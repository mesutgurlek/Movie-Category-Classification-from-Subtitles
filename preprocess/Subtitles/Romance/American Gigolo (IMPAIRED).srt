162

163
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,874

164
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,044

166
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,509
My husband's in New York.

167
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,930
What about your friend?

168
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,976
I'm not waiting for anyone.

169
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,772
You still don't understand.

170
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,565
Understand what?

171
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,737
Who I am.

172
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,616
Who are you?

173
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,663
You don't even understand who you are,
why you're sitting here.

174
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,666
Why are you here?

175
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,545
I've got to go.

176
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,797
All right. Just one thing.

177
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
Why did you come on to me?

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,844
Like I said, I made a mistake.

179
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,139
I heard you speaking French.

180
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,268
Often in these big hotels,

181
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,395
you run into women
from foreign countries

182
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,816
who may need a translator or a guide.

183
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,279
And they hire you?

184
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,573
Yes.

185
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,497
How many languages do you speak?

186
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,042
Five or six.

187
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,550
Plus the, uh, international language.

188
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,179
That's right.

189
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,188
Well, now,

190
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,067
you're something really special,
aren't you?

191
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,531
You're one to talk.

192
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,036
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

193
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,039
I know what I see.

194
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,877
How much would you have charged me?

195
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,296
As what? Translator or guide?

196
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,714
No.

197
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,591
Just one fuck.

198
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
Now, you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

199
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,973
You don't, huh?

200
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,062
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

201
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,276
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Jost.

202
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,154
Don't spoil it. Bonne chance.

203
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,772
Look, mister,
someone's made a mistake here.

204
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,023
I don't do fags.

205
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
MAN: I didn't mean that.

206
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,401
And I don't do couples, either.

207
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,112
No, no, no. You don't understand.

208
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,616
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

209
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,411
- Just her.
- Okay.

210
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,207
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

211
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,543
Would you like a drink?

212
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,217
Not yet.

213
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,971
I think I'd like my money now.

214
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,849
Oh, sure. Sure.

215
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,229
- I like to talk afterwards, too.
- Sure.

216
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,641
Hello, Judy.

217
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,312
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

218
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,609
Very pretty woman.
You're gonna like me.

219
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,696
I can tell.

220
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,450
Because I like you. I like you.

221
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,289
So just relax and close your eyes.

222
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,043
Just relax and let your mind run free.

223
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,090
Don't worry about anything.

224
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,635
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

225
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,476
That's right. Close your eyes.

226
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,188
Forget about him.

227
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,275
This has nothing to do with him.
This is just you and me.

228
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,903
Oh, no, no, no, from behind.

229
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,156
It has to be from behind.

230
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,914
Okay, baby,
just flip over on your stomach.

231
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,501
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

232
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,547
'cause I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

233
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm gonna get you wet.
I'm gonna get you very wet.

234
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,554
I know how to do this.

235
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,390
Now slap her.

236
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,023
Slap that cunt.

237
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,744
Hey, Leon.

238
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,205
- How you doing, Julie?
- All right.

239
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,046
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

240
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,593
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his boyfriends,

241
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,597
just banging away, you know how it is.
Dumb bastard.

242
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,140
Hello, Julian.

243
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,227
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.
- Okay.

244
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,728
Okay.

245
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,692
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

246
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,071
I'm serious.
They want you to come back this week.

247
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,494
I wouldn't take much, you know. It's...
They're regulars for me.

248
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,123
You lied to me, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

249
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:19,170
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

250
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

251
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,302
They get possessive.

252
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,055
I can't be possessed.

253
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,766
That include Miss Anne?

254
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,352
Anne who?

255
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,440
Boy, I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

256
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,941
I'll tell you why, Leon.

257
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,862
She's got a job coming up for me
in a week.

258
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,114
Eight grand.

259
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,283
Can you get me that?

260
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,453
All right. All right.

261
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,371
Thanks, hon.

262
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,003
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
I mean, that bitch will sell you out.

263
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,632
But you really care about me, don't you?
(CHUCKLES) Don't you, Leon?

264
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,718
You care.

265
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,056
You know,
you walk an awful thin line, Julie.

266
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,726
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
I mean, you're getting awful cocky.

267
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,394
All the rest of the boys are happy

a dip in the pool, a little tennis,
and orgasm.

271

I'm just trying to warn you as a friend.

272
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,998
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

273
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,461
You're sure about that?

274
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,797
They'll cut you out.

00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,674
I brought money.

325
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,346
What more can I do? I...

326
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,849
I...

327
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,270
I like...

328
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,859
I don't want to know.

329
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,572
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

330
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,267
JULIAN: Oh, don't say that.

331
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,480
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

332
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:17,982
(CHUCKLES)

333
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,777
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

334
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,575
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're just teasing me.

335
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,245
I'll have to hang up
and jerk off right now.

336
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,663
I am.

337
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,084
Yes, I'm touching myself.

338
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,129
(LAUGHS) You like that, don't you?

339
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,010
Oh, come on, baby. Don't say that.

340
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,180
We're lying here getting aroused,

341
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,225
talking about having more pleasure
than you've had in years,

342
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:57,396
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

343
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,860
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth? What's he worth?

344
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,820
A couple of million?

345
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,243
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

346
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,620
The speaker's cracked.

347
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,792
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.

348
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,711
Just listen to yourself.
Do you hear what you're saying?

349
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,381
Can you hold on a second?
Someone's at the door.

350
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,425
Good morning.

351
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,052
What do you want for breakfast?

352
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,640
Coffee, orange juice, croissant, eggs?

353
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,685
Julian Kay.

354
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,979
Yeah, I want two coffees,
orange juice, croissant...

355
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,230
No eggs.

356
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,359
...one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

357
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,611
Lisa, this is really embarrassing.

358
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,238
I'm sitting here with a hard-on,

359
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,574
and there's people all over
and I can't talk to you now.

360
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,369
All right, I'll see you about 5:00.
Bye-bye, love.

361
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,998
(SCOFFS)

362
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,085
So, what do you think?

363
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,504
About what?

364
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,842
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

365
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,138
Was it what you expected?

366
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,475
No. It was like really making love.

367
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm not used...

368
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,941
That's not what I expected.

369
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,529
Do you remember
what you said last night?

370
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,034
Yes.

371
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,415
WOMAN 1:
Now, if I bid on it, I have to buy it, right?

372
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,625
WOMAN 2: Right.

373
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,961
Well, now, the one I want is
right over here. There it is!

374
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,046
JULIAN: What does it say?

375
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,756
WOMAN 1: Uh, I saw one
just like that in Madam Wu's.

376
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,133
"Jacobean. Late 17th century."

377
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,386
It's estimated at $4,800 to $5,200.

378
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,098
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

379
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,433
Yeah.

380
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,310
I don't know.

381
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,689
My guess,
it's gonna go for $5,000, 55 maybe.

382
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,069
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

383
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,989
Now, 48, that's a good bargain.
What do you think?

384
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,537
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I don't know.

385
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,749
You know, I saw a George III chest
around here somewhere

386
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,627
going for, like, 22, 23.

387
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,671
It's a lot of money,
but it's a good investment.

388
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,339
Beautiful lines on it.

389
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,343
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garniture set over there...

390
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,845
- Uh-oh.
...if the Japs don't bid it up. What is it?

391
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,682
LISA: Do you see who I see?
JULIAN: Who is it?

392
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,725
LISA: It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

393
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
- She's a stockholder in Jim's company.
- Is she still alive?

394
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,356
She's gonna make a beeline
straight for us.

395
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,358
Ah, there goes the garniture set.

396
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,819
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

397
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,949
(IN GERMAN ACCENT)
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy

398
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,575
before they face us.

399
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Lucille!

400
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,915
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

401
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,084
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice.

402
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,796
Oh! There is an exquisite
garniture set over there.

403
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,507
Lucille, this is Willem Shoenvelt.

404
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,509
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

405
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,678
Great hospitality, madam.

406
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,474
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.
Beautiful dress.

407
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,810
Goes well with the face.
They're both beige.

408
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,311
Willem.

409
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,355
- (ALL GASP)
- Oh! Madam!

410
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,107
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

411
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,985
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

412
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,486
Willem.

413
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,989
JULIAN:
Lisa, we must go, auf Wiedersehen.

414
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,950
(BOTH LAUGHING)

415
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,536
(EXCLAIMING)

416
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,876
- Did you see her face?
- I can't believe you did that!

417
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,388
JULIAN:
I wish your husband would come back.

418
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,266
- He has.
- Good.

419
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,651
I can't stop thinking about you.

420
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,446
Do you mind?

421
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,579
What have you been doing?

422
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,083
- When?
- This morning.

423
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,253
Oh, driving around.

424
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,091
(SIGHS) I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

425
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,760
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

426
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,013
Then I drove here.

427
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,976
You know, Michelle,

428
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm really not part of your problems.

429
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,482
And I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

430
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,278
I brought money.

431
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
Don't...

432
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
I don't want your money.

433
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,123
I'll buy you something, then.

434
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,792
I'll buy you that stereo.

435
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,003
I got a stereo.

436
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,672
What, then?

437
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,007
(SPLASHING)

438
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,805
Come on.

439
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,602
- What?
- We're going to my room.

440
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,398
Bulgari. You want it?

441
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,566
No.

442
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,736
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it.

443
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,365
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

444
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,576
God. Why?

445
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,746
- I don't know. It seems important.
- (SIGHS DEEPLY)

446
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,333
We just made love, didn't we?

447
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,168
Yes.

448
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,255
Then you know everything
there is to know.

449
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,258
That's silly. Where are you from?

450
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,636
No. I'm not from anywhere.

451
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,265
I'm from this bed.

452
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,977
Anything worth knowing about me

453
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,771
you can learn from letting me
make love to you.

454
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,941
That's not true.

455
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,987
Why do you sleep with older women?

456
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,533
I prefer older women.

457
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,452
Why?

458
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
What's the use of bringing
some high schooler to climax?

459
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:41,545
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

460
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,132
No challenge.

461
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,260
It has no meaning.

462
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,515
The other night,

463
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,602
that night I met you at the hotel,

464
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,813
I was with a woman.

465
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,649
Somebody's mother.

466
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,487
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

467
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,908
This woman hadn't had an orgasm
in maybe 10 years.

468
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,621
It took me three hours to get her off.

469
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,374
For a while there, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to do it.

470
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:26,298
When it was over, I felt like I'd
done something, something worthwhile.

471
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,515
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

472
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,978
My God.

473
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,189
These are not the handcuffs
your wife was wearing

474
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,691
when she was killed, Mr Rheiman.

475
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,361
Those we found in the study.

476
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,696
They were in a filing cabinet.

477
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,368
Along with some dildos,
some paddles and some...

478
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,577
You know what I'm talking about.

479
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:01,333
Listen, your private sex life
is of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

480
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,421
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

481
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:11,969
suggests the killer was, may have
been, a guest in your home once.

482
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:16,515
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

483
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,145
However, I'm gonna have to have
detailed information

484
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,565
about you and your wife's sex practices.

485
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:30,988
The names of the parties, if any,
that were involved. All right?

486
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,420
Sorry. Here you go. And this, too.

487
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,630
So I get the Salvation Army.
Thanks a lot.

Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

492

I'm with the Homicide Bureau,

493
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,814

a few questions.

495

You're Mr Kay?

496
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,530
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

497
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,783
Come on.

498
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,620
Look, I'm walking into Westwood.
Do you wanna talk there?

499
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,664
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later, Jill.

500
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,299
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

501
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,968
You heard about the case?

502
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,638
Yeah, that's the one
that was in the paper, right?

503
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,889
Yeah.

504
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,226
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

505
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,603
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.

506
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,687
Yeah, I bet you did.

507
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,481
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

508
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,650
Listen, we'll sit in the back.

509
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,240
And what were you doing
Tuesday night?

510
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,826
Tuesday.

511
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,913
- WOMAN: Or people.
- Tuesday night, I was...

512
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:09,127
I was with a friend at a pre-auction
viewing at Sotheby Parke Bernet.

513
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,171
She'll verify that?

514
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,550
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

515
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,845
- I think she enjoys her privacy.
- WOMAN: I don't want this any more.

516
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,891
...if that's what this is to you, okay?
I don't want it! I don't want it!

517
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,978
Come over here.

518
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:31,024
You can't mix May and December.
It just... (LAUGHS)

519
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,776
Yep.

520

You like cigars?

521
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,489
I'm sorry.

522
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
Am I a suspect?

523
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,951
No, no, no, no. But we're gonna
have to check out your alibi

524
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,703
just to be on the safe side,
for your sake.

525
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,581
All right, now, this work that you
were doing for the Rheimans,

526
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,627
was this as a translator or a chauffeur?

527
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,381
Neither. This was...

528
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,592
This was more of a personal matter.

529
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,761
You're friends?

530
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,097
Not exactly.

531
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,891
Not exactly. All right, then.

532
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,894
Then what exactly is it

533
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,814
that you were doing with the Rheimans,
or for the Rheimans?

534
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,358
Nothing special.

535
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,153
Chit-chat. I don't know.

536
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,073
I have a hard time
remembering about these things.

537
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,451
You know, I meet a lot of people.

538
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,620
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

539
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,914
Let's see now, you got there,
you sat around, you had a few drinks.

540
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,125
Next thing you know, you're back in LA.
Is that right?

541
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,336
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

542
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,629
That's bullshit, Julian.
I'm gonna take you in.

543
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,089
It'll be good for your memory.

544
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,927
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

545
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,933
Look, Mr Sunday...

546
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,227
Detective Sunday.

547
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,898
Look, Detective.

548
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,861
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

549
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,698
These are very delicate matters.

550
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:07,454
Things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

551

552
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,795
I'm not gonna book you, Julian.

And I'm not gonna take away
your chauffeur's licence.

554
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,176
I'm not gonna bring you up on
drug charges. I could do all of that.

facing southern California.

You're smart. They're all whores.

00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,066
I don't know.

640
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,028
Be yourself.

641
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,406
Leave him?

642
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,202
His career will survive.

643
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,205
People forget.

644
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,044
These things have to be done quietly.

645
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:20,386
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

646
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,809
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

647
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,521
Take your pleasure when you can.

648
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,527
How about you? Where do you come in?

649
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,072
How do you get pleasure?

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

651
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,895
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

652
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,481
Detective Sunday.

653
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,568
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

654
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,194
Take a shine. You need it.

655
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:21,197
Thank you, Julian.
Well, you're quite dressed up today.

656
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,449
Well, I'm going to the country club.

657
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:27,120
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

658
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,041
Mrs Williams said that you had
been with her Tuesday night.

659
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:38,506
But you dropped her off at 7:00.

660
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,675
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

661
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,385
- Shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

662
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,014
But I described the house.
The bedroom.

663
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,558
Yeah, she said you had been
helping her redecorate,

664
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,810
that you had been to Parke Bernet,
picking out a bureau.

665
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,062
- Right. Right.
- I can understand why she'd say that.

666
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,856
She has a reputation to protect.

667
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,151
How do you do it, Julian?

668
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:03,907
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvie
and tonight at the country club.

669
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,535
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

670
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,456
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday,

671
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,375
bugging my friends.

672
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:20,214
I'll tell you what. You lay off my clients,

673
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,967
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women, okay?

674
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,011
(CHUCKLES) How's that?

675
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,266
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

676
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,185
Anybody can fix that, no problem.

677
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,770
- It's your face.
- Face?

678
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,396
- Face. Bad face.
- (LAUGHING)

679
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,940
And your body.
What's wrong with your body?

680
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,609
You have back problems?
You look like a monkey sitting there.

681
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,403
- Come on. Shh.
- Hey, back. Shoulders back. Back.

682
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,990
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.

683
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,369
- Up tight, tight. Yes. Uh-huh.
- Tight. Tight. (LAUGHS)

684
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,956
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

685
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,711
Sure. Why not?

686
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,713
Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

687
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,299
- What?
- What you do.

688
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,472
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty about that?

689
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,307
But it's not legal.

690
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,351
Legal is not always right.

691
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,562
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

692
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,857
They're stupid,

693
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,236
or jealous.

694
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,738
And you know better?

695
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,574
Some people are above the law.

696
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,828
Well, how do these people
know who they are?

697
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,329
They know.

698
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,417
They ask themselves.

699
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,587
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

700
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,381
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

701
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,592
- May I?
- Please.

702
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,762
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

703
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,934
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

704
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,188
I didn't.

705
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,315
Yeah, you said that.

706
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,569
That's why I went back and had it
checked it twice with the coroner.

707
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,905
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

708
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,492
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

709
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,203
But underneath the cuts
there were bruises

710
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,872
from where she was handcuffed earlier.

711
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,375
Now the coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

712
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,627
which would be the night
you were there.

713
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,467
Jesus Christ.

714
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,180
Now, she was beaten
with a heavy metal object,

715
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:35,641
raped and violated with an object,

716
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,477
presumably the murder weapon.

717
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,997
Yeah.

718
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,001
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

719
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,090
But you gotta understand
about these people,

720
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,008
like the Rheimans.

721
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,681
It's like a game to them.

722
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,102
I'll explain.

724
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,362
Yeah? What is it?

725
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,156
They were here two hours, the police.

726
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,366
They were here two hours.

727
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,535
I couldn't stop them.
They had a search warrant.

728
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,870
It's all right, Jill. It's okay.

729

No, it's okay. It's okay.

733
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,909

00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,347
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

735
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,143
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor.

736
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,936
What's happening?

737
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,565
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

738
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,109
I don't like to have anybody
in the house when Tim visits.

739
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,154
Courts might not let me see him at all.

740

Out in Palm Springs.

747

You tricked with them?

748

Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

749

- Two-timing bastard.
- So I'm a nice guy. I can't help it.

750
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,419
You check around for me?

751
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,214
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

752
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,174
I may just do that!

753
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,845
You trick for other people,
you cheat me out of money,

754

and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

755

How?

01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,403

work strictly for me.

No, it's got nothing to do with that.

- Like shit it doesn't.
- No.

760
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,702
- I made you, Julie.
- Uh-huh?

761
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,787
I taught you everything you know,

762
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,083
how to dress, how to behave,
how to treat women, how to make love.

763
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,793
And then one day
you come to me and say,

764
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,337
"I'm too good for you," and cut me out.

765

Look, if it's your period, it's okay.
I don't mind. I love it.

798
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,180
Don't give me that crap.
You know what I'm talking about.

799
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,808
I can't give you any pleasure,

800
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,519
and you can't fool me any more.

801
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,271
You don't know
what you're talking about.

802
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,065
Yes, I do. And so do you.

803
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,531
(SIGHING DEEPLY)

804
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:12,204
Yeah, I know.

805
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,585
You're talking about me
giving up what I am,

806
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,128
what I do.

807
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,714
Is that so shocking?

808
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,515
I care about you. I really do.

809
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,191
That's still not enough.

810
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,156
It's all I'm good at.

811
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,909
That's not true.

812
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,455
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

813
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,708
I can't quit anyhow.
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

814
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,421
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

815
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,638
People I know take care of each other.

816
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,101
I need their protection.

817
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,359
I'm being framed by somebody.

818
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,110
I don't know who.

819
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,449
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

820
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,953
Police think I did it.

821
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,956
It was a woman.

822
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,250
A woman I met once.

823
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,546
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

824
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,631
Why would anyone
want to do that to you?

825
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,176
I can't figure that out. I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

826
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,428
When was the murder?

827
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,264
A week ago Tuesday.

828
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,602
Weren't we together that night?

829
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,313
Baby, I wish we were.

830
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,574
(INDISTINCT MUMBLING)

MAN: All right, boys,
stand full-face, please.

832
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,082
This is bullshit. These cops...

833
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,793
Number three, take off your glasses.

834
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,674
Number two, straighten up.

835
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,635
Turn to your right.

836
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,807
No, number three, to your right.

837
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,350
Jerk.

838
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,561
How much you getting paid?

839
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,315
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

840
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,733
So am I.

841
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,860
I'm getting 15.

842
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,363
- You are?
- Yeah, 15 bucks.

843
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,365
Now left, please.

844
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,037
Left.

845
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,915
Thank you.

846
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,213
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

847
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,842
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

848
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,970
Shit! What the fuck is going on here?
Is my lawyer here yet?

849
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,305
- I want to speak to my lawyer...
- Four!

850
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,681
...when he gets here!
Make sure they call me.

851
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,392
Four. You'll see your lawyer.
Get back in line.

852
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,062
Now, just make sure I speak to him.

853
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,606
Number one, turn to your right again.

854
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,732
I know my rights.

855
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,902
- This isn't Russia.
- Okay, number one, turn to your left.

856
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,488
We have a constitution here.
I know my rights.

857
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,239
- Wait till my lawyer gets here.
- All right, thank you.

858
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,866
You all can leave now.

859
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,702
How about this fucking jerk here, three?
Is he getting paid?

860
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,330
Hey, you!
Are you getting paid, too, huh?

861
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,415
- What the fuck is going on?
- (DOOR BUZZES OPEN)

862
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,045
Well, what do you think?

863
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,756
- Huh?
- Not bad.

864
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,383
I'm gonna steal your thunder.

865

He's teaching me how to dress.
(CHUCKLING)

866
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,263
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

867
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,556
He's, uh...

868
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,685
He's in charge of this case.

869
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,937
Wait a minute. I thought you were.

870
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,815
No, not me. I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

871
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,318
They keep me pretty low on the pole.
(LAUGHS) Good joke, huh?

872
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,617
You've been identified, Julian.

873
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,162
- Julian.
- By whom?

874
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,873
Who could possibly identify me?

875
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,501
You parked your Mercedes
about 50 feet from the Rheiman house

876
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,254
between 9:30 and 10:00
on the night of the 22nd.

877
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:33,882
Then you proceeded up the street,
entered the house.

878
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,845
- Someone saw you, Julian.
- I request formal charges...

879
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,347
I don't understand. I don't know
who would say this about me.

880
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,808
- Now, he's been apprised of his rights!
- I was not there.

881
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,769
Then she identified subject number one.

882
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,941
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

883
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,866
- You got the licence number?
- She didn't see it.

884
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,617
- Shit!
- Right.

885
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:02,828
Here.

886
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,374
We looked around your house
the other day. We had a warrant.

887
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,835
- We know.
- You recognise these?

888
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,545
No.

889
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,380
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

890
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:18,010
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over it. That's so what.

891
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,180
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

892
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:24,683
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

893
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,770
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels, too.

894
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,688
There were no jewels.

895
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,025
Didn't you ever wonder
this whole thing may be a frame?

896
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,860
It occurred to us.

897
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,529
It occurred to you.

898
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,574
- Did you check out Rheiman himself?
- He has an alibi.

899
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,243
Big deal, he's got an alibi. What about...

900
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,620
You're grasping at straws.

901
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,580
What about Leon James, the black guy
sent me out to Rheiman's?

902
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,292
He spoke very highly of you.
He said you were a high-class act.

903
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,211
And what do you think?

904
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,215
(EXHALES)

905
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,221
I think you're guilty as sin.

906
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,598
I think you went to the Rheimans',

907
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,810
I think you did a trick,
played some rough games.

908
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,355
You got drugged or stupid or both.

909
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,692
I think you beat her, you killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

LAWYER: Then there's no use to
talk any more until you press charges.

911

Even though we think Julian's guilty,
we're not gonna arrest him.

01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,287
CURTIS: If you are being framed,

913
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,833
you're gonna be a lot more use to us
floating around.

914
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,921
Can we go now?

915
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:50,102
SUNDAY: Just one more thing, Julian.

916
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,774
Don't tell cons they get paid for line-ups.

Some cops don't have
a sense of humour. You know that.

I'm here to see Mrs Williams.
My name is Julian Kay.

That's all right, Wilma.
I'll take care of it.

- Hello, Julian.

923

- Why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

924
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,020
What do you want to talk about?

925
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,691
Were the police here?

926
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,610
There was a detective here.

927
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,363
I was very surprised you used my name.

928
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,825
I'm very, very sorry about that, Lisa,

929
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,371
but this is very important to me.

930
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,790
I told him the truth.

931
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,586
Lisa, you didn't tell him the truth.
I was with you until after midnight.

01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,463
That's not the truth.

933

Julian, I can't...

934
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,385
You weren't here.

He's the boy who told the police
he was with me the night of that murder.

939
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,272
So, you're Mr Kay.

940
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:03,360
It's bad enough you made a fool
of my wife at Parke Bernet,

941
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,654
but then you start spreading these lies?

01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,990
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

943
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,158
I don't know what you did.
I don't want to know.

944
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,536
Whatever it is, you're not going
to get out of it by dragging...

945
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,414
Truth. I just came here for the truth.
That's all.

946
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:19,710
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

947
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:24,840
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

948
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,509
Thank you, Mr Kay.

949
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,452
You're really not very good at this,
you know?

950
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,788
- What?
- Following people, pal!

In fact, you're lousy.

Who are you?
What are you talking about?

953
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,501
Who's paying you?

954
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,128
You're not a cop, are you? You can't be.
Leon. It's Leon, right?

955
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,881
- I'm calling the police.
- You want to call? Go ahead, good, call.

What have we got here?

- Give me that!
- Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

958
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,473
Born 7-23-52.

959
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,558

Master Charge, picture of girlfriend...

962
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,150
So-so, eyes too close together, Floyd.

963

What else have we got here?

Senator Charles Stratton.

- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read, can't you?

969
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,382
Here.

970
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,717
You work for Senator Stratton?

Yes.

972

- Why are you following me, Floyd?
- I was told to.

973
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,229
- By who? The Senator?
- Who else?

974
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,399
If the Senator wanted to know
about my private life,

975
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,776
why didn't he ask me himself?

976
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,865
You don't know. You don't know.

977

Well, I'll tell you what, Floyd,
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

I'm gonna make it real easy,
so you don't forget.

This is my telephone number.

980
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:07,419
Now you tell the Senator,
if he wants to talk to me,

981
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,173
he can just give me a call, all right?

982
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,593

I received your message, Mr Kay.

01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,881
- Thought I'd come see you in person.
- Good evening, Senator.

986
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,549
Yes, I'll have a vodka and tonic,
Charles, please.

Yes, sir.

This is heart-warming.

It's nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

990

I'm not talking as a senator now.
I'm talking as a husband.

That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

Want?

995

I know who you are.
I can't stop my wife from being a fool.

But I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

I don't know what you're talking about.

You don't?

999
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,385
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs

1000
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,011
a week ago.

1001
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,472
Three days later,
you saw my wife at a fundraiser

1002
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,266
and seduced her.

1003
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,394
You think you can blackmail me
into helping you?

1004

You're crazy, mister.

Am I?

1006
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,000
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

1007
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:14,129
It didn't make any sense
until I heard about you.

1008
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,549
You talked to Michelle about this?

1009

You're not gonna blackmail me!
You can spread...

You don't know
anything about this, Mister.

But I do know a whore when I see one.

1012
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,561
How much?

1013
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,357
Not to see your wife again?

1014
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,072
Five thousand.

1015
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:47,454
You'll have the cash in the morning.

1016
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,170
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her

1017
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,590
and because she wants to see me.

1018
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,595
I don't want a dime from you,
or anyone like you.

1019

Let me be even simpler.

1020

You live off the good graces
of a small number of people.

1021
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,034
Like Mrs Andrews,
who was just at the door a minute ago.

And the good graces of places
such as this.

You're just a hanger-on.

to hang on to,

- Not bad. How about you?

Yeah. He's probably at the Probe.

Okay. Thanks. Take care.

Oh, Leon? Yeah, he was here.

Well, if I was the police, I'd be more
interested in Rheiman himself.

01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,754
Don't... That's not what I'm saying!

(SIGHS)

1110
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,932
I don't know what I'm saying.

1111
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,319
All my life I've been
looking for something.

1112
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,780
I don't even know what it is.

1113
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,825
- Let me do it...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

1114
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,291
I gave Charles my word.

1115
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,043
I've got to go.

1116
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,130
It'll be all right.

1117
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,551
Yeah.

1118
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,803
I have to leave.

1119
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,121
(YELLS)

1120
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,662
Shit!

1121
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,463
JILL: I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

1122
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:17,633
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest. I'd tell you.

1123
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,928
The police have been here all morning.
His room's a mess.

1124
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,681
There's another cop waiting in his room.

1125
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,809
- Does he call in?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

1126
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,771
Okay, next time he calls in,
tell him that I've got to talk to him.

1127
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,939
Tell him it's important.

1128
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,190
Ask him if there's someplace
I can meet him.

1129
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,871
Do you know a blond kid

1130
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,373
that hangs around
with Leon James?

1131
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,042
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

1132
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,713
Eat shit, asshole.

1133

JULIAN: Anne, I'm sorry.

1134
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,355
I've got to talk to you.

1135
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:16,483
I can't now. I'm looking for somebody.

1136
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:21,030
Perino's? Look, I don't have time! I...

1137
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,115
Yeah, all right. All right. Perino's.

1138
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,742
Yes. 8:30.

1139
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,924
Jill? It's Julian.

1140
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,055
Yeah, I know, I know.
Got some messages for me?

1141
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,310
Michelle?

1142
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:58,067
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

1143
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,531
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

1144

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

1145
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:41,235
Mr Julian! You can't come in like this.

1146
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,861
I was working. I forgot my tie.

1147
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:46,240
- I'll have to give you a jacket.
- No, it's okay.

1148
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,915
Julie. You look like shit. What's wrong?

1149
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,042
Everything. Straight bourbon.

1150
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:58,836
What're you doing to yourself?

1151
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,423
The way you look now,
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you!

1152
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:04,508
Anne, I need your help.

1153
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,510
The cops are after me.

1154
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:07,886
They're framing me
for the Rheiman murder.

1155
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,471
Where have you been?

1156
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,349
- I was looking for somebody.
- Last night?

1157
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,935
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Vakklar.

1158
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,187
She came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

1159
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,272
And she only speaks Swedish.

1160
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,482
Nobody could understand her
and there was no one there to meet her.

1161
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:21,567
- Anne...
- She was furious!

1162
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,444
The auto people are furious.
Now I've got hell to pay!

1163
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:24,736
Now what happened?
Didn't you prepare?

1164
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,613
Didn't you hear me?

1165
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,366
I said the cops are after me!
For murder!

1166
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,702

Are you gonna help me?

1170
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,429
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble!

1171
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,348
That's why I need your help.

1172
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,392
You never did anything for me.

1173
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,353
I never did anything for you...

1174
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,148
What are you talking about?
I'm your number one boy!

1175
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,233
And you fight me every turn.

1176
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,571
You ask a favour, and then stand up
a gig I worked for six months to set up!

1177
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,406
I explained that already. I told you.

1178
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,033
I'm through with you, Julie.

1179

You'll have to fend for yourself.

I don't care
what happens to you any more.

1181
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,720
Excuse me. I'll be back in a second.

1182

Oh, Julian.
Thank God you got my message.

1183
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,738
I've been looking for you all day.

No. No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the D.A.

1186
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,540
They've found the murder weapon.
They're gonna arrest you.

1187
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,416
That can't be.

1188
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,628
What're you gonna do?

1189
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:07,756
I don't know.

1190
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,429
What can I do to help you?

1191
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,891
- There's nothing you can do.
- There's gotta be something.

1192
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,811
Don't you understand?
I am in big trouble!

1193
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,814
- Just stay away from me!
- No!

1194
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,316
It's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

1195
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,151
You know what that's like?

1196
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:31,446
Just stay away from me.
I'll ruin your life.

1197

Your husband's. It's all over.

1198
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,951
Not if you're innocent.

1199
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,204
If I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?

1200
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,291
- But you are...
- Look at me, right in the face!

1201
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:46,211
Can you tell me, without hesitation,
you know I'm innocent?

1202
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:47,462
Yes.

1203
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,306
- You see... Forget me.
- WOMAN: Is someone in there?

1204
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,391
I never loved you.

1207
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:25,036
Julie, you look terrible.

1208

Hey, listen, you wanna clean up?
Get a shave?

1209

I'm sorry to bug you
this time of the morning.

I've been looking for you.

1211
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,214
I'm listening.

1212
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,845
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

1213
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:45,098
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

1214
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:47,017
I'm still piecing it together.

1215
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,437
It's not easy, you know.

1216
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,230
I'm just trying, you know, to get it right.

- What're you talking about?

1218

Judy Rheiman's murder.
You're behind it.

You, Rheiman,

You don't know what I'm talking about.

What the fuck is that, then?

He's the one
that actually killed her, isn't he?

Huh?

Leon, what happened?
You sent him out there.

1228
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,388
You sent him out there, he got into
a scene with Rheiman and his wife.

1229
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:28,141
He got rough, and he killed her.

How much is it gonna cost me
to get you off my back?

You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

- How much?
- I feel sorry for you, Julie.

How much?

1237
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:51,706
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

1238
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:55,669
The other side will always pay more.

1239

You got it on real tight, huh?

1240

Real proud of yourself,
aren't you, Leon?

Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

1258
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:51,660
Why me?

1259
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,747
Why did you pick me?

1260
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:01,336
Because you were frameable, Julie.

1261

01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,844
Nobody cared about you.

1263
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:13,598
I never liked you much myself.

1264

Hello, Julian.

Going away on your trip?

1302
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:24,474
No, I decided not to.

- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

Why did you come?

1305
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,657
I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.

1306
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:47,330
Don't come back, Michelle.

1307

Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

1308
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:01,344
It doesn't matter.

Don't go.

Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:36,087
I think you know
this is a matter of some secrecy.

1312
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:42,677
Tell her not to bother.

1313
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:45,346
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

1314
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:51,102
You tell Michelle to forget me.

1315
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:58,776
I'm more worried about your defence,
Julian, than about her private life.

1316
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:04,240
We'll have to go into all the details
of the night of the murder.

A maid saw you trying to save Leon,

1318
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:10,413
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

1319
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:14,334
The papers and TV
are trying you already, Julian.

1320
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:17,879
The police aren't
investigating any more.

1321
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:19,672
We need some help,

1322
01:51:19,757 --> 01:51:23,301
some facts to get
the investigation going again.

1323
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:27,347
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman.

1324
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:28,556
Maybe the blond boy.

How about it, Julian?

- Lieutenant Curtis?
- Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honour.

May I sit?

1328
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:58,086
I was told you wanted to see me.
What can I do for you?

1329
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:02,465
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

1330
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:04,467
Yes.

1331
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:07,345
I'm paying for Mr Kay's legal defence.

1332
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:10,473
I know.

1333
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,644
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.

1334
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:17,230
And I don't want to see
an obstruction of justice.

1335
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:19,649
How do you know he's not guilty?

1336
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:23,528
Because he was not in Palm Springs
the night of the murder.

1337
01:52:23,612 --> 01:52:25,321
- No?
- No.

1338
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,865
He was with me.

1339
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,508
I told them, Julian.

1340
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:47,969
I heard.

1341
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:53,641
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

1342
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:56,185
You could have forgotten me.

1343
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,521
I'd rather die.

1344
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,861
What will you do now?

1345
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,655
I don't know.

1346
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:09,574
I can't go home.

1347
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,161
The newsmen are waiting
outside for me.

1348
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,037
There's dozens of them.

1349
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,211
Why did you do it?

1350
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,382
I had no choice.

1351
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:29,010
I love you.

1352
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,229
Oh, my God, Michelle.

1353
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:45,067
It's taken me so long to come to you.
