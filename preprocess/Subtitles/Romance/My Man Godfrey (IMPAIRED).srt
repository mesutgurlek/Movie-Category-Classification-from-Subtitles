Hello, Duke.

4
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,975
Hello, Mike.
Any luck today?

5
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,986
I figured out a swell racket,

6
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,454
and everything was going great
until the cops came along.

7
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,457
Too bad it didn't work.

8
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,823

<i>relief and all that stuff.</i>

11
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,393
Mike, I wouldn't worry.
Prosperity's just around the corner.

12
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,929
Yeah. It's been there a long time.
I wish I knew which corner.

13
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,567
Well, Duke, I'm gonna turn in.

14

- <i>Bonsoir,</i> Mike.

15
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,658
This is the place, all right.
That looks like one of them.

16
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,661
- Looks pretty tough to me.
- Stall Irene. I'll talk to the fellow.

17
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,425
- I told you about this place.
- We got here first.

18
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,659
Well, she's not gonna
get ahead of me.

19
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,403
Good evening.

20
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,708
- Good evening.
- How'd you like to make five dollars?

21
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,609
Huh? I didn't quite
catch what you said.

22
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,874
I said, how'd you like
to make five dollars?

23

- <i>Five dollars?</i>
- <i>Five dollars.</i>

24
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,443
[Chuckles] Well, I don't want
to seem inquisitive,

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,613
but what would I
have to do for it?

26
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,283
All you have to do is go
to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,

27
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,293
I'll show you to a few people,
and then I'll send you right back.

28
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,295
May I inquire just why
you would want...

29
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,354
to show me to people
at the Waldorf Ritz?

30
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,367
Oh, if you must know,
it's a game... a scavenger hunt.

31
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,701
If I find a forgotten man first, I win.
Is that clear?

32
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,832
Yes, quite clear.

33
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,639
Shall I wear my tails,
or come just as I am?

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,045
You needn't be fresh. Do you want
the five dollars or don't you?

35
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,640
Madam, I can't tell you
how flattered I am...

36
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,652
by your very generous offer.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,212
However, I'll have to take it up
with my board of directors.

38
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,384
- Don't you touch me!
- No matter what my directors advise,

39
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,758
- I think you should be spanked.
- George, do something!

40
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,956
Are you in the habit
of hitting ladies?

41
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,023
I'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen
also, if that'll interest you.

42
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,002
- Aren't you going to do anything?
- Let's get a policeman.

- I'm Irene.

45
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,837
That was my sister Cornelia
you pushed in the ash pile.

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,506
- Like me to push Cornelia's sister?
- I don't think I'd like that.

47
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,606
- Then you'd better get out of here.
- Oh, you bet.

48
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,617
Wait a minute!
Sit down!

49
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,619
I'm sitting.

What's up, Duke?
Need some help?

51

No, thanks, boys.
Got everything under control.

52
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,059
Are you a member
of this hunting party?

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,927
I was, but I'm not now.
Are they all forgotten men too?

54
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,092
Yes, I guess they are, maybe. Why?

55
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,728
I couldn't help but laugh. I've wanted
to do that since I was six years old.

56
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,240
- You wanted to what?
- Oh, push Cornelia in a pile of ashes.

57
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,243
That was Faithful George with her.
That isn't really his name.

58
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,712
He gets in everybody's hair.
His father's the broker.

59
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,749
That's very enlightening.

60
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,751
Cornelia thought she was going to win,
and you pushed her.

61

[Laughing]

62
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,759
Could follow an intelligent conversation
for just a moment?

63
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,125
- I'll try.
- Well, that's fine.

64
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,131
Do you mind telling me
just what a scavenger hunt is?

65
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,895
Well, a scavenger hunt
is exactly like a treasure hunt.

66
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,563
In a treasure hunt
you try to find something you want.

67
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,573
In a scavenger hunt you try to find
something that nobody wants.

68
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,939
- Hmm, like a forgotten man?
- That's right.

69
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,774
The one that wins gets a prize,
only there really is no prize.

70
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,781
It's just the honor of winning.
The money goes to charity.

71
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,784
That is, if there's any money left over,
and there never is.

72
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,719
Well, that clears
the whole matter up beautifully.

73
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,589
I've decided I don't want to play any
more games with human beings as objects.

74
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,856
It's kind of sordid when you think
of it, when you think it over.

75
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,126
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I haven't thought it over.

76
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,635
I don't like to change the subject, but
why do you live in a place like this?

77
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,967
There's so many
other nice places.

78
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,166
- You really want to know?
- Oh, I'm very curious.

79
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:47,178
Because my real estate agent felt the
altitude would be good for my asthma.

80
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,238
- Oh, my uncle has asthma.
- No!

81
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,046
Well, now there's a coincidence.

82
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,952
Well, I suppose I should
be going now, shouldn't I?

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,956
That's a good idea.

84
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,050
I want to see who won the game.
I suppose it was Cornelia.

85
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,527
She probably got another
forgotten man by now.

86
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,656
If you took me with you,
you'd win the game? Is that the idea?

87
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,860
Well, I might if I got there first.

88
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,802
But after seeing what you did
to Cornelia, I'm not saying anything.

89
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,465
But you'd win if you
got back first with me?

90
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,306
It'd be awfully nice of you,
but I don't like to ask.

91
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,573
Let's beat Cornelia.

92
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,581
- It wouldn't be asking too much?
- Mm-mm.

93
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,846
See, I've got a sense of curiosity,
just the same as you have.

94
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,082
I'd really like to see
just what a scavenger hunt looks like.

95
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,092
- But I told you!
- Yes. I'm still curious.

Well, come on.

an insane asylum.

Well, all you need
to start an asylum...

101
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,443
is an empty room and
the right kind of people.

00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,756
- Sounds like a bankruptcy proceeding.
- I never thought of that.

151
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,160
- Who receives me?
- I have to take you to the committee.

152
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,665
- You don't mind, do you?
- I can hardly wait.

153
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,860
Wait a minute!
What have you there?

154
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,666
This is Godfrey.
Is Cornelia back yet?

155
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,172
I haven't seen Cornelia.
Where did you find him?

156
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,438
[Chattering Continues]

157
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,072
Oh, Mr. Guthrie!
Come on this way.

158
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,584
Mr. Guthrie!
Mr. Guthrie!

159
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,087
- I have a forgotten man.
- [Monkey Chittering]

160
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,989
I have a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie, this is Godfrey.

161
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,357
He's a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie!

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,555
- A forgotten man!
- His name is Godfrey.

163
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,860
- A forgotten man? You got all eight.
- Yes.

164
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,196
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, quiet, quiet.

165
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,202
Miss Bullock has a forgotten man.

166
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
Do you mind stepping up
on the platform, please.

167
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,703
Yes, get right up
on the platform, Godfrey.

168
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,643
- Mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Fire away.

169
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,809
- What is your address?
- City Dump 32, East River, Sutton Place.

170
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,977
- <i>It's rather fashionable over there.</i>
- In spots.

171
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,454
- Is that your permanent address?
- The permanency is questionable.

172
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,424
See, the place is being
rapidly filled in.

173
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,554
- Mind if I ask a personal question?
- If it isn't too personal.

174
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,725
- Are those whiskers your own?
- No one else has claimed them.

175
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,462
I must ask that question
because one group...

176
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,597
tried to fool the committee by trying to
put false whiskers on one of their own.

177
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,508
- May I, uh... May I, uh...
- What?

178
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,739
Oh, it's a pleasure.

179
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,577
[Clears Throat] One more question.
Are you wanted by the police?

180
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,244
Ah, that's just the trouble.
Nobody wants me.

181
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,947
- <i>Oh, very good answer.</i>
- Splendid, Godfrey.

182
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,388
You mean, nobody wants him?
Nobody at all?

183
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,516
- Nobody.
- Oh, that's too bad.

184
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,528
On the contrary,
I sometimes find it a great advantage.

185
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,530
The committee is satisfied.
Miss Irene Bullock...

186
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,532
wins 20 points
for a forgotten man...

187
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,330
and 50 points extra
for bringing in the first one.

188
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,769
- Oh, bravo!
- <i>Speech! Speech!</i>

189
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,363
Group ten...

190
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,433
- <i>Speech! Speech!</i>
- Group ten wins the silver cup.

191
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,877
- Oh, thank you.
- <i>Speech! Speech!</i>

192
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,346
- They want a speech. Come on!
- <i>Speech!</i>

193
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,546
My purpose in coming here
tonight was twofold.

194
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,592
Firstly, I wanted
to aid this young lady.

195
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,593
Secondly, I was curious to see...

196
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,562
how a bunch empty-headed nitwits
conducted themselves.

197
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,031
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- My curiosity is satisfied.

198
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,762
I assure you it will be
a pleasure for me...

199
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,203
to go back to a society
of really important people.

200
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,298
- What did he call us?
- Nitwits.

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,208
- Nitwits? What are they?
- I don't know.

202
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,212
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>The man's perfect!</i>

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,147
<i>I've been wanting to say that,</i>
<i>but I didn't have the nerve.</i>

204
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,413
<i>Oh, Godfrey!</i>
<i>Oh, Godfrey!</i>

205
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,011
Oh, Godfrey,
I'm terribly sorry.

206
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,081
- That's all right.
- I'd never brought you here.

207
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,094
This is the first time I've ever beaten
Cornelia, and you helped me do it.

208
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,687
Well, that makes me
a Cornelia beater, doesn't it?

209
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,700
You've done something for me.
I wish I could do something for you.

210
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,260
- Why?
- Because you've done something for me.

211
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,899
No, I don't see. But I could use a job,
if you've got one.

212
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,000
- Can you "buttle"?
- "Buttle"?

213
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,545
We're fresh out of butlers.
The one we had left this morning.

214
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,377
<i>Irene, they're calling for you</i>
<i>in the jade room.</i>

215
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,384
- Don't you want your cup?
- Tell them to keep their cup.

216
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,114
You can't talk to this man.
What will people think?

217
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,021
I don't care what they think.
Godfrey's gonna be our butler.

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,787
- He's gonna be whose butler?
- He's gonna work for us.

219
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,795
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You don't know anything about him.

220
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,797
He hasn't any recommendations...

221
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,799
The last one had recommendations
and stole all the silver.

222
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,801
That was merely a coincidence.

223
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,702
People that take in stray cats
say they make the best pets.

224
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,206
I don't see what cats
have got to do with butlers.

225
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,038
You mustn't pay any attention
to my daughter. She's very impulsive.

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,101
- I'm not impulsive!
- Don't shout at your mother.

227
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,205
- I will shout!
- Oh, Mrs. Meriwether, Irene is shouting.

228
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,378
- You mean it's all over?
- Yes, she always shouts when she wins.

229
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,947
Run along, my good man. Thank you so
much for coming. Thank you so, so much.

230
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,254
<i>[Irene]</i>
<i>He will not run along!</i>

231
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,489
<i>[Godfrey]</i>
<i>I think I'd better.</i>

232
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,964
My word! There's Cornelia,
and she has another one!

233
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,737
You're a little late, Cornelia.
I've won the game.

234
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,935
- Oh, you have?
- Where do I get my five bucks?

235
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,410
Bucks? What...
Will you talk to your sister?

236
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,879
<i>She wants to hire this man</i>
<i>as a butler.</i>

237
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,008
Why not? He might make
a very good butler.

238
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,678
I'm sure I'd make
a very good butler.

239
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,915
Hey, where do I get
my five bucks?

240
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,481
Bucks? Bucks? What's he talking
about? What's he talking about?

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,495
- Five bucks!
- I promised him five dollars.

242
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,862
Well, give him the five dollars and the
bucks too, and get him out of here...

243
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,128
before your sister
hires him as a chauffeur.

244
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,137
Why did I have to find out
there's insanity on your father's side?

245
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,139
Come along, Cornelia.

246
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,643
I hope, Godfrey,
that you're very good at shining shoes.

247
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,804
I think we'd better drop
the whole idea, don't you?

248
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,179
I should say not. You're gonna make
the best butler we ever had.

249
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,481
And here. You'll need
some clothes and things, you know.

250
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,147
Oh, well, l...

251
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,629
[Laughs]
I told G. To lay out my other coat.

252
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,360
[Chuckles]
You have a wonderful sense of humor.

253
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,368
Thank you.

254
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,200
Well, then... good night.

255
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,139
Oh, uh, just one question.

256
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,142
- What?
- Where do you live?

257
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,077
Oh, 1011 Fifth.
Funny, I never thought of that.

258
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,637
- [Laughs] No, you didn't.
- No.

259
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,152
1011 Fifth.
Well, good night again.

260
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,653
Good night, Godfrey.

261
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,403
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

262
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,671
- I'm the new, uh...
- Yes, I know. You're the new butler.

263
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,339
- How did you know?
- There's one every day at this hour.

264
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,780
They're dropping in and out
all the time.

265
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,784
Why is that?

266
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,685
Some get fired,
some quit.

267
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,020
- Is the family that exacting?
- No, they're that nutty.

268
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,626
- May I be frank?
- Is that your name?

269
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,256
- No, my name is Godfrey.
- All right, be frank.

270
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,768
You're, uh,
quite an enthusiast.

271
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,929
Don't you worry about me.
I'm a seasoned campaigner.

272
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,065
[Laughs]
Uh, may we be friends?

273
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,339
Oh, I'm friends
with all the butlers. Sit down.

274
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,041
What's a three-letter sea bird
with an "R" in the middle?

275
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,448
That's... Oh, l...
I don't know.

276
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,647
You're no help.
Where'd you get the trick suit?

277
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,656
What's the matter with it?

278
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,660
Well, it might look better
if you took the rental tag off the coat.

279
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,663
[Laughs]
Oh... thanks.

280
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,859
Does the butler have quarters here
in the house, or is that necessary?

281
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,164
Oh, you won't need any quarters.
Hang your hat near the door...

282
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,170
so you can get it quickly
on the way out.

283
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,365
- [Intercom Buzzes]
- What's that?

284
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,535
That's the old battle axe.
She usually rings about this time.

285
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,602
- The old battle axe?
- Mrs. Bullock. She's the mother type.

286
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,843
- Well, don't you do anything about it?
- Mrs. Bullock or the buzzer?

287
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,908
- The buzzer.
- Not the first time.

288
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,047
If she has a hangover, she'll ring again
in a minute in no uncertain terms.

289
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,456
Then, brother, you better
grab her tomato juice and get going.

290
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,552
- <i>[Intercom Buzzing]</i>
- Ah, there she blows.

291
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,830
Well, Cupid, this is
your big opportunity.

292
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,834
Shall I take it to her?

00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,063
You might as well
know the worst.

Scorch her windpipe?

There's nothing like a counterirritant.
Where do I find her?

Why do they keep playing

Very, very quickly.

You must always send them away quietly.

- Yes. You're a great help.

What happened
to those nice whiskers?

Thank you.
Will there be anything else?

Yes. Sit down and talk to me.
I like to talk in the morning...

00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,084
especially if you've been
somewhere the night before.

378
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,589
Don't you think it'd be better
if I talked standing?

00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,591
No. If you're uncomfortable,
I get uncomfortable,

I get uncomfortable and forget
what I have to say.

If you insist.

382
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,297
But it doesn't seem in very
good form for a butler.

383
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,665
Oh, you're more than a butler.
You're the first protege I ever had.

00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,795
- Protege?
- You know, like Carlo.

- Who is Carlo?
- He's Mother's protege!

386
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,503
You know, it's awfully nice
Carlo having a sponsor,

387
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,570
because he doesn't have to work and
he gets more time for his practicing.

388
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,674
- And that makes a difference.
- Yes, I imagine it would.

389
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,118
Do you play anything?
Oh, I don't mean games.

390
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,418
- I mean the piano and things like that.
- Well, l...

391
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,617
It doesn't really
make any difference.

392
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,626
It's funny how some things
make you think of other things.

393
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,628
Yes, very peculiar.

394
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,826
- Makes me feel so mature and grown up.
- What does?

395
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,664
Having a protege.
You're the first one I ever had.

396
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,934
- You've never had others?
- You're the first, and it's thrilling.

397
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,237
Not only does it occupy my mind,
but it's character-building too.

398
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,406
Mm-hmm. Just what
does a protege have to do?

399
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,678
Well, you just go on buttling,
and I sponsor you. Don't you see?

400
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,151
Yeah, it's getting clearer.

401
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,485
It's really not much work,
and it's gonna be such fun.

402
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,491
[Chuckles] I'm sure it's going
to be heaps of fun.

403
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,824
For instance, if Cornelia got mean, you
wouldn't have to do anything about it.

404
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,660
I'm your sponsor,
and I'd just take a sock at her.

405
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,666
I hope that'll
never be necessary.

406
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,827
I just wanted
to give you the idea.

407
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,339
That's fine, but a protege
has certain responsibilities also.

408
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,843
For instance, if someone should ring
for me now and I didn't answer,

409
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,344
that would reflect upon you
because you're my sponsor.

410
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,348
- Don't you see?
- Yes, I never thought of that.

411
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,351
You don't know how nice it is having
some intelligent person to talk to.

412
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,546
It's been very enlightening
to me too.

413
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,055
Oh, I just thought of something.
Do you know what you are?

414
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,354
- I'm not quite sure.
- You're my responsibility.

415
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,396
- That's very nice.
- See you in church.

416
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,603
Good morning.
Fine morning, sir.

417
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,172
Yes, it is a fine morning.

418
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,750
Don't be in a hurry.

419
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,226
You see,
I'm the old-fashioned type.

420
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,423
And I was also middleweight champion
when I was in college.

421
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,524
I thought you might like to know that
before this thing starts.

422
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,728
Well, you see, sir,
I'm the new butler.

423
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,737
I just served Miss Irene
her breakfast.

424
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,899
Do you always take a change of wardrobe
when you serve breakfast?

425
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,409
Well... I think
this young lady can explain.

426
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,742
He really is the new butler,
Mr. Bullock.

427
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,213
I can't imagine how his things
got in the hallway.

428
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,649
I still don't get it. But if you are
the new butler, why didn't you say so?

429
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,846
I'm very sorry, sir.
May I?

430
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,913
There's a man at the door to see you.
I think it's another process server.

431
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,925
- Another one?
- Yes, sir.

432
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,590
Well, here I am again
with another little present...

433
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,759
Yes, I've heard that before. Which one
of the family is it this time?

434
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,999
Miss Cornelia. Last night, she busted
up a few windows along Fifth Avenue.

435
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,839
- I'm sorry, but girls will be girls.
- Good-bye.

436
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,845
In this family,
it's one subpoena after another.

437
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,747
Mr. Bullock, there's a handsome
cab driver waiting in the kitchen.

438
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,218
- What's he want?
- He wants $50 and his horse.

439
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,221
What horse?

440
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,417
The one Miss Irene rode
up the front steps last night.

441
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,824
Where is his horse?
I haven't got it.

442
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,989
It's in the library,
where Miss Irene left it.

443
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,401
<i>[Horse Neighing]</i>

444
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,071
Well, do you begin
to get the idea?

445
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,143
<i>[Horse Neighing]</i>

446
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,139
Come here, my man.

447
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,517
Do you like your place here,
so far as you've gone?

448
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,519
I find it very entertaining.

449
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,055
Yes, we are a very
entertaining family.

450
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,352
You really think you're
going to like it here?

451
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,521
I must admit it's more desirable than
living in a packing case on a city dump.

452
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,156
Oh, that's where I met you,
isn't it?

453
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,894
- Yes, miss.
- Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.

454
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,234
We were playing some sort of a game...
a scavenger hunt, I think.

455
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,765
<i>We needed a forgotten man. I asked you</i>
<i>to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,</i>

456
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,472
and I'm a little bit hazy as to
just what happened after that.

457
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,812
- I pushed you into an ash pile.
- Oh, yes, of course you did.

458
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,614
It was very amusing.
They were nice, clean ashes.

459
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,554
- I'm very sorry, miss.
- I didn't mind at all.

460
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,718
It was very amusing.
Have you a handkerchief?

461
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:13,059
<i>There's a spot on my shoe.</i>
<i>Would you see what you can do about it?</i>

462
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,574
I could have you fired, you know?
But I like to see things wriggle.

463
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,769
When I get through with you,

464
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,642
you'll go back to your packing case
on the city dump and relish it.

465
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,171
People don't make a practice of pushing
Cornelia Bullock into ash piles.

466
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,151
<i>I'll make your life so miser</i>...

467
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,382
- Hello, Godfrey.
- Greetings, Irene.

468
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,950
- I like your new monkey suit.
- Thank you for picking it up.

469
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,465
- It fits very well for a hand-me-down.
- I'm more or less standard.

470
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,693
How do you like
my new pajamas?

471
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,635
I think they're very nice.
Thank you.

472
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,437
- I heard what you said to Godfrey.
- So what?

473
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,911
- So you leave him alone!
- Who's gonna make me leave him alone?

474
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,778
If you don't,
you'll get a good sock from me.

475
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,942
- Oh, the physical type.
- What I say goes.

476
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,213
Since when did you start
falling in love with butlers?

477
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,812
I'm not in love with him.
He's my protege.

478
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,189
Oh, your protege. That's why
you're picking out his suits for him.

479
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,593
Suppose Father hears about this. How
long do you think Godfrey will last?

480
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,858
Father isn't
going to hear about it.

481
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,196
You seem terribly sure
of everything.

482
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,259
If Father hears about Godfrey,

483
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,566
he's also going to hear about you
and that college boy.

484
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,869
I don't know
what you're talking about.

485
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,139
But if Father does hear about it, I'm
likely to do a little socking myself.

486
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:39,013
Little Red Riding Hood didn't have
enough charm to trap a wolf her own age,

487
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,986
so she falls in love with the butler
and lives happily ever after.

488
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,716
- If you know what I mean.
- I know, if you know what I mean.

489
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,315
- May I come in?
- You're in, aren't you?

490
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,556
Very interesting book.
<i>The Greeks of the Middle Ages.</i>

491
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,258
Oh, Irene would like that. You love
the Middle Ages, don't you, dear?

492
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,326
<i>[Mrs. Bullock Blathering]</i>

493
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,271
- Ahh.
- [Speaking Italian]

494
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,831
Oh, Carlo!
Who's giving the concert tonight?

495
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,309
- The great Kalininski.
- Oh, the pianist?

496
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,711
- No, cellist.
- What difference does it make?

497
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,183
Oh, it's so nice to see you two girls
having a pleasant chat.

498
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,482
Or is it a pleasant chat?

499
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:21,617
Well, well, well! Imagine the Bullocks
gathered together in one room.

500
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,459
- Don't forget Carlo.
- I'm not going to forget Carlo.

501
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,055
Don't bother about me.
I feel like one of the family.

502
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,624
Don't you go away.

503
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,331
You don't mind if I discuss a few family
matters, do you, Carlo, old boy?

504
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,566
- No, not at all.
- Oh, Alexander,

505
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,634
you're not going to bring up those
sordid business matters, I hope.

506
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,010
I've just been going over
last month's bills,

507
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,777
and you people have confused me
with the Treasury Department.

508
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,943
Don't start that again, Dad.

509
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,113
I don't mind giving the government
60% of what I make.

510
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,022
But I can't do it
when my family spends 50%!

511
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,993
Well, why should the government
get more money than your own family?

512
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,555
That's what I want to know.
Why should the government get more?

513
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,295
Well, that's just the way
they have of doing things.

514
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,270
Oh! Money, money, money!

515
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,739
The Frankenstein monster
that destroys souls!

516
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,643
Please don't say anything more
about it! You're upsetting Carlo!

517
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,476
We've got to come
to an understanding right now!

518
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,915
- Either Carlo is or I am.
- Am what?

519
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,044
Well, one of us has got to,
and that's all there is to it.

520
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,147
You're inebriated. You don't know
what you're talking about.

521
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,092
Who would know what they're talking
about, living with a bunch like this?

522
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,653
There's one thing I do know.
What this family needs is discipline.

523
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,926
I've been a pretty patient man.

524
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,594
But when people start riding
horses up the front steps...

525
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,128
and parking them in the library,
that's going a bit too far.

526
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:47,042
- Horses?
- Are you insinuating I rode a horse?

527
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,909
Maybe that wasn't a horse
I saw in the library.

528
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,712
I'm positive I didn't ride a horse.
I didn't have my riding costume on.

529
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,221
- Irene rode the horse up the steps.
- What horse?

530
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,779
Don't play innocent.
I begged you not to do it.

531
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,089
I didn't ride a horse!
But if I did ride a horse,

532
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,393
who broke those windows
on Fifth Avenue?

533
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,524
- What windows?
- You know what windows!

534
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,229
And how about that college sap?
Yah, yah, yah!

535
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,330
I don't care who broke the horse,
rode the window or yah, yah, yah'ed.

536
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,138
- But this family's got to settle down!
- [Groans]

537
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,702
Will you stop bellowing!
Look what you're doing to Carlo.

538
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,146
- Hang Carlo!
- <i>[Angelica] Ohhh!</i>

539
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,481
- <i>[Alexander]</i>
<i>You've exhausted my patience!</i>
- Did you make these?

540
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,021
- I helped.
- They must be wonderful.

541
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,717
- I'd like to help, if you'll let me.
- I'd feel honored.

542
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,386
<i>You might as well face the situation.</i>
<i>I've lost a lot of money.</i>

543
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,396
- <i>You have?</i>
- Yes, I have.

544
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,694
Maybe you left it
in your other suit.

545
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,758
If things keep on, it won't be long
till I don't have another suit.

546
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,202
Which ones are poisoned?

547
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,206
Thank you.

548
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,174
While we're on the subject, how about
this business of certain people...

549
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,271
picking up anybody they find on the city
dump and dragging them into the house?

550
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,341
- <i>We might all be stabbed and robbed.</i>
- Who's going to stab who?

551
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,910
We don't know a thing
about certain people.

552
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,786
Someone should speak to Irene
about picking up strays.

553
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,689
- What's a stray?
- You shut up!

554
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
- Me?
- No. Cornelia.

555
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,926
<i>I will not shut up.</i>
<i>My life is precious to me.</i>

556
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,865
- It won't be in a minute.
- Now, now, children.

557
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,427
Come, Carlo. Come and get
some nice hors d'oeuvre.

558
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,206
I think we should get our help
from employment agencies.

559
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,801
I don't know
but I agree with Cornelia.

560
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,904
<i>[Angelica]</i>
<i>What are you all talking about?</i>

561
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,144
<i>[Sobbing]</i>

562
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,889
You upset Carlo,
and now you're upsetting Irene.

563
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,590
Don't you remember her
breakdown last summer?

564
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,462
I certainly do. That's why I'm not
paying any attention to this.

565
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:54,471
If Mother can sponsor Carlo,
why can't I sponsor Godfrey?

566
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,734
<i>Godfrey knows I'm not being personal,</i>

567
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,141
<i>but none of us would like to wake up</i>
<i>some morning stabbed to death.</i>

568
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,237
You mustn't
come between Irene and Godfrey.

569
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,444
<i>He's the first thing she's shown any</i>
<i>affection for since her Pomeranian died.</i>

570
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,419
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't have a spell.

571
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,548
Carlo, quick, quick,
give me a sofa cushion. Here.

572
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,525
Come, darling, lift up
your head like a good girl.

573
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,961
There now, darling, don't cry.
Now, now, darling.

574
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,023
She's not having a spell.
That's old stuff.

575
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,592
- [Sobbing Continues]
- Darling.

576
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,503
- What is all this nonsense?
- Will you be quiet!

577
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,440
You never did understand them.
Why don't you get a doctor?

578
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,239
- I don't want a doctor!
- Do you want an ice bag?

579
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,713
- I want to die!
- You mustn't do that.

580
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,683
She makes me ill.
Let's get out of here.

581
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,153
Carlo, do the gorilla for Irene.
It always amuses her.

582
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,623
- I'm not in the mood.
- Stop eating and get in the mood.

583
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,126
- Here.
- All right.

584
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,492
I'll do it,

Hey, cook, you'd better

Well, what's the matter, handsome?
Did something frighten you?

What kind of family
am I up against?

Do they go on this way
all the time?

- Oh, no! This is just a quiet evening.
- Quiet evening?

If I were you, I'd
get rid of that lip rouge.

00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,632
Makes you look
a little like Cupid.

You'll find Godfrey
in his room.

637

How did you know
I want to see Godfrey?

638
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,170
I don't know.
It just came over me.

639
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,313
Oh, you...
you can't come in here.

640
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,511
Why not?
It's our house, isn't it?

641
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,078
One room is just
like any other room.

642
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,090
Besides, I want to talk.

643
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,321
I'm terribly sorry,
but we can't talk here.

644
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:15,058
Don't you think it's indecent of you
to order me out after you kissed me?

645
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,498
After I kissed <i>you,</i>
did you say?

646
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,334
Isn't it funny? This morning you were
sitting on my bed; now I'm on yours.

647
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,238
We'll overlook
that startling coincidence.

648
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,004
- Uh, will you sit over here, please?
- The bed's comfortable.

649
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,842
- If it isn't, I'll get you another.
- We'll have our talk here.

650
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,939
If you want a new bed,
you can have it.

651
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,177
Uh, the bed's
very comfortable, thank you.

652
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,618
Much more so
than I am at the moment.

653
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,588
Any time you're uncomfortable,
you just let me know.

654
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:44,356
Thank you. Hasn't anyone ever told you
about certain proprieties?

655
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:48,057
You use such lovely big words.
I like big words. What does it mean?

656
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,191
I'll try to simplify it.

657
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,668
Hasn't your mother or anyone
ever explained to you...

658
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,672
that some things are proper
and some things are not?

659
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,800
She rambles on quite a bit,
but she never says anything.

660
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,334
- But you want me to remain, don't you?
- Oh, of course!

661
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:06,213
And I want to justify your faith in me
by being a very good butler...

662
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,482
and filling the void created by the
death of your late, lamented Pomeranian.

663
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,886
Oh, I've forgotten about him.
He had fleas, anyway.

664
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,085
Besides, you're different. You use
big words, and you're much cuter.

665
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,993
- May I tell you a story?
- I'd love it.

666
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:23,227
Once there was very sentimental
little girl with a very kind heart,

667
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,293
and she helped a man
who was very grateful.

668
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,329
Then she became a nuisance and undid
all the fine work she had done.

669
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,809
- Is it someone you know?
- Her name is Irene Bullock.

670
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,212
If she was a smart girl, she'd pick out
some nice chap in her own social set...

671
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,682
and marry him and
live happily ever after...

672
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,083
and never, never enter
the butler's room again.

673
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,588
- I never can come in here again?
- Never.

674
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,420
- When can we talk?
- When I'm serving breakfast,

675
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,926
I can say good morning and
you can say good morning.

676
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,691
- But you must never come into my room.
- You'll be sorry!

677
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,562
- I'm only trying to be helpful.
- <i>You're being mean!</i>

678
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,797
<i>I'll do something!</i>
<i>You wait and see! You'll be sorry!</i>

679
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,101
<i>You'll be sorry!</i>

<i>I thought it was just the words.</i>

687
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,669
I like it because
the words are all the same.

688
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,867
That's probably why "The Star
Spangled Banner" is so confusing.

689
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,240
Nobody seems to know the words.
[Chuckles]

690
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,371
<i>Except, perhaps, Godfrey.</i>
<i>He seems to know everything.</i>

- The words?

692

<i>Yes, yes. "The Star Spangled Banner."</i>
<i>Nobody seems to know the words.</i>

693
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,988
Do you know them, Godfrey?

694
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,490
I suppose I know as many
as the average person.

695
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,220
I feel ashamed of myself.
I should know them all.

696
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,728
After all, my ancestors
came over on the boat.

697
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,992
Not the <i>Mayflower,</i>
but the boat after that.

698
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,796
What did your ancestors
come over on, Godfrey?

699
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,337
As far as I know,
they've always been here.

700
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,396
They weren't Indians,
I hope.

701
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,771
One can never be sure
of one's ancestors...

You know, you have
rather high cheekbones.

703

[Whispering] Psst, Carlo.

These flowers just came for you, miss.
Where shall I put them?

709
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,827
What difference does it make
when one's heart is breaking?

710
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,424
Yes, miss.
Shall I put them on the piano?

711
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,901
Life is but an empty bubble.

<i>for a girl who's giving a tea party.</i>

713

Why should anyone
be cheerful?

00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,435
Oh, is Irene
giving a tea party?

- I'll invite myself.

716

- <i>Sure. Why not?</i>

717
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,545
All I have to say is,
some people will be sorry someday.

718
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,749
- Naturally, everybody will be someday.
- For what?

719
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,591
Some people will know for what,
and then it will be too late.

720
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,653
This conversation
is very confusing.

721
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,164
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't confuse Carlo.

722

<i>He's practicing.</i>
<i>[Giggles]</i>

723

Do you know any good
funeral music, Carlo?

724
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,072
Shut up!

725
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,540
Are you acting
for anybody in particular?

726
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,602
Godfrey might be interested, if
he'd only turn around and look.

727
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,444
Oh, I remember
that pose so well.

I'll spoil something of yours someday,
and it won't be your act.

or shall I create
a sort of buffet?

Where do you want
the sandwiches served?

734
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,907
- What is food?
- Something you eat, silly.

735
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,774
Do you want the sandwiches
served in here, or don't you?

736
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,678
What difference does it make?
Some people do as they like...

737
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,774
with other people's lives,
and it doesn't make any difference.

- Five, hearts.

I meant spades.

Hi, Irene.
Why the shroud?

Listen, Van Rumple, just because
some people have a million dollars...

747
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,980
doesn't mean they can put

Brrr!
Where's the bar?

Don't take her seriously. The servant

- What does it matter how I am?

- What thing?

- Well, I don't so far.

How about something to eat?

Oh, Godfrey,
bring Mr. Gray a sandwich.

It's your play. Well, come around here
Mr. Gray's not an acrobat.

766

What's come over you? You're beginning
to act like the rest of the family.

- Hey, wait a minute!
- What's the trouble?

768

Godfrey Parke, you old mug!

769
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,925
- Oh, do you know Godfrey?
- We went to Harvard together.

770
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,934
<i>I'm afraid you've confused me with</i>
<i>someone else. I'm Smith, remember?</i>

771
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,233
Sure, you're Smith.
We did go to college together?

772
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,900
- <i>Or did we?</i>
- A butler with a college education.

773
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,500
- <i>He's not really the butler?</i>
- <i>And a very good one.</i>

774
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,411
You mean, this is not a gag
just for my benefit?

775
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,973
Mr. Gray neglected to tell you that when
we were in Harvard, I was his valet.

776
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:17,578
- Was he a good servant, Tommy?
- Excellent.

777
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,249
- What's the idea?
- I'll tell you later.

778
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,884
- Mr. Gray never complained.
- When?

779
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,428
No, I had very few complaints
about Godfrey's work.

780
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,487
I'll tell you tomorrow.
It's my day off.

781
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,328
Strange, you never gave
Mr. Gray as a reference.

782
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,859
You see, I left Mr. Gray under
very unusual circumstances.

783
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,464
- What circumstances?
- I'd rather Mr. Gray told you.

784
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,806
<i>Well, don't go away.</i>
<i>Come here and tell us all about it.</i>

785
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:44,644
Godfrey's a very mysterious person.
Nobody seems to know about him.

786
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,843
- <i>Don't go away, Godfrey.</i>
- No, no, don't go away, Godfrey.

787
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,648
You see, I didn't want to say
anything about this.

788
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,487
But, you see, Godfrey had been working
for us as a butler and whatnot,

789
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,288
and things had been
going along very well...

790

<i>when all of a sudden it happened...</i>

791
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,530
just like that.

792
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,295
You're sure you want me
to tell all this, Godfrey?

[Mutters]

794
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,238
Well, you see, as I said,

795
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,571
<i>he'd been working for us for some time,</i>
<i>when one day he came to me and said,</i>

796
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,204
<i>"Mr. Gray, I trust my work</i>
<i>has always been satisfactory. "</i>

797
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,741
I said, "Why, of course. I've never had
more satisfactory work in all my life."

798
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,050
And he said,
"Thank you, Mr. Gray."

799
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,319
He was always
a very courteous man, Godfrey.

800
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,589
<i>Godfrey is still extremely courteous,</i>
<i>especially in the morning.</i>

801
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,358
Well, it's not much of a story.
Maybe we'd better skip it.

802
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,161
Come on, Tommy, finish it.
You can't stop in the middle.

803
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,828
- Where was I?
- Telling us how polite Godfrey was.

804
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,929
And that's where I said that
Godfrey was still very polite.

805
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,066
Thank you, Mrs. Bullock. It's
a pleasure to have you say so publicly.

806
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:50,512
That's my nature. I never say anything
behind your back I won't say in public.

807
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,845
That's what I admire
about you, Angelica.

808
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,714
That's nice of you, Tommy.
What about the story?

809
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,517
Well, anyway, Godfrey said, "I trust
my work has been satisfactory, sir."

810
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,058
That was about the gist of it,
wasn't it, Godfrey?

811
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:06,927
Those may not have been my exact words,
sir, but that was about the gist of it.

812
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,966
We'll settle for that.
You said he was very satisfactory.

813
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,524
He said thank you,
and then what?

814
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,130
- I had to take an attitude.
- What kind of an attitude?

815
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,970
<i>Well, the only kind I could take</i>
<i>toward a faithful servant.</i>

816
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,442
But Godfrey decided in favor
of his wife and five children.

817
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,538
- <i>Five children? My, my!</i>
- <i>Five.</i>

818
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,311
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Was his wife
an Indian woman?

819
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,649
She was rather dark. We used to take
her on hunting trips to stalk the game.

820
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:34,316
Godfrey! Why didn't you tell me
you had five children?

821
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,825
Why shouldn't Godfrey
have five children?

822
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:41,490
If a woman in Canada can have five
children, why can't Godfrey? You see?

823
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,762
I owe the creation of my family
to Mr. Gray's generosity.

824
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,931
Well, if other people can have
five children, so can other people.

825
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,339
Personally, I think two are plenty,
and Bullock agrees with me.

00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,476
- He's got lots of money.
- He'll need it.

873
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,807
Godfrey, let's you and I
have a good cry.

874
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,074
How about lunch
by my hotel tomorrow?

875
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,946
Yes, sir. Do you prefer
soda or ginger ale?

876
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,713
- Both. 12:00?
- Very good, sir.

877
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,325
Make up your mind just who she's going
to marry. I'd like to meet the guy.

878
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,692
<i>[Angelica] I don't know, Alexander.</i>
<i>It's one of those boys in there.</i>

879
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,697
<i>Come along, now.</i>

880
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,859
[Sobbing Continues]

881
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,343
You're not eating well
this morning, sir.

882
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,472
- You notice everything.
- Business trouble, sir?

883
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,279
What made you ask that?

884
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:53,187
Well, sir, butlers can't help picking
up scraps of news, shall we say?

885
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,451
We shan't say
anything about it.

886
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,618
I thought I might be
of some help, sir.

887
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,821
I dabbled in the market
at one time.

888
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,421
One dabbler in the family
is quite enough.

889
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,593
- Very good, sir. Your eggs.
- No, thank you.

890
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,503
Godfrey, you seem to be
a pretty good sort.

891
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,134
Have you noticed anything queer
about me lately?

892
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,371
Nothing particularly, sir.

893
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:20,109
I sometimes wonder whether my whole
family's gone mad or whether it's me.

894
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,880
I know how you feel. I've felt that
way many times since I've been here.

895
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:27,583
Then why do you stay here?
I have to; you don't.

896
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,388
It's much more comfortable than living
in a packing box on the city dump, sir.

897
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,725
Besides, I'm rather proud
of my job here.

898
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,198
- <i>You're proud of being a butler?</i>
- Proud of being a good butler.

899
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,964
And I may add, sir, a butler
has to be good to hold his job here.

900
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,837
Say... who are you?

901
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,906
I'm just a nobody, sir.
Coffee?

902
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,990
Godfrey, here I am.
So you've turned up at last, eh?

903
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,993
I began to think
you had fallen down the kitchen sink.

904
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,428
Sorry I'm late, Tommy.
It's hard to make beds full of people.

905
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,728
Waiter! You seem to do everything
except put out the cat.

906
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,395
I suppose I'd do that too,
only we have no cat.

907
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,837
The same for me.
What will you have, Jarvis, my man?

908
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,034
Make it a rousing
old lemonade.

909
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,077
Lemonade? You sure
you can handle it?

910
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,079
Oh, yes, I'm the type who
can take it or leave it alone.

911
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,548
You see, now that I'm a working man,
I have to keep my wits about me.

912
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,848
I'm beginning to wonder if you've got
any left. Don't avoid the issue.

913
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,446
I've been sitting here
like a snoopy old maid...

914
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,686
with her ears flapping in the breeze,
waiting to hear the dirt.

915
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,694
What dirt
would you like to hear?

916
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,858
Well, when I see one of the Parkes
of Boston serving hors d'oeuvre...

917
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,993
I think I'm entitled
to a pardonable curiosity.

918
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,867
Why tell you something
that you won't understand?

919
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,397
You've fallen off so many polo ponies
that your brain is scrambled.

920
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,967
But I still want to know
why you're buttling,

921
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,537
when your family is telling everybody
that you're in South America.

922
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,209
A family has to say something
to save its face.

923
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,445
The Parkes disgrace
very easily.

924
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,887
I'd like to see their faces when they
find out that you're a butler.

925
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:11,291
- They're not going to find it out.
- Come to the point.

926
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,057
Well, there isn't
much of a point.

927
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,759
Do you remember that little
incident up in Boston?

928
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,666
You still have that woman
on your mind?

929
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,672
No, not anymore.
But I was pretty bitter at the time.

930
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,335
So I gave her everything I had
and just disappeared.

931
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,312
You know, the Parkes were
never educated to face life.

932
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,145
- We've been puppets for ten generations.
- <i>And?</i>

933
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,584
Tommy, it's surprising
how fast you can go downhill...

934
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,214
when you begin
to feel sorry for yourself.

935
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,986
And boy did I feel sorry
for myself!

936
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,357
I wandered down
to the East River one night,

937
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,693
thinking I'd just slide in
and get it over with.

938
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,199
But I met some fellows
living there, on a city dump.

939
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,227
They were people who were fighting
it out and not complaining.

940
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,830
I never got
as far as the river.

941
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,433
Would you do me
a big favor?

942
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,705
- Who do you want killed?
- I'll do my own killing.

943
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,771
Go around the corner and telephone
this place and ask for Tommy Gray.

944
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,147
When you get him on the wire,
keep him there.

945
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,846
- What's this all about?
- Don't ask too many questions.

946
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,855
Okay.

947
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,585
And so out of the ruins
of Godfrey Parke...

948
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,787
a new edifice has sprung up
in the form of Godfrey Smith.

949
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,763
And, I may add, the edifice
is going to keep on springing.

950
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,095
Do you intend
to remain a butler?

951
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,431
No, I have
some other ideas in mind.

952
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,734
But you wouldn't understand
those either, so we won't go into that.

953
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,206
- Will you do me a favor?
- Maybe.

954
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,142
I have a friend in town,
a very eminent brain specialist.

955
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,146
I'd like him
to examine you.

956
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,183
I'll submit to an examination,
if you will also.

957
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,718
- That's a bet.
- [Laughs]

958
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,720
- Are you Mr. Gray?
- Yes.

959
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,052
- You're wanted on the phone.
- On the phone? What the...

960
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,523
Back in a minute, Godfrey.

961
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,693
- Well, the mystery's solved.
- The mystery?

962
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,206
Yes. Now I know what
a butler does on his day off.

963
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,437
When you worked for Mr. Gray,
were the two of you always this chummy?

964
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,911
You see, I worked for Mr. Gray
a long time, and we got to be...

965
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,643
Yeah, that was under
the name of Smith, wasn't it?

966
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,208
Or did I hear him mention
the name of Parke?

967
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,279
He may have said that we used to take
long walks in the park.

968
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,291
- A sort of custom.
- Oh, yes, I see.

969
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,293
Well, if you can be so chummy
with the Grays,

970
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,352
why can't you be chummy
with the Bullocks?

971
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,956
- I try to keep my place.
- Why? You're very attractive.

972
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,467
- As a butler?
- No, as a Smith.

973
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,868
- You're a rotten butler.
- Sorry.

974
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,430
Are we going to be friends?

975
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,103
I feel that on my day off, I should have
the privilege of choosing my friends.

976
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,203
You can't go on like this forever.

977
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,148
You really like me, and you're
afraid to admit it, aren't you?

978
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,879
Do you want me to tell you
what I really think of you?

979
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,444
- Please do.
- As Smith or as a butler?

980
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,548
- Choose your own weapon.
- You won't hold it against me?

981
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,116
- It's your day off.
- Very well.

982
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,788
You belong to that
unfortunate category...

983
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,389
that I would call
the Park Avenue brat.

984
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,629
A spoiled child who's
grown up in ease and luxury,

985
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,001
who's always
had her own way,

986
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,939
and whose misdirected
energies are so childish...

987
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:16,069
that they hardly deserve the comment
even of a butler on his offThursday.

988
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,080
Thank you for a very lovely portrait.

989
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,412
Hiya, Cornelia.
What are you doing here?

990
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,747
Godfrey and I were discussing
tomorrow's menu.

991
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,617
- Well, don't run away.
- I'm in an awfully big hurry. Good-bye.

992
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,089
I'll see you
down by the ash pile.

993
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,991
- What did she mean by that?
- A little joke we have between us.

994
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,086
Oh, I see.
Ajoking butler.

995
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,256
What's the matter
with that stuff?

996
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,800
I think I'll switch.
I'm more at mood.

997
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,301
Now we're getting
someplace. Waiter!

998
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,497
Another one of these.

999
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,910
- He's not back yet, is he?
- Not yet.

1000
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,681
Would you mind putting these
flowers in his room?

1001
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,383
- I can't go in there anymore.
- I can't, either.

1002
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,393
- You won't tell him they're from me?
- If you don't want me to.

1003
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,952
Oh, I don't want him
to know.

1004
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,402
It's his, isn't it?

1005
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,700
- Do you always sew his buttons on?
- Sometimes.

1006
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,900
I'd like to sew his buttons on
sometime when they come off.

1007
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,443
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- He doesn't lose very many.

1008
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,480
- Oh, he's very tidy...
- Yes, he's very tidy.

1009
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,983
- What does he do on his day off?
- He never tells me.

1010
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,487
He's probably sitting somewhere
with some woman on his lap.

1011
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,749
He's the meanest man I know.

1012
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,757
I think he's very mean.

1013
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,986
I suppose he's sitting
somewhere with somebody on his lap...

1014
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,689
who doesn't care for him at all.

1015
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:45,701
As far as I know, maybe his children
are there too, calling him, calling him.

1016

01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,804
<i>[Officer]</i>
<i>Well, they're not here.</i>

1163
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:28,034
They must be there.

1164
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:31,874
Just a minute. What makes you so sure
they oughta be under the mattress?

1165
01:07:31,946 --> 01:07:34,915
I read that that's where people
put things when they steal them.

1166
01:07:34,982 --> 01:07:38,748
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
- Say, what are you up to?

1167
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:42,983
I'd like to talk to you boys outside
for just a minute, if you don't mind.

1168
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:51,588
- I'm terribly sorry, Godfrey.
- <i>[Irene] I told you so.</i>

1169
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:56,602
<i>[Angelica] We're all terribly</i>
<i>sorry, Godfrey. Come, Cornelia.</i>

1170
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:03,167
Yah, yah, yah, yah!

1171
01:08:03,243 --> 01:08:05,370
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

1172
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:12,182
I wanna apologize for my family.
They're all slightly hysterical.

1173
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,949
- We got an idea what you're up against.
- I'd like to let the matter drop.

1174
01:08:16,023 --> 01:08:20,119
She probably mislaid her necklace.
I'm not certain she had one.

1175
01:08:20,194 --> 01:08:22,458
There's something phony
about the whole thing.

1176
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:24,963
That's all a mistake.
And if you don't mind,

1177
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:27,967
I'd like to send a little check
tomorrow to the pension fund.

1178
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:30,731
- Okay, Mr. Bullock. Thanks very much.
- Good night.

1179
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:33,705
- The whole thing's forgotten.
- Good night, boys.

1180
01:08:35,943 --> 01:08:37,877
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

1181
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,505
Just what have you got
to say for yourself?

1182
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:43,049
Aren't they going to do
anything about it?

1183
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:45,984
No, and it's a good thing
for you that they're not.

1184
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:49,955
And something else. If you don't find
your necklace, the joke's on you...

1185
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:52,891
because it's not insured.

1186
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,588
[Taunting] Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1187
01:08:55,662 --> 01:08:58,096
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1188
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,599
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1189
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:03,261
[Laughing]

1190
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:19,149
Well, here we are, Tommy.
The village of forgotten men.

1191
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:22,484
- How do you like it?
- I don't know but I prefer Newport.

1192
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:26,151
It's a matter of choice.
Unfortunately, these men have no choice.

1193
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:28,820
I still prefer Newport.

1194
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,626
What is that
delightful aroma?

1195
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:35,566
Oh, that's Old Man River.
You get used to it after a while.

1196
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:38,469
Do you mean to say that people
really live in this place?

1197
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:40,666
Well, they go through
the motions.

1198
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:43,642
Tommy, observe yon
structure on your left.

1199
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,271
That was the birthplace
of the celebrated butler Godfrey Smith.

1200
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:51,181
- Where are the ashes of Godfrey Parke?
- Scattered to the winds.

1201
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,685
- Hello, Duke. Well, well.
- Hiya, Mike.

1202
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:56,450
- How's tricks?
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Flaherty.

1203
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:59,515
Mr. Gray, pardon my wet paw.
I've been washing my lingerie.

1204
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:02,960
- That's okay.
- Hey, Bob, look who's here.

1205
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:07,228
- <i>[Godfrey] Hi, Bob.</i>
- Well, bust my false teeth!

1206
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:10,395
Say, thanks for the beans.
They got here just in time.

1207
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:14,567
What's up? The beans was marvelous.
We ate everything but the can.

1208
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:16,131
Don't thank me.
Thank Mr. Gray.

1209
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:18,144
He's got a corner
on the bean market.

1210
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:20,612
Is that the same corner
that prosperity's just around?

1211
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:23,172
No, that's another one.
Hello, Arthur.

1212
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,912
- Hello, Duke.
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Bellinger.

1213
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:28,716
You look as though you've got a job too.
Is this an epidemic?

1214
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,053
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey, Mike. Let's get goin'.</i>

1215
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,491
Duke, we gotta run along.
This is moving day.

1216
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,519
We gotta help the boys move their
shacks. The trucks are crowding in.

1217
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:40,066
We oughta be in the river
by early spring.

1218
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:43,729
We might be able to float
by that time. See you again.

1219
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,738
Right.

1220
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:49,742
That fellow with the bundle of wood
is Bellinger of the Second National.

1221
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:53,337
When his bank failed,
he gave up everything
so his depositors wouldn't suffer.

1222
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:55,347
- Not really?
- Really.

1223
01:10:55,415 --> 01:10:57,975
There are two kinds of people:
Those who fight the idea...

1224
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,747
of being pushed into the river
and the other kind.

1225
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,517
After all, things have always
been this way for some people.

1226
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,751
These men are not
your responsibility.

1227
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:07,851
There are different ways
of having fun.

1228
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:10,055
You have a peculiar
sense of humor.

1229
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,564
Here we have some very
fashionable apartment houses,

1230
01:11:12,633 --> 01:11:14,965
over there is
a very swanky nightclub...

1231
01:11:15,035 --> 01:11:17,435
while down here men starve
for want of a job.

1232
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:20,405
- How does that strike you?
- What's this leading to?

1233
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:23,341
Tommy, there's a very peculiar
mental process called thinking.

1234
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,503
You wouldn't know
much about that.

1235
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:28,013
But when I was living here,
I did a lot of it.

1236
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:32,814
One thing I discovered was
that the only difference between
a derelict and a man is a job.

1237
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:36,447
Sit down over here and rest your weary
bones. Let me tell you what I want.

1238
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:39,788
Well, I'll listen, but I still think
you belong in a psychopathic ward.

1239
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:44,263
You may be right, but let me tell you
my plan, and listen with both ears.

1240
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,265
I have an idea...

1241
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:24,001
Did you and Irene have a good time
while you were in Europe?

1242
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:26,699
Oh, as good a time as anyone
could have with Irene.

1243
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:29,037
- You should be more civil to Carlo.
- Why?

1244
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:31,839
- I don't mind. <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>
- That will hold you.

1245
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:34,847
Carlo always has such a clever answer
for everything.

1246
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:36,849
Darling, do you want
some coffee?

1247
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,851
- No, thank you.
- She didn't eat any dinner, either.

1248
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:40,853
- You had plenty.
- I can't say anything!

1249
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,014
- You never do.
- Oh, what's come over you?

1250
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,217
We spend good money
to send you abroad,

1251
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:47,453
and you're worse off
than when you left.

1252
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:49,791
- <i>Her liver is probably upset.</i>
- Take a liver pill.

1253
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:53,026
- I don't want a liver pill.
- You mustn't get upset.

1254
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,863
You've broken many before
and never acted this way.

1255
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:59,872
She's upset because Godfrey didn't fall
down in a faint when we got in today.

1256
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,204
Why should Godfrey
fall in a faint?

1257
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:04,870
He didn't make enough fuss
over her homecoming to suit her.

1258
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:07,311
Well, Godfrey's
not the fussing kind. Shh.

1259
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:11,340
Godfrey, I was just telling my daughters
you missed them while they were away.

1260
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,511
Oh, yes, I did.
Very much, indeed.

1261
01:13:13,587 --> 01:13:16,215
- We missed you too, didn't we, Irene?
- Yes.

1262
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,885
- I missed you, also.
- It's nice to miss everybody.

1263
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,724
Then it makes it so nice
when we get together again.

1264
01:13:22,796 --> 01:13:25,094
There, there, darling.
It's nice to see you cheerful.

1265
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:27,895
- You do have a way with you, Godfrey.
- Thank you.

1266
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:30,869
There's no use denying the fact
that Godfrey has a way with him.

1267
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:33,906
We must be running on.
Cornelia, cheer her up.

1268
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,908
I'm a cinch.

1269
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,740
Do you feel better now that
you know Godfrey missed us?

1270
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:41,713
He missed me more.
I could tell by the light in his eyes.

1271
01:13:41,782 --> 01:13:44,250
Why don't throw yourself
in the man's arms?

1272
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:46,445
You can't rush a man
like Godfrey.

1273
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,715
You're getting
pretty old, you know?

1274
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:51,724
He's really in love.
He's just hard to break down.

1275
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:54,488
I could break him down
in no time at all.

1276
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:56,995
- He'd have nothing to do with you.
- How do you know?

1277
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,862
Because he wouldn't.
Don't you try anything.

1278
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:02,902
I'm not saying I will,
and I'm not saying I won't

1279
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:06,132
Come to think of it, Godfrey and
I have a little unfinished business.

1280
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:10,336
You better leave it unfinished, unless
you want to be wearing a lamp for a hat.

1281
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,378
[Laughing]

1282
01:14:21,855 --> 01:14:24,688
Did you mean it
when you said you missed me?

1283
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:27,226
Oh! Yes,
of course I did.

1284
01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:30,024
I mean, did you miss
Cornelia and me or just me?

1285
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:33,032
- Well, I missed both of you.
- Not just me?

1286
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,263
Oh, I may have missed you a little
more than I did Cornelia. Why?

1287
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:39,703
I'm glad, because if you missed Cornelia
more, you'd probably miss me less.

1288
01:14:39,773 --> 01:14:42,503
- That sounds very logical.
- That's all I wanted to know.

1289
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:45,977
- You look so cute in your apron.
- I'm not trying to look cute.

1290
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:48,981
Molly has a cold,
and I'm doubling for her.

1291
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,643
- [Laughing]
- What's funny about that?

1292
01:14:51,718 --> 01:14:53,845
- She hasn't got a cold.
- No?

1293
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,856
She's got the same thing I've got,
only you won't let me talk about that.

1294
01:14:57,924 --> 01:15:00,984
- You'll lose your temper.
- [Chuckles] Well, not seriously.

1295
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:04,360
- Will you let me do something?
- What do you want to do?

1296
01:15:04,431 --> 01:15:06,661
- Wipe.
- Oh, all right.

1297
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:09,827
- You can tell me all about your trip.
- You won't get mad?

1298
01:15:09,903 --> 01:15:13,839
- Why should I?
- Because everybody was Godfrey.

1299
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:16,842
Every... I don't want
to seem dull,

1300
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:20,573
but I do seem to have a little trouble
following you at times.

1301
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:23,309
Well, for instance, when I'd go
into a restaurant in Paris,

1302
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:25,851
I'd close my eyes and say,
"The waiter is Godfrey.

1303
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:27,978
I'm home, and he's
serving me dinner."

1304
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,750
- It made everything taste better.
- Why?

1305
01:15:30,824 --> 01:15:33,793
- Haven't you any sense?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

1306
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,693
When I'd get in a cab,
the driver was Godfrey,

1307
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:38,856
and I'd say,
"This is his chariot,

1308
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:41,196
and he's taking me
to his castle on the mountains."

1309
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:45,364
Suppose you come down out of the
mountains and tell me about your trip.

1310
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,637
We went to Venice, and I went for a ride
in one of those rowboats.

1311
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:52,701
Not a matador. That was in Spain.
But something like a matador.

1312
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,872
Do you, by any chance,
mean a gondolier?

1313
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,384
That was the name of the boat. The man
that pushed it sang a beautiful song.

1314
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,250
- It was beautiful.
- I see.

1315
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:05,382
- So the man was Godfrey.
- I didn't even mind the smell.

1316
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:09,623
It was very convenient to take a trip
abroad without leaving the kitchen.

1317
01:16:09,696 --> 01:16:12,460
Oh, you have a wonderful sense of humor.
I wish I had a sense of humor.

1318
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:15,399
But I never can think
of the right thing to say.

1319
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:19,371
Do you mind if I talk for a little bit,
while you catch your breath?

1320
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:21,737
I'd love it.

1321
01:16:21,808 --> 01:16:25,403
While you've been away,
I've been doing some things also.

1322
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:29,074
I've been trying to do things that
I thought would make you proud of me.

1323
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:31,617
Oh, I was proud of you
before I went away.

1324
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:34,153
Yes, but I mean
prouder still.

1325
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:37,588
You see, you helped me
to find myself,

1326
01:16:37,657 --> 01:16:39,591
and I'm very grateful.

1327
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:42,150
- You'd make a wonderful husband.
- [Chuckles]

1328
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:44,220
I'm afraid not.

1329
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:48,529
- I know how you feel about things.
- How?

1330
01:16:48,602 --> 01:16:52,663
Well, you're grateful to me because I
helped you to beat Cornelia,

1331
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:56,971
and I'm grateful to you
because you helped me to beat life.

1332
01:16:57,043 --> 01:16:59,944
But that doesn't mean that
we have to fall in love.

1333
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:03,141
If you don't want to,
but I'd make a wonderful wife.

1334
01:17:03,216 --> 01:17:06,014
Well, not for me,
I'm afraid.

1335
01:17:06,086 --> 01:17:08,987
You see, I like you very much.

1336
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:12,456
But I had a very bitter experience.

1337
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,295
But I won't bore you with that.

1338
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,991
- Maybe she wasn't in love with you.
- Well, maybe not.

1339
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:22,057
However, that's
beside the point.

1340
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:24,695
You and I are friends.

1341
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,706
I feel a certain
responsibility to you.

1342
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:30,834
- That's why I wanted to tell you first.
- Tell me what?

1343
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:35,348
Well, I thought it was about time
that I was moving on.

1344
01:17:35,415 --> 01:17:37,508
Godfrey!

1345
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:40,144
Now, please.

1346
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,814
- I won't cry, I promise.
- That's fine.

1347
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:45,016
After all,
I'm your protege.

1348
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,821
- You want me to improve myself?
- Yes.

1349
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:50,988
You don't want me to go on being
just a butler all my life, do you?

1350
01:17:51,064 --> 01:17:54,261
- I want you to be anything you want.
- Well, that's very sweet.

1351
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:57,565
- When are you leaving?
- Oh, pretty soon.

1352
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:00,197
But I'll call you up
every now and then.

1353
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:03,208
We'll have long chats.
I'll tell you how I'm getting on.

1354
01:18:03,276 --> 01:18:06,643
- Oh, we'll have lots of fun.
- Are you going back to her?

1355
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:09,841
- To whom?
- That Indian woman.

1356
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:12,680
Indian... Oh!
[Laughs]

1357
01:18:12,752 --> 01:18:15,880
She was just
a fabrication.

1358
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:19,414
Oh! Then, you weren't
married to her?

1359
01:18:19,492 --> 01:18:22,950
No, she was just a product
ofTommy Gray's imagination.

1360
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:26,226
- Then there wasn't any?
- No!

1361
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:29,063
Well, there couldn't
have been five children.

1362
01:18:29,135 --> 01:18:31,660
- Well, naturally.
- [Laughing]

1363
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:34,138
That makes a difference.

1364
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:39,674
Yeah, that makes
a difference.

1365
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:43,882
Did you ring, miss?

1366
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,680
You needn't be so formal
when we're alone.

1367
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:49,722
Shouldn't that rather increase
a butler's formality?

1368
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:52,553
- But you're not a butler.
- I'm sorry if I've disappointed.

1369
01:18:52,626 --> 01:18:55,561
You might drop that superior
attitude for a moment.

1370
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:58,860
There's a little matter I've wanted to
talk over with you for quite a while...

1371
01:18:58,932 --> 01:19:01,127
called "The Mystery
of Milady's Necklace"...

1372
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:03,795
or "What Happened
to the Pearls?"

1373
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:07,567
Pearls? Necklace? Oh, you mean the
one that disappeared last fall?

1374
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:09,575
- The same.
- Didn't that ever turn up?

1375
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:12,271
Oh, yes, it turned up,
but not in my possession.

1376
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:16,179
I know the first part of the story, but
I wondered what you know might know?

1377
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:19,707
- I can't imagine.
- One other story might interest you.

1378
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:21,811
I met some people
on the boat coming over.

1379
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:23,879
A Boston family,
quite distinguished.

1380
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:27,688
They knew a great deal
about a family called... the Parkes.

1381
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:30,252
The old <i>Mayflower</i> crowd.
Very upper crust too.

1382
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:32,628
Never been a breath
of scandal.

1383
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,601
<i>It would be an awful shame to see</i>
<i>them made the laughing stock of Boston.</i>

1384
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:39,264
I should hate to see anyone
made a laughing stock.

1385
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:42,638
Let's you and I take a long taxi ride
out Van Cortland Way.

1386
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:44,973
<i>Perhaps we could</i>
<i>exchange secrets.</i>

1387
01:19:45,045 --> 01:19:48,071
- Is that a command?
- As you like.

1388
01:19:48,148 --> 01:19:50,981
I'll be waiting
around the corner.

1389
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:55,112
Which corner?
This one or that one?

1390
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,782
This corner.

1391
01:19:57,857 --> 01:20:00,826
It's impossible to exchange
intimate secrets here.

1392
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:04,728
The traffic's almost as heavy as it is
at Grand Central Station.

1393
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:08,063
Don't forget, darling.
Fifteen minutes.

1394
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:16,639
[Sobbing] Please, Godfrey,
you can't go with Cornelia.

1395
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,474
But I didn't say I was going
anyplace with Miss Cornelia.

1396
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:23,209
I know, but you will. She always
makes everybody do just as she likes.

1397
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:26,218
But why should you care
whether I meet her or not?

1398
01:20:26,286 --> 01:20:30,086
I do care, that's why.
Cornelia's the one who doesn't care.

1399
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:32,989
I think I should decide
those things for myself.

1400
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:35,960
Oh, Godfrey, I don't want
to be annoying, but l... Oh!

1401
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:40,398
Oh, see here...
You-You can't do that.

1402
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:43,493
Uh, please, snap out of it.

1403
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:48,337
Ohhh, this is
the craziest family.

1404
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:14,292
Now see here, stop this nonsense.
Do you hear?

1405
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:18,098
If you're faking one of your spells
to keep me from meeting Cornelia,

1406
01:21:18,171 --> 01:21:20,435
you're on the wrong track,
you hear?

1407
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:22,441
- Do you hear?
- Mmm.

1408
01:21:26,546 --> 01:21:29,208
Must be some smelling salts.

1409
01:21:46,332 --> 01:21:49,233
Are you feeling better?
No?

1410
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:53,765
Just a minute.

1411
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,139
Godfrey knows how to take care
of little Irene.

1412
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,144
Yes, indeed.

1413
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:05,677
Just lie there quietly, and Godfrey
will take care of everything.

1414
01:22:05,752 --> 01:22:09,051
Godfrey knows just how
to take care...

1415
01:22:09,122 --> 01:22:11,852
of these nasty old faints.

1416
01:22:11,925 --> 01:22:15,156
That's the girl.
Come right up here.

1417
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:19,392
There you are.
Godfrey will soon fix Irene.

1418
01:22:19,465 --> 01:22:23,401
Yes, indeed.
Just leave everything to Godfrey.

1419
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:26,233
Godfrey will take care
of everything.

1420
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:29,673
Now, you just sit right down
there like a good girl,

1421
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:33,041
and in just a minute
you'll forget that you had any trouble.

1422
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:36,172
- [Gasps]
- I thought so. Let that be a lesson.

1423
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:39,218
Godrey! Oh, Godfrey,
don't go away!

1424
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:42,311
Oh, Godfrey,
now I know you love me.

1425
01:22:42,388 --> 01:22:45,551
- I do not love you!
- You do!

1426
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,059
What is the meaning of this,
may I ask?

1427
01:22:48,127 --> 01:22:51,153
- Godfrey loves me!
- What are you talking about?

1428
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:54,200
- Godfrey loves me!
- Godfrey, I demand an explanation!

1429
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:58,033
- I think perhaps I had better resign.
- Yes, that's a good idea.

1430
01:22:58,104 --> 01:23:02,040
- What do you think your father'd say?
- I don't care. Godfrey loves me.

1431
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:05,077
You put on some dry clothes
and come downstairs.

1432
01:23:05,144 --> 01:23:08,580
- Godfrey loves me!
- I never heard anything like this!

1433
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:11,650
## [Singing In Italian]

1434
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:33,365
Shut that thing off!
I feel gloomy enough as it is!

1435
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:44,139
- Something terrible has happened.
- What?

1436
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:47,118
- Godfrey pushed Irene into a shower.
- What's terrible about that?

1437
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:50,178
He's in love with her. I can't make
head nor tail out of the whole thing.

1438
01:23:50,256 --> 01:23:52,850
I can't make head nor tail
out of what you're saying.

1439
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:55,190
The only thing is to send
him back where he came from.

1440
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:57,525
Imagine, falling in love
with a butler.

1441
01:23:57,597 --> 01:24:00,532
If you're going to feel sorry
for anyone, feel sorry for Godfrey.

1442
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,263
- Alexander!
- Don't "Alexander" me!

1443
01:24:04,337 --> 01:24:06,635
I've got something
more important to talk about.

1444
01:24:06,706 --> 01:24:09,470
Don't tell me you're going
to talk about money matters.

1445
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,204
- Money, money, money!
- Yes, I am. But before I start,

1446
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:14,769
I'm going to have
a little talk with Carlo.

1447
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:18,943
- What are you going to do?
- This is private, just for Carlo's ears.

1448
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:24,148
You don't mind if we have
a little chat, Carlo, old boy?

1449
01:24:24,223 --> 01:24:27,750
You know, for some time,
Carlo, I've felt...

1450
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:31,126
<i>[Glass Shattering]</i>

1451
01:24:33,466 --> 01:24:36,492
- What did you say to Carlo?
- I said good-bye.

1452
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:39,504
- Did he go?
- He left through the side window.

1453
01:24:39,572 --> 01:24:41,938
- <i>Where is he going?</i>
- <i>I don't know, but he won't be back.</i>

1454
01:24:42,008 --> 01:24:44,943
- Now, sit down and do some listening.
- I've never seen you like this.

1455
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:47,241
Sit down!
What's come over you?

1456
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:50,646
- You're just in time to listen.
- Do you want Godfrey to listen?

1457
01:24:50,717 --> 01:24:53,811
Yes, I want Godfrey to listen.
This concerns him too.

1458
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:57,253
You might as well all know,
point-blank, we're about broke.

1459
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:59,416
You mean we haven't
any money left?

1460
01:24:59,492 --> 01:25:02,552
We've got this house, a few odds
and ends, and that's about all.

1461
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:05,654
Not only that, I've lost all of my stock
in Bullock Enterprises.

1462
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:09,133
<i>I've borrowed some of the stockholder's</i>
<i>money trying to recoup my losses.</i>

1463
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:12,137
I don't know where I'm going to end up.
Maybe in jail.

1464
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:14,799
- Alexander!
- But if I do end up in jail,

1465
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:17,502
it'll be the first peace
I've had in 20 years.

1466
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:19,943
And I don't want any of you
to chortle about Godfrey.

1467
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,947
You may all end up on the dump.

1468
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:25,041
- <i>[Cornelia] What are we going to do?</i>
- May I intrude, sir?

1469
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:28,212
I'm afraid things are not
as bad as you make out.

1470
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,778
- What do you know about it?
- Well, sir,

1471
01:25:30,857 --> 01:25:34,987
I've known for a long time the Bullock
interests were in rather a bad way.

1472
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:37,962
I offered to help you once,
but you declined that help.

1473
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:42,468
So I took the liberty of dabbling in the
market on my own account. Here, sir.

1474
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:45,163
- <i>What's this?</i>
- <i>That's most of your stock.</i>

1475
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:48,230
I knew it had been dumped
on the market, so I sold short.

1476
01:25:48,307 --> 01:25:51,765
I don't understand. You sold short.
You mean gentlemen's underwear?

1477
01:25:51,844 --> 01:25:55,871
Wait! You mean that you've been making
money while I was losing it?

1478
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:59,475
I did it in your interest, sir.
The stock has been endorsed over to you.

1479
01:26:01,387 --> 01:26:05,619
I don't understand.
You did this for me?

1480
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:09,525
Well, sir, there comes a turning point
in every man's life.

1481
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:13,087
A time when he needs help.
It happened to me, also.

1482
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:17,000
This family helped me
I hope I repaid my debt.

1483
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,029
Some of the money went into a project
of my own. I hope you won't mind.

1484
01:26:21,107 --> 01:26:24,304
Do you mean that you did
all that on $150 a month?

1485
01:26:24,377 --> 01:26:28,211
Well, hardly. You see,
with the aid ofTommy Gray,

1486
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:32,718
I was able to transmute
a certain trinket into gold,

1487
01:26:32,785 --> 01:26:36,186
then into stock
and then back into pearls again.

1488
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:39,019
Thank you, dear lady,
for the use of this trinket.

1489
01:26:39,092 --> 01:26:41,856
Oh, Godfrey!
Then you did steal them!

1490
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:45,921
Well, I, uh... Perhaps Miss Cornelia
had better explain that.

1491
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:49,434
- You win.
- What is this all about, anyway?

1492
01:26:49,502 --> 01:26:52,562
I put the pearls
under Godfrey's mattress.

1493
01:26:52,638 --> 01:26:55,198
Thank you, Miss Cornelia.
I wanted you to say that.

1494
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:58,266
- <i>But why?</i>
- You wouldn't understand.

1495
01:26:58,344 --> 01:27:00,938
Here, Godfrey.
These are rightfully yours.

1496
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:04,642
Oh, no, thank you. I repaid my debt,
and I'm grateful to all of you.

1497
01:27:04,717 --> 01:27:07,948
If anyone's indebted, we are, after
the way some of us have treated you.

1498
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:12,889
I've been repaid in many ways.
I learned patience from Mr. Bullock.

1499
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:17,089
I found Mrs. Bullock
at all times, shall we say, amusing.

1500
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:21,600
That's complimentary, and don't forget
you said I looked as young as Cornelia.

1501
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:25,501
- What good did you find in me, if any?
- A great deal.

1502
01:27:25,571 --> 01:27:29,507
You taught me the fallacy of
false pride. You taught me humility.

1503
01:27:29,575 --> 01:27:32,601
I don't understand you.

1504
01:27:32,678 --> 01:27:36,512
Miss Cornelia, there have been other
spoiled children in the world.

1505
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:39,312
I happened to be
one of them myself.

1506
01:27:39,385 --> 01:27:41,580
You're a high-spirited girl.

1507
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:46,091
I can only hope that you use those
high spirits in a more constructive way.

1508
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,856
And so... good day.

You know,
I hate to see Godfrey go.

1511
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:08,372
He's the only butler we ever had
who understood women.

1512
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:14,585
Well, Molly, you told me to leave
my hat near the door. Remember?

1513
01:28:14,654 --> 01:28:17,020
I hate to see you leave,
Godfrey.

1514
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:20,786
- Oh, Molly, you've been swell.
- The house will seem empty.

1515
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:24,921
Well, I guess the best
friends have to part.

1516
01:28:24,997 --> 01:28:27,693
Will you say good-bye
to Miss Irene for me?

1517
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:30,930
I don't think I can go through
that ordeal right now.

1518
01:28:32,672 --> 01:28:35,732
You're sweet, Molly.

1519

I've got an estimate from the contractor
on your housing plan for the winter.

He figures he can petition off
our present buildings into compartments,

01:30:06,465 --> 01:30:08,626
take care of
at least 50 people.

1545

It'll cost $5,800,
but that includes steam heat.

Forgotten men with steam. Sounds like
something that ought to be on the menu.

I'll talk with you
about it later, Arthur.

We're giving food and shelter to 50

- What more do you want?
- You're the most arbitrary butler ever.

- Ex-butler.
- Fired?

foolish feeling coming on again.

- You mean Irene?
- What do you know about that?

Nobody knows anything about her love,

- I've had enough of matrimony.
- What's wrong with butlers?

Lots of society girls
run away with their chauffeurs.

Never mind about that. Suppose
you write me out a check for $5,000?

- For what?
- A new dock.

01:32:40,586 --> 01:32:43,612
Oh, you have a kitchen!
I'm gonna like this place.

1589
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:46,590
What's over here?
Oh, is this where you sleep?

1590
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:50,891
That's the general purpose
of the room. Any observations?

1591
01:32:50,963 --> 01:32:54,330
I think it's very cute,
but we'll have to change the wallpaper.

1592
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,369
- What do you mean "we"?
- Oh, I don't like green wallpaper.

1593
01:32:57,436 --> 01:33:00,462
You won't have to look at it.
You're going home right now.

1594
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:02,734
- Oh, but I can't go home.
- Why not?

1595
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:06,107
- I can't go home after what happened.
- What happened?

1596
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,011
You know what happened
just as well as I do.

1597
01:33:09,081 --> 01:33:12,414
- Now see here...
- Oh, go on and lose your temper.

1598
01:33:12,485 --> 01:33:14,919
I love it when
you lose your temper.

1599
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:16,921
Why can't you let me alone?

1600
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,254
Because you're my responsibility,
and someone has to take care of you.

1601
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:23,955
- I can take care of myself.
- Look me in the eye and say that.

1602
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:26,293
You love me,
and you know it.

1603
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:29,334
There's no sense in struggling against
a thing when it's got you.

1604
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:30,925
- That's all there is to it.
- <i>[Knocking At Door]</i>

1605
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:32,937
Oh, that's Clarence.

1606
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,331
I'm sorry I was delayed,
Miss Irene.

1607
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:39,934
- <i>I had to go around the back way.</i>
- <i>Put the wood over there.</i>

1608
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:43,311
You can put the groceries
right there in the kitchen.

1609
01:33:43,382 --> 01:33:46,112
- That's fine. Thank you, Clarence.
- What's the idea?

1610
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:49,279
I brought some wood and food.
It should last us for a week.

1611
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:52,813
It's a wonder you didn't bring
a minister and license.

1612
01:33:52,892 --> 01:33:55,122
- I never thought of that.
- <i>[Knocking At Door]</i>

1613
01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:57,287
- May I come in?
- Oh, Mr. Courtney.

1614
01:33:57,363 --> 01:34:01,163
Mr. Gray said there were a couple of
people here who wanted to get married.

1615
01:34:01,233 --> 01:34:04,896
- Are you it?
- Can you marry us without a license?

1616
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:07,200
It may get me
into a lot of trouble,

1617
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:09,707
but I guess I've known
your family long enough.

1618
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:12,801
- Who are you going to marry?
- Godfrey. This is Godfrey.

1619
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:16,746
- Oh. How do you do, Godfrey?
- [Stammering]

1620
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:19,215
Does your father
know about this?

1621
01:34:19,285 --> 01:34:21,981
Everybody knows about it
except Godfrey.

1622
01:34:22,054 --> 01:34:24,887
Well, I guess we better
have a witness.

1623
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:28,324
- Clarence, stand right down here.
- What?

1624
01:34:28,394 --> 01:34:32,160
That's fine. Right there.
Come on, Godfrey. Right there.

1625
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,530
Well, now, uh,
join hands, please.

1626
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:38,263
- No, the right hand.
- Oh.

1627
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:41,272
Stand still, Godfrey.
It'll all be over in a minute.

1628
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,774
[Giggling]
