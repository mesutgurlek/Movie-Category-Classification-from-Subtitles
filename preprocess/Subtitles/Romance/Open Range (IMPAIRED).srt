Hello!

165
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,286
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

166
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:42,346
Like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.

167
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,483
Okay, that'll be four bits each.

168
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,994
- There you go.
- Thank you.

169
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,453
Not planning on staying long?

170
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,762
Long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.

171
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,927
Maybe I can help you gents.

172
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,335
I been here since Harmonille
was Fort Harmon

173
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,566
and we still had soldiers
to chase off Indians.

174
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,270
I know eerybody in town
and for miles beyond.

175
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,371
Big man needing a haircut,
about 30.

176
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,712
That's his rig right there.

177
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:17,021
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.

178
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:18,752
Very friendly young fella.

179
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,694
Looks like he's been liing out
of saddlebags most of his life.

180
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,754
Got his horse in the corral.

181
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,231
Ride with you, does he?

182
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,097
Know where we can find him?

183
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,567
Yeah.

184
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,365
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

185
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:33,566
He got into it
with some cattlemen

186
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,938
oer at the general store.

187
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,670
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

188
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:38,405
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

189
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,344
before Marshal Poole came up

190
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,542
and hit him oer the head
with his gun barrel.

191
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:46,053
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

192
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,145
You might want to keep that
in mind

193
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,282
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

194
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:52,155
Saddle his horse.

195
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,524
That coer what he owes?

196
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,789
Oh, yeah.

197
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,764
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

198
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,299
Much obliged.

199
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,925
Hold on.

200
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,175
BAXTER:
How long you had him here?

201
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:16,274
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

202
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,751
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

203
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,912
Why is that?

204
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,684
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

205
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:28,794
Eening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

206
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,888
This here's Charley Waite.

207
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,626
Eening.

208
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,725
Beliee you hae
a friend of ours.

209
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,999
Name's Mose Harrison.

210
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah, I got him here.

211
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:44,135
He started a fight
in the general store.

212
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:48,046
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

213
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:51,483
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

214
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,985
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

215
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,885
You got a charge against him?

216
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,719
I got plenty.

217
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,851
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

218
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,726
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

219
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,697
Hear tell he got hit
oer the head.

220
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,960
[Scoffs]

221
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,968
He'll be fine.

222
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:11,699
Well, I come to get him.

223
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:16,540
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can hae him.

224
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:21,514
How does $50 each offense sound?

225
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,516
Like robbery.

226
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,082
Lot of money.

227
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,818
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

228
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,251
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

229
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,025
My name's Denton Baxter.

230
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,929
Be your men Mose tussled with.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,695
That's right.

232
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,396
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

233
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:47,100
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

234
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:50,269
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

235
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,372
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

236
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,345
I got the biggest spread around.

237
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,546
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

238
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,680
Built it up with me own
two hands,

239
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,554
piece by piece,

240
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,957
along with this town.

241
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,723
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

242
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:11,492
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

243
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,193
Free graze is legal.

244
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,497
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

245
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,597
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts neer do.

246
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:22,937
You know, a few years back,

247
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,707
a free-graze outfit
came through.

248
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,840
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

249
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,147
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

250
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,121
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

251
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,521
Shot in the back, was he?

252
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,830
Your man's horse and rig
are at the liery barn.

253
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,425
You can take him with you
when you leae tonight.

254
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:51,028
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

255
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,198
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moing

256
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,971
and keep them moing till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

257
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,876
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

258
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,382
so he can be on his way.

259
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,862
[Lock rattling]

260
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,762
Charley.

261
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,068
- Mose.
- [Grunts]

262
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,636
Mose.

263
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,375
[Groans painfully]

264
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,580
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

265
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,986
Does it?

266
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,496
Mose, you gotta get up.

267
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:53,864
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

268
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,195
I don't much like this town.

269
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:01,805
Here you go.

270
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,844
Boy, they really lit into him.

271
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,346
You got a doctor in this town?

272
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,440
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

273
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,985
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

274
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:13,748
Look for a picket fence.

275
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,312
He's got a sign out front.

276
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,153
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

277
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,427
Lay him down in there.

278
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,777
I'll fetch the doctor.

279
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,339
Get his legs, Boss.

280
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,248
Easy, easy.

281
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,621
Good.

282
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,097
I'm Dr. Barlow.

283
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,996
Boss Spearman.

284
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,328
Charley Waite.

285
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,097
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

286
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,729
He works for me.

287
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,272
These wounds are old.

288
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,308
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

289
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,641
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

290
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:14,408
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

291
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:17,212
He certainly gae
as good as he got.

292
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:19,378
Broke the arm of one.

293
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,388
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

294
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:24,924
Let's see what we got here.

295
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,391
- Aah!
- Easy.

296
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,655
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

297
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,663
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

298
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,756
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

299
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,734
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

300
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,015
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

301
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,715
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

302
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,193
- That's it.
- [Breathes sharply]

303
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,257
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

304
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:09,701
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

305
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,032
I'd say to good health,

306
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:13,039
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

307
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:17,840
We'll drink to good health
for them that hae it coming.

308
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,378
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

309
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:38,326
Be better he didn't trael.

310
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,924
Well, he'll hae to.

311
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,129
How much I owe you, Doctor?

312
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,194
We're een.

313
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:48,333
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

314
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,877
Wish he'd hae made you wealthy.

315
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,540
Ma'am.

316
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,407
BOSS: Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

317
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,378
Notice that, did you?

318
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,210
Well, I ain't dead.

319
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,806
Glad to hear it.

320
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,010
Sweet, too.

321
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,452
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

322
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,319
A woman like that makes a man

323
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,258
think about
setting down roots, eh?

324
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,790
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

325
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:47,356
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

326
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:49,494
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

327
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,696
Yeah.

328
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,365

a thousand words.

[Barks]

330
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,124
Hey, Tig.

331
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,873
Now, where do you suppose he is?

332
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:47,658
Goddamn kid.

333
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:51,823
Button's all right, Boss.

334
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:58,300
Anyone done him harm, they'd
hae gone through the wagon.

335
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:01,273
Reckon you're right.

336
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,144
Here he is.

337
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,107
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

338
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,209
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

339
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,277
BUTTON:
Out with the herd.

340
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:16,755
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

341
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,917
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

342
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:21,188
Yeah, but what happened?

343
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:24,629
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

344
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,599
Looks like more than a little.

345
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:29,431
Are we moing on?

346
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:33,098
We always do, don't we,
once we'e grazed off a place?

347
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,176
Did I do something wrong?

348
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,241
Just leae him be for a while.

349
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,651
Here.
Hae some coffee.

350
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,916
Made fresh, for a change.

351
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,357
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

352
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,689
Where?

353
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,627
Maybe half a mile out.

354
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:59,530
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

BOSS:
Do no good, Button.

360
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,644
I seen them like Baxter before.

361
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:25,283
He means to hae this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

362
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,190
BUTTON:
If he was gonna take the herd,

363
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,252
why not just keep you in town?

364
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,696
Marshal already had Mose.

365

CHARLE Y:
Wants us all in one place.

366
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,863
Far from there when it happens.

367
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:40,600
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to moe on and all.

368
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,404
Weren't the only thing he said.

369
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,877
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

370
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:49,848
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

371
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:54,013
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

372
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,886
That weren't no idle story.

Let's find out for certain.

Beautiful country.

375
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,976
A man can get lost out here,

376
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:02,011
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

377
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,552
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

378
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,553
Nigh on 10 years.

379
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,757
Mm-hmm.

380
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:15,233
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

381
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,566
Long time.

382
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,300
Been a lot of change since then.

383
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,170
What's on your mind, Boss?

384
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,073
Way I figure it, we can leae
the cattle and run,

385
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,582
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

386
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:32,983
before they scatter the herd.

387
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:41,090
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed oer?

388
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,560
The cows is one thing.

389
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,120
But one man telling another

390
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,895
where he can go in this
country's something else.

391
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,868
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

392
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:52,337
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

393
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,874
till he figured
it was time to show us

that he gae the orders
around here.

Ooh, sticks in my craw.

396
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:08,020
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

397
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,385
Yeah.

398

00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:49,319
you take him in the wagon
and moe on.

488
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:54,394
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

489
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,258
That's right.

490
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,088
And I'm gonna kill
eery son of a bitch

491
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,499
that comes to take them.

492
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,403
For one man on open ground,

493
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:08,032
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

494
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,189
You know I neer
gone against you, Boss.

495
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:28,091
Always let you do
most of the talking.

496
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:30,527
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

497
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,065
and I aim to take him.

498
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,124
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

499
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:40,333
Otherwise, you do what you
hae to do, I'll do the same.

500
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,399
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

501
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:44,842
I don't figure into it.

502
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:47,607
Button deseres eery chance
we can gie him.

503
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:53,452
All right.

504
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,826
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

505
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:03,920
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

506
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,660
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

507
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,862
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

508
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,428
Neer hae.

509
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,040
[Metal clanging]

510
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,862
Looks real nice, Charley.

511
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,333
Yeah, a man ought to hae
something to show he was here.

512
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,706
Be gone in another big storm.

513
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:27,338
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

514
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:31,180
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

515
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,583
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

516
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,621
than he was mine.

517
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,782
Be right to say some words.

518
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,420
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

519
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,589
I'll stand right here
and listen,

520
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:48,429
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

521
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,900
And I'll be holding a grudge

522
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,998
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

523
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,974
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

524
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,445
Woke with a smile.

525
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,148
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

526
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,991
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

527
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,028
whether it was or not.

528
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:20,789
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

529
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,630
I neer seen them.

530
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:27,330
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
een kill birds in the end.

531
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:31,842
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

532
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,538
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

533
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:36,047
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

534
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:39,676
I guess that means "amen."

535
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,110
God.

536
00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:07,112
BOSS:
Charley, you all right?

537
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:14,210
I'm fine.

538
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,253
Seems like you was, you know...

539
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,189
I said I'm fine.

540
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:24,128
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

541
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,126
You know, we neer asked
each other much.

542
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:32,069
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

543
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:35,301
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

544
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:40,403
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

545
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:44,649
Hey, Charley?

546
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:47,152
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

547
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,877
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

548
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:16,916
with our peashooters.

549
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:20,680
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

550
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,780
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

551
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:28,622
Killed my first man
in them woods.

552
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:33,189
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

553
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:37,100
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

554
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:42,197
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

555
00:45:43,643 --> 00:45:47,841
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

556
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,382
War was on.

557
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,941
They was only too happy
to hae me.

558
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:57,781
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

559
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:02,157
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

560
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:08,099
Must hae been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

561
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:10,796
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

562
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:15,537
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

563
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:18,076
so we could trael light
and on our own

564
00:46:18,144 --> 00:46:20,203
into enemy territory.

565
00:46:21,214 --> 00:46:25,913
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble whereer we could.

566
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:30,081
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

567
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:32,488
that weren't een in uniform.

568
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,529
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

569
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:40,625
After that, I come West.

570
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:45,264
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

571
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:48,830
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

572
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,940
Eery once in a while,
I almost get through a day

573
00:46:57,016 --> 00:47:01,646
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

574
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:13,456
He drifted off again.

575
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:17,094
No better, but no worse, either.

576
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,162
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

577
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,299
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

578
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,843
Not Button I'm talking about.

579
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:54,196
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

580
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:55,764
No, he's not here.

581
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:58,310
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

582
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,313
Here, put him
in the examining room.

583
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,089
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

584
00:48:19,165 --> 00:48:21,133
He hears real well
when he's awake.

585
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,363
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

586
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:26,928
It could mean a fractured skull.

587
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:32,141
Are you the boy's father?

588
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,508
No, ma'am.

589
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,174
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

590
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:40,151
It appears that's
not ery healthy.

591
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:44,121
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

592
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,817

[Thunder rumbling]

594
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,812
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

595
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:14,216
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

596
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,593
I hae to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

597
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,228
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

598
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:32,931
What about the feer?

599
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:37,033
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

600
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,635
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

601
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:43,944
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

602
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,279
Now, where's he at?

603
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:46,875
One of Dent Baxter's hands

604
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:48,944
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

605
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:52,480
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

606
00:49:57,363 --> 00:50:00,560
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

607
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,927
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

608
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:06,836
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

609
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:10,137
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

610
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:14,111
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

611
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,446
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

612
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:20,645
shot Button, left him for dead.

613
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,709
Oh.

614
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:27,117
Shot our dog.

615
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:31,620
I'll be getting money.

616
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,292
It's not necessary.

Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

Is that his real name?

620
00:50:51,984 --> 00:50:54,452
Please, sit.

621
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:59,886
Yeah, it's the only one
we'e known.

Yeah.

624
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:09,899
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

625
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:12,437
liing off café garbage.

626

Couldn't speak a word
of English.

627

a faor.

You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

631

People saw you ride in.

632

Don't intend to run.

634

We could wire
for the federal marshal.

635
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,562
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

636

With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

637

We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourseles.

What about Button?

Well, he's fighting
for his life.

640

If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

I'd be proud to buy you both

No need to make

for assaulting Baxter's men.

for attempted murder

to kill the boy

with none of you folks.

nothing about it.

You don't like free grazers
in this town.

to protect his property

and his life.

or his lawman take either.

here and now.

'cause if we ain't,

that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

right at the jail.

01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:57,827
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

802
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:59,564
How about I hold
your head underwater

803
01:03:59,638 --> 01:04:01,799
for just a little while?

804
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:14,175
BOSS:
I married once.

805
01:04:15,821 --> 01:04:18,085
Neer knowed that,
did you, Charley?

806
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:20,557
Had a wife and child.

807
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:21,957
Sweet little spread, too.

808
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:26,464
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

809
01:04:26,532 --> 01:04:29,092
Loed each other.

810
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:31,432
Neer had a cross word.

811
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:34,162
They caught the typhus
and died.

812
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,438
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

813
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:40,445
Beliee I'e changed
my mind on that

814
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:43,539
now that I'm getting on
in years.

815
01:04:48,787 --> 01:04:53,224
If Button lies
and we surie Baxter,

816
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:57,023
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

817
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:59,792
instead of the cold prairie.

818
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:09,807
Hae yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

819
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,866
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

820
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:12,933
Of course.

821
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:14,536
I know the way.

822
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:19,479
Whew.

823
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:32,397
Been riding with him 10 years.

824
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:34,762
Neer said nothing
about being married.

825
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:45,840
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

826
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:46,900
Don't rightly know.

827
01:05:46,979 --> 01:05:51,439
It... depends on circumstances.

828
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:53,917
You mean Marshal Poole?

829
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:56,454
We hae a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

830
01:05:56,522 --> 01:05:57,546
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

831
01:05:57,623 --> 01:06:00,558
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

832
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:03,754
Besides, it's a small town.

833
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:07,492
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

834
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:28,443
I'll take those.

835
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:31,253
You know where they go?

836
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:32,415
I saw.

837
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:34,220
Thank you.

838
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:39,121
Been raining like hell
eer since we got here.

839
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:42,725
Water washing right down
Main Street.

840
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:45,395
Charley saed a pup
from being washed away.

841
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:47,701
Looked a little like old Tig.

842
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:55,474
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

843
01:06:56,915 --> 01:07:00,510
'Cause I got something
important to say.

844
01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:05,285
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

845
01:07:05,357 --> 01:07:07,825
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

846
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:10,726
But you got
unfinished business here.

847
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:15,032
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

848
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,929
You come back.

849
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,075
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

850
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:28,170
No.

851
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:30,215
No, it's good.

852
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,780
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

853
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:37,185
Beliee I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

854
01:07:37,256 --> 01:07:40,623
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

855
01:07:40,693 --> 01:07:44,561
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

856
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,793
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

857
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:50,801
I mean sae your life and his.

858
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:53,099
He'll listen to you.

859
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:55,538
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

860
01:07:55,607 --> 01:07:58,804
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

861
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:02,773
I'll be paying you now
for whateer else Button needs.

862
01:08:02,848 --> 01:08:04,577
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

863
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,711
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

864
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:12,382
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you hae them.

865
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,949
Yes. Of course.

866
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:11,742
SUE:
Mr. Waite?

867
01:09:11,817 --> 01:09:13,717
Look at my face.

868
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:17,114
- Oh! Sorry!
- [Gun cocks]

869
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,384
[Gasping]
I'm sorry.

870
01:09:22,494 --> 01:09:23,984
It's all right, Charley.

871
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:26,189
Okay?
It just be us.

872
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:31,400
It's all right, Charley.

873
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,038
It's all right, Charley.

874
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:51,387
It's all right.
I'll get it.

875
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:18,212
Jumpy is all.

876
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:34,958
She ought not to sneak up
like that.

877
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,967
She weren't sneaking.

878
01:10:37,736 --> 01:10:39,761
I scared that woman
half to death.

879
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:41,897
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.

880
01:10:41,974 --> 01:10:43,498
[Chuckles]

881
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:45,702
Well, that's how it is, Boss.

882
01:10:45,777 --> 01:10:48,177
Ain't a pretty picture.

883
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:50,477
Got your wits about you now?

884
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:52,675
Yeah.

885
01:10:52,751 --> 01:10:53,683
Yeah.

886
01:10:53,752 --> 01:10:56,220
It weren't as bad as it looked.

887
01:10:56,288 --> 01:10:58,153
I'll bet.

888
01:11:09,234 --> 01:11:11,794
Go! Hyah!

889
01:11:37,296 --> 01:11:39,491
Two whiskeys, barkeep.

890
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:50,338
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.

891
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:55,672
You see that sign?

892
01:11:55,747 --> 01:11:59,376
Around these parts,
free grazers is the first.

893
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:12,553
[Glass shatters]

894
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:16,663
[Chuckles]

895
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:19,465
Now, he asked you twice.

896
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:21,699
Ain't gonna ask again.

897
01:12:24,242 --> 01:12:27,302
Hey, Bill, it's all right.

898
01:12:27,379 --> 01:12:29,404
These are the fellows
that saed my dog.

899
01:12:29,481 --> 01:12:32,712
I couldn't sere them
if they saed Jesus himself.

900
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:34,684
Mr. Baxter would hae my job.

901
01:12:34,753 --> 01:12:35,742
Baxter the owner?

902
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:37,152
That's right.

903
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:39,053
Gie me a bottle.
I'll sere them myself.

904
01:12:39,124 --> 01:12:40,614
You know I can't do that.

905
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:41,989
[Gun cocks]

906
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:54,602
Now we'll hae our drinks.

907
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:12,623
Beliee I'll hae me another.

908
01:13:14,993 --> 01:13:17,052
Yes.

909
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:26,537
Well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.

910
01:13:26,605 --> 01:13:27,469
Well, if it don't,

911
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:30,030
there'll be trout fishing
right on Main Street.

912
01:13:30,108 --> 01:13:32,474
[Both chuckling]

913
01:13:32,544 --> 01:13:35,707
I'd like you to meet my boys.

914
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:37,305
Ray and Cory.
