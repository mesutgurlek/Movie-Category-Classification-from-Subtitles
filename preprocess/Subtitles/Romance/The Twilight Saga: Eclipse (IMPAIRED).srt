00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,745
RENEE: Aren't you gonna miss this?

167
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,622
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

168
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,522
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

169
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,365
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

170
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,533
I'm just saying,
if you go to the University of Alaska,

171
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,634
I'm never gonna see you.

172
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:09,182
They have a really great science program.

173
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:11,910
You mean, Edward program?

174
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,048
The way he watches you,

175
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,088
it's like he's willing to leap in front
of you and take a bullet or something.

176
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,527
Is that a bad thing?

177
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:25,597
It's an intense thing.

178
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:28,827
You're different with him.

179
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:31,398
He moves, you move.

180
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,566
Like magnets.

181
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,775
I don't know, we're just...

182
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,712
RENEE: In love. I get it.

183
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,009
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

184
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,001
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

185
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,423
All right, enough with the heavy.

186
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,596
Mom.

187
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:04,503
Congraduation.

188
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,337
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

189
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,172
I didn't, come on.

190
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,124
(BOTH LAUGHING)

191
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:23,853
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:26,327
BELLA: Get out!
I saved them all.

193
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,422
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

194
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,468
Remember this one? Ensenada.

195
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,106
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

196
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:39,536
But this one is my favorite, here.

197
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,669
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

198
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,742
This is amazing.
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

199
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,305
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

200
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,680
have kids, we can add to it.

201
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,618
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

202
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:51,984
Thanks.

203
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,390
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:14:56,927 --> 00:15:00,363
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

205
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,764
Mom...
Yeah?

206
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,007
I miss you.

207
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,976
Honey, I miss you, too.

208
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,096
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

209
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,028
She's almost here.

210
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,047
On your left!

211
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,831
(GRUNTING)

212
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,243
Wait!

213
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,816
She's in their territory.

214
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,951
She'll get away!

215
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,217
No, she won't!

216
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,888
ESME: Emmett, no!

217
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,962
(GRUNTING)

218
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,637
(GROWLING)

219
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,692
Do you regret going?

220
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:49,961
No.

221
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,903
It was really great seeing my mom.

222
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,742
Just really hard saying goodbye.

223
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,205
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

224
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,407
Is that why you asked me to go?

225
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,382
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

226
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:07,281
I'm always hoping for that.

227
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,083
What?

228
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,425
If I asked you to stay
in the car, would you?

229
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,100
Of course not.

230
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:35,810
Hey.

231
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,417
Charlie said you left town.

232
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,883
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

233
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,587
He's checking to see if you're still human.

234
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:46,789
Look, I'm here to warn you.

235
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,657
If your kind come on our land again...

236
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,456
Wait, what?

237
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:55,326
You didn't tell her?

238
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:56,931
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

239
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Tell me what?

240
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:04,112
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

241
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,142
It's nothing to worry about.

242
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:07,545
JACOB: Listen to you.

243
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,744
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

244
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,547
You should just leave.

245
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,145
Now.

246
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,049
She has a right to know.

247
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:18,284
She is the one the redhead wants.

248
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,488
Victoria?

249
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,926
Alice's vision.

250
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,993
I was trying to protect you.

251
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:29,998
By lying to me.

252
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,771
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

253
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,971
You.

254
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,013
Why haven't you called me back?

255
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,519
I had nothing to say.

256
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,280
Well, I have tons. Hold on.
Hey.

257
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,591
Bella.

258
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,589
Edward, you have to trust me.

259
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,256
I do trust you.

260
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,298
It's him I don't trust.

261
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,913
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

262
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,007
Hold on tight.

263
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,985
♪ (JONATHAN LOW PLAYING) ♪

264
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,149
♪ Last born of the clan ♪

265

♪ Lived inside a house ♪

267
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,660
Are you sure this is a good idea?

268
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,704
I am the vampire girl, remember?

269
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,272
Hey, look who's back!

270
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,508
What up, Bella?

271
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,236
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

272
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,737
Finally made the pack.

273
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:43,336
EMBRY: I'm glad you're here, Bella.

274
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:46,075
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

275
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:47,241
"I wish Bella would call."

276
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,049
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

277
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,918
"Maybe I should call Bella."
"Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

278
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,184
(ALL LAUGHING)

279
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:55,385
All right, you can shut up now.

280
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:01,790
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

281
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,393
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

282
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:08,277
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

283
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,102
Fun, isn't she?

284
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:16,939
Bella, hi!
Hey.

285
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:20,115
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

286
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,549
BELLA: Yeah. Same here.

287
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,719
Sam, we good?

288
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:26,448
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

289
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,515
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

290
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:40,135
So when did Leah join the pack?

291
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:44,269
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

292
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,375
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

293
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:52,581
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

294
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,182
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

295
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,583
Come on, don't be such a guy.

296
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,125
No, it's not a chick thing.

297
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,291
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

298
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,525
We all have to live
the Leah Sam Emily pain-fest.

299
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,300
Wolf telepathy, remember?

300
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:14,131
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

301
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:18,675
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

302
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,004
But Emily was the one.

303
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:26,113
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

304
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:30,088
It's more than some crush, Bella.

305
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,317
Sam imprinted on Emily.

306
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,422
Do I even want to know what that is?

307
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:48,267
Imprinting on someone is like...

308
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,703
Like when you see her,

309
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,777
everything changes.

310
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:01,083
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

311
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,485
It's her.

312
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,256
Nothing else matters.

313
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,519
You would do anything,

314
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:12,860
be anything for her.

315
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,134
Sounds like you know the feeling.

316
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,307
Have you

317
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,381
imprinted on someone?

318
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:33,976
You'd know if I had.

319
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,185
I just have a direct
line to Sam's thoughts.

320
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,726
So for now you're

321
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:46,528
still you.

322
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,195
And you're still you.

323
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,533
Yeah.

324
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,377
Until graduation.

325
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,514
Graduation?

326
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,882
You knew this was gonna happen.

327
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,047
Not in a month!

328
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,495
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

329
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,556

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,201
For a second, just a second, I thought...

332
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,439
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

333
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,910
I decided this, not him.

334
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,347
Bella, they're not even alive.

335
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,909
It makes me sick.

336
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:43,387
Better you really be dead than one of them.

337
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,139
I can't believe you said that.

338
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:05,042
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

339
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:08,015
Bella, come on. Please.

340
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,348
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:26,392
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

342
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:28,459
I was just with Jake.

343
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,333
Oh.

344
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:32,900
Good.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

346
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,841
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

347
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,149
Hey.
Do you understand how worried I've been?

348
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,983
I was perfectly safe.

349
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:49,212
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

350
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:53,382
I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
No, something's wrong.

351
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,226
Edward, what's wrong?

352
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,291
Someone's been in here.

353
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,965
DR. CULLEN: Who was it?
Someone we know?

354
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:16,005
This stranger, I didn't
recognize his scent.

355
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,741
A nomad passing through?

356
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:19,815
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

357
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,188
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

358
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,957
Someone's orchestrating this.

359
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:28,391
Victoria?

360
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,619
I would have seen her decide.

361
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:31,955
Has to be the Volturi.

362
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:35,293
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

363
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,130
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

364
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:38,533
EMMETT: So we keep looking.

365
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:41,038
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

366
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,939
Another protection detail?

367
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:44,739
DR. CULLEN: Rosalie.

368
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:46,811
No, she's right.

369
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,716
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

370
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:53,547
And for Victoria.

371
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,280
And keep yourselves fed.

372
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,151
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

373
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,782
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

374
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:02,250
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

375
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:05,491
EDWARD: What?

376
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:15,603
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

377
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,040
It'll be hard to miss when we cross
it again. We'll handle it from here.

378
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:22,908
We don't need you to handle anything.

379
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,075
Or anyone.

380
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,811
I could care less what you need.

381
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,819
All right, we're done here.

382
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:29,855
No, you're done here.
BELLA: Stop!

383
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,182
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

384
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,462
BELLA: Edward hated the idea,

385
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,226
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

386
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:43,664
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

387
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:49,175
In the days that followed, I got them
to at least try to work together.

388
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,277
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

389
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:02,348
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

I'm good here. You should go.

393
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,408
I'm not gonna be gone long.

394
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:32,043
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

395
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,704
Maybe rush a little bit.

396
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,141

00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,820
So, what do you wanna do today?

00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,884
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

400
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,296
But we're going to a party tonight.

401
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,032
Are you sure this is okay?

402
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,934
I really hate being a party crasher.

403
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:27,035
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

404

You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

405

She took over for Harry when he died.

406
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,282
Okay, I should not be here.

407
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:40,479
You're okay. I thought...

408
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,288
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

409
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,919
The histories?

410
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:50,398
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

411
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:54,863
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

412
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:58,697
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

But you are the first outsider. Ever.

Hi.
Newest member of the pack.

Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

Okay.

424

The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

but we have always had magic in our blood.

We were great spirit warriors,

427
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:51,785
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

428
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,222
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

429
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,560
and protect our tribe.

430
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:06,167
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

431

It looked like a man,

432
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,975
but it was hard like stone

00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,615

but only fire would completely destroy it.

438
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:46,881

that the cold man was not alone.

Our elder chief, Taha Aki,

444
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:07,431

The third wife was no magical being,

449
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,790
with no special powers but one,

450
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:34,059

The third wife's sacrifice
distracted the cold woman

453
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:51,475
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

She saved the tribe.

But one remains,

And they've been created to fight someone.

492
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,896
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

493
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,436
DR. CULLEN: Regardless of why
they were made,

494
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:24,632
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

495
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:26,766
I'm surprised they've
let it go on this long.

496
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:28,276
Maybe they're behind it.

497
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:32,241
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

498
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,078
He wants me and Alice to join him,

499
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,313
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

500
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:40,048
An army could solve that for him.

501
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:49,858
Hey.

502
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,530
Did you eat dinner yet?

503
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:56,132
No, I haven't.

504
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,334
(CHARLIE SIGHS)

505
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:03,741
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

506
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,409
and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

507
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:11,978
You think they should just give up?

508
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:17,620
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

509
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,462
Not ever.

510
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:29,704
BELLA: I have to figure out
what to tell people.

511
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,536
Why I won't be home for Christmases,

512
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:36,372
and why I won't visit,

513
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:40,540
why they'll never see me again.

514
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:44,618
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

515
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:48,688
Problem solved.

516
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,389
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

517
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,527
I've told you.

518
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:03,335
Be honest with me.

519
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:06,109
There's more.

520
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:11,038
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

521
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,686
I've lived through it.

522
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:22,185
And to let you suffer that...

523
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:27,323
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

524
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:32,427
But to risk yours,

525
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:35,597
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

526
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:40,173
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

527
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:48,576
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

528
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:55,955
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

529
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:07,331
You'll always be my Bella.

530
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:31,585
My Bella, just less fragile.

531
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:44,668
BELLA: Gosh, it's so pretty here.

532
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,310
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

533
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:55,546
Which you're invited to.

534
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,922
Yeah, I figured that.

535
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,830
What?

536
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,332
I just wanted to do this differently.

537
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:18,074
Smoother.

538
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,580
But now I'm out of time.

539
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,214
Do what?

540
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:27,714
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

541
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:30,687
understand all your options.

542
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:34,022
And you need to know

543
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,826
that I'm in love with you,

544
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,326
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

545
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:46,566
I thought you understood.

546
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,878
I don't feel that way for you.
I don't buy it.

547
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:53,846
What don't you buy?

548
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:56,646
That's how I feel.

549
00:40:57,418 --> 00:41:00,979
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

550
00:41:02,323 --> 00:41:04,291
So I'm not giving up.

551
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:07,219
I'm gonna fight for you

552
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:12,726
until your heart stops beating.

553
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:14,830
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

554
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:17,201
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

555
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:18,864
No, I'm not.

556
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,072
I know what I want.

557
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:26,538
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

558
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:29,444
or say goodbye to anybody.

559
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,079
I can give you more than him.

560
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:38,321
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

561
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:41,126
Feel that?

562
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,360
Flesh and blood.

563
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,729
And warmth.

564

(GRUNTS)

565
00:41:58,547 --> 00:41:59,673
God!

566
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,578
God!

567
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:11,450
Edward!

568
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,791
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

569
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:15,854
Don't do this here!
She's not sure what she wants.

570
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:17,365
Don't do this here!
Let me give you a clue.

571
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,832
Wait for her to say the words.

572
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,165
Fine! And she will.

573
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,936
Jacob, just go, okay?

574
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:25,735
CHARLIE: Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

575
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,804
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

576
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:33,140
What's going on?

577
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,053
I kissed Bella.

578
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:44,091
And she broke her hand.

579
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:47,556
Punching my face.

580
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,165
Total misunderstanding.

581
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,203
DR. CULLEN: It's just a sprain.

582
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,533
It should heal fairly quickly.

583
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:02,478
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

584
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,803
I punched a werewolf in the face.

585
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,577
Bad ass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

586
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,483
Tough enough to take you on.

587
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:19,227
Don't worry about it.

588
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,091
Got any leads?

589
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:28,802
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

590
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,906
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

591
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,682
Okay...

592
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,190
Rosalie,

593
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:52,023
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

594
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,421
Hate...

595
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,660
I don't hate you.

596
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,704
I don't particularly like you, but...

597
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,371
Bella, I envy you.

598
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,643
What?

599
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,249
That's ridiculous.
No, it's not.

600
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,955
You have a choice.

601
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,690
I didn't.

602
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:25,255
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

603
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,266
I don't care
how miserable your human life is.

604
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,763
My life is not miserable.

605
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:39,206
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

606
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,077
Mine was.

607
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,680
Absolutely perfect.

608
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:47,316
There were things I still wanted,

609
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,010
to be married, with a nice house

610
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,284
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home,

611
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:54,784
a family of my own.

612
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:59,095
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor
in town.

613
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,030
I barely knew him.

614
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:10,264
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

615
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:15,302
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

616
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:16,872
I wasn't far from home.

617
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,645
There she is.

618
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:19,742
Hey, Rose!

619
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,120
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

620
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,651
Hey, come over here.

621
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:28,424
We've been waiting for you.

622
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,990
There she is.

623
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,094

00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:37,298
You're drunk.

626
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,862
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

627
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,465
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

628
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:45,071
What do you say, Rose?

629
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:47,885
Why don't we take off a few layers?
Stop it, stop it.

630
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:50,016
Stop. Stop!

631
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,850
I'll see you tomorrow.

632
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,251
Sober.

633
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,155
Hey, where do you think you're going?

634
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:00,624
I said, get... Come back... Hey!
Stop! Stop! Get off me!

635
00:46:00,693 --> 00:46:02,661
You'll do as I say!
Let go of me! Stop!

636
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:05,062
Stop! Let go! Stop!

637
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:10,794
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

638
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,105
Believe me, I wanted to be.

639
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,936
Carlisle found me. He
smelled all the blood.

640
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:20,209
Thought he was helping me.
I'm sorry.

641
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,281
I got my revenge on them.

642
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,448
One at a time.

643
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,620
Saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

He'll teach us how to defeat them.

They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

782

They're a great deal stronger than us

783

because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

than in our first several
months of this life.

Carlisle's right. That's
why they are created.

like a human army,

but no human army
could stand against them.

to remember are, first,

00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:25,057
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

791
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,683
And second,

792
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:30,692
never go for the obvious kill.

793
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,429

Some of you are gonna get hurt.

815
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:27,775
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

816
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:33,985
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?

(GRUNTING)

818
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:58,114
Done for the day.

819
01:00:11,295 --> 01:00:12,592
Jasper?

820
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:18,664
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

821
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:22,262
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

822
01:00:22,339 --> 01:00:26,366
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

823
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,971
Good. I'm glad.

824
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:35,482
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

825
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:41,548
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

826
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:51,197
Those bites are like mine.
Battle scars.

827
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:56,200
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

828
01:00:56,274 --> 01:00:58,742
was useless against the newborns.

829
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,343
Still, I never lost a fight.

830
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:11,278
This happened during the Civil War?

831
01:01:11,356 --> 01:01:14,086
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

832
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:16,854
all without having seen any real battle.

833
01:01:16,928 --> 01:01:18,088
Until?

834
01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:21,963
Till I met a certain immortal.

835
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,367
Maria.

836
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,504
I was riding back to Galveston

837
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:33,203
after evacuating a column
of women and children

838
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:35,240
when I saw them.

839
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:38,211
I immediately offered them my aid.

840
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:48,693
Lovely. And an officer.

(HORSE WHINNYING)

842
01:01:56,268 --> 01:02:00,898
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

843
01:02:04,443 --> 01:02:08,174
What's your name, soldier?
Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

844
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:10,911
I hope you survive.

845
01:02:12,017 --> 01:02:14,645
You may be of great use to me.

846
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,765
Maria was creating an army?
They were very common in the South.

847
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:27,527
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

848
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:29,897
Maria won them all.

849
01:02:31,104 --> 01:02:35,734
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

(GRUNTING)

851
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:40,809
I was her second in command.

852
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:44,373
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

853
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:47,653
I trained her newborns,

(BOTH GRUNTING)

an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

856
01:02:58,598 --> 01:03:01,066
It was my job to dispose of them.

857
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:24,089
I could feel everything they felt.

(GROANING)

859
01:03:37,037 --> 01:03:39,801
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

860
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,939
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

861
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:49,015
I didn't know there was another way

862
01:03:51,418 --> 01:03:53,215
till I found Alice.

863
01:03:55,022 --> 01:03:57,354
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

864
01:03:57,825 --> 01:03:59,918
You kept me waiting long enough.

865
01:04:03,865 --> 01:04:05,560
My apologies, ma'am.

866
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:09,867
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

if she wanted to make an army.

If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep
you as far away from the fight as possible.

885

Jasper said that I could be of help.
We won't need your help.

With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

888

Okay. Either it's so dangerous
that I have to hide

889
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,807
or it's so easy that you're gonna
be sidelined. Which is it?

It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

891
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:41,986
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

892
01:06:43,027 --> 01:06:47,760
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

but it needs to end here.

Edward and I are going to a campsite.

904
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,504
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

905
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:31,543
Your stench, however, is revolting.

Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

907
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:37,407
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:41,309
Done.
This is not a good idea.

909

Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

912
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:06,670
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

913
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:08,873
Or don't you care about my safety?

914
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:14,787
Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
I won't have a choice, anyways.

915

Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

Since you let Sam be alpha?

It has nothing to do with imprinting.

01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:04,464
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:07,733
And I know you feel something for me.

till you asked.

You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

I don't know.

971
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:17,462
I doubt that.

972
01:12:17,493 --> 01:12:19,933
And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat
you to it like 10 years ago.

973
01:12:20,013 --> 01:12:21,913
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

974
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,452
I'm sure things work the same way.

975
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:28,352
All right, so...

976
01:12:30,323 --> 01:12:32,757
You guys are taking precautions and...

977
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,889
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

978
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:39,998
Edward is old school.

979
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:46,002
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

980
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,695
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

981
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:53,113
Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

982
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:58,992
Virgin.

983
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,958
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

984
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:15,992
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

985
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:18,571
Nothing.

986
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:41,053
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

987
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:47,823
It's really pretty.

988
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:50,086
Thanks.

989
01:13:58,322 --> 01:13:59,812
There's a bed.

990
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:03,435
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

991
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:08,412
I think an air mattress
would have sufficed.

992
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:11,529
Is this too much?
No.

993
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:14,340
No, it's perfect.

994
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:19,353
I wanna ask you something.
Anything.

995
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,103
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

996
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,024
Yes.

997
01:14:33,854 --> 01:14:36,915
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

998
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:41,437
Anything you want. It's yours.

999
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,087
You promise?

1000
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,592
Yeah.

1001
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:52,613
Okay.

1002
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:00,645
Hey.

1003
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,698
Bella.

1004
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:12,901
No.

1005
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,578
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

1006
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:18,772
Not ones that will risk killing you.
You won't.

1007
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:24,047
And everyone says once I'm changed all
I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1008
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:28,587
That part doesn't last forever.
I want you.

1009
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:35,361
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1010
01:15:39,663 --> 01:15:45,193
It's too dangerous.
Try. Just try.

1011
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:52,088
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

1012
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,362
I'll marry you. Just try.

I just want to be married to you first.

You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1028
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:29,710
trying to steal your virtue or something.

1029
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:34,317
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1030
01:17:36,516 --> 01:17:38,177
Are you kidding?

1031
01:17:38,712 --> 01:17:42,739
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1032
01:17:45,217 --> 01:17:48,948
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1033
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:52,819
I know that's not a modern notion.

1034
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:56,080
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1035
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,169
I'm from a different era.

1036
01:18:03,563 --> 01:18:07,090
Things were a lot less complicated.

1037
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:13,825
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1038
01:18:16,102 --> 01:18:21,267
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1039
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:34,333
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1040
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:40,785
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1041
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:44,253
I would have got down on one knee,

1042
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:54,239
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1043
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:02,264
This was my mother's.

1044
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:11,543
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1045
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:16,378
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1046
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,732

You're not coming with us?

It'll be a last minute decision.

1050
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:06,006
I told you how it works.
The Cullens have powers.

1051
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:11,826
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1052
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:17,945
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

1053

According to your friend?
Yes.

My dead friend.

Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

1056
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,464
and they killed him.

1057
01:20:37,478 --> 01:20:39,673
But not before he told me.

1058
01:20:44,818 --> 01:20:46,649
Maybe he was wrong.

1059
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:56,117
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

We've been tearing it up

You don't trust me.

1062
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:09,723
With my life. I'm just saying...
I'm doing this for us.

1063
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:14,817
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1064

I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

I won't let them.

I swear.

1068
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:51,282
I love you so much.

1069
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:13,306
You're going overboard.

01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,469
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1071
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:18,775
The new borns'll be frantic.

1072

It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

It doesn't bother me anymore.

1074
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,084
Since when?

1075
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:32,584
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1076
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,460
You're not wearing your ring.

1077
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:40,333
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1078
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:43,694
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1079
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:50,845
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

If you're having second thoughts...
I'm not.

Nobody's I hope.

Yeah, I can feel it.

No, I'm staying.

Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

What?

01:27:38,441 --> 01:27:41,103
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:44,871
Nice.

1114
01:27:46,015 --> 01:27:51,351
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1115

Look.

1116
01:27:58,094 --> 01:28:00,961
I know she's in love with you.
Good.

1117
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,963
But she's in love with me, too.

1118
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:08,727
She just won't admit it to herself.

1119
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:14,175
I can't tell if you're right.

1120
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:17,169
Then let me ask you something.

1121
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:20,977
If she chooses me...
She won't.

1122

If she did,

1123
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,019
would you try to kill me?

1124
01:28:27,658 --> 01:28:29,751
That's an intriguing idea.

1125
01:28:34,665 --> 01:28:37,793
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1126
01:28:38,935 --> 01:28:41,699
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1127
01:28:42,506 --> 01:28:45,407
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1128
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:48,367
So stop her.
I tried.

1129
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,910
I left.
But you gave up too quickly.

1130
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:59,754
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1131
01:29:00,524 --> 01:29:01,855
Trust me.

1132
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,195
You have to consider that I might
be better for her than you are.

1133
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:12,801
I have considered that.

1134
01:29:16,507 --> 01:29:18,668
I know you can protect her.

1135
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:26,147
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1136
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,378
But I'm not...

1137
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:34,721
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1138
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:40,494
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1139
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,234
Yeah. That I remember.

1140
01:29:49,474 --> 01:29:51,738
When you thought she was gone,

1141
01:29:54,078 --> 01:29:55,841
that you'd lost her,

1142
01:29:58,349 --> 01:30:01,250
how did you cope?

1143
01:30:03,254 --> 01:30:05,052
There are no words.

1144
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:13,530
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1145
01:30:16,268 --> 01:30:19,795
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1146
01:30:20,672 --> 01:30:21,969
Meaning,

1147
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:25,977
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1148
01:30:29,114 --> 01:30:31,412
If we weren't natural enemies

1149
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,885
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1150
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,382
I might actually like you.

1151
01:30:39,424 --> 01:30:40,721
Well,

1152
01:30:42,294 --> 01:30:46,492
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1153
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:48,730
I might...

1154
01:30:55,809 --> 01:30:58,869
No. Not even then.

1155
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:10,519
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1156
01:31:17,297 --> 01:31:18,662
Then I'd let her go.

1157
01:31:38,818 --> 01:31:40,410
Right. Hey, Seth.

1158
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,559
Where's Jacob? Did he already...
Not yet.

1159
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:52,195
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1160
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:02,867
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1161
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,302
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1162
01:32:07,381 --> 01:32:11,511
You have a list?
All 10 I spent with you.

1163
01:32:12,953 --> 01:32:17,322
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1164
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:25,063
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1165
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,358
You're marrying him?
Jake, I...

1166
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:37,200
You knew he was listening!
He deserves to know.

1167
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,138
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1168
01:32:40,248 --> 01:32:41,374
Don't!

1169
01:32:44,452 --> 01:32:45,510
Jake, stop!

1170
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:52,648
BELLA: Jake, please!
I'm done! I'm so done!

1171
01:32:53,895 --> 01:32:55,123
What can I do?

1172
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:59,394
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1173
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:02,061
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1174
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,932
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1175
01:33:05,006 --> 01:33:07,440
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1176
01:33:09,344 --> 01:33:10,538
Why?

1177
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:14,109
Give me one good reason.

1178
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,184
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1179
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,186
It's not good enough.

1180
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,455
Because you're too important.

1181
01:33:26,896 --> 01:33:30,388
Still not good enough.
Jacob!

1182
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:35,899
Kiss me.

1183
01:33:39,275 --> 01:33:42,733
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1184
01:34:30,527 --> 01:34:33,155
That should have been our first kiss.

1185
01:34:38,769 --> 01:34:40,168
I gotta go.

1186
01:34:43,106 --> 01:34:44,505
I'll be back.

1187
01:35:14,739 --> 01:35:18,140
You saw.
No, but...

1188
01:35:19,143 --> 01:35:20,906
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1189
01:35:22,447 --> 01:35:23,971
I don't know what happened.

1190
01:35:25,983 --> 01:35:27,416
You love him.

1191
01:35:31,823 --> 01:35:33,620
I love you more.

1192
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:36,724

Seth, go.

She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1207
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,683
She knew you'd be with me.

1208

She knows I'll kill you.

1213
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:51,188
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1214
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:56,229
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1215

I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

VICTORIA: He's lying.

1217

She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

That's the only thing she cares about.

There's only you. You know that.

01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:28,675
DR. CULLEN: Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1287
01:46:28,926 --> 01:46:30,046
they would have stopped her.

1288
01:46:31,313 --> 01:46:32,610
Isn't that right, Jane?

1289
01:46:35,009 --> 01:46:36,499
Of course.

1290
01:46:37,948 --> 01:46:39,006
Felix.

1291
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:41,727
She didn't know what she was doing.

1292
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:46,027
We'll take responsibility for her.

1293
01:46:46,778 --> 01:46:48,405
Give her a chance.

1294
01:46:51,066 --> 01:46:56,265
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1295
01:46:57,532 --> 01:47:00,399
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1296
01:47:00,823 --> 01:47:02,916
The date is set.

1297
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:08,863
Take care of that, Felix.
I'd like to go home.

1298
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,808
(SCREAMING)

1299
01:47:37,296 --> 01:47:38,786
Hey.
(JACOB SCREAMING)

1300
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:48,062
It's been going on for a while.
EMBRY: Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1301
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,971
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1302
01:47:50,042 --> 01:47:51,566
Give it a rest, Leah.

1303
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,982
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1304
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:02,180
I gave him some morphine,

1305
01:48:02,255 --> 01:48:04,587
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1306
01:48:04,657 --> 01:48:06,716
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1307
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,693
Thank you.

1308
01:48:18,638 --> 01:48:19,832
He's asking for you.

1309
01:48:35,154 --> 01:48:36,212
Hey, Jake.

1310
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:41,054
Hey.

1311
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:57,741
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?

1312
01:48:59,513 --> 01:49:01,105
Yeah.

1313
01:49:02,116 --> 01:49:04,914
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1314
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:11,046
Was he hard on you?
He wasn't even mad at me.

1315
01:49:12,293 --> 01:49:13,453
Or you.

1316
01:49:14,962 --> 01:49:16,452
Well, damn.

1317
01:49:18,966 --> 01:49:22,925
He's better than I thought.
He's not playing a game.

1318
01:49:25,472 --> 01:49:26,734
Right.

1319
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:31,574
Bella.

1320
01:49:34,882 --> 01:49:37,716
He's not as perfect as you think.

1321
01:49:41,256 --> 01:49:42,951
I know who he is.

1322
01:49:47,295 --> 01:49:49,695
Can we just not talk about that?

1323
01:49:50,899 --> 01:49:53,959
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1324
01:50:00,075 --> 01:50:02,908
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1325
01:50:06,748 --> 01:50:10,081
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1326
01:50:13,521 --> 01:50:16,547
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1327
01:50:24,766 --> 01:50:27,702
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1328
01:50:30,206 --> 01:50:34,870
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1329
01:50:40,883 --> 01:50:43,181
You know I love you.

1330
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:52,860
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1331
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,900
Should I come back?

1332
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:10,806
I need some time.

1333
01:51:15,519 --> 01:51:17,612
But I'll always be waiting.

1334
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:25,657
Until my heart stops beating.

1335
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:28,962
Maybe even then.

1336
01:51:52,055 --> 01:51:56,355
August 13th?
Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1337
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,054
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1338
01:52:00,864 --> 01:52:02,984
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1339
01:52:03,768 --> 01:52:05,463
I'm sure she can.

1340
01:52:07,839 --> 01:52:09,500
There's no rush.

1341
01:52:12,076 --> 01:52:15,273
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1342
01:52:16,247 --> 01:52:19,705
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1343
01:52:20,051 --> 01:52:24,545
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1344
01:52:24,622 --> 01:52:27,420
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1345
01:52:29,427 --> 01:52:30,985
Does it matter?

1346
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,534
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1347
01:52:37,602 --> 01:52:40,799
What? The wedding?
No.

1348
01:52:43,774 --> 01:52:46,607
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1349
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:50,105
but you're already giving
away too much.

1350
01:52:51,048 --> 01:52:52,539
You're wrong.

1351
01:53:00,559 --> 01:53:03,926
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1352
01:53:07,766 --> 01:53:11,862
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1353
01:53:15,574 --> 01:53:20,568
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1354
01:53:23,749 --> 01:53:25,649
I've never felt normal.

1355
01:53:28,187 --> 01:53:30,121
Because I'm not normal.

1356
01:53:31,356 --> 01:53:33,017
I don't want to be.

1357
01:53:34,526 --> 01:53:39,759
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1358
01:53:41,134 --> 01:53:44,297
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1359
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:50,306
and more real, more myself.

1360
01:53:53,046 --> 01:53:55,207
Because it's my world, too.

1361
01:53:58,451 --> 01:54:00,214
It's where I belong.

1362
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,221
So it's not just about me?

1363
01:54:11,464 --> 01:54:14,490
No. Sorry.

1364
01:54:16,869 --> 01:54:21,932
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1365
01:54:23,309 --> 01:54:27,712
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1366
01:54:32,052 --> 01:54:33,610
Starting with a wedding.

1367
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:39,290
Actually,

1368
01:54:40,194 --> 01:54:45,154
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1369
01:54:50,904 --> 01:54:52,337
We have to tell Charlie.

1370
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,772
It's highly dangerous.

1371
01:54:58,846 --> 01:55:01,007
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1372
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:04,607
I'm gonna need that ring.
