1
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,398
(Gasping)

2
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:38,438
(Gunshot)

3
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,676
(Policeman) Give me your hand!

4
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,126
Give me your hand!

5
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,880
(Screams)

6
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,361
(Gentle classical)

7
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:53,281
Ouch! Ouch!

8
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:57,605
- I thought you said no more pains.
- It's this corset, it binds.

9
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:01,322
No three-way stretch? How very un-chic.

10
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, you know those police department
doctors, no sense of style.

11
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:10,121
- Anyway, tomorrow will be the day.
- Why, what's tomorrow?

12
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:13,125
Tomorrow?
The corset comes off tomorrow.

13
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:18,400
I'll be able to scratch myself, I'll throw
this miserable thing out the window.

14
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,120
Be a free... free man.

15
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,965
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

16
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,362
- Mm, more than you think.
- Really?

17
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,285
You know that
from personal experience?

18
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:33,479
Please. What happens after tomorrow?

19
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,997
- What do you mean?
- Well, what are you going to do?

20
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:41,677
- Once you quit the police force.
- You sound so disapproving.

21
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:45,242
No, it's your life. But you were
the bright young lawyer

22
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:48,359
that decided he was going
to be chief of police someday.

23
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,523
- I had to quit.
- Why?

24
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,242
Because of this fear of heights I have,
this acrophobia.

25
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,236
I wake up at nights seeing that man fall
from the roof and I try to reach out and...

26
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:03,360
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's what everybody tells me.

27
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:07,286
- Johnnie, the doctors explained...
- I know, I know.

28
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:11,479
I have acrophobia
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

29
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,995
Boy... what a moment to find out I had it.

30
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:18,438
Well, there's no losing it.
There's no one to blame, so why quit?

31
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,718
You mean sit behind a desk?
Chairborne.

32
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,760
- Where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia? What...?

33
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:28,799
Suppose I'm sitting
in this chair behind the desk

34
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,283
and a pencil falls to the floor,
I reach down to pick it up,

35
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:36,843
- bingo, my acrophobia's back.
- Oh, Johnnie-o.

36
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:38,878
Well, what'll you do?

37
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:41,964
I'm not going to do anything for a while.

38
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm a man of independent means,
as the saying goes.

39
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,720
- Fairly independent.
- Mm.

40
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:52,476
- Why don't you go away for a while?
- You mean to forget?

41
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:57,078
Oh, Midge, don't be so motherly.
I'm not going to crack up.

42
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:59,687
Have you had any dizzy spells
this week?

43
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,036
I'm having one right now.

44
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,079
The music, don't you think it's sort of...

45
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,118
Oh.

46
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,518
What's this doohickey?

47
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,078
It's a brassiere.

48
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:17,119
You know about those things,
you're a big boy now.

49
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,635
I've never run across one like that.

50
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:24,715
It's brand-new. Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps

51
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,486
but it does everything
a brassiere should do.

52
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,325
It works like a cantilever bridge.

53
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,164
It does?

54
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,438
Aircraft engineer down the peninsula
designed it,

55
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,478
worked it out in his spare time.

56
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,518
Kind of a hobby.

57
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,479
Oh. A do-it-yourself type thing.

58
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:46,518
How's your love life, Midge?

59
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,365
That's following a train of thought.

60
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,686
Well...

61
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,843
Normal.

62
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,196
Aren't you ever gonna get married?

63
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,807
You know there's only one man for me.

64
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,838
You mean me.

65
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,481
We were engaged once, weren't we?

66
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,759
- Three whole weeks.
- Good old college days.

67
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:11,117
You were the one
that called off the engagement.

68
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,716
I'm still available. Available Ferguson.

69
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:18,885
Do you remember a fellow in college
called Gavin Elster?

70
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,999
- Gavin Elster?
- Yes, funny name.

71
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,038
You'd think I would. No.

72
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:29,246
I had a call from Gavin today.
Funny, we lost touch during the war.

73
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,881
Somebody said he went east.
I guess he's back.

74
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,963
It's a Mission number.

75
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,682
- That's skid row, isn't it?
- Could be.

76
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:41,242
He's probably on the bum
and wants the price of a drink.

77
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,075
I'll buy him a couple of drinks
and tell him my troubles.

78
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:48,437
But not tonight,
how about we go out for a beer?

79
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,797
- Sorry, old man, work.
- I think I'll go home.

80
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:58,683
Midge, what did you mean,
''there's no losing it''?

81
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:02,800
- What?
- The, er, the acrophobia.

82
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:07,284
I asked my doctor, he said only another
emotional shock could do it,

83
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,238
and probably wouldn't.

84
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,847
Don't dive off another rooftop
to find out.

85
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,878
I think I can lick it.

86
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,600
- How?
- I have a theory.

87
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:21,198
I think if I can get used to heights,
just a little bit at a time.

88
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:26,037
Just a little like that.
Progressively. I'll show you what I mean.

89
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:29,045
Here. I'll show you what I mean.

90
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,317
- We'll start with this.
- That?

91
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,518
You want me to start
with the Golden Gate Bridge?

92
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,365
Watch this. Here we go.

93
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:41,683
There. There.

94
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:45,402
Now, I look up, I look down.

95
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:47,403
I look up...

96
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:51,235
- You're kidding. Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it!

97
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:54,040
- Here.
- Oh, that's a girl.

98
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:56,476
We'll use that. Put it right there.

99
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:02,360
All right. Here's the first step. There.

100
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,319
OK, now step number two.

101
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,517
All right, step number two coming up.

102
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:15,437
There we are.
See, I look up, I look down. I look up...

103
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm going to buy myself
a tall stepladder.

104
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,324
- Take it easy.
- All right, here we go.

105
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,958
No problem.

106
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:32,482
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down.

107
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,360
I look up, I look down.

108
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,277
Oh, Johnnie, Johnnie.

109
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:06,162
How did you get
in the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

110
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,198
I married into it.

111
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:13,286
- Very interesting business.
- To be honest, I find it dull.

112
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't have to do it for a living.

113
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,720
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

114
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:23,716
My wife's family has all gone,
someone has to look after her interests.

115
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:28,522
Her father's partner runs
the company yard in the east - Baltimore.

116
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:33,083
So I decided, as long as
I had to work at it, I'd come back here.

117
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,676
- I've always liked it here.
- How long have you been back?

118
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,446
- Almost a year.
- You like it, huh?

119
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:42,479
Well, San Francisco's changed.

120
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:46,679
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

121
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:53,606
- Like all these?
- I should like to have lived here then.

122
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,481
Colour, excitement, power, freedom.

123
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:03,004
- Er, shouldn't you be sitting down?
- No, I'm all right.

124
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,403
I was sorry to read about
that thing in the paper.

125
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:10,918
And you've quit the force,
is it a permanent physical disability?

126
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:16,280
No. No, it just means I can't climb
steep stairs or go to high places,

127
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,397
like the bar at the Top of the Mark.

128
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,122
But there are street-level bars
in this town.

129
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,761
Would you like a drink now?

130
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:27,800
No, I don't think so,
it's a little early in the day for me.

131
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,883
Well, I guess that just about
covers everything.

132
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,999
I never married,
I don't see much of the old college gang,

133
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,598
I'm a retired detective
and you're in the shipbuilding business.

134
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,997
What's on your mind, Gavin?

135
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:49,598
I asked you here, Scottie,
knowing you'd quit detective work,

136
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:54,482
but I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favour to me.

137
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:57,837
I want you to follow my wife.
No, it's not that.

138
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,640
- We're very happily married.
- Well, then...

139
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:04,123
- I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
- From whom?

140
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,362
Someone dead.

141
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:14,205
Scottie, do you believe that someone
out of the past, someone dead,

142
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,603
can enter and take possession
of a living being?

143
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,444
No.

144
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,958
If I told you I believed this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

145
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:28,000
I'd say take her to the nearest
psychiatrist or psychologist

146
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:32,643
or neurologist
or maybe just the plain family doctor.

147
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,155
I'd have him check on you too.

148
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:38,597
Then you're of no use to me,
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

149
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:41,962
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.

150
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,123
OK.

151
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,443
I, er... I didn't mean to be that rough.

152
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,921
It sounds idiotic, I know.

153
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,323
You're still the hard-headed Scot,
aren't you?

154
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,437
Always were.

155
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:58,001
- You think I'm making it up?
- No.

156
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,926
I'm not making it up,
I wouldn't know how.

157
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,765
She'll be talking to me about something

158
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,924
and suddenly the words fade
into silence,

159
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,357
a cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

160
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:17,806
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

161
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,441
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.

162
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,797
Then, with a long sigh, she's back.

163
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:26,122
Looks at me brightly.

164
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:30,319
Doesn't even know she's been away,
can't tell me where or when.

165
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,518
Well... how often does this happen?

166
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,956
More and more in the past few weeks.

167
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:39,966
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

168
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:44,444
I followed her one day, watched her
coming out of the apartment.

169
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:48,685
Someone I didn't know,
she even walked a different way.

170
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:53,560
Got into her car
and drove out to Golden Gate Park,

171
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,598
five miles.

172
00:14:55,647 --> 00:15:00,801
Sat by the lake, staring across the water
at the pillars on the far shore,

173
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,315
you know, the Portals of the Past.

174
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,165
Sat there a long time without moving.

175
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,596
I had to leave, get back to the office.

176
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:11,878
When I got home,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

177
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:16,523
She said she'd driven to Golden Gate
Park and sat by the lake, that's all.

178
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,842
Well?

179
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,357
The speedometer on her car showed
she'd driven 94 miles.

180
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,160
Where did she go?

181
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:32,722
I've got to know where she goes and
what she does, before I involve doctors.

182
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,282
- Have you talked to doctors?
- Yes, but carefully.

183
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:40,240
I want to know more before
committing her to that kind of care.

184
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,757
OK, I'll get a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

185
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,560
- They're dependable.
- I want you.

186
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,757
Look, this isn't my line.

187
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:53,835
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust. I'm in a panic.

188
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,880
I'm supposed to be retired,
I don't want to get mixed up in this.

189
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,078
We're going to an opening
at the opera tonight,

190
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,118
we're dining at Ernie's first.

191
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,476
You can see her there.

192
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,518
Ernie's.

193
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:18,476
(lndistinct chatter)

194
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,998
(lnaudible)

195
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,758
(Church organ)

196
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,398
(Bell tolls)

197
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,364
(Mouths)

198
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,083
Will you tell me something?

199
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,802
That lady, who's the woman
in the painting she's looking at?

200
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:18,238
That's Carlotta. You'll find it
in the catalogue. Portrait Of Carlotta.

201
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,243
- May I have this?
- Yes.

202
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,278
Thank you.

203
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,118
(Starts engine)

204
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,565
(Woman) Yes?

205
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,956
Is there something I can do for you?

206
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:24,157
- You run this hotel?
- Oh, yes.

207
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:27,597
Who has the room on
the second floor in the corner?

208
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:29,478
That corner.

209
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:33,042
Oh, we couldn't give out
information of that sort.

210
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,124
Our clients are entitled their privacy.

211
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,364
And I do believe it's against the law.

212
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:43,366
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind really but still, I...

213
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:46,921
Oh, dear. Has she done
something wrong?

214
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:48,958
Please answer my question.

215
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,477
- I can't imagine that sweet girl...
- What's her name?

216
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:55,644
Valdes. Miss Valdes. Spanish, you know.

217
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,076
- Carlotta Valdes?
- That's it.

218
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,800
Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign but sweet.

219
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,964
- How long has she had the room?
- It must be two weeks.

220
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,804
Her rent's due tomorrow.

221
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:09,203
- Does she sleep here ever?
- No. She just comes to sit,

222
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,044
two or three times a week.

223
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:14,796
I don't ask questions,
as long as they're well behaved.

224
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:18,556
- I must say...
- Don't tell her I've been here.

225
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,916
But she hasn't been here today.

226
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,356
I saw her come in five minutes ago.

227
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:25,875
No, she hasn't been here at all.

228
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:28,725
I would've seen her -
I've been here all the time,

229
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,964
putting olive oil
on my rubber plant leaves.

230
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:37,518
There. There, you see.
Her key is on the rack.

231
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,717
Would you please go up and look?

232
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,678
- To her room?
- That's right.

233
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,718
Of course, if you ask.

234
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:47,759
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

235
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,962
Oh, Mr Detective?

236
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:12,439
Would you like to come and look?

237
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,476
- Her car's gone.
- What car?

238
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:16,480
Midge... who do you know that's
an authority on San Francisco history?

239
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,519
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.

240
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:23,958
Not, ''Hello, you look wonderful,'' just,
''Who do you know that's an authority... ''

241
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,282
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

242
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:29,763
Well, who do you?
You know everybody.

243
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:34,244
- Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
- I don't mean that kind of history.

244
00:31:34,287 --> 00:31:38,439
I mean the small stuff,
people you never heard of.

245
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:43,561
Oh. You mean the Gay Old Bohemian
Days of Gay Old San Francisco.

246
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:48,397
Juicy stories like who shot who
in the Embarcadero in August 1879?

247
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:50,438
- That's right.
- Pop Leibel.

248
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,478
- Who?
- Pop Leibel.

249
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,997
He owns the Argosy Book Shop.
What do you want to know?

250
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,881
Who shot who in the Embarcadero
in August 1879.

251
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:04,205
Wait a minute, you're not a detective
any more, what's going on?

252
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,238
- You know him well?
- Who?

253
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:09,120
- Pop Leibel.
- Oh, sure.

254
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:13,001
Let's go. I want you to introduce me.
Get your hat.

255
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:15,038
I don't need a hat.

256
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,563
Hey, Johnnie, what's it all about?

257
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:24,125
Hey! Wait a minute!

258
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:35,440
Oh, yes. I remember. Carlotta.

259
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,478
The beautiful Carlotta.

260
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,677
The sad Carlotta.

261
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:45,164
What does an old house on Eddy
and Gough Street have to do with her?

262
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:49,519
It was hers. It was built for her
many years ago.

263
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,161
- By whom?
- By, er...

264
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:55,721
By, er... Hm.

265
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,799
No. The name I do not remember.

266
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:03,760
A rich man, a powerful man. Cigarette?

267
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,798
- No, thank you.
- Cigarette, miss?

268
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:08,077
No, thank you.

269
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:10,482
It is not an unusual story.

270
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:15,645
She came from somewhere small
to the south of the city.

271
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:22,160
Some say from a mission settlement.
Young, yes. Very young.

272
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:28,998
She was found dancing and singing
in cabaret by that man.

273
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:34,360
And he took her and built for her
the great house

274
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:36,398
in the Western Addition.

275
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,517
And, er...

276
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,797
There was a... There was a child.

277
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,999
Yes, that's it, a child. A child.

278
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:50,686
I cannot tell you exactly
how much time passed

279
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,878
or how much happiness there was.

280
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:56,725
But, then - he threw her away.

281
00:33:56,767 --> 00:34:00,442
He had no other children,
his wife had no children.

282
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:04,480
So, he kept the child and threw her away.

283
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,199
You know, a man could do that
in those days.

284
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,807
They had the power and the freedom.

285
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,805
And she became the sad Carlotta,

286
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,236
alone in the great house,

287
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,562
walking the streets alone,

288
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:26,203
her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

289
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:31,402
And the mad Carlotta,

290
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,883
stopping people in the streets to ask,

291
00:34:35,927 --> 00:34:38,725
''Where is my child?

292
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,997
''Have you seen my child? ''

293
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,959
- Poor thing.
- And she died?

294
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:47,805
- She died.
- How?

295
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:51,044
By her own hand. Hm!

296
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,518
There are many such stories.

297
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:57,525
- Thank you, Mr Leibel.
- You are welcome.

298
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:00,240
- I appreciate it.
- You're welcome. Bye.

299
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:03,279
Wait a minute.
Goodbye, Pop, thanks a lot.

300
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:12,756
- Now then, pay me.
- For what?

301
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:16,880
- For bringing you here. Come on, tell.
- There's nothing to tell.

302
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:19,202
Tell or you'll be back in that corset.

303
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,238
Come on, I'll take you home.

304
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,878
- Here you are.
- You haven't told me everything.

305
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:37,124
- I've told you enough.
- Who's the guy, who's the wife?

306
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,761
- Out! I've got things to do.
- I know...

307
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:43,004
- the one that phoned, Elster.
- Out, please?

308
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:47,325
The idea is that the beautiful Carlotta
has come back from the dead

309
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,961
and taken possession of Elster's wife.

310
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,804
Johnnie, really, come on!

311
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:55,203
I'm not telling you what I think
but what he thinks.

312
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:58,045
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

313
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,521
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

314
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,161
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

315
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:08,835
Yes, I guess you'd consider
that she would... You could...

316
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,879
I think I'll go take a look at that portrait.
Goodbye.

317
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,724
- Midge...
- Goodbye!

318
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,758
Midge! You...

319
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:46,526
You've done well.
You're good at your job.

320
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:51,038
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There were things you didn't tell me.

321
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:55,524
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- You knew about this.

322
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,161
You notice the way she does her hair?

323
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:00,880
There's something else -
my wife Madeleine

324
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,476
has several pieces of jewellery
that belonged to Carlotta.

325
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,324
She inherited them.

326
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,165
Never wore them,
they were too old-fashioned.

327
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,004
Until now.

328
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:14,801
Now, when she's alone,
she takes them out and looks at them.

329
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,407
Handles them, gently, curiously.

330
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,837
Puts them on
and stares at herself in the mirror.

331
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:26,005
Then goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

332
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:30,643
Carlotta Valdes was what,
your wife's... grandmother?

333
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,484
Great-grandmother.

334
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,518
The child who was taken from her,

335
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,445
whose loss drove Carlotta mad
and to her death,

336
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:39,478
was Madeleine's grandmother.

337
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:43,486
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdes home.

338
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:48,726
I think that explains it. Anyone could
become obsessed with the past

339
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,758
with a background like that.

340
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,639
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.

341
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:57,759
She knows nothing of a grave
at the Mission Dolores,

342
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,923
or that old house on Eddy Street,

343
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:03,516
the portrait at
the Palace of the Legion of...?

344
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:06,286
- Nothing.
- When she goes to these places...

345
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,682
She's no longer my wife.

346
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,525
How do you know
all these things she doesn't?

347
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:15,445
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

348
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,478
I dug out the rest here.

349
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:20,883
- Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
- Natural fear.

350
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:24,966
Her grandmother went insane
and took her own life.

351
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:27,396
Her blood is in Madeleine.

352
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:35,118
Boy, I need this.

353
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,997
(Ship's horn blows in distance)

354
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,124
Madeleine.

355
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,158
Madeleine?

356
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:41,126
(Muttering) Where is my child...

357
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:54,526
(Phone)

358
00:42:57,487 --> 00:43:00,047
Yes?

359
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:04,157
No, it's all right. I'll call you back.

360
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,486
Yes.

361
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:09,326
Yes.

362
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,562
Are you all right?

363
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:15,757
Oh. Oh, you'll, er...

364
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,798
You'll want this.

365
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:56,282
You better come over here by the fire
where it's warm.

366
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:02,438
What am I doing here?

367
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:05,478
What happened?

368
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:10,641
Well, you... fell into San Francisco Bay.

369
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,366
I had to dry your hair as best I could.

370
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:19,195
Your things are in the kitchen,
they'll be dry in a few minutes.

371
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:21,317
Come on over by the fire.

372
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:32,282
Here, I'll give you some cushions.

373
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:37,277
There you are.

374
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:47,245
Would you like to have some coffee?

375
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:52,436
You'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink?

376
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,282
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?

377
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,045
That's right.

378
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:04,318
- Thank you.
- You don't remember?

379
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,198
No, I...

380
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,442
Do you remember where you were?

381
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:15,919
Yes. Yes, of course I remember that.

382
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:21,239
Then I must have had
a dizzy spell and fainted.

383
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:23,926
Where were you?

384
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:27,562
At Old Fort Point, out at the Presidio.

385
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:31,115
Of course I remember. I often go there.

386
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:33,522
Why? Why do you go there?

387
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:39,687
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there, especially at sunset.

388
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:46,520
- Thank you for the fire.
- Where were you before?

389
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:49,081
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

390
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:54,880
- Wandering about.
- I know, but where were you just before?

391
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,163
Downtown, shopping.

392
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,316
Here, you better have some coffee.

393
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,562
I think it's still warm.

394
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:10,316
You're terribly direct in your questions.

395
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,439
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

396
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,241
You're not. You're merely direct.

397
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:22,482
What were you doing at Old Fort Point?

398
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:27,006
Oh, just wandering about.

399
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,277
- You like it too?
- Yes.

400
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,278
Where had you been just before?

401
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:36,684
I'd been to the Palace of
the Legion of Honor, the art gallery.

402
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,958
Oh, yes. That's a lovely spot, isn't it?

403
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:44,398
I've never been inside
but it looks so lovely driving past.

404
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:53,885
It's lucky for me you were
wandering about. Thank you.

405
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:57,806
- I've been a terrible bother to you.
- No, you haven't.

406
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,206
Oh... When you, um...

407
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:08,238
There were some pins in my hair?

408
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,597
Oh, the pins?
Yeah, right in here, I'll get 'em for you.

409
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,842
And my purse, please.

410
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,796
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

411
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:27,883
- You shouldn't have brought me here.
- I didn't know where you lived.

412
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:32,925
You could've looked in my car. But then
you didn't know my car, did you?

413
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,765
I knew which one it was -
it's outside now -

414
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:39,436
but I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home in that way.

415
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:42,559
You're right. I'm glad you didn't
take me home,

416
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:45,360
I wouldn't have known you. Thank you.

417
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:50,036
But we don't know each other.
My name is Madeleine Elster.

418
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:53,284
- My name is John Ferguson.
- Good strong name.

419
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:58,081
- Your friends call you John or Jack?
- John, mostly.

420
00:47:58,127 --> 00:48:01,802
Old friends call me John,
acquaintances call me Scottie.

421
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:06,682
- I shall call you Mr Ferguson.
- Oh, gee whizz, I wouldn't like that.

422
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:10,720
After this afternoon,
I should think you'd call me Scottie,

423
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:12,758
maybe even John.

424
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,002
Well, I prefer John.

425
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:20,957
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

426
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:25,677
- Wander about.
- That's a good occupation.

427
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:27,718
And you live here, alone?

428
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:32,555
- One shouldn't live alone.
- Some people prefer it.

429
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:35,598
No, it's wrong.

430
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,761
I'm married, you know.

431
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:48,125
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?

432
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:52,323
- What?
- Falling into San Francisco Bay?

433
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:55,524
Oh.

434
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:57,637
No, it's never happened before.

435
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:01,521
I've fallen into lakes
out of rowboats as a little girl.

436
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:06,038
I fell into the river once,
trying to leap from one stone to another.

437
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:10,437
But I've never fallen into
San Francisco Bay.

438
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:15,686
- Have you ever before?
- No, it's the first time for me too.

439
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:21,118
- Here, I'll get you some more coffee.
- (Phone)

440
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,886
- Hello?
- (Gavin) 'Scottie, she's not home yet.'

441
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:41,205
No, she's all right.
She's here, I'll bring her home soon.

442
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:44,239
- 'What happened? '
- She went into the Bay.

443
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:47,724
Hello?

444
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:51,362
- 'Did she hurt herself? '
- No, she'll be in fine shape.

445
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:54,126
But she doesn't know -
do you understand that? - 

446
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,362
she doesn't know what happened.

447
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:02,199
- 'Scottie, Madeleine is 26.'
- (Door opens)

448
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:05,683
'Carlotta Valdes committed suicide
when she was 26.'

449
00:50:05,727 --> 00:50:09,276
- (Door closes)
- Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

450
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:40,565
Well now, Johnnie-o, was it a ghost?

451
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,598
Was it fun?

452
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:08,398
Is that for me?

453
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:15,795
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

454
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:19,840
I worried about you last night,
you shouldn't have run off that way.

455
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:21,843
I suddenly felt such a fool.

456
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:23,684
I wanted to drive you home.

457
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:27,276
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. No aftereffects.

458
00:53:28,807 --> 00:53:32,163
- The water was cold, wasn't it?
- It sure was.

459
00:53:32,207 --> 00:53:36,564
What a terrible thing for me to do.
You were so kind.

460
00:53:37,607 --> 00:53:40,724
It's a formal thank you note,
and a big apology.

461
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:43,804
- You've nothing to apologise for.
- Yes, I do.

462
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:46,520
It must've been so embarrassing for you.

463
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,797
Not at all, I enjoyed...

464
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:52,118
talking to you.

465
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:56,042
Well, I enjoyed talking to you.

466
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,163
Well, I'll get my mail.

467
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:06,837
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

468
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:11,920
I couldn't mail it,
I didn't know your address.

469
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,801
But I had a landmark - Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

470
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:19,044
First time I've been grateful
for Coit Tower.

471
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:25,047
- I hope we will too.
- What?

472
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:27,999
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

473
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:32,998
Goodbye.

474
00:54:47,887 --> 00:54:50,959
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I don't know.

475
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,998
- Shopping?
- No.

476
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:56,005
Well, anywhere in particular?

477
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:58,038
No, I just thought I'd wander.

478
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,965
Oh... That's what I was going to do.

479
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:06,520
Oh, yes, that's right.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

480
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:09,081
Don't you think it's a waste for us...

481
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:11,516
- To wander separately?
- Uh-huh.

482
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:15,560
Only one is a wanderer, two together
are always going somewhere.

483
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:18,679
No, I don't think that's necessarily true.

484
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,081
You've left your door open.

485
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:24,118
Be right back.

486
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:08,799
(Madeleine) How old?
(Scottie) Oh, some 2,000 years or more.

487
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:11,236
- The oldest living things.
- Yes.

488
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,120
- You've never been here before?
- No.

489
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,317
What are you thinking?

490
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:21,883
Of all the people who've been born and
have died when the trees went on living.

491
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:24,316
Their true name is
Sequoia sempervirens,

492
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:26,483
always green, ever-living.

493
00:56:26,527 --> 00:56:29,246
- I don't like them.
- Why?

494
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:31,482
Knowing I have to die...

495
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:50,724
Here's a cross section of one of
the old trees that's been cut down.

496
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:18,679
Somewhere in here I was born,

497
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:23,086
and there I died.

498
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:27,325
It was only a moment for you,
you took no notice.

499
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,718
Madeleine.

500
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:22,644
Madeleine.

501
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:25,882
Madeleine, where are you now?

502
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:28,918
- Here with you.
- Where?

503
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:33,164
- Tall trees...
- Have you been here before?

504
00:58:33,207 --> 00:58:35,198
- Yes.
- When?

505
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:38,756
When were you born?

506
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,243
- Long ago.
- Where? When?

507
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,847
- Tell me. Madeleine, tell me.
- No.

508
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:47,685
Where do you go, what takes you away?

509
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:51,117
You didn't know where you were
when you jumped in the Bay.

510
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:53,237
I didn't jump, I fell - you told me.

511
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,482
- Why did you jump?
- I can't tell you.

512
00:58:55,527 --> 00:58:57,916
- What told you to jump?
- No, please...

513
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,764
What? What?

514
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:02,719
Please don't ask me.
Please don't ask me!

515
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,758
Take me away from here.

516
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,002
Shall I take you home?

517
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:11,637
Somewhere in the light.

518
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:16,044
Promise me something, promise
you won't ask me again. Please.

519
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:50,443
Why did you run?

520
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,717
I'm responsible for you now.

521
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:55,964
The Chinese say that
once you've saved a person's life

522
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:59,204
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

523
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:01,363
I have to know.

524
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,398
There's so little that I know.

525
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:12,802
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor that...

526
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:15,838
that once was mirrored.

527
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:18,321
Fragments of that mirror still hang there

528
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:22,042
and when I come to
the end of the corridor,

529
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:24,282
there's nothing but darkness.

530
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:29,283
And I know that when I walk
into the darkness...

531
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:32,958
that I'll die.

532
01:00:34,247 --> 01:00:38,877
But I've never come to the end,
I've always come back before then.

533
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,918
- Except once.
- Yesterday?

534
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:45,722
And you didn't know what happened
until you found yourself with me.

535
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,758
You didn't know where you were.

536
01:00:47,807 --> 01:00:51,277
But the fragments of the mirror,
you remember those?

537
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,557
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

538
01:00:53,607 --> 01:00:56,041
There's a room...

539
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:59,557
and I sit there alone, always alone.

540
01:00:59,607 --> 01:01:01,598
- What else?
- A grave.

541
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:04,400
- Where?
- I don't know.

542
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:06,438
It's an open grave and I...

543
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:10,639
I stand by the gravestone
looking down into it.

544
01:01:10,687 --> 01:01:12,086
It's my grave.

545
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,721
- How do you know?
- I know.

546
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:17,156
Is there a name on the gravestone?

547
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:19,402
No.

548
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:23,281
No, it's new and... clean and waiting.

549
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:26,398
What else?

550
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:29,041
This part is dream, I think. There...

551
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,883
There's a tower and a bell,
and a garden below.

552
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:39,726
It seems to be in Spain,
a village in Spain.

553
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,962
It clicks off and it's gone.

554
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:44,362
Well... a portrait?

555
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:46,716
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

556
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:52,000
If I could just find the key,
the beginning, and put it together.

557
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:54,197
And so explain it away?

558
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:58,239
There is a way to explain it, you see.

559
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:02,121
If I'm mad, then that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

560
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,358
Madeleine!

561
01:02:10,007 --> 01:02:12,123
Oh, Scottie!

562
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:15,125
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die!

563
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:19,603
There's someone within me
and she says I must die.

564
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,162
- Scottie, don't let me go.
- I'm here.

565
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:26,199
- I've got you.
- I'm so afraid.

566
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:40,638
- Don't leave me, stay with me.
- All the time.

567
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:52,123
(Chuckling)

568
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:55,362
(Door opening)

569
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,041
- Hi, Johnnie.
- Hi.

570
01:03:09,087 --> 01:03:12,124
- Did you get my message?
- I did, indeed.

571
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:16,038
- I'll get you a drink.
- OK.

572
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:20,126
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

573
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,681
Since I can't get them on the phone.

574
01:03:22,727 --> 01:03:26,117
For a man with nothing to do,
you're certainly busy.

575
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:29,762
- Where do you go these days?
- Just wandering.

576
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:34,045
- Where?
- Round about.

577
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:40,920
What was this... what was
this desperate urge to see me?

578
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:43,959
All I said in my note was,
''Where are you? ''

579
01:03:44,007 --> 01:03:46,475
That doesn't sound very desperate.

580
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,041
I detected a little undercurrent.

581
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:54,206
Well, I thought if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner,

582
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,238
you'd take me to a movie.

583
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,517
That's fair enough.

584
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:02,560
- What will we talk about at dinner?
- This and that.

585
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:06,399
- What I've been doing?
- If you want to.

586
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:09,837
Naturally, we won't talk about anything
you don't want to.

587
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,605
Naturally.

588
01:04:14,407 --> 01:04:16,523
What have you been doing?

589
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,558
Wandering.

590
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,199
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

591
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:26,477
I've been having a wonderful time.

592
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:29,121
I've gone back to my first love, painting.

593
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:33,718
Good, I said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

594
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:36,998
That's a living
but I'm really excited about this.

595
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,356
What is it? Still life?

596
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,716
No, not exactly.

597
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:45,281
- You want to see?
- Mm. Yeah.

598
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:49,115
As a matter of fact,
I thought I might give it to you.

599
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:02,404
Johnnie...

600
01:05:02,447 --> 01:05:04,642
It's not funny, Midge.

601
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:07,281
- Johnnie?
- No.

602
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,319
- Johnnie, I just thought...
- Uh-uh.

603
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:12,483
Oh, er...

604
01:05:12,527 --> 01:05:15,519
Let's make that movie some other night.

605
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:24,278
Johnnie?

606
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,765
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!

607
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:32,798
Idiot!

608
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:42,798
Stupid! Stupid!

609
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:05,998
(Buzzer)

610
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,478
(Buzzer continues)

611
01:06:19,807 --> 01:06:24,005
- Madeleine. What's the matter?
- I should've phoned you but...

612
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:27,164
- I wanted to be with you.
- Why, what's happened?

613
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:30,165
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.

614
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:32,402
You're going to be all right.

615
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:36,235
You'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you some brandy.

616
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:39,279
Drink this down, just like medicine.

617
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,122
- (Coughs)
- There, now.

618
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:47,080
It was a dream, you're awake.
You're all right now.

619
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:49,721
Now, can you tell me?

620
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:53,965
It was the tower again and the bell
and the old Spanish village.

621
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:57,363
- Yes?
- So very clear for the first time. All of it.

622
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,398
Tell me.

623
01:06:59,447 --> 01:07:02,041
It was a village square, a green with trees

624
01:07:02,087 --> 01:07:05,716
and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

625
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:08,645
Across the green
was a big, grey wooden house

626
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:11,326
with a porch, shutters and a balcony.

627
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:15,076
Next to it was a livery stable,
with old carriages inside.

628
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:16,924
Go on.

629
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:21,802
At the end of the green was a stone
house with a pepper tree at the corner...

630
01:07:21,847 --> 01:07:24,725
And a wooden hotel
from the old California days?

631
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:29,477
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings
with hanging oil lamps?

632
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:31,279
Yes.

633
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:34,797
It's all there. It's no dream.

634
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:39,679
You've been there before, you've seen it.

635
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:44,439
- No, never!
- 100 miles south of San Francisco,

636
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:47,763
there's an old Spanish mission,
San Juan Bautista.

637
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:51,402
It's been preserved as it was
100 years ago as a museum.

638
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,598
Now think hard, darling. Think hard.

639
01:07:54,647 --> 01:07:56,797
You've been there, you've seen it.

640
01:07:56,847 --> 01:08:00,203
No, I've never been there.
What is it, Scottie?

641
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:03,523
Go on about your dream.
What was it that frightened you?

642
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:07,480
I stood alone on the green
searching for something.

643
01:08:07,527 --> 01:08:09,995
Then I started to walk to the church...

644
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:14,357
then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark.

645
01:08:15,687 --> 01:08:20,317
Being pulled into the darkness.
I've got to wake up.

646
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:23,484
You're going to be
all right now, Madeleine.

647
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:26,280
You've given me
something to work on now.

648
01:08:26,327 --> 01:08:30,798
I'll take you to that mission and you'll
remember when you saw it before.

649
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,681
It'll finish your dream, destroy it,
I promise you.

650
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:36,718
All right?

651
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:40,477
Come on, I'll take you home.

652
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:42,518
I'll be all right.

653
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,206
You'll come back here around noon.

654
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:03,643
Madeleine? Where are you now?

655
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:08,560
- Here with you.
- And it's all real!

656
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:12,885
Not merely as it was 100 years ago,
or a year ago, or six months ago,

657
01:10:12,927 --> 01:10:15,760
or whenever it was
you were here to see it.

658
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,116
Think of when you were here.

659
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,765
There were not so many carriages then.

660
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,446
There were horses in the stalls.

661
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,842
A bay, two black and a grey.

662
01:10:31,767 --> 01:10:33,962
It was our favourite place.

663
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:37,926
But we were forbidden to play here,

664
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,562
Sister Teresa would scold us.

665
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,044
Look at this.

666
01:10:47,087 --> 01:10:49,078
Here's your grey horse.

667
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:54,365
Have a little trouble getting
in and out of the stall but even so.

668
01:10:54,407 --> 01:10:57,205
You see, there's an answer
for everything.

669
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:02,843
Madeleine...

670
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,957
try.

671
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,838
Try for me.

672
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,845
- I love you, Madeleine.
- I love you too.

673
01:11:32,887 --> 01:11:35,606
- Too late...
- No, we're together.

674
01:11:35,647 --> 01:11:38,559
It's too late.
There's something I must do.

675
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:41,360
No, there's nothing you must do.

676
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:43,602
There's nothing you must do.

677
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:48,639
No one possesses you,
you're safe with me.

678
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,638
No, it's too late.

679
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:12,241
Look, it's not fair,
it shouldn't have happened this way.

680
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,926
It had to happen, we're in love.

681
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:18,084
- Let me go!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

682
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:25,596
- Do you believe I love you?
- Yes.

683
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:32,003
And if you lose me, you'll know I loved
you and I wanted to go on loving you.

684
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,322
I won't lose you.

685
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:39,000
- Let me go into the church. Alone.
- But why?

686
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:01,206
Madeleine!

687
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:05,400
Madeleine!

688
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,121
Madeleine!

689
01:13:49,087 --> 01:13:50,520
(Madeleine screams)

690
01:15:19,487 --> 01:15:24,959
(Man) Mr Elster, suspecting that all
was not well with his wife's mental state,

691
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:29,637
took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr Ferguson,

692
01:15:29,687 --> 01:15:31,803
lest any harm befall her.

693
01:15:31,847 --> 01:15:36,557
As you have heard, Mr Elster was
prepared to take his wife to an institution

694
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:41,601
where her mental health would have
been in the hands of specialists.

695
01:15:41,647 --> 01:15:44,002
Mr Ferguson, being an ex-detective,

696
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:48,245
would have seemed the proper choice
as watchdog and protector.

697
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:51,324
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

698
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:55,246
However, you'll agree no blame
can be attached to the husband.

699
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:59,075
His delay in putting his wife under
medical care was due to the need

700
01:15:59,127 --> 01:16:03,917
for information as to her behaviour,
which he expected from Mr Ferguson.

701
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,686
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife,

702
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:11,118
he could not have known
that Mr Ferguson's fear of heights

703
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,318
would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

704
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:16,961
As to Mr Ferguson.

705
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:19,396
You have heard his former superior,

706
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:23,486
Detective Captain Hansen
from that great city to the north,

707
01:16:23,527 --> 01:16:28,681
testify as to his character and ability -
he was most enthusiastic.

708
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:32,197
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances,

709
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:36,320
Mr Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death,

710
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:40,360
Captain Hansen dismissed
as an unfortunate incident.

711
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:46,403
Mr Ferguson is to be congratulated upon
having saved the woman's life,

712
01:16:46,447 --> 01:16:50,838
when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

713
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:55,403
It is a pity that,
knowing her suicidal tendencies,

714
01:16:55,447 --> 01:16:58,644
he did not make
a greater effort the second time.

715
01:17:01,127 --> 01:17:05,518
But we are not here to pass judgment
on Mr Ferguson's lack of initiative.

716
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,364
He did nothing.

717
01:17:07,407 --> 01:17:10,604
The law has little to say
on things left undone.

718
01:17:10,647 --> 01:17:16,677
Nor does his strange behaviour
after he saw the body fall

719
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:18,922
have any bearing on your verdict.

720
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:23,676
He did not remain
at the scene of the death - he left.

721
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:27,356
He claims he suffered a blackout
and knew nothing more

722
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:31,958
until he found himself back
in his apartment several hours later.

723
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:34,805
You may accept that, or not.

724
01:17:36,207 --> 01:17:40,200
Or you may believe that having
once again allowed someone to die,

725
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:45,605
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness, and ran away.

726
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:50,799
That has nothing to do with your verdict.

727
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:55,238
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

728
01:17:55,287 --> 01:18:00,486
Now, from the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her death,

729
01:18:00,527 --> 01:18:02,518
from the manner of her death,

730
01:18:02,567 --> 01:18:06,321
and from the postmortem
showing the cause of her death,

731
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:10,406
you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict, gentlemen.

732
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:12,642
You may retire if you wish.

733
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:39,765
- We've reached a verdict.
- Thank you.

734
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:45,844
The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide

735
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,117
while of unsound mind.

736
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:51,876
The verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

737
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:00,365
- Let's go.
- Do you mind if I speak with him?

738
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:03,399
- No, go ahead.
- Scottie.

739
01:19:07,927 --> 01:19:12,717
Sorry, Scottie, that was rough.
He had no right to speak to you like that.

740
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:17,079
It was my responsibility,
I... shouldn't have got you involved.

741
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,766
There's nothing you have to say to me.

742
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,402
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.
I can't stay here.

743
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:27,837
I'm going to wind up
her affairs, and mine,

744
01:19:27,887 --> 01:19:30,321
and get away as far as I can.

745
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:32,562
Europe, perhaps.

746
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,041
I probably never will come back.

747
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:38,078
Goodbye, Scottie.

748
01:19:39,127 --> 01:19:42,756
If there's anything I can do
for you before I go.

749
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:46,241
There's no way for them to understand.

750
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,881
You and I know who killed Madeleine.

751
01:19:57,127 --> 01:19:59,880
Come on, Scottie, let's get out of here.

752
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:01,924
(Gentle classical)

753
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:03,958
It's Mozart.

754
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:06,043
Wolfgang Amadeus.

755
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:10,204
I had a long talk with that lady
in musical therapy.

756
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:12,761
She says that Mozart's the boy for you.

757
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:16,083
The broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

758
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:19,483
Well, it's what the lady said.

759
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:25,963
It's wonderful how
they have it all taped now.

760
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:30,319
They have music for dipsomaniacs
and music for melancholiacs

761
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:33,325
and music for hypochondriacs.

762
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:38,202
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up?

763
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:49,917
I brought a lot of other things,
you can see what you like.

764
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:52,561
It shuts off automatically.

765
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:03,882
Oh, Johnnie. Johnnie, please try.
Try, Johnnie.

766
01:23:04,927 --> 01:23:07,919
You're not lost. Mother's here.

767
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:11,399
(Door opens)

768
01:23:11,447 --> 01:23:13,165
(Midge) Time?

769
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:14,799
OK.

770
01:23:14,847 --> 01:23:16,599
(Door closes)

771
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:19,002
I'll be in again, Johnnie.

772
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:21,038
Want me to shut that off?

773
01:23:41,207 --> 01:23:43,277
Oh, Johnn-o...

774
01:23:43,327 --> 01:23:46,160
you don't even know I'm here, do you?

775
01:23:49,247 --> 01:23:51,238
But I'm here.

776
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:07,205
Nurse, could I see
the doctor for a moment?

777
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:10,238
Doctor, Miss Wood.

778
01:24:11,367 --> 01:24:13,278
Won't you go in, please?

779
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:16,124
Yes, Miss Wood?

780
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:20,126
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

781
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:23,398
It's hard to say. At least six months,
perhaps a year.

782
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:26,917
- It really could depend on him.
- He won't talk.

783
01:24:26,967 --> 01:24:30,277
No. He's suffering
from acute melancholia,

784
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:32,363
together with a guilt complex.

785
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:35,399
He blames himself for
the woman's death...

786
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:38,086
we know little of what went on before.

787
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:41,642
I can give you one thing.
He was in love with her.

788
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:44,485
Oh, that does complicate the problem.

789
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:48,281
I can give you another complication -
he still is.

790
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:50,602
You want to know something, Doctor?

791
01:24:50,647 --> 01:24:53,639
I don't think Mozart's gonna help at all.

792
01:26:20,567 --> 01:26:23,604
- Where did you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?

793
01:26:23,647 --> 01:26:26,241
I bought it from a man
who used to live here.

794
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:29,836
Mr Gavin Elster. I bought it from him
when he moved away.

795
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:32,526
Oh, you knew him? And his wife?

796
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:37,083
The poor thing - I didn't know her.
Is it true that she really...

797
01:26:37,127 --> 01:26:39,118
I'm... l'm sorry.

798
01:26:58,687 --> 01:27:01,076
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

799
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:27,758
Give me a Scotch and soda.

800
01:28:07,927 --> 01:28:10,521
(Chattering)

801
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:03,755
- Well? What is it?
- Could I ask you some questions?

802
01:30:03,807 --> 01:30:06,958
- What for? Who are you?
- My name's John Ferguson.

803
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:10,317
- Is this some kind of Gallup poll?
- Oh, no.

804
01:30:10,367 --> 01:30:13,165
- Just a couple of things...
- You live here?

805
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,564
- I happened to see you as you came in.
- I thought so, a pick-up.

806
01:30:17,607 --> 01:30:21,122
You've got a nerve!
Following me right up to my room.

807
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:24,398
- Now, you beat it!
- Please, I just want to talk to you.

808
01:30:24,447 --> 01:30:29,567
- Listen, I'm gonna yell in a minute.
- I'm not going to hurt you.

809
01:30:29,607 --> 01:30:32,804
Please. Just let me talk to you.

810
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:35,202
- What about?
- You.

811
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:38,045
- Why?
- Because you remind me of somebody.

812
01:30:39,207 --> 01:30:44,235
I heard that one before too. I remind you
of someone you were in love with

813
01:30:44,287 --> 01:30:46,755
but she ditched you for another guy

814
01:30:46,807 --> 01:30:49,367
and you've been
carrying a torch ever since.

815
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:53,320
Then you saw me
and something clicked.

816
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:57,201
- You're not far wrong.
- It's not gonna work, so you better go.

817
01:30:57,247 --> 01:30:59,238
Please, let me come in.

818
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:04,077
You can leave the door open,
I just want to talk to you. Please.

819
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,085
Well, I warn you - I can yell awful loud.

820
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:11,482
You won't have to.

821
01:31:11,527 --> 01:31:16,282
Well... You don't look
very much like Jack the Ripper.

822
01:31:16,327 --> 01:31:18,522
- What do you want to know?
- Your name.

823
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:20,558
- Judy Barton.
- And who you are.

824
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:23,360
- I work at Magnin's.
- How come you're living here?

825
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:27,525
- It's a place to live, that's all.
- But you've not been here long?

826
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:30,001
- Yeah, about three years.
- And before?

827
01:31:30,047 --> 01:31:32,038
Salina, Kansas.

828
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,317
What is this? What do you want?

829
01:31:35,367 --> 01:31:39,076
- I just want to know who you are.
- Well, I told you.

830
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:44,803
My name is Judy Barton,
I come from Salina, Kansas,

831
01:31:44,847 --> 01:31:47,156
I work at Magnin's and I live here.

832
01:31:48,527 --> 01:31:51,200
My gosh, do I have to prove it?

833
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:59,482
All right, mister -
my Kansas driver's licence.

834
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:06,080
Judy Barton, number Z296794.
425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.

835
01:32:09,407 --> 01:32:13,241
See the address on this one?
It's this place, right here.

836
01:32:13,287 --> 01:32:17,200
A California licence,
issued May 25th, 1954.

837
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:22,197
You wanna check my thumbprints?
Are you satisfied?

838
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:27,240
And whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

839
01:32:30,767 --> 01:32:33,759
Gee, you have got it bad, haven't you?

840
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,162
Do I really look like her?

841
01:32:42,567 --> 01:32:45,127
She's... She's dead, isn't she?

842
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:52,444
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I yelled at you.

843
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:01,842
That's me with my mother.

844
01:33:02,887 --> 01:33:05,765
And that's my father. He's dead.

845
01:33:05,807 --> 01:33:08,799
My mother married again
but I didn't like the guy,

846
01:33:08,847 --> 01:33:13,318
so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

847
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:15,927
I've been here three years.

848
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,958
Honest.

849
01:33:26,487 --> 01:33:29,285
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Why?

850
01:33:30,007 --> 01:33:33,522
- I feel I owe you something after...
- You don't owe me.

851
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:36,684
- Then, will you, for me?
- Dinner and what else?

852
01:33:36,727 --> 01:33:38,718
Just dinner.

853
01:33:38,767 --> 01:33:40,758
Because I remind you of her?

854
01:33:40,807 --> 01:33:43,480
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.

855
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:47,518
Well...

856
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:49,842
I've been on blind dates before.

857
01:33:49,887 --> 01:33:52,481
Matter of fact,
I've been picked up before.

858
01:33:55,127 --> 01:33:58,244
- OK.
- I'll get my car. Be back in half an hour.

859
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:01,085
Oh, no, you better
give me time to change.

860
01:34:01,127 --> 01:34:02,924
An hour?

861
01:34:02,967 --> 01:34:04,241
- Uh-huh.
- OK.

862
01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:56,358
'Dearest Scottie...

863
01:35:56,407 --> 01:35:58,284
'and so you've found me.

864
01:35:58,327 --> 01:36:01,524
'This is the moment
that I dreaded and hoped for,

865
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:05,116
'wondering what I would say and do
if I ever saw you again.

866
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:08,239

867

868

'I want you to have peace of mind,
you've nothing to blame yourself for.

869
01:36:15,607 --> 01:36:18,246
'I was the tool, and you were the victim

870

'of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.

871

'He chose me to play the part

01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:30,445
'Lt was quite safe because she lived in
the country and rarely came to town.

the witness to a suicide.

885
01:39:25,807 --> 01:39:27,798
Here, I'll do it.

886
01:39:28,847 --> 01:39:31,600
- There you are.
- Thanks again.

887
01:39:31,647 --> 01:39:34,366
- Good night.
- Can I see you tomorrow?

888
01:39:34,407 --> 01:39:36,398
Tomorrow night? Well...

889
01:39:36,447 --> 01:39:38,517
No, I mean tomorrow morning.

890
01:39:40,527 --> 01:39:44,236
- But I have to go to work, I've got a job.
- Don't go to your job.

891
01:39:44,287 --> 01:39:47,006
What will I live on, my oil wells in Texas?

892
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:49,242
Let me take care of you, Judy.

893
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:53,687
Thanks very much, but no thanks.

894
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:57,917
- You don't understand...
- I understand all right.

895
01:39:57,967 --> 01:40:00,845
I've been understanding since I was 17.

896
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:03,720
- And the next step is?
- No, no. No, no.

897
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:05,564
No? Then what?

898
01:40:06,327 --> 01:40:09,444
We could just... see a lot of each other.

899
01:40:10,887 --> 01:40:13,117
Why?

900
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:15,556
Because I remind you of her?

901
01:40:20,207 --> 01:40:22,198
That's not very complimentary.

902
01:40:24,367 --> 01:40:26,722
And nothing else?

903
01:40:26,767 --> 01:40:28,200
No.

904
01:40:28,247 --> 01:40:30,807
That's not very complimentary either.

905
01:40:30,847 --> 01:40:33,884
I just want to be with you
as much as I can, Judy.

906
01:40:46,447 --> 01:40:50,201
Well, I guess I...

907
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:53,125
I could phone the store
in the morning and...

908
01:40:53,967 --> 01:40:55,958
make some excuse.

909
01:41:40,607 --> 01:41:42,996
(Mellow dance music)

910
01:41:59,927 --> 01:42:01,804
Hi, John.

911
01:42:02,847 --> 01:42:04,838
I like that one.

912
01:42:04,887 --> 01:42:08,084
- That? All right.
- That's very nice.

913
01:42:08,127 --> 01:42:11,164
- (Car horns honk)
- It's beautiful.

914
01:42:11,207 --> 01:42:15,644
There we are. We'll get this
and then we'll buy you those clothes.

915
01:42:15,687 --> 01:42:18,759
- Honest?
- There's Ransohoffs. Only the best.

916
01:42:18,807 --> 01:42:21,275
- How much is that?
- That'll be 50 cents.

917
01:42:21,327 --> 01:42:24,683
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

918
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:47,917
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.

919
01:42:47,967 --> 01:42:49,958
But you said grey, sir.

920
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:52,840
Look, I just want an ordinary,
simple grey suit.

921
01:42:52,887 --> 01:42:57,085
- But I like that one, Scottie.
- No, it's not right.

922
01:42:57,127 --> 01:43:00,676
The gentleman seems to know
what he wants.

923
01:43:00,727 --> 01:43:02,877
All right, we'll find it.

924
01:43:09,607 --> 01:43:12,519
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to buy you a suit.

925
01:43:12,567 --> 01:43:16,845
But... but I loved
the second one she wore.

926
01:43:16,887 --> 01:43:20,641
- And this one, it's beautiful.
- No, none of them are right.

927
01:43:20,687 --> 01:43:24,077
I think I know the suit you mean,
we had it some time ago.

928
01:43:24,127 --> 01:43:26,516
We may still have that model.

929
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,558
Thank you.

930
01:43:29,967 --> 01:43:34,404
You're looking for the suit that she wore.
You want me to dress like her.

931
01:43:34,447 --> 01:43:37,439
I want you to look nice,
I know what would look good.

932
01:43:37,487 --> 01:43:39,478
No, I won't do it!

933
01:43:42,487 --> 01:43:44,239
Judy.

934
01:43:45,287 --> 01:43:48,404
Judy, it can't make that much
difference to you.

935
01:43:48,447 --> 01:43:51,280
I don't want any clothes.
I want to get out of here.

936
01:43:51,327 --> 01:43:54,319
- Do this for me!
- (Assistant) Here we are.

937
01:43:54,367 --> 01:43:56,801
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought so.

938
01:43:56,847 --> 01:44:00,806
- I don't like it.
- We'll take it. Will the thing fit?

939
01:44:00,847 --> 01:44:04,886
It might need some slight alterations
but it's madam's size.

940
01:44:04,927 --> 01:44:07,566
All right, dear.
You can try it on in a moment.

941
01:44:07,607 --> 01:44:10,519
- How long will the alterations take?
- Well...

942
01:44:10,567 --> 01:44:14,003
- By tonight?
- If it's absolutely necessary.

943
01:44:14,047 --> 01:44:17,642
Yes, it is.
We'd like to look at an evening dress.

944
01:44:17,687 --> 01:44:21,566
Short, black, with long sleeves
and kind of a square neck.

945
01:44:21,607 --> 01:44:24,167
- Scottie...
- (Assistant) My!

946
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:27,756
You certainly do know
what you want, sir. I'll see what we have.

947
01:44:35,527 --> 01:44:38,200
All right, that's it.
Do you have them in brown?

948
01:44:38,247 --> 01:44:40,442
- Yes, we have.
- Fine.

949
01:44:47,567 --> 01:44:51,116
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

950
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:55,364
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

951
01:44:55,407 --> 01:44:57,398
I don't know.

952
01:44:57,447 --> 01:45:00,439
I don't know.
No good, I guess. I don't know.

953
01:45:03,447 --> 01:45:07,156
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

954
01:45:07,207 --> 01:45:09,198
You can, you know.

955
01:45:11,407 --> 01:45:13,602
No, you wouldn't let me.

956
01:45:15,487 --> 01:45:18,126
And I... I don't want to go.

957
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:24,719
Judy, these past few days have been the
first happy days I've known in a year.

958
01:45:24,767 --> 01:45:30,046
I know. I know, because...
because I remind you of her.

959
01:45:32,287 --> 01:45:34,278
And not even that very much.

960
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:36,522
No.

961
01:45:36,567 --> 01:45:40,446
No, Judy. Judy, it's you too.

962
01:45:40,487 --> 01:45:42,876
There's something in you that...

963
01:45:47,087 --> 01:45:50,636
- You don't even want to touch me.
- Yes, I do.

964
01:45:52,007 --> 01:45:53,998
Couldn't you like me?

965
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:56,038
Just me, the way I am?

966
01:45:57,087 --> 01:46:00,796
When we first started out,
it was so good, we had fun.

967
01:46:01,927 --> 01:46:05,124
And... And then
you started in on the clothes.

968
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:11,643
I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to, if you'll just...

969
01:46:11,687 --> 01:46:13,678
just like me.

970
01:46:18,447 --> 01:46:21,200
- The colour of your hair.
- Oh, no!

971
01:46:25,767 --> 01:46:28,565
Judy, please, it can't matter to you.

972
01:46:35,247 --> 01:46:37,044
Lf...

973
01:46:38,927 --> 01:46:41,839
If I let you change me, will that do it?

974
01:46:41,887 --> 01:46:43,878
If I do what you tell me...

975
01:46:45,767 --> 01:46:48,884
- will you love me?
- Yes.

976
01:46:50,087 --> 01:46:51,679
Yes.

977
01:46:51,727 --> 01:46:53,524
All right.

978
01:46:53,567 --> 01:46:57,560
All right then, I'll do it.
I don't care any more about me.

979
01:47:06,327 --> 01:47:08,921
Come on over and sit by the fire.

980
01:47:28,247 --> 01:47:30,397
I'm afraid it will take several hours.

981
01:47:30,447 --> 01:47:33,678
The young lady thought
she might see you at home.

982
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:37,640
No, you tell her I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

983
01:47:37,687 --> 01:47:40,281
You're sure about the colour of the hair?

984
01:47:40,327 --> 01:47:43,046
- Yes, it's an easy colour.
- And the rest...

985
01:47:43,087 --> 01:47:45,601
- We know what you want.
- Thank you.

986
01:48:59,487 --> 01:49:01,762
(Lift bell)

987
01:49:25,007 --> 01:49:26,599
Well?

988
01:49:26,647 --> 01:49:31,801
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck. I told her that.

989
01:49:31,847 --> 01:49:35,157
We tried it, it just didn't seem to suit me.

990
01:49:40,767 --> 01:49:42,837
Please, Judy.

991
01:50:40,487 --> 01:50:42,478
(Door opens)

992
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:43,004
- Where shall we go for dinner?
- Anywhere you like.

993
01:52:43,047 --> 01:52:46,005
- Ernie's?
- You have a thing about Ernie's.

994
01:52:47,047 --> 01:52:49,436
After all, it's our place.

995
01:52:52,687 --> 01:52:54,917
Hello, my love. Like me?

996
01:52:54,967 --> 01:52:57,800
- Mm-hm.
- Is that the best you can do?

997
01:52:57,847 --> 01:53:01,237
- Come here.
- Oh, no. You'll muss me.

998
01:53:01,287 --> 01:53:03,642
That's what I had in mind. Come here!

999
01:53:03,687 --> 01:53:06,042
It's too late, I got my face on.

1000
01:53:06,087 --> 01:53:08,362
I'm suddenly hungry.

1001
01:53:09,487 --> 01:53:13,639
- Would you rather go somewhere else?
- No, Ernie's is fine.

1002
01:53:13,687 --> 01:53:15,882
I'm gonna have...

1003
01:53:15,927 --> 01:53:19,442
I'm gonna have
one of those big, beautiful steaks.

1004
01:53:19,487 --> 01:53:23,036
Let me see. To start, I think I'll...

1005
01:53:24,367 --> 01:53:26,403
Help me with this, will you?

1006
01:53:29,047 --> 01:53:31,322
I have it.

1007
01:53:31,367 --> 01:53:35,519
- How do you work this thing?
- Can't you see?

1008
01:53:35,567 --> 01:53:38,081
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1009
01:53:38,127 --> 01:53:41,915
I'm just about ready.
All I've got to do is find my lipstick.

1010
01:53:42,967 --> 01:53:45,606
Where did I put it? I had it a minute ago.

1011
01:53:57,407 --> 01:53:59,602
I wonder if it's here?

1012
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,444
There it is.

1013
01:54:02,447 --> 01:54:04,438
There, I'm ready.

1014
01:54:06,607 --> 01:54:08,802
First, muss me a little?

1015
01:54:11,687 --> 01:54:14,724
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?

1016
01:54:17,367 --> 01:54:20,996
Would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1017
01:54:21,047 --> 01:54:24,835
- We could drive down the peninsula.
- If you like.

1018
01:54:42,207 --> 01:54:44,198
We're going awfully far.

1019
01:54:44,247 --> 01:54:46,238
I just feel like driving.

1020
01:54:46,287 --> 01:54:48,278
Are you terribly hungry?

1021
01:54:48,327 --> 01:54:50,318
No. It's all right.

1022
01:55:09,407 --> 01:55:11,398
Where are you going?

1023
01:55:15,567 --> 01:55:17,683
One final thing I have to do.

1024
01:55:20,047 --> 01:55:22,038
And then I'll be free of the past.

1025
01:55:41,407 --> 01:55:43,796
Scottie... why are we here?

1026
01:55:43,847 --> 01:55:45,644
I told you.

1027
01:55:47,807 --> 01:55:52,085
I have to go back into the past
once more. Just once more.

1028
01:55:52,127 --> 01:55:54,322
For the last time.

1029
01:55:54,367 --> 01:55:56,437
Why? Why here?

1030
01:55:56,487 --> 01:55:58,717
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1031
01:56:00,407 --> 01:56:03,797
- I don't want to go, I'd rather...
- No, I need you.

1032
01:56:03,847 --> 01:56:05,838
Why?

1033
01:56:05,887 --> 01:56:09,084
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.

1034
01:56:09,127 --> 01:56:11,721
And when it's done, we'll both be free.

1035
01:56:12,767 --> 01:56:16,840
- I'm scared.
- I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

1036
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:19,037
Right there.

1037
01:56:19,087 --> 01:56:21,647
We stood there and kissed
for the last time.

1038
01:56:21,687 --> 01:56:23,484
She said, ''lf you lose me,

1039
01:56:23,527 --> 01:56:26,519
''you'll know that
I wanted to keep on loving you.''

1040
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:28,956
And I said, ''I won't lose you.''

1041
01:56:29,007 --> 01:56:31,157
But I did.

1042
01:56:31,207 --> 01:56:36,964
And then she turned...
and ran into the church.

1043
01:56:48,847 --> 01:56:52,044
And when I followed her,
it was too late.

1044
01:56:55,687 --> 01:56:57,678
I don't want to go in there!

1045
01:56:57,727 --> 01:56:59,718
It was too late.

1046
01:57:01,527 --> 01:57:03,119
Scottie...

1047
01:57:06,287 --> 01:57:10,041
I couldn't find her.
Then I heard footsteps on the stairs.

1048
01:57:10,087 --> 01:57:12,601
She was running up the tower.

1049
01:57:12,647 --> 01:57:14,638
Right here.

1050
01:57:14,687 --> 01:57:17,281
- Scottie...
- See, she was running up the stairs.

1051
01:57:17,327 --> 01:57:20,080
Through the trap door
at the top of the tower.

1052
01:57:20,127 --> 01:57:23,164
I tried to follow her
but I couldn't get to the top.

1053
01:57:23,207 --> 01:57:25,846
I tried but I couldn't get to the top.

1054
01:57:25,887 --> 01:57:29,880
One doesn't often get a second chance.
I want to stop being haunted.

1055
01:57:30,927 --> 01:57:33,202
You're my second chance, Judy.

1056
01:57:33,247 --> 01:57:36,125
- You're my second chance!
- Take me away!

1057
01:57:36,167 --> 01:57:38,761
You look like Madeleine now.

1058
01:57:38,807 --> 01:57:41,605
Go up the stairs. Go up the stairs!

1059
01:57:44,167 --> 01:57:46,158
Go up the stairs, Judy.

1060
01:57:47,767 --> 01:57:49,758
And I'll follow.

1061
01:58:46,527 --> 01:58:49,803
This was as far as I could get
but you went on.

1062
01:58:50,847 --> 01:58:52,838
Remember?

1063
01:58:52,887 --> 01:58:54,878
The necklace, Madeleine.

1064
01:58:54,927 --> 01:58:58,556
That was the slip.
I remembered the necklace.

1065
01:58:58,607 --> 01:59:00,916
- Let me go!
- We're going up the tower!

1066
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:02,958
You can't! You're afraid!

1067
01:59:03,767 --> 01:59:07,999
We'll see. This is my second chance!

1068
01:59:08,047 --> 01:59:10,959
You knew that day
that I couldn't follow you.

1069
01:59:11,007 --> 01:59:13,316
Who was up there? Elster and his wife?

1070
01:59:13,367 --> 01:59:15,517
- Yes!
- And she was the one who died.

1071
01:59:15,567 --> 01:59:17,444
The real wife, not you!

1072
01:59:17,487 --> 01:59:19,796
You were the copy, the counterfeit.

1073
01:59:19,847 --> 01:59:23,123
- Was she dead or alive?
- Dead! He'd broken her neck.

1074
01:59:23,167 --> 01:59:25,840
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

1075
01:59:25,887 --> 01:59:30,358
When you got there, he pushed her off.
It was you that screamed! Why?

1076
01:59:30,407 --> 01:59:33,365
I wanted to stop it. I ran up to stop it.

1077
01:59:33,407 --> 01:59:37,719
Why did you scream?
Since you tricked me so well up to then.

1078
01:59:37,767 --> 01:59:39,997
You played the wife very well.

1079
01:59:40,047 --> 01:59:43,801
He made you over, didn't he?
Just like I did.

1080
01:59:43,847 --> 01:59:46,839
Only better.
Not only the clothes and the hair

1081
01:59:46,887 --> 01:59:51,358
but the looks, the manner and the words
and those beautiful phoney trances.

1082
01:59:51,407 --> 01:59:55,366
You jumped into the Bay, didn't you?
I bet you're a wonderful swimmer.

1083
01:59:55,407 --> 01:59:58,160
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

1084
01:59:58,207 --> 02:00:02,564
And then what did he do?
Did he train you? Did he rehearse you?

1085
02:00:02,607 --> 02:00:05,360
Tell you exactly what to do and say?

1086
02:00:05,407 --> 02:00:09,719
You were a very apt pupil too,
weren't you? A very apt pupil.

1087
02:00:09,767 --> 02:00:12,201
But why did you pick on me? Why me?

1088
02:00:12,247 --> 02:00:14,238
Your accident!

1089
02:00:14,287 --> 02:00:18,246
My accident. I was the setup, wasn't I?

1090
02:00:18,287 --> 02:00:21,563
I was a made to order witness. I was...

1091
02:00:27,767 --> 02:00:29,758
I made it.

1092
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,799
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

1093
02:00:35,607 --> 02:00:38,804
We're going up to look
at the scene of the crime.

1094
02:00:38,847 --> 02:00:40,838
Come on, Judy!

1095
02:00:52,047 --> 02:00:54,083
This is where it happened.

1096
02:00:55,967 --> 02:00:58,765
The two of you hid back there

1097
02:00:58,807 --> 02:01:02,117
then sneaked down
and drove into town. Is that it?

1098
02:01:02,167 --> 02:01:04,601
And then, you were his girl, huh?

1099
02:01:05,647 --> 02:01:08,161
Well, what happened to you?

1100
02:01:08,207 --> 02:01:10,198
Did he ditch you?

1101
02:01:11,247 --> 02:01:14,398
With his wife's money,
all that freedom and power,

1102
02:01:14,447 --> 02:01:16,483
and he ditched you. What a shame.

1103
02:01:16,527 --> 02:01:19,280
He knew he was safe,
you couldn't talk.

1104
02:01:19,327 --> 02:01:22,285
- Did he give you anything?
- Some money.

1105
02:01:22,327 --> 02:01:25,603
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace.

1106
02:01:25,647 --> 02:01:28,480
There was where you made
your mistake, Judy.

1107
02:01:28,527 --> 02:01:31,564
You shouldn't keep
souvenirs of a killing.

1108
02:01:32,407 --> 02:01:34,477
You shouldn't have been...

1109
02:01:34,527 --> 02:01:37,485
You shouldn't have been
that sentimental.

1110
02:01:41,567 --> 02:01:43,558
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1111
02:01:45,047 --> 02:01:46,844
Scottie...

1112
02:01:47,887 --> 02:01:51,596
I was safe when you found me,
you couldn't prove anything.

1113
02:01:51,647 --> 02:01:56,675
When I saw you again,
I couldn't run away, I loved you so.

1114
02:01:56,727 --> 02:02:00,686
I walked into danger and
let you change me because I loved you.

1115
02:02:00,727 --> 02:02:03,287
Oh, Scottie...

1116
02:02:03,327 --> 02:02:07,764
Oh, Scottie, please.
You love me now, you'll keep me safe.

1117
02:02:07,807 --> 02:02:11,800
- Please!
- Too late, there's no bringing her back.

1118
02:02:11,847 --> 02:02:13,838
Please!

1119
02:02:19,327 --> 02:02:21,318
(Shuffling footsteps)

1120
02:02:23,327 --> 02:02:24,885
Oh, no!

1121
02:02:24,927 --> 02:02:26,918
- (Woman) I heard voices.
- (Screams)

1122
02:02:30,207 --> 02:02:32,198
God have mercy.

1123
02:04:12,287 --> 02:04:14,278
