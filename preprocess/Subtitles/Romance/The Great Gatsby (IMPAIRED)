00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,090
Highballs it is.

814
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,340
HEAD WAITER: All right. - You
take care of my friend.

815
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,970
Look who's here.

816
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,325
GATSBY: You see these fists?

817
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,680
He's the next heavyweight...

818
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,730
- champion. - Pay my
respects to your boss.

819
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,350
Hey, Jay!

820
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,190
You're under arrest! Ha-ha-ha!

821
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,610
You be careful, now. You're turning
into a real jazz hound, commissioner.

822
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,320
Bang, bang!

823
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,910
- That's the commissioner.
WAITER 1: Mr. Gatsby...

824
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,410
Your table is ready.

825
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,540
MAN 2: Gatsby!
- Good to see you.

826
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,330
WOLFSHIEM: Yeah,
that's fantastic.

827
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,460
You be careful at
those tables now...

828
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,920
Senator.

829
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,670
I'll put a bet on for you, Jay!

830
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,340
<i>Hundred dollar bills.</i>

831
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,090
We'll have the lobster.

832
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
It's decorated with
truffles and fine herbs.

833
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,100
<i>Hundred dollar bills.</i>

834
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:03,649
WOLFSHIEM: So...

835
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,360
How is the bond
business, Mr. Carraway?

836
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,490
Fine. Thank you.

837
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,070
I understand you're
looking for...

838
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,504
- a business connection.
- No. No, no, no.

839
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:13,529
No, no, no.

840
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,740
This isn't the man, Meyer.

841
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,240
This is the friend...

842
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,040
That I told you about.

843
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, I beg your pardon.

844
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,250
I had a wrong man.

845
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
(CHUCKLES)

846
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:25,395
GATSBY: If you'll excuse
me, I have to make...

847
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,460
That call.

848
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,089
Any luck, senator?

849
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,380
WOLFSHIEM: What a gentleman.

850
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,760
From one of the finest
families in the midwest.

851
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,560
Sadly, all dead now.

852
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,785
When I first made
the pleasure of...

853
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:43,310
Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance
just after the war...

854
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,150
I knew I'd discovered a
man of fine breeding.

855
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,399
A war hero.

856
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,820
Such medals.

857
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,610
And...

858
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,085
And...

859
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,360
An Oxford man.

860
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,070
You know Oxford?

861
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,030
Yes, I've heard of it.

862
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,845
WOLFSHIEM: Then you'd know that
when it comes to married women...

863
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,250
A man like this can be trusted.

864
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,460
With a friend...

865
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,960
With someone like you...

866
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,500
He'd never so much as
look at your wife.

867
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm not married.

868
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,340
But you work on
wall street, right?

869
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,720
Yes.

870
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,050
Ah.

871
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,930
Looking at my tiepin?

872
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,640
Finest specimen of human...

873
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,930
Molar.

874
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
GATSBY: Gentlemen.

875
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,310
Everything all right?

876
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,770
Yes! Yes. We...

877
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,610
We were just talking about
other people's wives.

878
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,940
Other people's wives?

879
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,150
- Yes.
- Really?

880
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,990
WOLFSHIEM: Well, my work here is done.
I'm going to leave you gentlemen...

881
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,240
To talk about your
sports and your women.

882
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,950
Other people's wives.

883
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,870
WOLFSHIEM: Hello, ladies.

884
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,870
Ooh.

885
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,790
NICK: Who is he, anyhow?

886
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,789
An actor?

887
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,790
Meyer?

888
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,880
No, no. He's a gambler.

889
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,970
He's the man who fixed
the 1919 world series.

890
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,115
Fixed it?

891
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,009
Fixed it.

892
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,260
Well, how'd he manage that?

893
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,430
Saw the opportunity, I suppose.

894
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,850
He's a very smart man.

895
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,280
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

896
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,410
Now, 'Old Sport', about miss Baker
and that request we spoke of.

897
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,990
TOM: Nick? Nick!

898
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,870
NICK: Tom! Funny seeing you!

899
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,870
TOM: How have you been?
NICK: Yeah.

900
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,370
- Good. - Nick,
Daisy is furious...

901
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,420
- that you haven't called.
- Hey...

902
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,460
Mr. Gatsby, this
is Mr. Buchanan.

903
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,050
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

904
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,590
Yeah.

905
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,720
Never would have expected to
find you in this Temple...

906
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,559
Of virtue. NICK: I
was having lunch...

907
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,850
With Mr. Gatsby.

908
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:55,465
MAITRED: Can I help you, Sir?
NICK: Jordan Baker...

909
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,200
The famous sporting star?
The golfer? I see.

910
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,820
I've spotted her. Thank you.

911
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,069
There you are.

912
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,080
What game are you and Gatsby...

913
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,079
Playing at?

914
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,330
- The gentleman will be
joining-? - Excuse me.

915
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,660
- Nick, please. NICK:
It's all rather...

916
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,590
Strange. He picks me
up in his fancy car.

917
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,750
- Going on about...
- Keep your...

918
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,975
his life. Voice down.

919
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,829
People can hear you.

920
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,669
What is...

921
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,250
This enormous request?

922
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,670
He wants you to
invite Daisy to tea.

923
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,880
Daisy?

924
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,220
And Gatsby.

925
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,390
Why?

926
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
I don't quite know
where to start.

927
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,980
You see, I didn't realize
until the other night that...

928
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,690
I'd met Gatsby.

929
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,520
Five years ago. In louisville.

930
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,150
<i>It was the day I got my
new English golf shoes.</i>

931
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:42,819
<i>Daisy...</i>

932
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,290
<i>Was by far the most
popular girl with...</i>

933
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,811
<i>The officers from camp Taylor.</i>

934
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,580
DAISY: Hello, Jordan.

935
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,039
<i>One of them was...</i>

936
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,170
<i>In the car with her.</i>

937
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,590
<i>It was Gatsby.</i>

938
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,590
<i>The way he looked at
her is the way...</i>

939
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,550
<i>All girls want
to be looked at.</i>

940
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
NICK: So...

941
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,590
Tell me what happened.

942
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,300
Well, I don't know.

943
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,550
Charge!

944
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:07,969
<i>"Jordan". Gatsby
was sent off...</i>

945
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,970
To war.

946
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,770
<i>When the war ended...</i>

947
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,230
<i>Daisy waited.</i>

948
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,650
<i>But for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.</i>

949
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,280
<i>A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.</i>

950
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,530
<i>He gave her a string of
pearls worth $350,000.</i>

951
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,040
<i>But the morning
of the wedding...</i>

952
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,225
<i>Daisy received a letter.
DAISY: Tell them...</i>

953
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,420
<i>Daisy's changed her mind!</i>

954
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,710
DAISY'S MOTHER: What is this?
JORDAN: Daisy, please!

955
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,340
- Hand it to me!
- No!

956
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Leave me alone!

957
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,170
DAISY'S MOTHER: Jordan, no
one must know about this.

958
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,090
<i>NICK: What was in the letter?
JORDAN: I don't know.</i>

959
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,890
<i>She wouldn't tell me.</i>

960
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,720
<i>But it was too late.</i>

961
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,140
<i>That day at 5:00, Daisy Fay...</i>

962
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,429
Married Tom Buchanan...

963
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,990
<i>With more pomp and circumstance
than louisville had ever seen.</i>

964
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,440
MAN: Congratulations,
Mr. Buchanan!

965
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,530
After the honeymoon, I saw
them in Santa Barbara.

966
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,825
Well, it was touching, really.
I'd never seen...

967
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,910
A girl so in love
with her husband.

968
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,330
A week later, Tom...

969
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,910
Crashed his car.

970
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,250
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara hotel.

971
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,630
It got into all the papers.

972
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,380
NICK: It's a strange
coincidence. JORDAN: What is?

973
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,470
NICK: The fact that Gatsby's
house is just across the bay.

974
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,680

Strained himself to get
this menagerie together.

1450
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:47,810
I'd like to know who he
is and what he does.

1451
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,600
And I think I'll make a
point of finding out.

1452
01:19:08,424 --> 01:19:10,225
GATSBY: I'm not sure. Ask
them in the kitchen.

1453
01:19:10,226 --> 01:19:11,500
SERVANT 1: To the left.

1454
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,499
SERVANT 2: Yeah...

1455
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,790
We'll pile that stuff in the
garage, it's going back to town.

<i>NICK: Well...</i>

1457
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,730
There you are. Daisy just left.

1458
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,350
She asked me to tell you...

1459
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,650
She had a wonderful time.

1460
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,400
She didn't like it.

1461
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:38,690
Of course she did.

1462
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,440
No, no, no.

1463
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,860
No, she didn't like it. She
did not have a good time.

1464
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,489
I feel so far...

1465
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,490
Away from her now.

1466
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,540
It's so hard to make
her understand.

1467
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,000
You mean about the party?

1468
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,160
The party?

1469
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,880
I couldn't care less
about the parties.

1470
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,710
That'll be all for
now, gentlemen.

1471
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,400
- Thank you. SERVANT
3: Thank you, Sir.

1472
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,010
GATSBY: You see...

1473
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,260
She has to tell Tom that
she never loved him.

1474
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:08,549
What?

1475
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:09,600
Yes.

1476
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,810
Then we can go back to louisville
to her parents' house.

1477
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,600
Her parents are lovely people,
'Old Sport'. We'll be...

1478
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,770
Married there.

1479
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:19,980
See...

1480
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:24,240
See, Daisy and I are gonna start over
just as if it were five years ago.

1481
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,990
I wouldn't ask too much of her.

1482
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,450
Wouldn't ask too much?

1483
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,660
No.

1484
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,160
I beg your pardon, 'Old Sport'.
It's just

1485
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,250
it's so sad, because it's
so hard to make her...

1486
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,090
Understand.

1487
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,300
It's so hard to make
her understand.

1488
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:48,840
I've gotten all these things for her,
and now she just wants to run away.

1489
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:51,139
She even wants...

1490
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,680
To leave that. NICK: Jay.

1491
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,100
You can't repeat the past.

1492
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,400
Can't repeat the past?

1493
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,860
No.

1494
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,030
Why, of course you can.

1495
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,400
Of course you can.

1496
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:08,860
I'm gonna fix things...

1497
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,910
Just the way they were before.

1498

recover something.</i>

1501

If I could just get
back to the start...

1502

If I could just get

1503
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,720

<i>I'd never been in such
a beautiful house.</i>

May I save the next dance?

<i>The truth that he was...</i>

1513

<i>Grand vision of himself.</i>

1516
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,220
- Daisy, don't scamper.
DAISY: I was not, mother.

1517
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,510
So many dashing young
officers here.

1518
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,050
And from such
illustrious families.

Kissed this girl...

1525
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:31,359
I would be...

1526

Forever wed to her.

1527
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,370
So I stopped.

1528
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,290
I stopped and I...

1529
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,670
I waited.

1530
01:22:46,959 --> 01:22:47,959

His mind would never again
be free to romp like...

for a man like me to fall in love.

1542
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,070
I'm only 32. I might still be a great

And tell him that she
never loved him.

1549

I just need to give her
more time, 'Old Sport'.

More time.

Don't worry, 'Old Sport'.
Don't worry.

01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,410
GATSBY: You see...

1608
01:28:48,739 --> 01:28:49,739
Every night...

1609
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,910
I can see...

1610
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,160
That light...

1611
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:55,540
At the end of your
dock blinking.

1612
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,250
What light?

1613
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,830
GATSBY: You see,
Mr. Buchanan...

1614
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:08,930
I wanted to be close.

1615
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,074
- Daisy and I have both.
- It's so hot!

1616
01:29:17,099 --> 01:29:18,099
Everything's...

1617
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,190
So confused.

1618
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,860
What'll we do this afternoon...

1619
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,755
Or the day after that, or
for the next 30 years?

1620
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,780
Oh, don't be morbid.

1621
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:27,200
Let's go to town. Who
wants to go to town?

1622
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,360
Town?

1623
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,200

1624
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:32,370

You look so cool.

1627
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,190
You always look so cool...

1628
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,490
Like the advertisement...

1629
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,110
Of the man in Times Square.

1630
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,159
The man...

1631
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,330
In the cool, beautiful shirts.

1633
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,250
<i>Gatsby that she loved him...</i>

1634
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:24,709
And Tom...

1635
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,050
<i>Had seen.</i>

1636
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,170
TOM: Let's go to town.

1637
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,970
I'm perfectly willing.

1638
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,220
It's a marvelous idea.

1639
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:32,424
Henri! Have the car...

1640
01:30:32,425 --> 01:30:33,425
Brought around now.

1641

DAISY: Can't anyone
at least have...

1642
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,731
- a cigarette first? - We
smoked through lunch.

1643
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:39,730
Come on, let's have fun.
It's too hot to fuss.

1644
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:41,440
TOM: Daisy, it was
your great idea.

1645
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,150
Why don't we? Let's
all go to town.

1646
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,730
I changed my mind, you brute.

1647
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,939
TOM: Come on. We'll get...

1648
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,030
A great big room at the Plaza...

1649
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,320
A bucket of ice...

1650
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,780
A bottle of whiskey...

1651
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,990
And it will be fun.

1652
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,160
Come on.

1653
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:56,830
It was your idea.

1654
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,620
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom.

1655
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,040
Come on, Jordan.

1656
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,460
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

1657
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,310
Two bottles of whiskey.
Wrap them in a towel.

1658
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:13,630
Come on, Nick!

1659
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:19,770
TOM: Mr. Gatsby...

1660
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,270
Would you be good
enough to take...

1661
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,270
My coupe, and I'll
drive everyone else...

1662
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,690
In your circus wagon.
GATSBY: I don't think...

1663
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,610
There's much gas, 'Old Sport'.

1664
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,070
TOM: No, plenty of gas.

1665
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,150
Well, if I run out, I'll stop...

1666
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,860
At a drugstore. I
hear you can...

1667
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,591
Buy anything at a
drugstore nowdays.

1668
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,410
You take Nick and Jordan.

1669
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,700
GATSBY: I suppose you can...

1670
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,910
- yes. - We'll meet
you at the Plaza.

1671
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,145
I'll be the man on the corner...

TOM: You must think I'm
pretty dumb, don't you?

1674
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:56,850
Well, I have a second sight
sometimes that tells me what to do.

1675
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,100
I've made a small investigation
into this fellow.

1676
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,469
JORDAN: And you
found he was...

1677
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,180
- an Oxford man?
- Oxford, new Mexico.

1678
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,310
He wears a pink suit,
for chrissake.

What are you waiting for?

1687
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,600
- Let's have some gas!
- Uhh.

1688
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,390
Do I have to do it myself?

1689
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,451
You think I come here
to admire the view?

1690
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,020
- I'm sorry, I'm sick.
TOM: Why?

1691

- Why, what's the matter?
WILSON: I don't know.

01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:58,250
I understand that
you're an Oxford man.

No, not exactly, no.

Oh, yes, I understand that...

1729

You went to Oxford.

went to Oxford. - Tom.

1734

I'd like to know when.

Well, Mr. Gatsby?

1737

stayed there five months.

you a drink, Tom.

to yourself. TOM: Wait a minute.

1746
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,260
I want to ask Mr. Gatsby
one more question.

1747
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,090
Oh, please, please, go
on, Mr. Buchanan. Go on.

01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:09,470
What kind of a row are you trying
to 'cause in my house anyhow?

He isn't causing a row, you're causing a
row. Please have a little self-control.

01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,600
Self-control?

1751
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,479
Oh, I suppose...

1752
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,520
The latest thing
is to sit back...

1753
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:22,070
And let Mr. nobody
from nowhere...

1754
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,740
Make love to your wife.

1755

Well, if that's the idea...

1756

You can count me out.

01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,390
You see, she loves me.

1767
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,270
You must be crazy.

1768
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,560
No, 'Old Sport'.

1769
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,110
No, you see, she
never loved you.

1770
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,190
She only married you
because I was poor...

1771
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,440
And she was tired of waiting.
It was a terrible...

1772
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,910
Terrible mistake,
but in her heart...

1773
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:08,490
In her heart, she never loved...

1774
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,950
Anyone but me.

1775
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,620
- We should go.
- Let's all go home.

1776
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,660
- Sit down, Daisy!
GATSBY: Please.

1777
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,500
Please, take a seat.

1778
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,960
Go on, Daisy.

1779
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:20,960
TOM: Daisy...

1780
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,420
What's been going on?

1781
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,855
- I want to hear about it. - I
told you what's going on.

1782
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,590
It's been going on
for five years.

1783
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,640
You've been seeing him...

1784
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:32,180
For five years?

1785
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:35,640
No, no, no, not seeing. Not
seeing, we couldn't. But...

1786
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,810
Both of us loved each other
all that time. Didn't we?

1787
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:40,190
TOM: Oh, that's all.

1788
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,940
Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!

1789
01:37:43,569 --> 01:37:44,569
I can't speak about...

1790
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:47,950
What happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.

1791
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,070
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...

1792
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,990
Unless you brought the
groceries to the back door.

1793
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,410
But all the rest of that...

1794
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,974
Is a goddamn lie.

1795
01:37:56,999 --> 01:37:57,999
Daisy loved me...

1796
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,620
When she married me...

1797
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,460
And she loves me now.
GATSBY: No.

1798
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:04,050
- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.
TOM: She does! She does, though.

1799
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:05,235
No, she does, though.

1800
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,840
She does. And what's
more, I love Daisy too.

1801
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:10,130
No.

1802
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,220
I love you, Daisy.

1803
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,390
Now, once in a while...

1804
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,020
I go off on a spree.
I always come back.

1805
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,435
A spree.

1806
01:38:18,436 --> 01:38:19,690
TOM: And in my heart I
love her all the time.

1807
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,190
You're revolting.

1808
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:22,375
You know why we left...

1809
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...

1810
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,110
To the story of
that little spree!

1811
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,280
That's all over now, Daisy,
darling. That's all over.

1812
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,990
Just tell him the truth. Go on.

1813
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,030
That you never loved him and this
will all be wiped out forever.

1814
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,330
How could I love him...

1815
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,660
Possibly? GATSBY:
Remember our plans.

1816
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,710
You tell him that you never
loved him and all...

1817
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,500
This pain will be wiped out...

1818
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:43,670
Forever.

1819
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,630
Daisy.

1820
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,300
Daisy, tell him.

1821
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:50,840
I never loved him.

1822
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:53,680
Never?

1823
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,890
- No.
- No.

1824
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,890
Not at kapiolani?

1825
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,940
Not that day I carried you down from
the punch bowl to keep your shoes dry?

1826
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:11,900
Never?

1827
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,450
Please don't.

1828
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:16,240
Daisy.

1829
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,250
There, Jay.

1830
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,080
You want too much.

1831
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,540
I love you now...

1832
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:24,190
Isn't that enough?
I can't help...

1833
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,500
What's past.

1834
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:28,090
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.

1835
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,260
You loved me too?

1836
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:34,640
You loved me...?

1837
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,800
Even that is a lie!

1838
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,970
She didn't know you were alive!

1839
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,770
There are things between
Daisy and me...

1840
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,291
Gatsby, that you'll never know.

1841
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,190
- Things that neither of us can
ever forget. GATSBY: I need to...

1842
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:43,520
Speak to Daisy alone.

1843
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:47,020
You see, you've got her all
excited now, don't you...

1844
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,030
'Old Sport'? Daisy.
DAISY: Even alone...

1845
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,990
I can't say I never loved torn.
It wouldn't be true.

1846
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,390
- What? - Of course
it wouldn't.

1847
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:55,675
- As if it mattered to you.
TOM: Of course it matters!

1848
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,501
I'm gonna take better
care of you from now on.

1849
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:00,910
You're not taking care of Daisy
anymore. She's leaving you.

1850
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,250
Nonsense!

1851
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,290
- I am, though!
TOM: No, no, no.

1852
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,500
She is not leaving me.

1853
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:06,725
Certainly not...

1854
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,170
For a common swindler...

1855
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,340
Like you.

1856
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,970
Mr. Gatsby, exactly
who are you, anyhow?

1857
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:13,170
I made an investigation...

1858
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,740
Into your affairs. You're one...

1859
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,080
Of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.

1860
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,600
Please, let's go home.

1861
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,180
See, he and this Wolfshiem...

1862
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,770
They bought up drugstores.

1863
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,180
And sold bootlegged...

1864
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,480
Alcohol over the counter.

1865
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,980
What about it, 'Old Sport'?

1866
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,420
Don't you call me 'Old Sport'."

1867
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,940
And this drugstore business...

1868
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:30,610
Is just small change compared
to this bonds stunt...

1869
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,399
That you and Wolfshiem
have got going.

1870
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,481
Your friend Walter chase...

1871
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,409
- isn't too proud to come in?
- I gave you...

1872
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,409
That some thought.

1873
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:37,740
How does a reputable banker...

1874
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,580
Like Walter chase
find himself...

1875
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:41,200
Up to his eyeballs in debt...

1876
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,200
GATSBY: I'll tell you. To a
little kike like Wolfshiem?

1877
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,620
- It's called greed, 'Old
Sport'. TOM: That's right!

1878
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,750
And you have half of wall street
out there swilling your...

1879
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,670
Free booze at that fun
park every weekend.

1880
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,600
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

1881
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,260
My God, he has.

1882
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:58,680
He's got nothing to do with

1883
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:00,140
with your little racket.

1884
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,680
Daisy.

1885
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,140
Daisy.

1886
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,400
Can't you see who this guy is...

1887
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,440
With his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?

1888
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,070
He is just a front...

1889
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,360
For Wolfshiem, a gangster...

1890
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:20,890
To get his claws into respectable
folk like Walter chase.

1891
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:24,330
The only respectable thing about
you, 'Old Sport', is your money.

1892
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,341
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...

1893
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,870
As you. That means we're equal.

1894
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
Oh, no. No.

1895
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:31,420
We're different.

1896
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,800
I am.

1897
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,300
They are.

1898
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,590
She is.

1899
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,090
We're all different from you.

1900
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,220
You see, we were born...

1901
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,220
Different.

1902
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,680
It's in our blood...

1903
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,810
And nothing that you
do or say or steal...

1904
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:51,560
Or dream up can
ever change that.

1905
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,690
A girl like Daisy

1906
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,124
you shut up!

1907
01:41:55,149 --> 01:41:56,149
Shut up!

1908
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:58,490
You shut up! Shut up!

1909
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,370
Shut up!

1910
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:10,960
NICK: Gatsby looked,
in that moment...

1911
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:13,420
<i>As if he had...</i>

1912
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,800
<i>Killed a man.</i>

1913
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:17,590
(TOM CHUCKLES)

1914
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,900
My sincerest

1915
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,980
my sincerest apologies.

1916
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,820
I seem to have...

1917
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,490
Lost my temper.

1918
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,330
That's right, Mr. Gatsby.

1919
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,500
Show us some of those fine...

1920
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,460
Oxford manners. GATSBY:
Daisy, darling.

1921
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:54,590
None of this has
any consequence.

1922
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,590
Daisy.

1923
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,670
Daisy, talk to me, darling.

1924
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,220
I just lost my
temper, that's all.

01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,340
But

2089
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,530
it was Daisy.

2090
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,530
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Well, I...

2091
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:33,370
You see, after we left New
York, she was very nervous.

2092
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,830
She thought that driving
would steady her.

2093
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,960
But this woman, she rushed...

2094
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:42,340
<i>Out at us.</i>

2095
01:52:44,630 --> 01:52:45,711
It all happened so quickly.

2096
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,510
It wasn't her fault...

2097
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,680
<i>Do you see?</i>

2098
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,200
No one must know that
Daisy was driving.

2099
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,540
Promise me.

2100
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:21,500
Jay, you should go home
and get some rest.

2101
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:24,720
I'm going to wait here. I'm
going to wait here all night...

2102
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,120
- if necessary.
- No, no, no.

2103
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:27,640
- That's not a good idea.
- If he tries...

2104
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,260
To bother her about that
unpleasantness this afternoon...

2105
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:31,551
If he tries to bother her...

2106
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:34,520
If he tries any brutality
on her whatsoever

2107
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,850
torn won't touch her. He's
not even thinking about her.

2108
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,810
I don't trust him.

2109
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,650
- I don't trust him.
- All right.

2110
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:43,110
All right.

2111
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,700
You wait here.

2112
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,620
I'll see if there's
any commotion.

2113
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,290
Would you?

2114
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,880
Thank you, 'Old Sport'.

2115
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,880
TOM: Listen, she was in the
wrong, running out on the road.

2116
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,050
Sweetheart, you have...

2117
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:12,600
Nothing to worry about.

2118
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:15,020
Let me take care of things.

2119
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,680
Take care of you.

2120
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:18,480
I'll make some calls.

2121
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,480
We'll go away.

2122
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:23,520
Just go away, get out of town.

2123
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:25,820
Get some rest. Don't worry.

2124
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:28,740
It'll be all right.

2125
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:32,240
Hey

2126
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,090
(CAR APPROACHES)

2127
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:03,020
Oh. Hello, 'Old Sport'.

2128
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:04,270
Jay

2129
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:06,650
- everything all right?
- Yes.

2130
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,070
Everything's just fine.

2131
01:55:09,570 --> 01:55:12,820
Around 4:00, she
came to the window.

2132
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:15,330
She stood there, then...

2133
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,830
Then she turned out
the light, so...

2134
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:20,710
Well...

2135
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,080
Give me a hand, will
you, 'Old Sport'?

2136

2138

You know, Jay, with
everything that's happened...

2139
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:35,680
You ought to go away.

2140
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:37,260
Tonight. They'll trace your car.

2141
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,350
Go away? No, I can't leave now.

2142
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,520
Not tonight.

2143
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:42,770
Jay, do you understand that
a woman has been killed?

2144
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,610
Daisy's going to
call in the morning.

2145
01:55:45,110 --> 01:55:47,940
Then we'll make plans
to go away together.

2146
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:51,280
- Yeah.
- Daisy, she

2147
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:53,700
she just needs time to think
things through. Herzog...

2148
01:55:53,860 --> 01:55:55,700
We're talking. Thank you.

2149
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:01,790
She just needs time to think.

2150
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:04,420
No, Jay. With Daisy

2151
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:09,550
she just needs time to think. She's
going to call in the morning.

2152
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:18,810
Wait up with me.

2153
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:24,980
The sun's almost up.

2154

<i>NICK: That was the night he
finally told me the truth.</i>

<i>All of it.</i>

2156
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,740
GATSBY: You know, I've
thought for a while...

2157
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:44,710
I had a lot of things, but
the truth is I'm empty.

2158
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:47,790
I suppose that's why I make
things up about myself.

2159
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,750
But I've wanted to tell you
the whole story for...

2160
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,340
A very long time.

2161
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,470
See, I grew up terribly,
terribly poor, 'Old Sport'.

2162
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:00,010
- <i>My folks were... NICK: He
revealed his humble beginnings...</i>

<i>His transformative

<i>The war, Oxford...</i>

2165
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:09,650
<i>And how he joined Wolfshiem
in the business.</i>

2166
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:12,530
<i>It was also that night...</i>

2167
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:16,780
<i>That I became aware of Gatsby's
extraordinary gift for hope.</i>

2168
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:19,990
I can't describe how surprised I
was to find out that I loved her.

2169
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,290
And that she loved me too.

2170

<i>NICK: A gift that I have never
found in any other person.</i>

01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:27,170
I never realized how
extraordinary...

2172
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:29,250
A nice girl could be.

2173
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,960
<i>And which it is not likely
I shall ever find again.</i>

2174
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:35,010
I thought out my life
with Daisy in it...

2175
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:36,820
Trying to figure out
how we could marry...

2176
01:57:36,821 --> 01:57:38,741
And struggle along on so
many dollars a month.

2177
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:42,310
What was in the letter?

2178
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:49,480
The reason why after the war I
hadn't been able to return.

2179
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:54,400
I asked her to wait until I made
something of myself, but she was...

2180
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:58,450
See, I felt married to her.

2181
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:02,700

01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:31,310
Chicago calling, Sir.

2188
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,730
Not now.

2189

course. GARDENER: Excuse me, Sir.

Mr. Gatsby, I'm gonna
drain the pool.

01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:43,450
Before the leaves
start falling in.

2193
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:45,080
Not today.

2194

Not today, it's so beautiful.

2195
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:56,170
You know, 'Old Sport', I haven't used that
pool once all summer. Let's take a swim.

2196
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:59,470
Have the phone brought
down to the pool.

2197

I have to go, Jay.

2198

to Mrs. Buchanan?

It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin.

I'm sorry, monsieur,
they have gone away.

<i>Gone away?</i>

Do you know when
they'll be back?

No.

<i>They have already departed.</i>

Please. I know that she would
want to be there. She would.

If you would just get
a message to her.

HENRI: You wish to contact her?</i>

I have no further
information, monsieur.

<i>And as I stood there, brooding
on the old, unknown world...</i>

2314

<i>I thought of
Gatsby's wonder...</i>

<i>When he first picked out the green
light at the end of Daisy's dock.</i>

<i>He had come such a long way.</i>

2317
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:58,880
<i>And his dream must have
seemed so close...</i>

<i>That he could hardly
fail to grasp it.</i>

<i>That it was already
behind him.</i>

2321

<i>Gatsby believed in
the green light...</i>

2322

that's no matter.</i>

<i>Tomorrow, we will
run faster...</i>

2326
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:28,200
<i>Stretch out our
arms farther...</i>

2327
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:31,200
<i>And one fine morning...</i>
