00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:59,166
- [ Scoffs ]
- How long have you been on Makatea ?

151
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:02,644
- You're kidding, right ?
- No.

152
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,846
You brought me here...
today.

153
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,851
Five hours ago ?

154
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,855
- Oh. So much has happened since then--
- [ Chair Breaks ]

155
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:15,153
Oh ! Oops. Oopsy.

156
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,989
Wow. There you go.
[ Chuckles ]

157
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,996
- I slipped.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:22,464
So where is your,
uh, copilot ?

159
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,696
Oh, she's busy
with the tourists.

160
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,862
Well, that sounds
like you don't like us.

161
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:33,103
Oh, no. Never bite the hand
that feeds... uh, your mouth.

162

- [ Laughs ]
- Whatever.

163
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:39,876
Besides, you know, they're--
they're good for a laugh. [ Chuckles ]

164
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,651
- You're a big laugher, are you ?
- Oh, yeah.

165
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,746
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:50,192
They come here looking
for "the magic,"

167
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,252
expecting to find romance...

168
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,696
when they can't find it
any other place.

169
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:00,497
- Maybe they will.
- [ Scoffs ]

170
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,596
It's an island, babe.

171

If you don't bring it here,
you won't find it here.

Oh, heavy.
Pilot and philosopher.

- Let me buy you a drink.
- Hey, I'm here with somebody.

174
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,149
You remember him ?
He came in with me.

175
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,451
[ Groans ]
I meant both of you.

176
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:25,688
No, you didn't.

177

- You're from New York, aren't you ?
- Hey, is everything okay ?

00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,063
- Well, hi. Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, that's very--

- Let's go.
- Oh, but we're leaving. And so--

- Well, maybe some other time...
- Ta-ta.

I'll buy you a drink.

00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,614
Okay. Bye.

184
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,744
- Was he bothering you ?
- Oh, no.

185
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,483
Was he hitting on you ? From over there,
it looked like he was hitting on you.

186
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:57,254
- Maybe a little--
- He was ? Do you want me
to do something about it ?

187
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,354
- Like what ?
- Hey, I don't go to the gym every day
just to watch old guys shower.

188
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:03,866
- You know, I will--
- Really ? Really ?

189
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,971
[ Frank ]
Well done, ocean. Well done, sky.

190

Well done, mai tais.

Well done, silicone. Oh, my.

- Hey.
- Ow. [ Chuckles ]

Hey, I'm-- I'm getting
a little toasty here.

194

You want me to put some
cream on you, honey ?

195
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,057
You'd do that for me ?
You'd cream me up ?

196
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,929
[ Laughs ]
Only for you. Where is it ?

197
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,763
Excuse me. Miss Monroe ?
You have a phone call.

198
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,270
- I do ?
- You could take it at the bar.

199
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,832
- What-- Who would be calling you here ?
- I have no idea. I'll be back.

200
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,905
- Could I get two mai tais, please ?
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:54,007
Thank you. Hello ?

202
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:58,487
Look, I know you're on vacation,
but this is a dire emergency.

203
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:02,992
- Oh, no.
- The photo shoot's on, but it's
an availability nightmare.

204
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,996
Vendela and Evander Holyfield
only have a mutual 17-hour window.

205
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:09,089
If we don't get them now,
nobody's available for four months...

206
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,225
and we lose them
for the May cover.

207
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,168
There's gotta be somebody closer
whose life you can screw up.

208
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:16,502
That's the ironic thing, dear.
There's not.

209
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:20,168
Vendela's in Sydney.
Evander's in Osaka.

210
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:23,111
I threw Taylor on a plane
this morning to Papeete.

211
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,115
- Tahiti ?
- Yes. They're all coming to you.

212
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:30,779
All you have to do
is fly back to Tahiti, baby-sit
the shoot, fly back out.

213
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:34,449
- Fifteen hours at the most.
- Look, this is complicated.

214
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:37,926
Uh-- Frank proposed
to me last night.

215
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:42,125
Oh, my God ! This is so exciting !
Sweetie, I'm so happy for you !

216
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,259
Well, I'm glad,
but the point is...

217
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:48,634
what kind of message am I sending to
Frank if the day after our betrothal...

218
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,105
I'm leaving him to go
on some photo shoot ?

219
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:59,611
An excellent message.
This is the perfect opportunity
to establish parameters.

220
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,548
Oh, God.

221
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,179
I read somewhere
that 38.6% of all women...

are pressured into quitting their jobs
in the first year of marriage.

in our magazine, and we made it up.

wants me to go to Tahiti tonight.

Well, uh, I'm sort of
on my layover here.

240
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:19,928
Right. Would $500
cut your layover short ?

to Papeete ?

I can't. I have a show tonight.
Tuesday is Tamure night.

Uh, it's Tamure night.

Great ! Thank you.

252

Honey, it's a known fact that
38.6% of all women...

are pressured into quitting their jobs
the first year of marriage.

254
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,404
That was in your magazine.
You probably made it up.

255
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:10,542
If you had to work,
I would understand.

256
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,875
That's because you're not
as romantic as I am.

Ohh.

258

So come with me.

- No.
- How come ?

260
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:27,622
Because if I go with you,
I'll resent the fact that I'm there.

261

I don't know.
I guess it leaves us nowhere.

1072
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:52,911
So let's not
complicate things.

1073
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:56,813
Oh, I forgot
you like things simple.

1074
01:29:58,451 --> 01:30:02,785
- Right.
- Right.

1075
01:30:13,499 --> 01:30:16,263
Well, good luck.

1076
01:30:17,436 --> 01:30:19,870
Good luck to you too.

1077
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:26,005
I hope everything
works out... for you.

1078
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:35,714
So how's
that shoulder today ?

1079
01:30:35,788 --> 01:30:38,086
Need something
for the pain ?

1080
01:30:38,157 --> 01:30:40,489
Yeah.

1081
01:31:03,783 --> 01:31:07,048
Well, 14 more hours,
then back to reality.

1082
01:31:11,524 --> 01:31:13,754
- Frank ?
- Hmm ?

1083
01:31:13,826 --> 01:31:17,262
I don't think
we should get married.

1084
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:19,560
What ?

1085
01:31:19,632 --> 01:31:21,725
How come ?

1086
01:31:21,801 --> 01:31:25,237
Because I think it's wrong
for two people...

1087
01:31:25,304 --> 01:31:28,865
to get married when something
is hanging over their heads.

1088
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:34,140
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Robin, I'm sorry. I was-- I was--

1089
01:31:34,213 --> 01:31:38,149
I was distraught, and then she took off
her blouse. I was, "Oh, my God."

1090
01:31:38,217 --> 01:31:41,675
But l-l walked away. I did.
I went back to our room.

1091
01:31:41,754 --> 01:31:43,688
I tried to go to sleep,
but I thought of you. I thought--

1092
01:31:43,756 --> 01:31:46,281
Oh, I didn't know
if you were dead or what.

1093
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:50,056
So I went back to her bungalow,
you know, just to-- and she--

1094
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,496
Robin, she answered
the door with-- [ Stutters ]

1097
01:31:58,104 --> 01:32:00,629
You slept with Angelica ?

1098
01:32:00,706 --> 01:32:03,402
Who slept ?
Are you ki--

1099

How would I know ?

1101
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:11,578
Wait a minute. You just said
there was something hanging over our--

1102

What do you-- Wh--
What do you mean ?

Quinn and me.

1104
01:32:16,689 --> 01:32:19,453
Aha !

1105
01:32:19,525 --> 01:32:21,891
Oh, Frank,
something happened.

1106
01:32:21,961 --> 01:32:26,125
Something happened that shouldn't
have happened if you and I were really--
