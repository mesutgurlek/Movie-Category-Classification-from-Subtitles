303
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,313
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

- Make it official if you like.

- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

And that makes Rick a citizen

I understand you came here from Paris

It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

- I haven't the slightest idea.

Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,190
And that takes in the field
of women too.

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,516
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

Cannot return to his country."

The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

And also we know why you left Paris.

...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

378
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,594
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

379

In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

380
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,910
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

381
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,958
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

...until the day we marched in.

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,952
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

385
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,998
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

386
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,914
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

we shouldn't stay here.

396
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,958
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

397
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,192
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,628
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

767
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,355
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

768
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,039
What if you murdered all of us?

769
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,352
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

770
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,750
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

771
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,310
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

772
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,038
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

773
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,634
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

774
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,279
But there is one exception.

775
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,948
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

776
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,918
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

777
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,510
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

778
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,159
This is still unoccupied France.

779
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,319
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

780
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,074
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

781
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,199
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

782
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,513
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

783
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,830
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

784
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,272
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

785
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,192
Signor Ugarte is dead.

786
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,993
I'm making out the report now.

787
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,628
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

788
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,077
...or died trying to escape.

789
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,234
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

790
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,873
Good day.

791
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,640
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

792
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,749
Excuse me, captain.

793
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,838
Another visa problem has come up.

794
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,078
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

795
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,312
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

796
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,119
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

797
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,396
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

798
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,074
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

799
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,271
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

800
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,512
MAN:
Thanks.

801
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,199
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

802
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,391
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

803
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,834
Thank you very much, signor.

804
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,309
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

805
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,550
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

806
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,716
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

807
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,154
I never drink in the morning.

808
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,919
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

809
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,957
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

810
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,394
Here, sit down.

811
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,120
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

812
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,838
Bourbon.

813
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,957
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

814
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,157
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

815
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,233
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

816
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,356
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

817
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,748
Practically no one.

818
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,110
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

819
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,356
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

820
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,790
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

821
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,433
I'll handle the entire transaction.

822
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,154
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

823
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,793
And the carrying charges?

824
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,599
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

825
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,589
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

826
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,239
I'll tell him when he comes in.

827
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,914
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

828
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,272
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

829
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,632
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

830
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,997
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

831
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,037
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

832
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,469
LASZLO:
Morning.

833
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,068
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

834
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,074
MAN: You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

835
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,508
Only 700 francs.

836
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,757
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

837
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,912
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

838
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,509
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

839
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,195
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

840
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,309
Doesn't matter.

841
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,268
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

842
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,352
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

843
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,078
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

844
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,834
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

845
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,470
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

846
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,629
Yes.

847
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,030
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

848
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,759
I don't think I will, Rick.

849
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,388
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

850
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,033
I think I'm entitled to know.

851
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,316
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

852
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,032
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

853
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,668
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

854
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,072
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

855
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,039
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

856
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,474
If we leave it that way...

857
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,831
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

858
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,349
Not last night.

859
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,117
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

860
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,033
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

861
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,838
You can believe that if you want to.

862
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,634
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

863
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,552
Above a saloon, it's true...

864
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,119
...but walk up a flight...

865
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,918
...I'll be expecting you.

866
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,593
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

867
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,432
You'll be there.

868
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,869
No, Rick.

869
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,390
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

870
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,836
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

871
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,591
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

872
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,591
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

873
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,433
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

874
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,152
...I am influential and respected.

875
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,596
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

876
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,512
You, however, are a different matter.

877
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,158
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

878
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,552
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

879
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,877
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

880
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,792
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

881
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,270
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

882
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,756
We are only interested in two visas.

883
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,115
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

884
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,431
You two will want to discuss this.

885
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,477
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

886
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,918
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

887
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,311
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

888
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,278
But if the situation were different...

889
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,874
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

890
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,314
...would you take it?

891
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,509
Yes, I would.

892
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,795
Yes, I see.

893
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,674
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

894
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,956
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

895
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,629
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

896
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,269
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

897
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,039
I love you very much, Ilsa.

898
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,236
Your secret will be safe with me.

899
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,276
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

900
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,670
Not more than 50 francs.

901
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,918
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

902
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,311
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

903
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,357
Well, good luck, but be careful.

904
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,239
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

905
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,472
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

906
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,274
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

907
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,237
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

908
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,477
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

909
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,589
Yes, something.

910
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,832
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

911
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,911
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

912
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,032
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

913
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,669
Rick?

914
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,912
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

915
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,678
But it is worth a chance.

916
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,913
Thank you very much.
Good day.

917

In your own way, you were fighting

01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,879
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1224
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,474
You're a coward and a weakling.

1225
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,473
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1226
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,353
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1227
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,114
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1228
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,269
What of it?

1229
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1230
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,312
Now, if you'll...

1231
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,828
All right.

1232
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,956
I tried to reason with you.

1233
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,270
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1234
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,632
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1235
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,957
Put them on the table.

1236
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,709
No.

1237
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,791
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1238
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,874
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1239
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,151
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1240
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,029
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1241
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,557
Richard...

1242
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,995
...I tried to stay away.

1243
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,920
I thought I would never see you again.

1244
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,355
That you were out of my life.

1245
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,756
The day you left Paris...

1246
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,151
...if you knew what I went through.

1247
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,320
If you knew how much I loved you.

1248
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,999
How much I still love you.

1249
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,309
And then?

1250
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,432
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1251
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,990
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1252
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,798
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1253
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,474
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1254
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,830
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1255
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,269
Then it came.

1256
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,550
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1257
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,189
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1258
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,913
Then I met you.

1259
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,437
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1260
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,598
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1261
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,189
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1262
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,473
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1263
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,831
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1264
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,479
...and for those working with us.

1265
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,310
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1266
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,754
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1267
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,229
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1268
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,392
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1269
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,631
He was sick. He needed me.

1270
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,674
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1271
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,628
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1272
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,312
Well...

1273
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,232
...well, you know the rest.

1274
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,992
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1275
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,275
What about now?

1276
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,389
Now?

1277
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,639
I don't know.

1278
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,192
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1279
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,349
And Laszlo?

1280
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,837
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1281
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,197
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1282
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,793
All except one.

1283
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,553
He won't have you.

1284
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,312
I can't fight it anymore.

1285
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,230
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1286
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,032
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1287
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,191
You have to think for both of us.

1288
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,479
For all of us.

1289
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,520
All right. I will.

1290
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,118
Here's looking at you, kid.

1291
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,798
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1292
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,671
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1293
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,751
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1294
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,869
Come inside.

1295
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,676
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1296
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,598
LASZLO:
Thank you.

1297
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,390
RICK:
Carl, what happened?

1298
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,516
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1299
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,039
We escaped at the last moment.

1300
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,435
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1301
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,797
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1302
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,554
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1303
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,390
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1304
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,116
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1305
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,632
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1306
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,472
This might come in handy.

1307
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,749
Thank you.

1308
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,474
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1309
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,039
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1310
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,031
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1311
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,036
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1312
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,679
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1313
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,195
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1314
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,510
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1315
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,750
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1316
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,070
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1317
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,395
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1318
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,557
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1319
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,474
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1320
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,792
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1321
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,473
...and that you'll never succeed.

1322
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,790
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1323
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,988
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1324
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,476
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1325
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,352
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1326
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,318
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1327
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,550
The first evening I came into this café...

1328
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,950
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1329
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,352
Since no one is to blame...

1330
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,671
...I demand no explanation.

1331
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,991
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1332
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,673
All right.

1333
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,671
But I want my wife to be safe.

1334
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,313
I ask you as a favor...

1335
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,278
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1336
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,509
You love her that much?

1337
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,359
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1338
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,394
Well, I am also a human being.

1339
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,633
Yes, I love her that much.

1340
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,199
[CLATTERING]

1341
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,348
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1342
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,954
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1343
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,069
On what charge?

1344
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,356
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1345
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,159
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1346
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,433
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1347
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,830
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1348
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,518
You might as well let him go now.

1349
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,558
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1350
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,153
If you were to help him escape...

1351
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,629
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1352
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,155
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1353
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,312
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1354
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,438
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1355
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,397
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1356
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,879
They're all excellent reasons.

1357
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,917
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1358
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,390
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1359
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:00,111
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1360
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,713
Yes, I have the letters.

1361
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,632
But I intend using them myself.

1362
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,390
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1363
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,518
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1364
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,557
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1365
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,156
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1366
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,276
The last man I want to see in America.

1367
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,557
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1368
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,757
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1369
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,480
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1370
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,679
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1371
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,797
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1372
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,996
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,916
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1522
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,514
But that was all over long ago.

1523
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,831
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1524
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,878
I understand.

1525
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,156
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1526
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,552
I appreciate it.

1527
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,078
Welcome back to the fight.

1528
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,669
This time I know our side will win.

1529
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,910
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1530
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,039
Yes, I'm ready.

1531
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,359
Goodbye, Rick.

1532
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,997
God bless you.

1533
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,874
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1534
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,031
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1535
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,919
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1536
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,354
What you just did for Laszlo.

1537
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,829
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1538
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,230
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1539
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,351
But she knew you were lying.

1540
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,397
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1541
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,711
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1542
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,989
Especially for you.

1543
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,192
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1544
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,791
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1545
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,115
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1546
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,596
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1547
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,716
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1548
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,639
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1549
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,957
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1550
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,353
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1551
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,317
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1552
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,233
Major Strasser has been shot.

1553
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,360
Round up the usual suspects.

1554
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,711
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

1555
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,150
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1556
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,872
...but you've become a patriot.

1557
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,116
RICK: Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1558
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,151
I think perhaps you're right.

1559
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,469
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1560
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,995
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1561
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,789
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1562
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,194
I could use a trip.

1563
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,517
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1564
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,513
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1565
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,511
RICK: "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1566
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,719
RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1567
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,309
