gonna stay for dinner?

I did, but they never--
I'm not gonna use this place
anymore.

right there.

00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,801
So, John,
I have to apologize to you.

340
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,769
What?

341
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,771
You came in
and I-I sat you down,

342
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,558
and I just started blabbing
all about my life.

343
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,311
I get overly excited sometimes,
and I apologize.

344
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,313
I honestly am curious
to hear about you...

345
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,818
and, you know,
just want to-- want to
hear more about your life.

Well, uh, let's see.
I'm-I'm an editor.

I do freelance
editing work. Um--

348
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,332
I like to go to the movies.
I've got a pretty good
DVD collection.

350
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,837
what else do you
want to know?

351
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,804
I don't want to know
what you do.

352
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,306
I want to know what you are.
Who you are.

That's more what I'm--
what I'm interested in.

Are we really gonna--
You want me to? Okay.
I'm, uh-- I'm--

I'm divorced.

356
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,857
I got divorced, like,
seven years ago.

357
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:06,326
And it wasn't my idea.

358
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,864
It was--
You know, I got left.

359
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,869
Uh, I was kind
of digging myself
into a hole with my life,

360
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:17,838
and my wife at the time
was not happy with it.

361
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,376
Told me so.
Said to work it out.
I didn't work it out.

362
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,879
I ran away from her
emotionally...

363
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,346
and made a huge mistake...

364
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:31,386
and have been in kind of a dark,
existential place,
to tell you the truth.

365
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:34,890
And then I met your mom
at a party,

366
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,857
and, I don't know.

367
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,897
Seems like things are
looking up for the first time
in a long time.

00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,901
That's--
Wow.

your mom. I don't know.

Um, I think that's
between me and John.

377
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,895
[Cyrus]
Fair enough.

378
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,933
I was just messing around.
It's not, uh-- It's none
of my business.

379
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:22,938
It's valid. It's valid.
If I was in your position,
I'd probably be a little--

380
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:25,458
I mean-- Molly?
[Chuckles]

381
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,908
Seriously, don't fuck my mom.

382
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,446
I'm just kidding.
I'm just joking around.
Sorry. No.

Cy!
[Cyrus Laughs]

384
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,451
I know. I--
I'm sorry. Uh--

385
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,204
that's my attempt
at humor, John.

386
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,956
[Molly]
Okay.
That's, uh, just--

387
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,458
Enough said.
[Chuckles]

388
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,429
We did have sex.

389
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,468
I mean, if you want to be
adults about it, we did.
That's--

390
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,435
I'm sorry if that's
weird or whatever,

391
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,973
but I'm not gonna sit here
and pretend like we didn't.

That's not appropriate
to talk about here.

393
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,480
Okay. I mean, I don't want to
disrespect you by treating you
like a child or whatever.

treated like an adult, and--

That's just it. That's--
That happened, so--

That's--

397
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,494

it was really great...

401
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:53,144
what you did at dinner,
opening up to me like that.

402
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,898
And I know it was weird,
but I thought it was great.

have a new dad.

to my weird sense of humor.

00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:14,916
But I really thought that was--
that was a great thing
that you did.

were expressing in the kitchen

I love that about you,

and I'm sorry that I wasn't
as open about my boy.

No, that's fine.

428

It's your--

429
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,974
Yeah, I know.
your prerogative
not to say that stuff.

430
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,514
It's private, we just met,
and I was fine with it.
I mean--

431
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,016
He's a great kid too.
He is.

432

I'm glad you appreciate that.

433
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,985
I was going to leave,

434
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,523
and he was, like,
"No, come in, come in."

00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,026
I'm happy to hear that.

I'm happy to hear that.

437
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,032
And that's the thing.
He's so--

438
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,037
He's very mature,
as you can see,
in a lot of ways,

439
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,504
and he really pushes me.

440

But in other ways he's just--
he's not come into himself yet.

This could be a--
This is a very sudden--

You are very sudden.
[Chuckles]

to stay overnight--

446
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,565
since Cyrus, uh, was born.

447
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:47,534
So it's a new thing.

448
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:51,072
Well--
But to tell you the truth,
you didn't have me over.

449
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:53,074
I-- I stalked you over--

450
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,041
Yeah, you gave it a little--

451
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:59,330
I get seized sometimes,
so it's okay you're here.

Thanks for talking to me
about my--

456
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,097
I just feel a little--
No, I know.

457
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,076
N-N-N--

458
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,578
No, we leave the door open.

00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:00,106
Yep. How'd you sleep?
Good.

465
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,643
Good.
How'd you sleep?
Very well.

466
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:04,145
Good.
Nice.

467
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,113
So what's-- What's, uh--

468
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:10,151
What's going on?
What's the plan?

469
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:12,118
What are you guys doing?

470
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:15,657
Um, we go to Elysian Park
every morning and eat
a little breakfast...

471
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:18,427
and take some photos
for a few hours.

472
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,162
Yeah. Cyrus composes
to images of nature.

473
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:24,666
Sounds cool.
I am supposed to work.

474
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,172
Should I blow it off?

475
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:38,645
I'll just get it over with.

476
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,183
I'll get in there. Get it done.
Then I have less to do
next week, so--

477
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:44,686
Anyway, all right.

478
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,692
Here you go, Mom.
Did you guys
see my shoes?

479
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:54,195
- [Cyrus, Molly] No.
- They were right here.

480
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,198
Weird.

481
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,667
[Molly]
Okay.
[Cyrus Grunts]

482
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:06,174
Yeah. I can't believe
how deep into it I am already.

483
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:08,176
That's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

484
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:10,143
Thank you.
I really am.

485
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,644
It's amazing.
Is it that obvious?

486
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,682
Am I-- Am I glowing?
You actually are.
[Chuckles]

487
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,151
You look good.
Just, you know, slow down.

488
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,653
Let's just be here now.
Don't worry, I'm not--

489
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,691
I know. I just don't
want you, you know,
to obsess on this.

490
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,693
I was a little needy
out of the gate.
Yes.

491
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,197
I'll admit that.
But it's settling in nicely now.

492
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,202
And other than one little
weird blip this morning,

493
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:36,704
I am not concerned
about anything.

494
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,671
What? What is it?

495
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:43,211
Um, when I woke up this morning,
my shoes were missing
from their house.

496
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,713
Your white Adidas?
Yeah.

497
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,466
Your favorite shoes.
Oh, my God.

498
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,718
Well, then somebody
did you a favor.

499
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:53,186
Whatever.
It-It'll be fine.

500
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,724
- [Typing]
- [Cell Phone Rings]

501
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,698
- John?
- I definitely left my shoes
in their living room.

502
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,237
You know what I mean?
I wore shoes into the house.
Shoes-- John?

503
00:33:09,272 --> 00:33:12,740
Can we not have
this conversation
at 1:30 in the morning?

504
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:15,743
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea
what time it was.

505
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,212
But the more I think
about the shoes,

506
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,749
now it's like every look the kid
gave me seems really weird.

507
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,019
- Like he was
being friendly but--
- Yeah.

508
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:26,219
Will you please do me a favor
and meet them...

509
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,257
and tell me whether I'm the one
who's paranoid and crazy?

510
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,758
Sure.
Good night, John.

511
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,225
Fine. I will, okay?

512
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,264
It's got to be totally casual
and like it was an accident.

513
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,571
No.

514
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,609
Higher so that
it takes longer
and I can catch it.

515
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:50,111
Okay.

516
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,615
[Molly]
Yes.

517
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,619
Mmm. I love the ripples.
This looks incredible.

518
00:33:58,654 --> 00:34:02,088
There they are.
There they are.
Come on. Come on.

519
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,625
It ripples out almost
across the whole thing.
[John] Molly?

520
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,627
Hey.
[Cyrus]
Hey.

521
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,629
Oh, my gosh, Cyrus.
How's it going?
John.

522
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,131
How you doing?
[Jamie]
Hi.

523
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm Cyrus.
So nice to meet you.

524
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,635
[John] I was just saying,
"I wonder if they're
hanging out in the park."

525
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,602
- I'm Molly. We've met.
- This is Jamie.

526
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,604
- We go jogging here
all the time.
- You do?

527
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,143
Yeah.
That's so weird, because
we're here literally every day.

528
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,646
Yeah, you said that,
but I didn't make the--

529
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,149
I guess, I don't know.
I guess the jogging track--

530
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,652
We took a little bit of
a side diversion this time.
Yeah.

531
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,121
[Shutter Clicks]
What are you doing?

532
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,658
Your hair--
The light is hitting your hair
in this great way.

533
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:41,162
It's like a crippled tree
reaching for heaven.

534
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,165
John, would you do me
a huge favor?

535
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,631
Yeah, what?

536
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,169
Would you mind
getting into the tree?

537
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,639
Try one where
you get in the tree
just like a jaguar.

538
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,678
Like a jaguar?
Yeah, just climb up the tree
like a jaguar.

539
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,681
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

540
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,149
You're a natural.
[Clapping]

541
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,187
Now do one where you just
scream as loud as you can.

542
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,190
[Screams]
No, that's not screaming.
That's moaning.

543
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:11,692
[Chuckles]
You're bossy, Cyrus.

544
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,196
You look incredible right now.
I'm really trying to get
the most of this.

545
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:17,198
[John]
All right.
Now scream as loud as you can.

546
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:18,699

549
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,231
[Chuckles]
What did you think?
Did you like them?

550
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:53,234
Yes! I think
they're really sweet...

551
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:55,701
and, uh, kind--

552
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,703
And the wrestling
wasn't weird?
And quirky.

553
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,742
No, that was weird.
But, you know, in a good way.
I don't know.

554
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,496
I don't think it was,
like, "strange" weird.

555
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,749
I mean,
it wasn't "bad" weird.
You know?

556
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,518
They're really cool.
I like them.

557
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,253
They're cool, right?
They're fun.

558
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:13,719
They're fun.
They're great.

559
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,258
And I don't think
they stole your shoes.
[Chuckles]

560
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:20,726
Thank you for coming out here.
I appreciate it.

561
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,764
Don't worry.
All right, I'll see you
at the office in a second.

562
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,766
Relax, okay?
All right. Okay.

563
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:26,767
Okay.

564
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,270
You're the best, Jamie.

[Synthesizer]

566
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,946
Okay. That one.

567
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,449
That one's great.

568
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,451
No, let's skip that one.

00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:50,458
That's the perfect one.

572
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,963
Hello?

573
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,932
Hi.

574
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,970
No, no, no.
I don't need anything. Thanks.
I'll see you in a minute.

00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,472
Okay.

576
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,441
Who's that?

577
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,978
John.
He's gonna come by.

578
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,445
Cool.
Yeah.

579
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,983
I was-- I--
I was going to tell you
and then--

580
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:19,487
- I don't know.
We never talked about it.
- Okay.

581
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:21,954
Anyway,
he's coming over.

582
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,492
That was a lot.
You could have just said
"John's coming over."

583
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,994
I know.
I guess I could have.

584
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,499
- I feel weird.
- You don't have to
explain yourself.

585
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,501
I think it's nice that
John's coming to see you.

586
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:36,271
I think it's lovely,

587
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:38,971
but I still feel--

588
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,510
I feel really--
I feel really weird.

589
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:44,029
You feel weird?
Mm-hmm.

590
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,513
Why do you feel weird?

591
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,015
Are you okay
with all of this?
Yes.

592
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,019
If I was 10,
maybe I'd feel weird,
but I am a grown-up,

593
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,523
and you deserve somebody
who can love you--
[Knocking]

594
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,527
in a way that
I can't love you, and--
Okay. Okay.

595
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:02,029
I think it's great.
Okay.

Oh, hey.

00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,486
I was just looking
for your mom.

I think she's asleep.

Oh, okay.

616
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,495
Come here.

617
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,001
Come here.

618
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,004
You hungry?

619
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,009
I heard you scream,

620
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,014
and your mom didn't tell me
what was going on so--

621
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,487
Night terrors.

622
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,274
I used to get them a lot
when I was younger,

623
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,027
and I just recently
started getting them again.

624
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,995
I'm sorry.

625
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,033
I'll get through it.
Sounds terrible.

626
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:55,000
Um, I'm glad you're up,

627
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,037
because I've been wanting
to talk to you man-to-man.

628
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,045
No. I'm-- I'm all right.

629
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:11,051
I didn't want to say anything,
'cause Molly asked me not to,
but...

630
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:18,058
I think--
I think you might be
coming on a tad too strong.

631
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,062
Okay.

632
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,530
She said that?

633
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,569
She didn't say it
in those exact words but--

634
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,572
Wow. I mean--

635
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,577
I don't want to get into it, but
those were not the signals...

636
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,079
I was getting at all tonight.

637
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,583
In the past,

638
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,589
when she's losing interest,

639
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,594
she tends to
overcompensate sexually.

640
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,566
I just think that if you
pulled back 10% to 20%,

641
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,604
emotionally speaking,
you'd do a lot better
for yourself.

642
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,863
Wow.

643
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,615
Okay.

644
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,618
Okay, I'm gonna
go to sleep.

Did you see John this morning?

647
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,163
He actually left
last night.

648
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
Last night?

649
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,169
Come take a seat, Mom.

He...

feels that things
are moving really fast,

657
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,672
and...

658
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:51,211
I think he wants to just
slow down a little bit.

659
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,714
He said that?

660
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,216
Read the note.

661
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,221
I mean,
it's just so not like him.

Are you saying
that I'm making this up?

00:44:09,264 --> 00:44:11,697
No, I'm just--
I'm confused.

664
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,700
You're confused?
What do you mean
you're confused?

665
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,738
I'm just trying
to tell you the truth,
and you're, like, attacking me?

Mm-mmm.
No?

Molly, why don't you, uh--
why don't you sit down
for a sec, okay?

Sit down for a second.

Yeah.

Okay.

703
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:46,412
I don't want to
make this emotional.
I've decided to move out.

704
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:51,917
I'm an adult now, and I think
it's time for us to move on.

It's pretty sudden though.

- I rented a room.
- You rented a room?

707
00:46:56,922 --> 00:47:00,926
I found some musicians on
Craigslist, and I'm gonna rent
a room in their house.

708
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,928
And it's gonna be
better for both of us.

And besides,
you have John now,

710
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,933
and you guys need some space
for your relationship
to flourish.

This is so sudden.

- Maybe you're feeling
some anger or--
- I'm not angry.

just take it slowly,

It was the act
of taking the shoes
that was the big deal...

that he's been lying
the whole time I've known him.

he's leaving because of me,
he makes me the bad guy.

It's gonna be okay.

774
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,356
No, it's not.

775
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:07,366
I know it seems just weird
that it was so fast, but it
really is gonna be all right.

776
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:09,368
No, it's not okay!
Okay.

777
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:15,874
[Sniffles]

778
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,878
Let's just go to sleep.
Yeah.

779
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:37,896
Listen, I know you're tired
of me saying this.

780
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:39,398
So don't say it.

781
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:43,151
And it's upsetting
to hear.
It is.

782
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:45,904
But it's not
gonna be all right.

783
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,407
It's gonna be terrible.

784
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:50,409
[Laughs]

785
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:54,378
That's true.

786
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,415
Things are really
not gonna be okay.

787
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,918
That makes me feel better.

788
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:03,422
[Laughs]

789
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:08,677
Just be honest with me.

790
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:10,429
Yeah. Yeah.
[Laughs]

791
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:15,934
Thank you.
[Sniffles]
Thank you.

792
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:18,937
You're welcome.

793
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:26,445
[John]
I like you.
I want to be with you.

794
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:31,950
[Molly]
I love being with you.

795
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:47,466
[John]
I want to wake up
in the morning at your house...

796
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:49,933
instead of waking up
at my house going,

797
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:51,970
"I gotta get over to her house.
I miss her."

798
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:57,976
What do you think?

799
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,983
Did you just ask to move in?

800
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:07,486
Yes. I did.

801
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,959
So, hold on. Hold on. But...

802
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:19,498
I don't know which way the wind
is blowing with Cyrus.

803
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:22,000
And I don't know
how he's feeling.
Yeah, of course.

804
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:24,002
I don't think that he knows
how he's feeling and--

805
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:27,005
Let's take it day by day...

806
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,509
for as long as we can go.

807
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,520
[Molly]
Okay.

808
00:54:41,555 --> 00:54:43,522
Yeah, let's do this.

809
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,384
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

810
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:13,850
Right there.
Hmm?

811
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:16,638
I'm taking you right there.
[Chuckles]

812
00:55:16,673 --> 00:55:19,391
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?

813
00:55:23,395 --> 00:55:25,897
I want to get fucked.
You're naughty.

814
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:28,900
Mm-hmm.
[Moans]

815
00:55:28,935 --> 00:55:29,866
Hey, guys.

816
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:32,904
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[Screams]

817
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:33,905
What the--

818
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:35,872
Hey, man.

819
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:36,908
[Molly]
Cy--

820
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,911
Sorry for
interrupting you.
Good to see you.

821
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:41,913
Hi.
Yeah.

822
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,918
Uh, were you planning on
coming over?

823
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:48,687
We didn't get a message.

824
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,422
Just came home for a bit.

825
00:55:56,928 --> 00:56:00,432
That was, uh, bad timing
there, huh?

826
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,936
Can I have a hug?

827
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:08,905
Yeah.

828
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,942
Come here.

829
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:17,449
I went through something
really tough tonight.

830
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:21,418
Oh, baby.

831
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:22,954
What happened?

832
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:07,999
[Clears Throat]

833
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:15,507
He wants to come back home.

834
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:18,510
Okay.

835
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,513
He's been having
panic attacks.

836
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,015
Oh, no.

837
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:26,852
Hmm.

838
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,358
The weird thing is,
it was his decision, you know?

839
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:35,127
He is an adult and--
I mean--

840
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:36,827
But these
are panic attacks,

841
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:39,364
and that doesn't
have anything to do
with being an adult or not.

842
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:40,866
Yeah.
An adult, that's--

843
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,868
No. I know, I know.

844
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,370
Yep.

845
00:57:46,872 --> 00:57:47,873
Ohh.

846
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,878
Do you mind if
I go talk to him?

847
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,389
[Knocking]

848
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:08,894
Hey.

849
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:14,900
You can relax.
It's just me.

850
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:17,903
I'm sorry?

851
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,936
We should talk.

852
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:03,914
What the fuck are you doing
with all your shit in my room?

853
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:08,954
Oh, you're going to stop
bullshitting now? This is good.
[Shoes Drop On Floor]

854
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:11,957
You know,
I was gonna come back.

855
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:14,925
I was gonna apologize
to you both.

856
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,463
But after this shit
you just pulled? You just
fucked yourself, John.

857
00:59:18,964 --> 00:59:20,931
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hide my belt now?

858
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:23,969
You gonna light
a bag of shit on fire
in front of my door?

859
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:25,435
You are out of your league.

860
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,472
I will do
whatever it takes.
Listen to yourself.

861
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,975
What do you think
your mom would say if she
could hear you right now?

862
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:31,977
Who's going to
tell her? You?

863
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:33,944
Who do you think
she's gonna believe?

864
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:37,482
Her son, who needs her now
more than ever after his battle
with panic and anxiety,

865
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:40,986
or this new guy who clearly
wants her kid out of the way?

866
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,453
You listen to me,
you little weirdo.

867
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:46,992
If you want to mess with me,
I'm gonna mess with you
right back.

868
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:48,994
Oh, buddy.

869
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:54,699
Everything okay?

870
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:56,166
Yeah.

871
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:57,702
I was feeling
a little panicky.

872
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:02,707
I was talking to John about
how happy I am to be around
you guys right now.

873
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,711
The thought of going back
to that house...

874
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:10,180
makes me all...

875
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:11,681
fluttery and nauseous.

876
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:15,220
You don't have to
go back there, sweetie.

877
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,725
You know, um,

878
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:25,730
I've never told anybody
this before, but, uh,

879
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,234
I used to get
anxiety attacks.

880
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:31,201
You did?
Yeah.

881
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,203
So I know how scary
they can be.

882
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:36,741
Wow.
Did you have a good family
to help you get through it?

883
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:38,208
You know, I didn't.

884
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,245
I couldn't imagine
going through this alone.

885
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,711
Yeah, but I did.

886
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:44,499
It was terrifying.
I didn't know what was going on.

887
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:47,252
They didn't even call them
anxiety attacks back then.

888
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,754
I just thought
I was going crazy.

889
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,721
I almost left college.

890
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:54,224
But I decided to tough it out.

891
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,262
And that decision
made me who I am.

892
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:01,231
This could be that
moment in your life.

893
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,733
Where you go from
being a boy to being a man,

894
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:07,272
and you say, "You know what?
You're not gonna beat me."

895
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:14,279
- Do you guys not want me
to come home?
- No.

896
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,283
'Cause if so, just say so,
and I'll totally find
another place.

897
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:22,787
I'll figure something out.
That's not what
he's saying, Cyrus.

898
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:26,791
No. Not at all.
I'm not saying that.

899
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,758
Look.

900
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,795
You know what
the right decision is.

901
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,801
You know in your heart
what the right thing to do is.

902
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,305
When I looked in my heart,

903
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:43,308
I decided that it--

904
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,311
I decided that
coming back here...

905
01:01:46,346 --> 01:01:49,279
was not defeat,

906
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:52,317
but, in a way,
like a weird victory.

907
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:55,319
And if it's okay
with you, John,

908
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:57,822
I'd really like
to come back home.

909
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:04,329
[Mouths Words]

910
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,333
Okay.

911
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,800
Thank you, John.

912
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:13,338
You're an amazingly
selfless guy.

913
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,341
Thanks, buddy.

914
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:28,853
[Tim]
It's halftime.
Are you hungry, hon?

915
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:31,356
I am so fucked.

916
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:32,857
Honey?

917
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:40,865
I think it's time you
just had a conversation
with these people--

918
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,135
You know,
all three of you.

919
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,370
I can't.
I can't do that.
Why?

920
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:46,871
Because if I do,

921
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:49,874
it's just gonna be between me
and him, and she's gonna
pick him, and that's it.

922
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:52,342
I lose. I can't do that.

923
01:02:52,377 --> 01:02:55,845
But you tell me
she's supersensitive,

924
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,884
and if you really love her,
then have the conversation
with her.

925
01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:03,888
It doesn't, you know--
Just let the truth come out.

926
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,362
Good night.
Okay.

927
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:14,899
I love you.
I love you.

928
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,902
[Cyrus]
Good night.
Good night.

929
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:20,370
Oh, um,

930
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,908
I forgot to ask.
John, do you have
an extra tie I could borrow?

931
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,875
A what?

932
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:29,414
A tie.
I want to try and look nice
for the wedding tomorrow.

933
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:32,917
Uh, yeah. I think I do.

934
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:38,423
I've got a bunch of ties,
so I'll find one for you,
if you need it.

935
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,425
Thanks.
All right, good night.

936
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:54,439
Um, wow.
I didn't know that Cyrus
was coming with to the wedding.

937
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,941
Oh.

938
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:00,444
Yeah. Yeah. I-I--

939
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:02,947
I-I know it's a lot,

940
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:07,452
but he's going through
a lot, so--

941
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:09,954
Yeah.
Okay?

942
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:10,955
Okay.

943
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,424
Um,

944
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,461
I don't know
how to put this.

945
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:21,466
Uh,

946
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:25,219
do you ever feel like...

947
01:04:25,254 --> 01:04:27,972
Cyrus is not being...

948
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,978
a hundred percent genuine?

949
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,981
How do you mean?
I don't know.

950
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:40,985
I know he's going
through a lot, and I'm not
trying to deny that.

951
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,456
Um,

952
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:47,957
I mean, like--

953
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:49,493
I'm sorry.
Spit it out.

954
01:04:49,528 --> 01:04:50,960
No. Uh--
You're just--

955
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:54,499
He's behaving in a way
that I think...

956
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:57,001
is--

957
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:59,003
um--

958
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:02,972
All right,
I don't know how else to--

959
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:06,010
I wasn't gonna tell you
about this, but, whatever,
I'll show you.

960
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,522
My shoes were
in Cyrus's closet.

961
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:21,526
Hidden.

962
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:30,034
So, what--
what does that really mean?

963
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,002
I don't know.

964
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,039
You know,
sometimes I think--

965
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:40,044
and I want to put
this exactly right--

966
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:43,548
he might be...

967
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,049
acting...

968
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,519
out...

969
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:51,556
with this behavior.

970
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:56,310
How long have you
felt like this?

971
01:05:56,345 --> 01:05:58,528
Do I feel that way?
I don't know.

972
01:05:58,563 --> 01:06:03,568
I'm just unearthing things
in my own head right now.
I just--

973
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:05,837
You know what?
This is too important.

974
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:08,072
We should have Cyrus
come in here.
No.

975
01:06:08,107 --> 01:06:10,039
Let's talk about this.
No, no, no.

976
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:13,578
Trust me.
It will really put him
on the spot.

977
01:06:13,613 --> 01:06:16,045
He's having panic attacks.

978
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,583
We'll have a great time
at the wedding.
Are you sure?

979
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:21,586
Yeah. Yeah.

980
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,092
[Softly]
Cyrus.

981
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:04,628
[Gasps]
Shh, shh, shh.

982
01:07:04,663 --> 01:07:06,130
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

983
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:07,597
Cyrus. Shh.
It's me.

984
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,133
Are you all right?
Am I all right?

985
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,135
Yeah.
What are you
doing in my room?

986
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,137
I want to talk to you.

987
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,142
Listen, I know why
you want to come to
the wedding tomorrow.

988
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:24,614
This wedding is really,
really important to me.

989
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:29,654
And my ex-wife's feelings
are really, really
important to me.

990
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:33,157
And I know we've been messing
around with each other,

991
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:37,662
and it would be a great time
for you to mess things up
for me and your mom.

992
01:07:37,697 --> 01:07:39,128
I agree.

993
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,165
But here's the thing.

994
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:45,134
Do you know what it feels like
to be knocked unconscious?

995
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:49,673
Because if I sense for
one second that anything weird
is going on,

996
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:54,178
or you're even thinking
of pulling some shit,
I will knock you out.

997
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:56,681
Do you understand?

998
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,150
Yeah.
Good.

999
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:03,688
Then let's have a great time
at the wedding tomorrow, okay?

1000
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,689
How you doing, Roger?
Good. Good.
You look great.

1001
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:39,690
Thank you.

1002
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:50,166
Um,

1003
01:08:50,201 --> 01:08:52,703
you know this is a big day
for John, right?

1004
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:54,705
Yes.

1005
01:08:58,209 --> 01:08:59,710
Okay.

1006
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:09,185
I choose you to be mine.

1007
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,722
To live with you
and laugh with you.

1008
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:17,228
To stand by your side
and sleep in your arms.

1009
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:23,734
To be joy to your heart
and food for your soul.

1010
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:26,737
To bring out the best
in you always.

1011
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:33,744
Jamie and Tim,
please join hands
and repeat after me.

1012
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:37,247
[Woman]
I, Jamie, take you, Tim--

1013
01:09:37,282 --> 01:09:39,750
[Jamie] I, Jamie,
take you, Tim--

1014
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,503
to be my lawfully
wedded husband--

1015
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:44,755
to be
my lawfully wedded husband--

1016
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,774
to have and to hold--

1017
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,785
to have
and to hold--

1018
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,791
to love and to cherish--

1019
01:09:50,826 --> 01:09:52,763
to love
and to cherish--

1020
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,266
[Dance]

1021
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:18,789
John. John.
Yeah.

1022
01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:28,299
[Dance]
[Plays Notes]

1023
01:10:53,324 --> 01:10:54,825
[No Audible Dialogue]

1024
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:18,015
[Door Opens]
Oh, I'm in here.

1025
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:20,518
[Zipping]

1026
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:24,522
What?

1027
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:31,529
[Chuckles]
Cyrus, are you drunk?

1028
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:33,531
What happened?
How did you get drunk so fast?

1029
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:37,500
I saw the way you
looked at her, John.

1030
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:41,539
You can't marry her.
You'll never,
ever marry her ever.

1031
01:11:41,574 --> 01:11:43,506
Listen to me.

1032
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,508
Before you embarrass yourself,

1033
01:11:45,543 --> 01:11:48,546
let me call you a cab
and send you home,
'cause you're drunk.

1034
01:11:48,581 --> 01:11:50,047
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay away from my mother.

1035
01:11:50,548 --> 01:11:52,515
What'd I warn you
about last night?

1036
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,553
Don't you do this to me!
She's all I have!
Don't marry her!

1037
01:11:55,588 --> 01:11:58,073
Knock it off!
You're not gonna
take her away from me!

1038
01:11:58,108 --> 01:12:00,558
Calm the fuck down!
You'll never fucking
punch me, John!

1039
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,060
- Get your shit together!
- Just leave us the fuck alone!

1040
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:05,563
Fuck you!
She's all I fucking have!

1041
01:12:05,598 --> 01:12:08,531
Go, John!
Go! Just go away!

1042
01:12:08,566 --> 01:12:11,068
- Just go away
and leave us the fuck alone!
- Put some water on your face!

1043
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:12,570
Stop it!
Leave us alone!

1044
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,071
You stop it!
Stop it!

1045
01:12:14,572 --> 01:12:16,038
What are you doing? Hey!

1046
01:12:16,073 --> 01:12:17,825
Hey! Hey!
I'm not doing anything!

1047
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,719
What, are you
out of your mind?

1048
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:21,544
You stop it!
[Cyrus]
He hit me.

1049
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:24,081
- Did you hit him?
- He attacked me
in the bathroom!

1050
01:12:24,116 --> 01:12:26,048
Did you hit him?

1051
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:28,085
[Cyrus]
He hit me.
[Jamie] John!

1052
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,101
Open your eyes, Molly.

1053
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:35,820
[John]
He went crazy in the bathroom.

1054
01:13:35,855 --> 01:13:37,787
Well, I didn't see
that part.

1055
01:13:37,822 --> 01:13:40,825
I didn't even know
that happened.
So, what did you think?

1056
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,327
Did you think
that I suddenly--
I wasn't thinking.

1057
01:13:43,828 --> 01:13:45,795
tackled Cyrus
and was beating him up?

1058
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:49,333
- How could you
think that about me?
- I just reacted.

1059
01:13:49,368 --> 01:13:52,837
I just saw my son
on the floor being hurt.

1060
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:57,306
From the moment
that I met you,

1061
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:02,346
as soon as your son
became aware of it, he made it
his mission to split us up.

1062
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:05,314
Every step of the way,
every overture I made,

1063
01:14:05,349 --> 01:14:09,854
every time I tried to be
understanding and reach out
to him, he's shut me down.

1064
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,320
He hates me, Molly.

1065
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:13,858
- He hates me.
- He's having a really
tough time.

1066
01:14:13,893 --> 01:14:15,359
He's not having a tough time.

1067
01:14:15,394 --> 01:14:16,861
Your son hates me.

1068
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:21,365
And I gotta say,
I fucking hate him too.

1069
01:14:35,379 --> 01:14:37,381
Nothing here
between us that's...

1070
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:43,387
worth taking
another look at?

1071
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:45,855
You and I--

1072
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:48,392
We do have something.

1073
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:52,396
And I know how rare it is,

1074
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,899
because it's
been a long time...

1075
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:58,903
since I had anyone
close to someone like you.

1076
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:04,373
But I am not prepared...

1077
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:08,162
to get deeper into it and
hoping it's gonna work out,

1078
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:11,916
and then two years down the line
it's not gonna work out,

1079
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:14,418
and you guys have each other,

1080
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,888
and I'm alone again.

1081
01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:23,427
I just think
there's so much here
between us and--

1082
01:15:26,931 --> 01:15:29,934
He's gonna not--
He's gonna wreck it.

1083
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,942
So that's it.

1084
01:15:37,977 --> 01:15:39,944

[Molly]
I've been thinking
about us, and...

1088
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,992
I feel like
I've missed a few things
in our relationship.

1089
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:31,996
And I feel that
I've done you a disservice...

1090
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:36,000
with the way that I raised you,
in some aspects.

1091
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,507
[Cyrus]
I'm so proud of...

1092
01:16:44,008 --> 01:16:46,010
who we are
and how close we are.

1093
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:49,513
I don't think
there's any reason...

1094
01:16:49,548 --> 01:16:52,016
to feel negatively about that.

1095
01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:56,520
[Molly]
The fact that you and I
have a hard time...

1096
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:58,522
letting another person...

1097
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:02,026
hang out with us is...

1098
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:07,031
unhealthy for us, I feel.

1099
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:11,035
I don't want you
to think that...

1100
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:17,041
I want you to be alone forever
or want you to be unhappy.

1101
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:23,047
I want you to find somebody
and be with him.

1102
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:30,554
But I know in my heart
that John is not that person.

1103
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:39,063
[Molly] There are things
that are happening
from all sides of this.

1104
01:17:39,098 --> 01:17:41,030
I-I--

1105
01:17:41,065 --> 01:17:44,068
I know what happened
with the shoes.

1106
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,541
Who cares? It's shoes.

1107
01:17:52,576 --> 01:17:55,079
It's so stupid.
It's shoes.
I don't care about shoes.

1108
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:02,586
But I care if
you're lying to me.

1109
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:12,096
[Cyrus] I used to feel like
you and I had a special
little thing, and now...

1110
01:18:12,131 --> 01:18:14,598
I'm feeling like you...

1111
01:18:15,599 --> 01:18:18,102
are letting me go away.

1112
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:25,609
[Molly]
No one will ever...

1113
01:18:25,644 --> 01:18:27,611
ever take your place.

1114
01:18:28,612 --> 01:18:30,114
Ever.

1115
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:36,620
[Cyrus]
Well, I'm happy he's gone.

1116
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:46,630
[Molly]
I'm not happy right now.

What do you want?

1120
01:19:35,846 --> 01:19:38,348
I want you to come back
and live with us.

1121
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,352
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1122
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:45,320
Come on,
just go home, Cyrus.

1123
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:47,107
It's not the same anymore!
Oh, it's not the same?

1124
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:48,859
No. She's depressed!
That's 'cause you
fucked it up!

1125
01:19:48,894 --> 01:19:51,361
She misses you, John!
I know you love her!

1126
01:19:51,396 --> 01:19:52,828
Yeah, I know!

1127
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:55,365
We had a great thing,
and you fucked it up!

1128
01:19:55,866 --> 01:19:59,870
Please, John. Just hear me out
and then you can make
the decision for yourself.

1129
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:02,838
I'll move out.
I'll do whatever you want.

1130
01:20:02,873 --> 01:20:05,375
Don't punish her
'cause I'm a fucked-up person.

1131
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,342
I-I-- It's--

1132
01:20:07,377 --> 01:20:09,880
It's not her fault.
No, it's not her fault!

1133
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,883
It's not her fault!
It's your fault!

1134
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:17,853
So you just live with that,
you asshole!

1135
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:22,392
It's your fault that I'm back
in a shitty apartment all alone!

1136
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:25,896
You're a little fucking liar
and an asshole!

1137
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:27,397
So fuck you!

1138
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:34,905
Go away!

1139
01:20:43,914 --> 01:20:45,415
Are you still out there?

1140
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:22,452

Let me ask you something.

1144
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,476
Were the panic attacks
real or fake?

1145
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:51,982
They were real at first,
and then...

1146
01:21:53,483 --> 01:21:56,486
sometimes I would fake them
to get sympathy from Molly.

1147
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:04,459
[Sniffles]

1148
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:06,496
I brought you something.

1149
01:22:08,999 --> 01:22:11,001
It's mixed,
but it's not mastered.

1150
01:22:11,036 --> 01:22:13,003
So it's not final.

1151
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:21,511
I think I might be
a really fucked-up and
dysfunctional person, John.

1152
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,022
You did some
fucked-up stuff.

1153
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:37,527
But it's my fault too.

1154
01:22:44,534 --> 01:22:47,037
How'd you get through
all these panic attacks?

1155

[Chuckles]

1156
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:56,546
I'm sorry.
I never had panic attacks.

1157
01:22:57,547 --> 01:23:00,050
I made that up
to try to get rid of you.

I was desperate.
I had to come up
with something.

You were boxing me out.

You're good, John.

Well, you're good.

Would you mind--

01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:40,090
Would you mind
giving me a ride home?

1167
01:23:42,092 --> 01:23:44,094
Okay. Is your mom home?

1168

No.

1169
01:23:47,097 --> 01:23:48,598
All right. 'Cause--

01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,068
I don't know. I'm just--

to talk to her yet.

right here, if that's okay.

No problem.

I have some of your stuff
in the garage that you left.
