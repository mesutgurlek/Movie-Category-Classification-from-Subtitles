00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:19,343
Hey, Jules?
I have got to interview you

163
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,961
for this piece
that I'm writing.

164
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,814
Sure, Annabelle, great.
I'd be honored.

165
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:26,483
Call Julie about interview.

166

The article?

171
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:45,268
It's about our generation
turning 30.

172
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:50,974

Oh, my life, I am so busy.

173

174

I don't want to see you,
you want to see me?

175

Yeah. Would a breakfast work?

176

our generation turning 30."

178
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,079

188

Just your face.

190
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:49,649
JULIE: I forgot to tell you.
Do you know what
Annabelle's doing now?

191
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,568
Sarah told me. A blog.

192
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,636
Of what?

193
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,706
What do you mean "of what"?
A blog of Annabelle.

194
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,509
Of every thought that
passes through her brain.

195
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,761
Her stupid,
vapid, insipid...

196
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,249
I could write a blog.

197
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,102
I have thoughts.

198
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,470
And you're a writer,
which is more than
I can say for Annabelle.

199
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,838
If only that were true.

200
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,490
You wrote a novel.

201
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:17,161
Half a novel. And no one
wanted to publish it.

202
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,047
You're not a writer
unless someone
publishes you.

203
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:22,131
See, that's what's
so great about blogs.

204
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,834
You don't have
to be published.

205
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:29,473
You can just go online,
press enter and
there it is, out there.

206
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,508
What would I write
a blog about?

207
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,260
You're an editor, tell me.

208
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:36,997
Why don't you write about
how much you love Queens?

209
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,550
A short blog.

210
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:46,239
You could write
about your job.

211
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,292
If I wrote a blog
about my job

212
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,661
and anyone at work
ever read it...

213
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,029
I mean, hello.

214
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,931
This is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,566
This is really good.

216
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,901
On top of which,
the whole idea
of writing a blog

217
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,120
is to get away
from what I do all day.

218
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:03,257
The way that cooking
is a way that I get away
from what I do all day.

219
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,558
So write a blog
about cooking.

220
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:11,631
I'm not a real cook,
like Julia Child
or Mario Batali.

221
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,467
Julia Child wasn't
always Julia Child.

222
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,626
If I really wanted
to learn to cook,

223
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,162
I could just
cook my way through
Julia Child's cookbook.

224
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,431
I could blog about that.

225
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,585
I have a copy.
I stole it from my mother
last time I was in Texas.

226
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,656
When I was eight,

227
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:39,276
my father's boss
came to dinner and
it was a really big deal,

228
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,145
and my mother made
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

229
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,881
But it wasn't just
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

230
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,183
It was Julia's
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

231
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,552
And it was like
she was there,

232
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,322
like Julia was
there in the room,

233
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:58,629
on our side like some
great big good fairy.

234
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,581
And everything was
going to be all right.

235
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:09,205
<i>I'm gonna try to flip</i>
<i>this thing over now,</i>

236
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,792
<i>which is a rather</i>
<i>daring thing to do.</i>

237
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,211
She changed everything.

238
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,379
Before her,
it was frozen food

239
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,481
and can openers
and marshmallows.

240
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,501
Don't knock marshmallows.

241
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,503
<i>When you flip anything,</i>

242
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:28,075
<i>you've just got</i>
<i>to have the courage</i>
<i>of your convictions.</i>

243
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:31,445

<i>a loose sort of mass like...</i>

<i>Oh, that didn't go very well.</i>

245
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,050
<i>But, you see,</i>
<i>when I flipped it,</i>

246
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,654
<i>I didn't have</i>
<i>the courage I needed...</i>
<i>- She's so adorable.</i>

247
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,640
<i>...the way I should've.</i>

248
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,776
<i>But you can always</i>
<i>put it together.</i>

249
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:52,682

<i>in the kitchen.</i>
<i>Who's to see?</i>

250

I've never eaten an egg.

And I have a hyperacidic
stomach. We'll deal.

460
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,386

461
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:23,089

I've had eggs in, like, cakes.

486
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:29,756
Never had an "egg" egg.
I was a very willful child.

<i>would be simple.</i>

Oh, maybe

496
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,579
Julia says the eggs
have to be fresh.

497
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:55,648
They are fresh.

498
00:28:55,715 --> 00:29:00,119
Okay. You don't have
to bite my head off.
I'm just quoting Julia.

00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,979
How cute is that?

505
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:21,240

were going to be greasy

506
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,810
cheese sauce. Yum.

507
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:27,746
Julia Child,
you are so good.

00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:29,282
Cheers.
- Cheers.

509
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,951
And, may I say, excellent wine?
- Mmm-hmm.

510
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,719
Do you think
Julia knows about you?

511
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:35,504
I wish.

512
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:37,223
I have this fantasy
that she comes for dinner

513
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,358
and I show her
my new lemon zester.

514
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,227
We become very close.

515
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,998
The truth is,
no one knows about me.

516
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:49,985
I feel like
I'm just sending things
into this giant void.

00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:53,672
Which reminds me.
Annabelle's blog.

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,307
Yes.

519
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,093
It's sort of funny.

00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,628

His name's Lester.

And they do it

524
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,205
People love it.
It's a huge hit.

What do you think
it means if you don't

It's completely normal.

Today we will begin

First, you must make sure
that the egg is fresh.

Well, for something
a little more advanced,

But you are
not an advanced cook.

But I do know
how to boil an egg.

542

Do you know how
to bone a duck?

543
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:25,147
No, but that's exactly
the sort of thing

544
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:28,818
that I'm very interested
in learning how to do.
- Mmm.

There is one other class,

And the hand,
the other hand,
you must protect it.

558
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:34,149
Here, you must cut
only the onion. Yes?

Yes.

Well, that's not true.

Paul designed all of
the secret war rooms

- On top of which,

I have to bone a whole duck.

- At some point.

- No, I can't.

Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction.

You whisk them together,

and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids
in the butter

1046
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:57,648
so that the butter,
instead of melting,
becomes this
