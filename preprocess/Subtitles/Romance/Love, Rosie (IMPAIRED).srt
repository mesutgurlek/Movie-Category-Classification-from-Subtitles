And free champagne!

1447
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,754
All right, follow me and then...

1448
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,346
Yeah, a brand new bed, and...

1449
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,344
It's massive and you
get to see the sea.

1450
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:16,850
And it's... It's really pretty.

1451
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,552
You'll love it.
You'll love it.

1452
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:49,582
Uh...

1453
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:50,713
Hi.

1454
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,261
Hi...

1455
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,049
Uh...

1456
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:05,598
Hey, guys!

1457
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,734
KATIE: No, I want to see him!
PHIL: Come on, out. No, out.

1458
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,169
I said out!
Come on, out, out, out!

1459
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,903
- KATIE: No, but I...
- (LAUGHING)

1460
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,447
Um...

1461
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,407
So, I, uh...

1462
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,488
I guess I need a room.

1463
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,786
Any baggage?

1464
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:25,793
No.

1465
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:28,334
I left it behind.

1466
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,878
So your wife...

1467
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,630
Won't be joining me.

1468
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:38,631
We both knew it wasn't right.

1469
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:44,186
Sea view or garden view?

1470
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,765
I... (GULPS) recommend the sea.

1471
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,645
Um, sea it is.

1472
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,699
One room with sea view.

1473
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,654
Um, Ruby would you mind
showing our guest upstairs

1474
01:35:00,655 --> 01:35:02,655
to his room? Please.

1475
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:07,035
Sorry, chief,
but I'm really busy doing
the files right now.

1476
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,957
Um, please, follow me.

1477
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,085
(CHUCKLES)

1478
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:17,754
(CHUCKLES)

1479
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:22,843
So, I had this weird dream
on the plane over...

1480
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:25,140
Let me guess,
you were a clip on the seatbelts?

1481
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,312
- (CHUCKLES)
- No, I know,

1482
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,680
you were, um, a valve in
those annoying fans

1483
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:31,081
that blow cold air on you?
I can never turn those things off.

1484
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,574
No.

1485
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,702
No, uh...

1486
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,708
I was me.

1487
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,754
And you were you,

1488
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,709
standing where you
are right now, perfect.

1489
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,967
And I took you in my arms,
in a manly kind of way.

1490
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:05,476
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1491
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,765
Like this.

1492
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,397
<i>And said,</i>

1493
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:16,446
"Rosie Dunne,
can I take you to the dance?"

1494
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:19,482
(CHUCKLES)

1495
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,155
Better late than never.

1496
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,657
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1497
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:42,338
(GIGGLES)

1498
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:10,908
(LAUGHING)
