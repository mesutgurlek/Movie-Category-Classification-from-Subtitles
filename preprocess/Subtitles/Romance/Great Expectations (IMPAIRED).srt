Estella?

506
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,357
Excuse me.

Haveyou seen Estella?

Finn:
Dinsmoorwas weirderthan usual.

509
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,237
But I had to see Estella.

510
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,689
I never come here.
Never.

You knowwhy?

512
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,288
26 years ago,
I trusted.

513
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:27,735
I saved myself.
I was a virgin.

514
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:31,398
It's funny, hmm?

515
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:34,739
Those were the times.
That's how I was raised.

517
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:41,541
What kind of creature
takes such a thing?

518
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:43,949
Such a gift? Atrust?

519
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,453
Who does this?

520
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:48,251
Takes advantage
of a 42-year-old woman?

521
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:49,757
What kind of creature...

522
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:53,852
Ieaves this woman
waiting like a fool?

523
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:58,866
A man. A man does this.

524
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:00,834
So men must pay.
Am I right?

525
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,864
Estella will make men weep.

526
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,306
Doyou knowwhere she is?

527
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,037
Oh,yes.
She'll breakthem.

528
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:11,602
I taught herwell.
When she returns...

529
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,047
she'll cutthrough them
like a hot knifethrough butter.

530
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,083
Chicka-boom.

531
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:17,813
Returns?

00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:19,013
Oh, my dear boy...

didn'tyou know?

534
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:24,321
Estella's left
for school abroad.

535
00:39:24,393 --> 00:39:26,486
Switzerland for 2 years,
then Paris.

536
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:29,087
She's gone.
Didn't she say good-bye?

537
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:32,532
Oh, I'm sure she meantto.

the puppy up-- puppy--

back into town...
