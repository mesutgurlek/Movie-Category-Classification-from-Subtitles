- Morning.
- I can make you some eggs.

160
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,089
That's okay. I've got to go to work early
for some meeting.

164

SEAN: Your uncle shut down Ocean Drive
yesterday.

165
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,599
Sarah, go brush your teeth.
We're gonna leave in five minutes.

Why are you acting like this?

173

is a long shot. At best.

She works at this shipping company,

181

management training program.

Well, let's hope so.

190

your butts kicked by a singing cat.

I came to Miami for one reason.</i>

193

To turn the Dimont into the top destination
in South Beach.

194
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,423
And that's just the beginning
In the coming months,

195
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,760
I plan to break ground
on a new hotel and residential complex.

196
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,268
And after that, continue building
the greatest hotels Miami has ever seen.

197

If you work hard for me,
I will be loyal to you.

198

Mr. Ryan, for example, started working for
me when he was still in business school.

199
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,564

of the Dimont.

I don't understand why.

Look at it from my perspective.

It's like I'm rewarding you
for dropping out of college.

- It's one thing to dance when you're a kid,
