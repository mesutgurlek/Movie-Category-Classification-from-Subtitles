00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,502
But no one's looking
for another brand of tequila.

00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,936
They've got the three... What is it?

11
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,973
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

12
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,677
And they don't need more tequila.

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,675
- If I can't sell it, it's not gonna sell.
- People want the new-new.

- The "new-new"?
- The "new-new."

No!

17
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,177
What if I could sell this tequila
to a customer?

18
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,414
- Would I have your order then?
- (LAUGHS) Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,252
And I'm just gonna pick a customer
at random.

Excuse me, sir.

21
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,819
Do you enjoy the taste of tequila?

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,890
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Why, yes, I do.

23
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,264
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

24
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,401
- It's a perfect candidate.
- Because it's your brother!

25

I know that's your brother.

26
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,234
He dated my niece.

27
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,398
Look, mate, I don't know your niece.

28
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,406
- Okay.
- But if I did...

29
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,376
I'd say she was a little clingy,
and she'd freak a lot of people out.

- Name's Rick. Just got in from Melbourne.

Mom, do you hear this river of horse shit
coming out of Dad's mouth?

163
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,146
We don't want you showing up stag
and riling each other up!

164
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,723
- We don't rile each other up!
- We never get riled up!

165
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,019
- I don't get riled!
- He doesn't and I don't, either!

166
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,886
Look at you right now! You're riled!

167
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,191
- Take your head out of your ass, Dad!
- You sound insane right now.

168
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,857
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

169
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,230
You guys bringing wedding dates
was my idea.

170
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,364
Look, I love the shit out of you guys.

171
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,541
But everyone is already stressed out
about this wedding...

172
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,574
and I just need you to be cool.

173
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,470
Of course, Jeanie!

174
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,978
Please?

175
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,174
For me?

176
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,751
I promise. We would never do anything
to mess up your wedding.

177
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,582
MIKE: Jeanie, we love you.

178
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,400
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,468
Yeah.

180
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,636
You, too, Eric.

181
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:20,922
- Oh.
- Oh. Thank you.

182
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,205
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

183
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,273
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,308
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

185
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,458
All right, it's settled then.

186
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,301
Wedding dates!

187
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,196
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

188
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,433
I'm sorry to lump you in with Mike...

189
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,270
but if I only told your older brother
to bring a date...

190
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,037
he'd get all weird about it.

191
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,339
I just feel like he's holding you back.

192
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,039
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

193
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:43,615
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

194
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,808
when Mom made those cupcakes...

195
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,247
and I called them moist?

196
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,719
- Mm-hmm.
- Everyone called me Moist...

197
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,789
till Mike took a cupcake...

198
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,587
and shoved it in Tom Ginty's face.

199
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,062
He said, "Now you're moist, Moist."

200
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,294
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

201
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,094
So, think on that...

202
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,233
Dad.

203
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,635
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end that
on such a weird note, Dad.

204
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,803
- I love you. And thanks.
- Good. I don't want you to be mad.

205
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,023
I'm not even mad. I'm not even upset.

206
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:13,138
We're gonna find some dates.

207
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,842
TATIANA: I gotta say, some nights,
I am not looking my best.

208
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:19,054
But tonight is not one of those nights!

209
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:20,164
(LAUGHS)

210
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,450
- Do you like my hair?
- Yeah, girl.

211
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,114
- You look good.
- No.

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,452
We're gonna make a lot of tips tonight.

213
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:26,626
Good. We need it. We don't have any money.

214
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,589
Uh, you got money for this ride, don't you?

215
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,408
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

216
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:31,475
(WHISPERING) 'Cause you have money?

217
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,576
I thought you had money.

218
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:33,644
I don't have any money.

219
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:34,713
You know I don't have money.

220
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,330
Yeah, y'all are whispering like people
that don't got money.

221
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,941
Check it out. I'mma pay you right now.

222
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,752
Boop. I Apple Paid.

223
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:41,970
I don't even have Apple Pay.

224
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,008
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

225
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,290
He's already paid.

226
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,358
God damn it!

227
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,850
I'm not gonna take shit from you,
because this my cab.

228
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,429
You shouldn't take shit from us.

229
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,731
- You should kick us out!
- You should kick us out of this cab.

230
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,901
You know what? I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

231
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,203
Yeah, just go three more blocks up
on the right...

232
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,318
and then kick us out!

233
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:01,459
- (BRAKES SCREECHING)
- Here we are!

234
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,821
Get out of my cab.

235
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,296
Thank you. You're a really good person.

236
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,491
Okay, God bless you.

237
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,137
I'm just gonna start driving for Uber.
Fuck it.

238
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,594
Ooh. I got a good idea.

239
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,434
Let's pop off, get a couple of drinks
before work.

240
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,668
Just a few,
because I don't want to get hammered.

241
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,335
Yeah, of course not. Just a light buzz.

242
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,173
(ALL CHEERING)

243
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,318
Hey, hey, hey!

244
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,012
Welcome to Sake Bombers...

245
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,385
where your first Sake Bomb is on us!

246
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,458
- Kaboom!
- You're drunk, Alice.

247
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,304
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

248
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,522
but you're really yelling.

249
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,993
Because I'm upset with you.

250
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,188
Oh, what the hell?

251
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,677
ALICE: I don't understand why you just
started yelling at me for no reason.

252
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,564
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your little buddy is shit-faced.

253
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:45,506
Straight up.
Her fiancé just left her at the altar.

254
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,786
She's been going through a hard time.

255
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,955
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, baby girl.

256
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,514
You know how many times
I have come in here...

257
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,619
and she is drunk off her fucking ass,
dancing on the tables?

258
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,915
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

259
00:09:58,078 --> 00:09:59,819
I am a strong independent woman.

260
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,653
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

261
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,806
Because it's my right. America!

262
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:06,887
Feminism!

263
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,499
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

264
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,032
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

265
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:13,280
# 2016. Women can do shit now.

RONNIE: Don't do that!

268
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:19,200
Who put her jam on?

269
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,536
Queen RiRi, forever!

270
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,613
I'm really sorry that I got us fired.

271
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,077
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

272
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,685
- but I'm still really sorry.
- Hey!

273
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,088
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

274
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,283
You didn't do one thing wrong.

275
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,754
- Okay.
- People need to get in line with you.

276
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,953
Right. You're right.

277
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,859
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

278
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,509
FATHER MIKE ON VIDEO:
And Alice... do you take Luke?

279
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:42,610
I do.

280
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,566
ALICE: Because it's therapeutic.
The more I watch it, the less I feel.

281
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,763
FATHER MIKE: And do you, Luke, take Alice?

282
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:47,962
I do...

283
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,397
not.

00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:54,942
Oh, fuck that guy.

287
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,443
Fuck him right in his dick.

288
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:57,639
No!

289
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:01,582
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

290
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,154
And it makes me want to protect it.

291

Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

292

vodka pot brownies with me...

for the junior high science fair?

296
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,929
Or gave us water balloon tits and we won
that wet T-shirt contest in Mexico?

297

Oh, yeah, they were so nice.

298
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:22,069
I know, dude. We need that shit.

299
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,901
I'm tired of living like this.

300

We need an adventure.

that's where you go to meet nice girls?

00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,247
And you wuv this couch, don't you?

321
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,448
I do love that couch.

322
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,882
DAVE:
I'm gonna unlock the swag on this bitch.

323
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,202
All right.

324
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,922
Here you go. Just take a little sip.
Take a little nip-a-roo.

Boom!

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,578
Do you think anyone's even really gonna
see this?

328
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,659
God, I hope so.

329
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,131
Like max, what do you think?

330
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,968
We're gonna get, like, five or six dates
out of this, or what?

331
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,734
I'd be happy with that.

332
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:35,760
Hey.

333
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,286
Did you see this thing
that Shelly's sending around the office?

334
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,580
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

335
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,300
Look what someone posted to my Facebook.

336

- WOMAN 1: Those guys are cute.

Oh, I got the one on the right.

340

I like the one on the right.

341

- TANISHA: Let's all apply!

WOMAN A:
Let's just meet them, give 'em a chance.

344
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,434
So, you guys want to go to a wedding?

No way.

357
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,896
Did you guys say something about
an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii?

358
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,260
It's just for girls.

That's not a deal breaker.

Hi, my name is Lauralie...

Online dating. Yeah.

365

I'm not really looking
for a heteronormative relationship.

- Goddamn right, I do.

Our sister loves dogs.

00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:43,595
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

370
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,676
What's a good home?

371
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,483
The white homes.

372
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,592
- The what homes?
- The white homes.

373
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:49,954

All right, look, here's the deal.

379
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,102
I went through a divorce, like,
three weeks ago. I need a vacation.

No.

381

Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

- What?
- Nothing.

- Nothing.

Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

385

Do you wanna fuck?

- What?
- What?

387
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,082
- What?
- You guys...

388
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:17,346
- Do you want me to fuck you?
- No.

- No.
- I didn't say it, but...

I'm here with Mike and Dave Stangle...

who posted an ad on Craigslist...

396
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,901
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

397

in Oahu, Hawaii.

398

from women who actually wanted to go.

402

Yeah, well, who's counting?

finding nice girls...

to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.

408

And I just want to reiterate...

409
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,263
we're footing the bill for this
because we're gentlemen.

- WENDY: Come on. Craigslist.
- What's up?

That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.

You know what else you can find
on Craigslist?

- Love.
- Mm-mm.

That's right. I said it.

Yeah, and he's also super hot.

Yeah, he's hot as fucking balls.

But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

Like, girls that our mom and our sister
would like.

Okay, look, dude, we are going to Hawaii.

Let's go on vacation.

But it's not a vacation. It's a wedding.

427
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,599
Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

Since the last wedding I went to
was mine...

is perfect, okay?

you haven't been the same.

You know what I'm saying?

480
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:52,104
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

481
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,399
it's like the guys interviewing the girls.

482
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,069
Like, it immediately would put us
in an inferior position.

483
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,237
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

484
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,677
- Those guys would be lucky to have us.
- Right.

485
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,911
- We just gotta make them think so.
- Okay, right.

486
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,182
But, you know,
I'm really not good at lying...

487
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,600
because I always try to start small
and then it gets crazy...

488
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,388
and I make-up stuff
that couldn't possibly be true.

489
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,306
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

490
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,374
Okay.

491
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,524
- Um, what do you like to do?
- Drink.

492
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,829
Just sweet teas.

493
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,071
Sweet teas and biscuits on blimps.

494
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,366
All right, straight up,
you don't have to do an accent.

495
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,564
I was doing an accent?

496
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,801
And definitely don't bring up blimps.

All right, don't worry.

500

It's all part of the plan.

- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

and then there's a hedge fund.

if you guys wanted to come with.

638
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,528
- Um... (LAUGHS)
- Um...

639
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,732
Can you just give us a second to...

640
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,536
Of course.

641
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,645
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

642
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,889
like we're not sure if we wanna go or not.

643
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:23,970
ALICE: Oh, like...

644
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,812
What the fuck are you doing?

645
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,498
ALICE:
I don't understand why we're arguing!

646
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,750
I thought we wanted to go.

647
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,135
All right, fuck it. Let's go to Hawaii!

648
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,250
(WHOOPS)

649
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,693
- Yes! Fuck yes!
- ALICE: Hawaii!

(FEEL SO GOOD PLAYING)

652
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,543
Yo, what you know about goin' out?

653
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,845
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

654
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,181
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck

655
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,764
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,719
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp, split it all

Ho's ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

659
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,692
You make me feel so good

660
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,773
Aloha, and welcome.

661
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,941
- Hi.
- Aloha.

662
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,162
For real?

663
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,778
Let me get you gentlemen checked in, yeah?

664
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,956
Holy shit, this place is nice!

665
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,221
It's gonna be more nice.

666
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,626
Nice girls don't show off their ecstasy.

667
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,096
One of these is a multivitamin.

668
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,257
Is this shit free?

669
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:19,132
I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

670
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:22,467
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

671
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,741
Look at that personality from behind.

672
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,846
It is, dare I say...

673
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,481
- well-rounded.
- Mmm-hmm.

674
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,572
TATIANA: Look at Mike.

675
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,911
He looks like a funhouse mirror version
of a better looking dude...

676
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,216
but he is just that dude.

677
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,448
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

678
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,991
(LAUGHS) I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

679
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,438
He thinks just because he brought me here
I'm gonna sleep with him?

680
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:44,519
Check it out.

681
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,775
If this was Mike's dick, I'd be like...

682
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:48,664
- (SINGING) Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...
- (LAUGHING)

683
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,258
I'd get close, but I'd never touch it.

684
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,268
They have such beautiful flowers here.

685
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,818
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

686
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,053
I'm like, I'm hungry.

687
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,339
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

688
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,274
I'm gonna baste them ham hocks.

689
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:01,847
I'm gonna be like a sex chef.

690
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:03,947
Mr. Grey will see you now.

691
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:05,478
I'm gonna touch Dave.

692
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:07,018
Every time he says something sweet...

693
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:10,214
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

694
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,290
and just see where it takes us, you know?

695
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,223
That is messed up.

696
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,626

# DoingItForJeanie.

698
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,197
DAVE: Today, we have
the meet and greet by the pool.

699
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:22,311
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

700
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:23,879
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

701
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,047
Mmm-hmm.

702
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,249
That's where Dave and I are gonna be
doing our big speech.

703
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,366
(CLEARS THROAT)
Will there be any downtime?

704
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,205
ALICE: Yeah, 'cause I gotta
keep in touch with the office.

705
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,557
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

706
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,638
It happens a lot.

707
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:37,351
Mm-kay, I think we are right up here.

708
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,850
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

709
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,467
Uh...

710
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,892
I don't know.
Are you and Alice gonna share a room?

711
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,339
Or I was thinking that maybe you and I...

712
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,160
would stay in the same room.

713
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:56,162
That sounds interesting...

714
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,328
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

715
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:00,664
Why not?

716
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,736
(WHISPERING) Because I don't
trust myself around you.

717
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,677
You can trust me.

718
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,078
I do trust you.

719
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,183
Let's trust each other.

720
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:15,415
There's so much trust.

721
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,956
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

722
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,204
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

723
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,540
Yeah, we're gonna cover
all the room charges and stuff...

724
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,108
for up to $50 per day.

725

Oh, my God. You don't have to do that.

726
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,561
I'm a very strict teacher.

You be Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

728
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:32,970
I'll be Coolio.

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,076
- Coolio's not in that movie.
- Oh.

730
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:39,277
He is in song and spirit.

731
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:42,177
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

732
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:45,049
and tell them what a bad boy you are.

733

Please don't tell my mommy.

734
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,065
Please don't tell my daddy.

735
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,134
I think Wi-Fi is included, too, so...

736
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,421
- That's always nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:55,674
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

738
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:56,960
A big, hard D.

739
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:58,497
Why? I deserve an A.

740

- Oh.

Nothing.

In conclusion...

743
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,339
I'm gonna stay in the room...

744

with Alice.

Cool, cool. No doubt.

She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

755
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,376
But I'm one of the good ones.

(LAUGHS) I think she is.

TATIANA: I am a teacher, yeah.

758
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,814
And you know what?
The key to teaching children is repetition.

759
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,887
You'd be surprised how stupid they are.

- And Alice.

- Oh, the bride. The gorgeous bride.
- Ow! Hi.

This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

Check out your arms.
You got some Michelle Obama arms.

TATIANA: Try 10 points hotter.

- Try a million.
- That's too many points.

- Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.
- Thank you.

You guys look great together, really.

will keep these two in check a little bit.

- (ALL LAUGHING)
- I think we can.

I'll just keep him on a leash.

- Maybe don't hurt him.

and all they have is champagne!

Hi, Dave.

797
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:15,530
Look, I'm trying to make your dreams
come true, okay?

798
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,765
- Right.
- What?

799
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,720
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

800
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,854
- Sorry.
- Okay.

801
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,880
Purple. It better be purple.

802
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,283
I should probably go see to that.

803
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,440
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

804
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:26,881
Thank you so much for being here.

805
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,989
Guys, good job with these two.

806
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:31,625

Talk about Jeanie Jeanie likes the girls

811
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,208
Because it's a" about
Jeanie likes the girls

812
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:41,393
- Oil, yeah, Jeanie likes the girls
- Come on!

813
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,945
- It's a" about Jeanie
- Likes the girls

814

- it's all about Jeanie likes the girls!
- Mike. Where are the girls?

815
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,134
- BURT: Oh, hello!
- I'm Alice.

816
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:48,484
I just I wanna give you a hug.

817
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:50,009
It's so nice to meet you.

818
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,440
Fucking A. You distracted me, man.

819
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,636
This dress is lucky to be on you.
Those pins!

820
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:54,839
- My Mike?
- Yes.

821
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,176
- I can't... Wow.
- He did.

822
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,011
That's fantastic.

823
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,878
Mike, Tatiana was just telling me...

824
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,420
that you saved her life.

825
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:02,851
I most certainly did, Father.

826
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,801
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

827
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,137
- I mean, these are nice girls.
- Aw!

828
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,355
Absolutely.

829
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,606
They are. And we brought them, so...

830
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:10,960
KEITH: Excuse me.

831
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,142
Excuse me.

832
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:13,210
See you in a minute. Honey, come on.

833
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,445
Can I get everybody's attention?
Could we gather around?

834
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,902
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

835

We're killing this shit! We're killing.

Ow.

I'm Eric's best man, his cousin...

Put your hands together...

845
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,602
for Eric and his lovely bride, Jeanie.

846
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,355
- Give it up!
- (ALL CHEERING)

847

Jeanie!

848
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:45,288
Hey, everybody. A big thank you
to my new family, the Stangles.

849
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,544
We love you, Eric!

850
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:47,645
Thank you.

851
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,864
And to my own family, I must say...

852
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,535
Portland, Oregon in the house!

853
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,902
(ERIC'S FAMILY WHOOPING)

854
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,979
I'm really happy
to finally make you all my ohana...

855
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:58,511
- which means "family."
- (APPLAUSE)

856
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:00,706
And as the Hawaiians say...

857
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,078
Kale maluna!

858
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,312
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up." (LAUGHS)

859
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:08,184
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

860
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,802
"your butts to the sky"...

861
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:12,486
which is inappropriate.

862
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,354
This is gonna be magic.

863
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:19,230
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

864

to have you at our wedding.

- Alice.
- Where are you going?

868
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,092
Hi! What happened?

869
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,243
You sort of zoned out for a sec.
What's up? You okay?

870
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:38,786
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

871
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,699
You just said "wedding" three times.

872
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,867
I'm fine. Yeah!

873
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,722
Let's just forget about the past,
and move on.

874
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,620
To the bar!

875
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:46,991
To the bar?

876
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:48,954
Mmm. Mmm.

877
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,868
Ooh. I don't think these are shots.

878
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,595
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

879
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:56,934
but I don't think they're
supposed to be drunk like that.

880
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,041

Oh. Hey, Mike.

I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

886

Tatiana, this is my cousin, Mike.

887
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:23,094
She knows who I am. She's my date.

888
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,997
Why would someone this attractive
ever be with you?

889
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,499
Are you gonna hit on my date all weekend,
like bisexual Fonzie?

890
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,639
I don't think it's gonna take all weekend.
Am I right?

891
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:32,337
So, you guys are cousins?

892
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,239
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

893
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,845
What could I possibly be jealous of?

894

Your outfit looks like Jimmy Buffet's
dust ruffle.

Do you guys always do this?

896
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,614
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

897
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:45,256
No, you look like the wallpaper
from a Long John Silver's bathroom.

898
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,016
TATIANA: Cool.
I'm gonna hit the buffet now...

Good idea.

Look at that.

Whoa. What's up, double trouble?

Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

- Everybody does.
- No.

912

Not everyone does.

913
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,634
Saw you and Dave are doing your
speech together at the rehearsal dinner.

914

Mmm-hmm.

with my speech.

you're such a hotshot?

You know Chris Rock?

918
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,392
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

919
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,998
And he gave me seven killer jokes.

It's a one-two step.

1116
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,038
All right, that's enough.

1117
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:18,902
Enough dancing! You and you...

1118
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:20,410
outside, now!

1119
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:21,774
Honey, calm down.

1120
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:22,870
(SCREAMING)

1121
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,073
- Honey, calm down.
- Sorry.

1122
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,583
Do you understand they've deformed
our little girl...

1123
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,880
the day before her goddamn wedding?

1124
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,267
She looks like Seal, for Christ's sake!

1125
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,169
Oh! Why, Dad?

1126
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:35,250
Ow!

1127
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,694
Do you think he's gonna spank us?

1128
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:38,853
What?

1129
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,622
Never mind.

1130
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,677
I haven't seen him this pissed
in a long time.

1131
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:43,792
OOP-

1132
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:45,701
Yeah. It's the other door.

1133
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:47,716
They meet in the middle.

1134
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,400
- They meet in the middle.
- God damn it!

1135
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,978
DAVE: Dad, listen.
I know what you're gonna say.

1136
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,358
- You're right.
- We're gonna sue the ATV companies.

1137
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:57,644
- Right?
- (SCOFFS) I see.

1138
00:42:57,772 --> 00:42:58,773
Not what I was gonna say.

Let's Erin Brockovich this bitch.

1140
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:01,878
Mike, stop!

1141
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:04,266
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1142
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:05,347
It's not.

1143
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,917
If anything, it's the girls' fault.

1144
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:09,491
They're crazy.

1145
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,041
The girls aren't the problem!

1146
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:13,498
You are.

1147
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,795
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

1148
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,665
What did you think was gonna happen?

1149
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:18,828
We had a plan.

1150
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:21,407
The plan was to swim with dolphins...

1151
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:23,271
and eat bananas afterwards.

1152
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:25,173
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1153
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:26,335
but indirectly...

1154
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:29,176
we wouldn't have been on ATVs
if the girls hadn't forced us to.

1155
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,784
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1156
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:33,996
- Not pointing fingers.
- Yeah.

1157
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,317
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1158
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:38,618
I am going to lump you in together.

1159
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,591
All right, you are lumped!

1160
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:44,162
The hell is wrong with you, huh?

1161
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:46,665
What the hell is wrong with you?

1162
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,635
Dad.

1163
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,673
Fuck.

1164
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,270
Everyone get the fuck away from me.

1165
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,847
Move! Adult Swim!

1166
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,281
It's all fucked now.
It's all fucked, you know? Poor Jeanie.

1167
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:06,430
Jeanie's special weekend, and I ruin it.

1168
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,083
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1169
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,170
That's two weddings that I've ruined.
It's just like, "Stupid Alice!"

1170
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,628
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1171
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,507
but this is supposed to be our vacay.

1172
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:19,376
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1173
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,577
and going on adventures.

1174
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,761
Get in here with me.

1175
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,268
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1176
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,930
No, no! You're not listening to me.
Don't leave me!

1177
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,631
(SCOFFS)

1178
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,100
Ah!

00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,877
(SIGHS) Oh.

1180
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,140
Hmm?

1181
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,629
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1182
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:41,452
It's not like you asked or anything,
but you're here. Yay.

1183
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,984
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1184
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,137
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1185
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:49,027
where you go to Vegas
and you dress up as a prostitute...

1186
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,042
and you go out and there's a contest...

1187
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,329
to see who can get the most money
from a john...

1188
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,413
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1189
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:58,531
and they, like, beg that you don't tell
their children and their wives...

1190
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,336
and they piss themselves,
and you've got the whole thing on video.

1191
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:04,571
And then you put it on YouTube
and then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1192
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:05,737
Did you do that thing?

1193
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:07,475
- No.
- No.

1194
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:12,312
I didn't actually end up having one, so...

1195
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:14,116
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1196
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:16,468
I'm sorry Cabo didn't work out, Jeanie.

1197
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,037
I know. It's fine.

1198
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,171
You know I couldn't get the time off work.

1199
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:21,640
And it would have ruined it for you,
down there without me.

1200
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,875
Is there some tension about this?

1201
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:25,577
So I just thought, "Let's cancel
the whole trip," if that makes sense.

1202
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,613
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1203
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:28,781
Did I bring up something uncomfortable?

1204
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:31,205
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

Oh, that fucking gaping mouth of yours,
shut it!

Shut it!

Is that too much to ask?

Please! I just wanna relax.

- I'll give you a minute to disrobe.
- Yeah, okay.

Hi, um, that is my best friend in there...

1219
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,707
and she's getting married tomorrow,
and she's a little uptight.

1220
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:15,146
And I was wondering if you could, um,
help her let loose a little bit?

1221
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:16,329
You know?

1222
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:21,415
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh" experience?

you know?

but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1226

Looks like you had a bit of a fit.

1227

No, no. That's wink... That's wink-wink...

what you're trying to say.

1229

- Great.
- But I figured it out.

1230
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,124
- You didn't really communicate it to me.
- Okay, that's fair.

1231

Yes, you want the special

Do you know how few people
know what they really wanna do?

1382

But then I think about
what Mike's gonna think about it all...

1383
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,171
and he's gonna hate that idea.

if I fell asleep before Mike...

When you invite someone to a wedding...

1403

they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

does not make it okay.

- It's just like Tinder.

Rotating your photos.
Expanding them, contracting them.

1413

Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?
Is that what you're doing?

No...

1418
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:15,400

You're supposed to smile, nod...

1419
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,768
and do what I want you to do.

1420
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,931
That's the deal.

1421
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,374
I thought that we had a connection.

1422
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:21,935
Like a spark.

1423
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:25,049
You thought you were gonna bring me here
so that you could have sex with me.

1424
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:27,827
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1425
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,908

Get him, Dave.

Oops, who said that?

1746
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:39,627
This wedding is going to hell!

1747

Yes.

1748

MIKE: They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.

1749
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:45,801
And they don't realize the bride...

1750
01:07:45,964 --> 01:07:47,886
is getting off at massage parlors...

1751
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:50,255

I think they just misunderstood.

MIKE: I walked in and saw little Jeanie...

1755
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:58,431
the bride-to-be, orgasming.

1756
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,900
The masseuse got her off.

God damn it!

Yep.

I've been thinking about a lot?

1775
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:45,896
Like for my honeymoon...

1776
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:48,448
all I wanted to do
was go on a hot air balloon...

And just be surrounded by wicker.

1779
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:54,221
We could have wicker picnic baskets...

1780
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,838
and I could make picnic hats
out of wicker.

1781
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,059
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

- And he vetoed it.
- Oh!

1783
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:03,786
Because he wants to go to a resort,
and just...

1784
01:09:05,879 --> 01:09:07,434
- ...perch.
- What?

- I haven't even been to Burning Man.

I've probably told myself a million times.

01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:19,092
Why were you trying to poison your cousin?

1806
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:26,515
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1807

That is some crazy shit.
That's like something I would do.

1808
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,253
This one time in high school...

1809
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,821
this bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...

1810
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:34,490
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1811
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,025
and I wore it to school for a month.

1813

Look. I'm sorry I've been so rough
on you, okay?

1815

I honestly think it's
because you're so much like me.

You act all confident...

1817

but, inside, you're scared of everything.

1818

You act like you don't care
what people think...

1819
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:08,106
but you really care what people think.

And you try to act so smart...

1821

but sometimes...

1822
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:14,417

that I don't know the meaning of.

1825
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,764

all the time.

1827

Can you assuage me the ketchup?

1828
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,671
Can I assuage you a few questions?

1829
01:11:31,862 --> 01:11:34,672
- Is that the meaning of it?
- I don't know.

1830

But it's like, I'm so stupid...

1831

No. God, no.

1893

Why would say that?
Just because everything feels really soft?

Please. Just tell me the truth.

Are you on drugs?

We're super fucked up. Yeah.

What?

1898
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:23,881
We started with ecstasy,
but then I went into my mystery bags.

go into the mystery bag...

01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:29,780
the night before the wedding.

1903
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,084
We brought you here
because we thought you were nice girls.

1904
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,090
But Mike was right about you two.

1905
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:36,490
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1906
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:38,461
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1907
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,758
I need some clothes.

1908
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:42,268
I can't continue to wear this horse.

1909
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:43,960
Oh, my God.

1910
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:45,801
Oh, the wind feels so nice.

1911
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,235
Come on, come on, come on.

1912
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:50,886
(GASPS) We should go in the ocean.

1913
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:53,088
I'm so thirsty! Dave,
we should get in the ocean.

1914
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:56,325
(SHUSHING) Please, please, please,
just be quiet.

1915
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:57,893
I love this song.

1916
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:59,316
There's no music playing.

1917
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,443
JEANIE: Baby, wait.

1918
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,521
Don't worry. Only our butts touched.

1919
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,625
Stop it. Don't freak out anymore, Pumpkin!

1920
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:07,818
Don't freak out? Don't freak out?

1921
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,360
Tell me one thing.

1922
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:10,792
Did you enjoy it?

1923
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:12,958
No.

1924
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:15,311
That is such a "yes" no.

1925
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:16,446
No.

1926
01:15:16,526 --> 01:15:18,915
I'm gonna ask you again. Did you enjoy it?

1927
01:15:18,995 --> 01:15:19,983
Yes! Oh.

1928
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,098
Well...

1929
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:22,934
Cat's out of the frigging bag, isn't it?

1930
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,010
JEANIE: I went for a normal massage...

1931
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,205
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1932
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,281
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1933
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,544
Who are these fucking girls
your brothers brought to this wedding?

1934
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,512
You are clearly on drugs.

1935
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,156
And we're getting married tomorrow!

1936
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,823
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1937
01:15:38,982 --> 01:15:40,222
Aren't you scared?

1938
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:42,192
Well, yeah, now I am.

1939
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,027
JEANIE: It's just that...

1940
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:49,171
I'm just a little worried that you are...

1941
01:15:50,694 --> 01:15:51,695
boring.

1942
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,573
What are you saying?

1943
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:55,938
You don't want to marry me?

1944
01:15:57,368 --> 01:15:58,369
(CRYING)

1945
01:15:58,636 --> 01:15:59,876
(BOTH GASP)

1946
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,084
Well...

1947
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:09,849
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1948
01:16:10,014 --> 01:16:11,254
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1949
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:12,519
You rolled her!

1950
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:14,754
- You're the roller!
- I'm so sorry.

1951
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:17,330
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1952
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:19,468
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT)
Everything is not irie, man!

1953
01:16:21,892 --> 01:16:24,498
You've made me so, so sad.

1954
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:28,442
But a little bit mad.

1955
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,611
But mostly just sad.

1956
01:16:31,603 --> 01:16:32,604
Oh!

1957
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:35,880
- Dad!
- Don't!

1958
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,452
Mike, for once in your life...

1959
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:40,590
please don't say a fucking word.

1960
01:17:05,036 --> 01:17:06,812
I hate them sometimes.

1961
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,227
Fucking love them and they're dicks.

1962
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:10,048
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1963
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:19,118
Everything okay over there?

1964
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:21,697
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1965
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,331
Did you take my sock, bro?

1966
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:27,562
No.

1967
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,438
I think you took my fucking sock, bro.

1968
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,134
God damn it.

1969
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:35,370
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1970
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,310
and it's all our fault.

1971
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,951
It's slightly our fault.

1972
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,853
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1973
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:46,354
We got selfish. We got distracted.

1974
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,758
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1975
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:52,794
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1976
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:55,797
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1977
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:58,333
She is Stanglita.

1978
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:01,268
The one little girl
we used to let into our Stang Hangs.

1979
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:02,416
The Stangle Dangle.

1980
01:18:02,496 --> 01:18:04,032
The smallest plane in the Stangar.

1981
01:18:04,197 --> 01:18:05,335
Don't do it, dude.

1982
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:06,807
We're supposed to be her protector.

1983
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,503
Don't you cry.

1984
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:09,669
We're supposed to look out for her.

1985
01:18:09,836 --> 01:18:11,008
Stop it.

1986
01:18:11,171 --> 01:18:14,118
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1987
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,719
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1988
01:18:15,876 --> 01:18:18,152
We broke up her marriage.

1989
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:23,860
Of course I'm fucking doing it, man.
We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1990
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:25,463
I'm doing it, too.

1991
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,397
- (BOTH CRYING)
- I hate it.

1992
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:29,195
(BAWLING)

1993
01:18:40,067 --> 01:18:42,690
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.

1994
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,771
Yeah.

1995
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:46,111
We fucked it in the dick.

1996
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:47,362
(GROANS)

1997
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:49,097
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

1998
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:51,885
I know, but we fucked it so hard. Fuck.

1999
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,136
I think the reason we get ourselves
into so much shit is...

2000
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,287
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

2001
01:18:57,552 --> 01:19:00,556
when we're definitely not being awesome.

2002
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,029
That's deep.

2003
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, you know what? Um...

2004
01:19:05,594 --> 01:19:07,437
I wanted you to feel better...

2005
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,769
and get your groove back...

2006
01:19:09,932 --> 01:19:13,072
but not all the way better to where...

2007
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:16,505
you wouldn't need me anymore.

2008
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:19,585
Because if you don't need me...

2009
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:23,750
then nobody needs me, and, um...

2010
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,690
Anyway, that's what I was thinking
when I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

2011
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,296
Dude, we're always gonna need each other.

2012
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:31,920
Okay.

2013
01:19:32,187 --> 01:19:36,230
Okay, here's the thing.
I don't wanna stop being us.

2014
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:38,462
But I think occasionally...

2015
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:42,872
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

2016
01:19:45,168 --> 01:19:46,156
Like Jeanie?

2017
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:47,442
Yeah, like Jeanie.

2018
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:49,611
- Oof.
- Or like Eric.

2019
01:19:50,073 --> 01:19:51,108
Oh, fuck.

2020
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:52,912
This feels fucking terrible.

2021
01:19:53,076 --> 01:19:55,283
This does not feel good.

2022
01:19:55,478 --> 01:19:58,220
Like, Dave's so special and...

2023
01:19:58,948 --> 01:20:01,326
He must be so mad at me.

2024
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:02,821
Poor Mike.

2025
01:20:02,986 --> 01:20:06,331
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

2026
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:07,934
They must be so mad at us!

2027
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,298
They must hate us. Fuck! I would hate us.

2028
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,269
I would fucking hate us!

2029
01:20:12,428 --> 01:20:14,772
I hate us, man. I hate us!

2030
01:20:14,931 --> 01:20:16,069
I hate us, too!

2031
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,939
But you're the best, dude. I love you.

2032
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:20,445
Don't lump yourself in with me.

2033
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:22,083
I'm like a little troll...

2034
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,015
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

2035
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:27,587
Your drawing?
I could never do anything like that.

2036
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:29,934
- So go. You go right now.
- What?

2037
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,068
Go!

2038
01:20:31,148 --> 01:20:34,527
Don't let your loser older brother
hold you back.

2039
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:39,331
You are not a loser.

2040
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,659
Thanks, Dave.

2041
01:20:41,825 --> 01:20:43,327
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

2042
01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:45,337
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

2043
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,373
That Raphael was actually dope...

2044
01:20:47,531 --> 01:20:49,511
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

2045
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:50,941
He's cool, but rude.

2046
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,341
Exactly.

2047
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,541
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

2048
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,517
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

2049
01:20:57,675 --> 01:20:59,348
They were too moist.

2050
01:21:00,477 --> 01:21:02,389
Made you an easy target.

2051
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:06,051
You're my brother. And I love you.

2052
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:07,787
Heroes in a half shell.

2053
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:09,057
Turtle power.

2054
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:12,958
(YELLS)

2055
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,332
We're not going anywhere...

2056
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:20,169
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

2057
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:22,039
is getting married.

2058
01:21:22,968 --> 01:21:23,969
(YELLS)

2059
01:21:25,403 --> 01:21:26,404
(GASPS)

2060
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,979
You just killed the TV.

2061
01:21:29,507 --> 01:21:31,248

01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:04,396
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2384
01:35:04,476 --> 01:35:07,514
was a slang term
for cheese that's gone bad.

2385
01:35:07,612 --> 01:35:10,869
I'd see moldy cheese and I'd be, like,
"Dude, that cheese is goat."

2386
01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:12,758
Like, "Get that goat cheese
off the counter."

2387
01:35:12,984 --> 01:35:15,540
You look like a deconstructed taco.

2388
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:16,655
Like carnival food.

2389
01:35:16,788 --> 01:35:19,769
Like the waffle that the chef would just go,
"We're throwing that away."

2390
01:35:19,891 --> 01:35:21,598
What are we doing?

2411

I'm proud of my little sister
Proud that she got a wedding ring

2412
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:46,935
And a necklace, Eric you're my brother now
So that means I'm kinda black
