1
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,310
Aphilosopher once asked,

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,752
"Are we human
because we gaze at the stars,

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,429
"or do we gaze at them
because we are human?"

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,838
Pointless, really.

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,676
Do the stars gaze back?

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,432
Now, that's a question.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,069
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,192
Our story really begins here,

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,790
1 50 years ago
at the Royal Academy of Science

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,070
in London, England,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,676
where a letter arrived,
containing a very strange inquiry.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,639
It had come from a country boy

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,675
and the scientist who read it thought it
might be a practical joke of some kind.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,360
But he duly wrote a reply

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,472
politely explaining
that the query was nonsense.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,314
And posted it to the boy
who lived in a village called Wall,

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,319
so named, the boy had said,
for the wall that ran alongside it.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,151
A wall that, according to local folklore,
hid an extraordinary secret.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,558
I'm charged with guarding the portal
to another world.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,878
And you're asking me
to just let you through?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,709
Yes.
Because, let's be honest, it's a field.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,071
Look, do you see
another world out there?

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,557
No. You see a field.
Do you see anything nonhuman?

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,036
No. And you know why?
Because it's a field!

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,232
Hundreds of years,
this wall's been here.

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,911
Hundreds of years,
this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,713
-Well...
-One more word,

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,628
and I'll have you up
in front of the village council!

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,237
-Well, that sounds rather final.
-Yeah.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,390
-Better just go home, then, I suppose.
-Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,236
Give my best to your father.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,429
Stop!

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,795
Stop!

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,028
I don't deal with time-wasters.

35
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,878
Get over here and tend this stall.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,753
I'm off to The Slaughtered Prince
for a pint.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,598
See anything you like?

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,917
Definitely.

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,477
I mean, what I meant was these ones,
the blue ones.

40
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,952
How much are they?

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,799
They might be the colour of your hair.

42
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,833
Or they might be all of your memories
before you were three.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,110
I can check if you like.

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,472
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
Buy this one instead.

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,634
Snowdrop.

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,352
It'll bring you luck.

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,511
But what does that cost?

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,033
This one costs a kiss.

49
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,759
Is she gone?

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,908
Follow me.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm a princess,
tricked into being a witch's slave.

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,233
Will you liberate me?

53
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,470
It's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,755
Sorry.

55
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,429
Well, if I can't liberate you,
what do you want of me?

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,951
So, the scientist was wrong.

57
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,754
The wall had successfully done its job

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,953
of hiding
the magical kingdom of Stormhold.

59
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,755
The young man returned that night
to his home in England,

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,952
hoping that his adventure
would soon be forgotten.

61
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,790
But nine months later,
he received an unexpected souvenir.

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,909
This was left at the wall for you.
It says here his name is Tristan.

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,789
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,388
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

65
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,952
Eighteen years passed,
and the baby Tristan grew up

66
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,231
knowing nothing
of his unconventional heritage.

67
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,753
But never mind
how the infant became a boy.

68
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,953
This is the story of
how Tristan Thorne becomes a man,

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,189
a much greater challenge altogether.

70
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,355
For to achieve it,

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,359
he must win the heart
of his one true love.

72
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,188
-It's him!
-It's him!

73
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,434
Humphrey?

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,869
-No, it's Tristan.
-Oh.

75
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
Did I leave something at the shop?

76
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,272
Did I leave something at the shop?

77
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,709
No. I just thought I could bring...

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,036
Tristan Thorne,

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,913
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,190
Is there no end to your charms?

81
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,196
Humphrey,
there's no need to be like that.

82
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,151
Be nice to the poor boy.

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,231
Were those for Victoria?

84
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,912
You were always useless at fencing
in school, Tristan.

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,237
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering
if there was anything you were good at.

86
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,635
Humphrey, that's enough.

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,076
Are you all right?

88
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,349
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

89
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,312
-Want some breakfast?
-No, I'm really late for work.

90
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,989
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Fine. Why?

91
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,432
Oh, I don't know.
Last night, how'd it go?

92
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,791
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

93
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,668
Hello, Tristan.

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,155
-Victoria.
-Pound of sugar, please.

95
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,034
-Yes.
-Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,072
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.

97
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,636
I also need a sack of potatoes
and some chocolate, please.

98
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,635
May I perhaps see you tonight?

99
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,996
No, but you may walk me home.

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,315
Now?

101
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,878
Yes. Yes, I can.

102
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,672
Father, I lost my job.

103
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,873
Father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,070
-Father...
-You lost your job.

105
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,353
Yes, so I heard.

106
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,357
Father, I'm sorry. I...

107
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,113
Maybe Mr Monday was right.
Maybe I am deluding myself.

108
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,279
-I'm not good enough for Victoria.
-He said that? That's poppycock.

109
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,072
You really want to know
how it went last night?

110
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,235
Yeah.

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,314
Not good.

112
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,674
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

113
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,112
I'm not like Humphrey.

114
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,350
Tristan, I can tell you that every man
I ever envied when I was a boy

115
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,150
has led an unremarkable life.

116
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,631
So you don't fit with the popular crowd.
Now, I take that as a very good omen.

117
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,799
-Tristan, I clearly said...
-I know. You told me not to come.

118
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,354
I have something for you. A surprise.

119
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,475
No...

120
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,158
It's not my birthday for another week,
you know.

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,797
-I've never had champagne before.
-Yeah, me, neither.

122
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,395
My God! This is delicious!

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,873
How did... Well,
how does a shop boy afford all of this?

124
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,592
I'm not a shop boy.

125
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,590
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
What are you going to do now?

126
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,315
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.

127
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,512
And now I'm not.
Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

128
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,995
This must have been all your savings.

129
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,998
So? I can make more.
That's the beauty of it.

130
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,633
I never intended to stay in Wall,
Victoria.

131
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,911
There's a big world out there,
I'm gonna make my fortune.

132
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,554
Now you sound just like Humphrey.
He's quite a traveller.

133
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,719
Do you know he's going all the way
to lpswich just to buy me a ring?

134
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,193
Ipswich?

135
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,074
Victoria, I'm talking about London
or Paris or...

136
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,829
A ring? Why is he...
What kind of a ring?

137
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,679
The word is he's planning to propose
to me on my birthday.

138
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,313
He's going to...

139
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,919
And you're gonna say yes.

140
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,430
I can't exactly say no
after he's gone all the way to lpswich.

141
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,516
"All the way to lpswich"?

142
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,316
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,
I'd cross oceans or continents.

143
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,559
-Really?
-Yes.

144
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,999
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

145
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,351
I would go to
the gold fields of San Francisco

146
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,789
and bring you back your weight in gold.

147
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,829
I would.

148
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,594
I'd go to Africa and bring you back
a diamond as big as your fist.

149
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,073
Or I'd go to the Arctic
and I'd slaughter a polar bear

150
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,191
and bring you back its head.

151
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,158
A polar bear's head?

152
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,432
You're funny, Tristan.

153
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,274
People like you and people like me,
we're just not...

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,399
I should be going. It's really late.

155
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,876
Well, hold on, then.
Let's at least finish the champagne.

156
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,075
Okay.

157
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,148
Had Tristan known then
how the stars watched Earth,

158
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,998
he'd have shuddered at the very thought

159
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,395
of an audience to his humiliation.

160
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,398
But, fortunately for him,

161
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,353
nearly every star in the sky
was at that moment

162
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,393
Iooking in earnest at the land
on the other side of the wall,

163
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,910
where the King of all Stormhold
lay on his deathbed,

164
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,749
which was a coincidence
because it was the King's final act

165
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,000
that would change the course
of Tristan's destiny forever.

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,997
Where is Secundus?

167
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,876
He's on his way, Father.

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,638
Then we shall wait.

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,713
Sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.

170
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,589
Septimus.

171
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,155
Primus.

172
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,395
Tertius.

173
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,358
So, to the matter of succession.

174
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,956
Of my seven sons,
there are four of you today still standing.

175
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,198
This is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.

176
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
And you killed them all for your throne

177
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,032
before your father, the King,
even felt poorly.

178
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,439
We know, Father.
You're strong and courageous.

179
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,235
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

180
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,557
-Secundus.
-Yes, Father?

181
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,753
Look through the window.
Tell me what you see.

182
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,276
I see the kingdom, Father.

183
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,552
The whole of Stormhold.

184
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,229
-And?
-My kingdom?

185
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,635
Maybe. Look up.

186
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,958
-Secundus.
-Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

187
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,033
You're alive. You're...

188
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,913
Stuck like this
till the new king is crowned.

189
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,750
I was that close.

190
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,030
Well, at least
you haven't lost your looks.

191
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,913
Oh, please. You're not annoyed
about that whole murder thing, are you?

192
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,918
-I mean, that was 10 years ago.
-Yeah.

193
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,837
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it,
killing me, Secundus?

194
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,032
Because now, of course,
now you are King of all Stormhold.

195
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,913
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not.
You're dead.

196
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,032
Una? Una?

197
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,039
No, Father, it's me, your son.

198
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,069
Tertius.

199
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,994
Where is your sister, Una?

200
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,271
Sorry, Father.
Nobody has seen Una for years now.

201
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,470
-Septimus?
-What?

202
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,879
Tradition dictates the throne must pass
to a male heir.

203
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,991
Exactly, Father.

204
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,714
So why would I kill my sister
when these cretins are still alive?

205
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,955
Indeed.

206
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,997
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation
in a non-traditional manner.

207
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,880
Only he of royal blood
can restore the ruby.

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,348
And the one of you that does so
shall be the new King of Stormhold.

209
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

210
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,948
Beautiful.

211
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,873
More beautiful than a fancy ring
from lpswich?

212
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,156
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

213
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,795
I'd cross the wall
and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

214
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,951
You can't cross the wall.

215
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,788
Nobody crosses the wall.
Now you're just being silly.

216
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,639
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

217
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,231
For you, I'd do anything.

218
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,991
My very own star.

219
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,120
It seems we have ourselves
an agreement.

220
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,271
You have exactly one week
or I'm marrying Humphrey.

221
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,308
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

222
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,630
-What is it?
-A star has fallen.

223
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,918
Where are the Babylon candles?

224
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,511
You used the last one, Lamia,
200 years ago. Do you not recall?

225
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,790
Perhaps we can obtain another.

226
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,151
Has your mind become
as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

227
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,919
You speak as if such things
are freely available.

228
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,314
I know, sister, I merely thought...

229
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,919
You'd have us hunting
for a Babylon candle

230
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,634
while some other witch finds our star.

231
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,228
Fool. There's no time to waste.

232
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,633
If we must retrieve it on foot,
then we shall.

233
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,751
Mormo, we need information.

234
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,270
If these divinations are correct,
the fallen star lies 1 00 miles away.

235
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,440
Four centuries we've waited for this.
What hardship a few more days?

236
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,836
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it
and bring it back?

237
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,392
-I've his kidney.
-I've his liver.

238
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,112
And I've his heart.

239
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,040
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

240
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,554
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

241
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,915
-There's not much left.
-Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

242
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,437
-Dunstan Thorne. Not again.
-It's Tristan, actually.

243
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,068
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.

244
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,476
And I suppose you intend
to cross the wall as well, do you?

245
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,352
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

246
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,516
Cross the wall as well as who?

247
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,515
No one. Nobody.

248
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,995
Nobody crosses the wall.
You know that!

249
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,270
Everybody knows that!

250
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,756
Yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.

251
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,795
Well, I better just head
for the old homestead, then.

252
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,989
Yeah.

253
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,079
-Right, then. Night, Tristan.
-Good night.

254
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,191
Give my best to your father.

255
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,679
Off you go.

256
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,637
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

257
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,909
No, I'm fine.

258
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,439
-That Humphrey again?
-No.

259
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,757
Actually, it was the guard.
The guard at the wall.

260
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,959
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

261
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,039
Well, that's given him plenty of time
to practise, then, hasn't it?

262
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,557
Why, may I ask,
were you trying to cross the wall?

263
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,915
I might ask you the same thing.

264
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,153
I have a mother.

265
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,398
I mean, I have a mother.
She could still be alive.

266
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,318
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

267
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,638
The chain you cut.

268
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,028
Just like you said.

269
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,229
And...

270
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,595
And the glass flower.
The flower she sold to you.

271
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,631
She told me it would bring me luck.

272
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,954
Thank you.

273
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,757
This was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.

274
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,192
It's addressed to you.

275
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,949
Yep.

276
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,358
"My dearest Tristan, please know that
I only ever wanted the best for you."

277
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,594
Had my mistress allowed it,
I would have kept you in a heartbeat.

278
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,633
My dearest wish is that
we will meet someday.

279
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,993
The fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

280
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,113
To use it, think of me and only me.

281
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,795
I will think of you every day, for always.

282
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,719
"Your mother."

283
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,158
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

284
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,599
Mother?

285
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,792
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

286
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,992
No, I'm not.
And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

287
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,068
You're... You're not my mother?

288
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,395
Do I look like I'm your mother?

289
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,675
No.

290
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,115
Sorry.

291
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,952
Well, are you all right?
Do you want some help?

292
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,310
You can help by leaving me alone!

293
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,794
All right.

294
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,991
Oh, my God.
"Light the candle and think of me."

295
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,076
I was. I was thinking of my...

296
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,794
But then Victoria and the star
just popped into...

297
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,516
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

298
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,349
This may seem strange, but
have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

299
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,832
-You're funny.
-No, really, we're in a crater.

300
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,996
This must be where it fell.

301
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,958
Yeah, this is where it fell.

302
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,913
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

303
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,235
up there is where
this weird, bloody necklace

304
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,396
came out of nowhere
and knocked it out of the heavens

305
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,238
when it was minding its own business.

306
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,157
And over there is where it landed.

307
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,798
And right here, this is where it got hit
by a magical flying moron!

308
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,720
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

309
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,948
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

310
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,991
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...

311
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,639
May I just say in advance
that I am sorry?

312
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,996
-Sorry for what?
-For this.

313
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,873
Now, if I am not mistaken,
this means you have to come with me.

314
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,470
See, you're going to be a birthday gift
for Victoria, my true love.

315
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,874
But of course!

316
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,834
Nothing says romance like the gift
of a kidnapped, injured woman!

317
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,355
I'm not going anywhere with you.

318
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,158
Hurry. You should be
on your way now, Primus.

319
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,196
You must find the royal necklace
with the ruby before your brothers.

320
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,518
I should like to see you take the throne.
The first benevolent king.

321
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,039
I don't doubt Stormhold would be
a better place under your rule.

322
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,309
Really?

323
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,795
Well, that is fascinating.

324
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,956
-Don't you think, Tertius?
-Yes, indeed.

325
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,676
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
Well, well, l...

326
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,073
Since you're all here,
won't you join me in a toast?

327
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,318
What a very good idea.

328
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,715
To the new King of Stormhold,

329
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,912
whichever of you fine fellows
it might be.

330
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,710
To the new King of Stormhold.

331
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,435
You!

332
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,394
You really thought that you were king?

333
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,995
-You killed the Bishop?
-No, Primus.

334
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,716
I think you'll find that you killed the
Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

335
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,591
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling
with your conscience,

336
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,314
may I suggest you return
to your chamber?

337
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,715
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

338
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,393
How have we lived this way
all these years?

339
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,628
In my absence, I expect you to make it
fit for the queens we are.

340
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,394
When I return with our prize,
all of us shall be young again.

341
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,076
Never fear, my sisters.

342
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,033
I will not fail.

343
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,433
Don't you ever sleep?

344
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,515
Not at night.

345
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,194
May have escaped your notice, genius,

346
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,276
but that's when stars
have rather better things to do.

347
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,550
They're coming out, shining,
that sort of thing.

348
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,752
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours,
but you're not in the sky any more.

349
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,757
Coming out is off the agenda.

350
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,395
Shining has been suspended
until further notice.

351
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,796
Oh, and sleeping during the day
is O-U-T.

352
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,830
Unless you have some magical ability
to sleep while you're walking.

353
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,190
Have you not got it
into your thick head yet?

354
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,197
I'm not walking anywhere!

355
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,029
Fine.

356
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,478
Sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.

357
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,308
I was gonna put you back in the sky
once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

358
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,512
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own
in the middle of nowhere forever.

359
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,837
And just how were you planning
to get me back to the sky?

360
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,077
I find the fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

361
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,189
-You've got a Babylon candle.
-Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

362
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,719
-A Babylon candle.
-That's what I said.

363
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,829
You said "Bubbling."

364
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,235
Anyway, I was going to give
what's left of it to you.

365
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,555
Well, that barely has one use left.

366
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,992
So be grateful I'm not using it right now
to get us both back to the wall.

367
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,317
Unless you have a better way of
getting yourself home.

368
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,909
Fine!

369
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,952
Help me up.

370
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,875
All right. All right. I'm helping.

371
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,758
And you are gonna have to walk
quicker than that.

372
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,474
Otherwise, I'll never get you back
to Victoria in a week.

373
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,999
Don't push your luck.

374
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,509
Don't take less than a florin for him,
Bernard! You understand?

375
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,631
-Yes, Mother.
-No dilly-dallying!

376
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,469
And don't even think of stopping at the
tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

377
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,636
A florin for your goat, boy.

378
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,395
Oh.

379
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,155
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

380
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,552
You're quite right.

381
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,118
That's much better.

382
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,794
Bernard!

383
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,709
Bernard!

384
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,189
Get on!

385
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,148
Who goes there?

386
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,157
What do you want with me,
a poor old flower...

387
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,078
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

388
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,637
and I swear by the ordinances of the
sisterhood to which we both belong

389
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,069
that I mean you no harm this day.

390
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,111
I wish to share your meal.

391
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,152
Well, one can never be too careful.
Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

392
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,478
-Anything else?
-Nope.

393
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,360
What's it to be?

394
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,439
What's it to be?

395
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,519
Heads or tails?

396
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,275
Heads.

397
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,638
So, stranger,

398
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,998
where are you headed off to
on this fine day?

399
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,917
I seek a fallen star.

400
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,678
She fell not far from here.

401
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,916
And when I find her,
I shall take my great knife

402
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,395
and cut out her heart
while she still lives.

403
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,752
And the glory of our youth
shall be restored.

404
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,673
Fallen star?

405
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,189
That's the best news I've had in ages.

406
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,959
I could do with losing
a few years meself.

407
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,036
So whereabouts did you...

408
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,593
Limbus grass!

409
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,840
You dare to steal truth from my lips
by feeding me limbus grass?

410
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,033
Do you have any idea what a big
mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

411
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,071
How do you know my...

412
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,111
-Who are you?
-Look again.

413
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,269
I shall not seek the star,
Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

414
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,992
Seek all you wish.

415
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,390
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

416
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,756
You will not perceive her
even if she stands before you.

417
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,000
Pray you never meet me again,
Ditchwater Sal.

418
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,876
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.

419
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,434
You think you know
we're going the right way because...

420
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,199
And I quote, "l just do."

421
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,912
I do, though. I don't know why.

422
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,600
Maybe it's my love for Victoria
guiding me home.

423
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,199
-Please.
-Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

424
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,788
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

425
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,115
How many times do I have to...

426
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,879
Would you...
Would you please slow down?

427
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,194
Yes, yes.

428
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,155
Look, we're...
We're going north, all right?

429
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,474
The wall's north.

430
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,592
And if you look up in the sky,
even during the day, you can see the...

431
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,312
The evening star. That's so weird.

432
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,237
That's funny. Hilarious.
My sides are splitting.

433
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,839
No, I'm being...

434
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,037
Wait that... That was you! Really?

435
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,952
What... What are...

436
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,275
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like I'm doing?

437
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,470
-Sitting down. I'm tired.
-Please don't do this again.

438
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,909
We agreed we'd stop off
at the next village to eat and rest.

439
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,873
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

440
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,598
I never stay up this late!
Just, please, let me sleep!

441
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,718
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.

442
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,389
What are you doing?

443
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,559
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making sure you don't run away.

444
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,198
Your Highness, the soothsayer,
as you requested.

445
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,113
South, you said.

446
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,479
South we went.

447
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,359
Still no stone.

448
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,196
Do you now propose
we start swimming?

449
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,155
Sire, I've merely relayed to you
what the runes have told me.

450
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,793
I can do no more.

451
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,917
Well, consult them again.

452
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,389
Wait.

453
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,114
Before we seek the stone,
I have another question.

454
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,678
Am I the seventh son?

455
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,075
Yes.

456
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,758
Another question.

457
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,994
Is my favourite colour blue?

458
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,469
Yes.

459
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,149
Has excessive begging or pleading
ever persuaded me

460
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,430
to spare the life of a traitor?

461
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,073
What does that mean?

462
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,634
-That means no.
-Good.

463
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,398
Throw them again.
This time, throw them high.

464
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,276
Do you work for my brother?

465
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,918
So, do we continue west?

466
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,275
Tristan?

467
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,279
Who's there?

468
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,158
Tristan, is that you?

469
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,633
It's not funny.

470
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,994
Tristan?

471
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,909
Come on.

472
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,988
Be careful how much magic
you use, sister.

473
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,838
It's beginning to show.

474
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,111
One goat and a small enchantment.
Hardly extravagant.

475
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,038
Well, even using the ring
will take its toll.

476
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,390
Better you call on us only in dire need.

477
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,637
And use your runes
to locate the star yourself.

478
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,671
I used them and she should be here.

479
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,439
But now
they're just telling me gibberish.

480
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,873
It is because you must stay
where you are, my sister.

481
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,149
She is coming to you.

482
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,748
Oh, be warned, Lamia.
Delicacy is needed.

483
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,714
Misery has drained her.
She's barely shining.

484
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,356
Set a trap that ensures her heart
is glowing before you cut it out.

485
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,192
Yvaine! Yvaine!

486
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,473
Oh, you idiot.

487
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,874
You shall become human.

488
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,799
You are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

489
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,152
Now, make everything ready.
Our special guest will be here soon.

490
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,553
I mean, who's to say he'd have even
kept his promise about the candle?

491
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,195
I just refuse to believe
he's the only person in Stormhold

492
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,912
who could've helped me.

493
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,113
Going on and on and on.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

494
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,594
Tristan?

495
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,474
Please protect our sister, Tristan.

496
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,153
Yvaine is in grave danger.

497
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,195
The unicorn came to help her.

498
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,269
But now they're heading into a trap.

499
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,793
No star is safe in Stormhold.

500
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,838
The last to fall, 400 years ago,

501
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,034
was captured by the same witches
who seek Yvaine now.

502
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,792
They tricked her,

503
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,713
cared for her,

504
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,430
and when her heart
was once more aglow,

505
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,237
they cut it from her chest

506
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,838
and ate it.

507
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,197
There's no time to waste.

508
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,958
A coach is coming.

509
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,550
By any means possible,
you must get on it.

510
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,149
Run.

511
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,875
Whoa!

512
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,873
If Septimus insists on sending a boy
to do a man's job...

513
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,955
No, no, no, wait, please!

514
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,832
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.

515
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,633
Look at me, look at me.
I'm unarmed. Please.

516
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,031
Please, let me ride with you.

517
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,357
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

518
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,277
Well, then all the more reason
to take me with you.

519
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,710
There may come a time when you need
a second pair of hands. Sir?

520
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,310
Please. Maybe providence sent me
to you just as it sent you to me.

521
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,274
-Get on.
-Oh, yes. Thank you.

522
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,790
Goodness me, my dear.
Come in out of this wretched rain!

523
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,279
We have food and drink, a warm bed
and plenty of hot water for a bath.

524
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,593
How do you like your bath?
Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?

525
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,629
I honestly don't know.

526
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,079
Then let me choose for you,

527
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,237
and I'll have my husband
take your horse to the stable.

528
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,229
Billy?

529
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,831
Now, let's get you out
of your wet things, shall we?

530
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,079
Feeling better?

531
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,838
Much. Thank you.

532
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,629
The warm water's actually done me
a world of good.

533
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,558
You see?
The powers of a nice, hot bath.

534
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,989
And your leg? Any improvement?

535
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,592
That is extraordinary.

536
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,629
It's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

537
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,512
You seem happier in yourself, too.

538
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,791
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

539
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,115
Wonderful.

540
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,950
Nothing like a nice soak
to warm the cockles of your heart.

541
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,797
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

542
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,230
but I've been told
I have a healer's hands.

543
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,669
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

544
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,633
What's a massage?

545
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,832
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

546
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,479
Nothing like a massage to send you off
for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

547
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,999
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

548
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,872
Lie on your back, dear.

549
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,677
Why not close your eyes?

550
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,995
You'll drift off better that way.

551
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,755
Hello!

552
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,709
Service!

553
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,229
Maybe we should carry on
and try the next inn,

554
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,954
especially if this stone is as close
as your runes say.

555
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,718
I'll give it one more try.

556
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,229
Relax here, my love.

557
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,591
I'll be back just as soon as
I've taken care of this customer.

558
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,789
At last. We require accommodation.

559
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,117
Please help my friend
take the horses to the stables.

560
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,589
Hello!

561
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,315
Oh.

562
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,833
I'm accustomed to better service,

563
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,679
but you're awake now
and that's what counts.

564
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,794
Prepare your best room.

565
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,909
-She got the stone.
-Stone, stone.

566
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,999
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.

567
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,553
Glass of wine?

568
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,795
No, no, no, no, no.

569
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,635
No.

570
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,439
Until my brother is dead,
I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

571
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,836
Though my friend in the stables
might be glad of a drop.

572
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,911
Your best room, perhaps?

573
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,714
Of course.

574
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,676
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

575
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,117
Travelling alone, are you?

576
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,791
I've just stabled my four black stallions
and my carriage.

577
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,878
Well, I say mine.
It belonged to my late father.

578
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,469
Thank you.

579
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,718
That's so kind, thank you very much.
My name's Tristan. What's yours?

580
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,989
Bernard.

581
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,472
There was not a horse or beast
he could not master.

582
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,194
So much so that in his youth,
he took to riding a camel,

583
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,594
which was comical.

584
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,711
When he passed,
the carriage came to me.

585
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,829
She's got the stone!

586
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,915
-She's got it!
-She's got it!

587
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,112
And it's the largest in all of Stormhold,
so they say.

588
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,879
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

589
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,989
Wait.

590
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,591
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

591
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,073
-Oh, finally.
-Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

592
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,155
-Well done.
-Sweet.

593
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,269
Come here. Let me see it.

594
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,751
You have no idea
what you're meddling with.

595
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,398
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold
and I demand that you bring it to me!

596
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,953
Bring me the stone! Now!

597
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,038
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything
they give you! They tried to...

598
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,240
-Are you all right?
-Billy!

599
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,592
-Are you all right?
-Billy!

600
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,749
Get him!

601
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,075
The burning golden heart
of a star at peace

602
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,078
is so much better
than your frightened little heart.

603
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,954
Even so, better than no heart at all.

604
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,474
Yvaine?
Hold me tight and think of home.

605
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,880
No!

606
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,798
-What the hell did you do?
-What did I do? What did you do?

607
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,673
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

608
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,756
You thought of your home
and I thought of mine

609
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,632
and now we're halfway between the two!

610
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,672
Oh, you stupid cow!
What did you think of your home for?

611
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,153
You just said "home"!

612
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,431
If you wanted me to think of your home,
you should have said!

613
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,869
Some crazy lady
was going to cut your heart out

614
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,638
and you wanted
more specific instructions?

615
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,991
Perhaps you'd like it in writing!
Or a diagram, maybe!

616
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,669
Look, Captain Shakespeare!
Caught ourselves a little bonus!

617
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,475
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

618
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,112
They don't look
like Lightning Marshals to me.

619
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,198
Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?

620
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,357
"Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?"

621
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,158
Well, let's think.

622
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,397
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason
we are!

623
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,599
Now, who are you?

624
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,472
Let's see if a night on our lovely brig
will loosen their lips!

625
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,398
-Get them in the brig!
-You heard the man! Let's go!

626
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,071
Get them into the brig and the rest of
you dirty dogs, back to work!

627
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,668
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

628
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,275
-They're going to kill us, aren't they?
-I don't know.

629
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,599
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

630
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,554
I used to watch people
having adventures.

631
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,033
I envied them.

632
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,313
You ever heard the expression,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

633
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,000
What? So ending up with my heart
cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

634
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,998
No. No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

635
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,996
Look, I admire you dreaming.

636
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,197
Shop boy like me,

637
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,117
I could never have imagined
an adventure this big

638
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,390
in order to have wished for it.

639
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,558
I just thought
I'd find some lump of celestial rock

640
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,148
and take it home, and that would be it.

641
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,554
And you got me.

642
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,399
If there's one thing I've learned
in all my years watching Earth,

643
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,159
it's that people aren't
what they may seem.

644
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,869
There are shop boys

645
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,039
and there are boys who just happen
to work in shops for the time being.

646
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,994
And trust me, Tristan,
you're no shop boy.

647
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,674
You saved my life. Thank you.

648
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,993
Well, well, well.

649
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,352
The last brother dead.

650
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,996
Which means that I'm king.

651
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,074
I'm king!

652
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,433
Not yet, brother.

653
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,796
Damn. I still need the stone.

654
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,589
-Your brother doesn't have it?
-Well, why don't you find out?

655
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,958
Where is my stone?

656
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,718
I don't...

657
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,593
The man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.

658
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,473
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

659
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,397
-What girl?
-I don't know.

660
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,080
A girl. She got away.
Because this was a trap set up for her,

661
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,112
but your brother,
he come just straight into it.

662
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,390
A trap? Set by who?

663
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,517
A woman you should pray
you'll never meet.

664
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,755
She's...

665
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,439
She's gone.
She took your brother's carriage.

666
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,551
This woman wanted my stone?

667
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,955
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

668
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,198
She said the girl was a star and
she wanted to cut out her heart and...

669
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,869
Eat it?

670
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,879
Oh, my God.

671
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,834
Do you have any idea what this means?

672
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,638
Everlasting life.

673
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,871
King forever.

674
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,359
It's not here, sire.

675
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,471
This idiot's coming with us.

676
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,876
-Ask again.
-We have asked again

677
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,195
and the answer is still the same.
She is airborne!

678
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,514
Well, she can't remain so forever.

679
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,517
Inform me
as soon as she touches ground!

680
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,437
Immediately! Do you understand?

681
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,950
Watch your tongue, sister!
It is you and not we who've lost her.

682
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,832
Lost her and broken the knife!

683
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,793
Even if you apprehend her,
how will you complete the deed?

684
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,117
Perhaps you should return now
and one of us set out in your place.

685
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,355
Don't be absurd.

686
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,199
I'll bring her home
and deal with her there.

687
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,039
Be sure everything is ready
for our arrival.

688
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,676
Tell me about Victoria then.

689
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,718
Well, she...

690
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,668
There's nothing more to tell you.

691
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,079
Because the little I know about love
is that it's unconditional.

692
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,075
It's not something you can buy.

693
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,839
Hang on.
This wasn't about me buying her love.

694
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,599
This was a way for me
to prove how I felt.

695
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,113
And what's she doing to prove
how she feels about you?

696
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,309
Well...

697
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,189
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand
when you meet her. All right?

698
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,638
Provided we don't get murdered
by pirates first.

699
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,509
Murdered by pirates.
Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

700
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,279
I can't quite decide
which sounds more fun.

701
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,870
We've located the sky vessel.

702
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,468
It's headed north
for the port town on Mount Drummond

703
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,751
and you are no longer
the only one seeking the star.

704
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,757
There's someone following your tracks!

705
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,836
A witch? A warlock?

706
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,952
A prince and he's catching you up!
Get a move on!

707
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,350
So, this is the part where you tell me
who you are and why you're up here.

708
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,154
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers
one by one like dry twigs!

709
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,316
My name is Tristan Thorne.

710
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,034
-This is my wife, Yvaine.
-Your wife?

711
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,229
Far too young and radiant
to belong to just one man!

712
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,275
It's share and share alike
aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

713
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,715
If you dare even touch her...

714
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,400
You may think you're showing
a little spirit in front of your lady friend,

715
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,239
but if you talk back to me again,
I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

716
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,316
you impertinent little pup!

717
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,919
-Sir?
-Better! But still interrupting.

718
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,715
Let's see.
A hanging's always good for morale!

719
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,195
Maybe we'll watch you dance
a gallows jig!

720
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,988
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side
and have done with it!

721
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,517
It's a very long way down.

722
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,871
Plenty of time to reminisce
about your pitifully short lives.

723
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,798
Please, look, we're just trying
to make our way home,

724
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,148
back to a place called Wall,
where I come from.

725
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,713
What did you say?

726
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,831
I said we were trying to get home
to Wall.

727
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,678
That's one lie too many, my son.

728
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,789
-Wall?
-Shut up.

729
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,875
What's he saying?

730
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,673
Thought you could just wander
onto my patch, did you?

731
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,153
-He is. Yeah, he's gonna...
-And live to tell the tale?

732
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,669
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck,
on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

733
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,998
Big mistake, Mr Thorne!
And the last one you'll ever make!

734
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,753
-No! No! You brute!
-Come... Come on!

735
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,838
-You murderer! You pig!
-Come on! Get up! Get up!

736
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,390
I'm taking the girl to my cabin,
and mark my words,

737
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,158
anyone who disturbs me
for the next few hours

738
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,032
-will get the same treatment!
-What? You'll...

739
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,674
No, you idiot!
I'll sling you over the side as well!

740
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,994
Oh, yeah.

741
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,390
Captain's busy. So should you be.

742
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,672
Get in there, wench!

743
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,034
So, that went well, I thought.

744
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,913
Now, tell me news
of my beloved England.

745
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,508
I want to hear absolutely everything.

746
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,638
Hang on.
I can't believe your crew fell for that.

747
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,069
And where in God's name
did you get that mannequin from?

748
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,792
Oh, it works every time.

749
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,036
An ounce of bargaining,
a pinch of trickery,

750
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,549
a soupcon of intimidation, et voil!

751
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,671
The perfect recipe
for a towering reputation

752
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,155
without ever having to spill
one drop of blood.

753
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,511
Ever try to get blood stains out
of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

754
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,791
Right. I still don't understand
how they won't recognise me.

755
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,909
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

756
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,995
your own mother won't recognise you.

757
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,109
Now, we've no time to waste.

758
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,958
We have only two hours
before we make port.

759
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,672
First and foremost...

760
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,670
It'll be so good to see you
out of those dreary clothes.

761
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,872
So very small-town errand-boy.
Howlingly parochial.

762
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,676
Here. Trs you.

763
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,840
I wore it as a younger man.
I hate to throw anything away.

764
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,473
You know the day you do,
it'll come back in fashion,

765
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,397
be oh, so de la mode.

766
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,839
Now, you, darling.

767
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,552
I have some lovely dresses.
Take your pick.

768
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,033
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

769
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,435
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

770
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,835
Now, England, England.
I want to hear everything.

771
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,630
-You're not from England.
-Oh, no, sadly, no.

772
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,955
But from my earliest youth,
I lapped up the stories.

773
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,718
People always told me they were
nothing more than folklore,

774
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,195
but my heart told me they were true.

775
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,390
As a boy, I'd scurry away
from my father at the market

776
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,273
while he did his deals
just to peek over the wall,

777
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,233
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day,
seeing England for myself.

778
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,635
Really? So you...
You were here looking over there.

779
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,909
Oh, yes.

780
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,675
-Hair.
-Hair?

781
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,035
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

782
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,276
Tried to make my father,
Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

783
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,675
Forged a decent reputation
as a ruthless marauder

784
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,677
and cold-blooded killer.

785
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,718
But my father died.

786
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,590
I always promised him
I'd take over the family business,

787
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,597
keep the old girl flying.

788
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,397
You have no idea the lightness
it brings to my heart

789
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,398
being able to confide in you
charming young people.

790
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,750
The pressure of maintaining the
whole Captain Shakespeare persona

791
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,757
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

792
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,313
Sometimes...

793
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,273
You see, I'm very much
a man of my own creation.

794
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,119
Even chose the name specially.
Took me ages.

795
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,231
See, I'm thinking
legendary British wordsmith.

796
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,238
My enemies and crew are thinking,
"Shake! Spear!"

797
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,916
It's little things like that make me happy.

798
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,236
I don't understand that.

799
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,033
Surely it would make you happier
just to be yourself.

800
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,277
Why fight to be accepted by people
you don't actually want to be like?

801
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,278
Yeah.
Why would anyone do that to himself?

802
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,709
Exactly.

803
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,395
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

804
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,794
Hurry up.

805
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,278
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh.
I'll be honest.

806
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,311
Shall I give you a little taste,
young Ferdinand?

807
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,112
No, no. Oh, there you go.

808
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,272
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

809
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,920
I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still trs fresh.

810
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,158
I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still trs fresh.

811
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,908
-So, name your best price.
-For 10,000 bolts?

812
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,349
Ten thousand bolts
of finest quality grade A.

813
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,199
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift,
isn't it? Difficult to store.

814
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,392
If I get the Revenue Men in here
sniffing round, what's the...

815
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,192
Best price, 150 guineas.

816
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,515
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

817
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,868
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

818
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,672
Hold on. Hold on. One minute.
Hold on, cuddles.

819
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,552
-Oh, he's...
-One-sixty. One-sixty.

820
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,511
Seeing as I'm feeling
particularly generous today,

821
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,834
I'll settle for 200.

822
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,838
Two hundred? Okay.
You're having a laugh.

823
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,154
Have you had your head in that?

824
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,192
Has he been sailing up
where the air's too thin?

825
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,108
-You're being very rude.
-Not any more.

826
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,912
-Two hundred.
-One-eighty.

827
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,393
-Two hundred.
-That's not negotiation.

828
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,715
I'm changing my number.
One-eight-five.

829
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,149
-Did I hear 200?
-From you, you did. Yeah.

830
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,919
-You said 200.
-lf I did, you're a ventriloquist.

831
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,996
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

832
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,273
One-nine-five it is.
So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.

833
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,470
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

834
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,916
Unbelievable. Here.

835
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,838
Yes? Can I help you?

836
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,835
Nosy.

837
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,392
Have you heard any of these rumours
going round about a fallen star?

838
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,839
Everyone's talking about it.

839
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,111
You get your hands on one of them,
we can shut up shop. Retire.

840
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,832
-Fallen star?
-Yeah.

841
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,278
-Nothing on your travels?
-No.

842
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,549
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

843
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,272
Everyone's going on about it
down at the market.

844
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,594
Which market?
The market near the wall?

845
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,675
Yeah.

846
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,392
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time
listening to gossip

847
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,351
from the kind of pond scum
trading down there.

848
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,675
-Well, if it...
-Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

849
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,438
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

850
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,755
Oh, what a wonderful woman
you are, Sal.

851
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,472
How the world wouldn't be
the same place without you.

852
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,158
You look great.
You've had your feet done, haven't you?

853
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:55,193
But, you two, you have business
to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

854
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,880
Come on.
I've got something new for you.

855
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,958
Captain Shakespeare.

856
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,588
Stand down!

857
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,312
Meet my nephew,
the fearsome buccaneer,

858
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,839
Tristan Thorne.

859
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,589
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

860
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,951
I have the perfect gift
to keep you amused on the way.

861
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,549
Oh...

862
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,999
Right, you lazy dogs!

863
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,680
Let's get young Tristan
on his way home!

864
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,389
Touch.

865
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,473
I'm impressed.

866
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,791
Yvaine, I know what you are.

867
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,918
No, no. Have no fear.

868
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,393
No one on this vessel will harm you,
but there are plenty who would.

869
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,229
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine.
You must learn to control them.

870
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,555
You've been glowing
more brightly every day,

871
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,999
and I think you know why.

872
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,759
Of course I know why I'm glowing.
I'm a star.

873
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,708
-And what do stars do best?
-Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

874
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,674
-Now try.
-Okay.

875
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,672
-See?
-Very good.

876
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,673
Due west, you say?

877
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,949
And you're certain
he had a girl with him?

878
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,069
Yeah.

879
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,351
You're sure? Absolutely sure?
Sure you're not lying?

880
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,035
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

881
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,878
-Brilliant.
-You'd better be telling the truth,

882
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,194
you two-faced dog.

883
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,153
I can get you one of them, actually.
Very good guard dogs.

884
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,236
They can watch the back
and the front door at the same time.

885
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,349
I can get you anything you want.

886
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,994
What are the chances of getting
a Babylon candle?

887
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,473
That one's slim.

888
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,878
Although, I did know a girl once,
if you know what I mean...

889
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,989
I'm a ladies' man.

890
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,439
...who had a sister...

891
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,549
I think it was a woman.

892
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,229
Oh, she was terrible.
Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

893
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,509
Enough.

894
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,719
Hold on tight!
The Captain's at the helm!

895
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,674
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

896
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,156
Good luck on your journey home,
Yvaine, wherever that may be.

897
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:37,078
And good luck to you, Tristan,
with your Victoria.

898
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,592
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough
for your kindness?

899
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,156
Don't mention it.
No, seriously, don't mention it.

900
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,114
Reputations, you know.
A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

901
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,238
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

902
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,952
Just think about it.

903
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,792
Well, give my regards to England.
It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

904
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,277
Mind you don't wear that wench out,
Captain Tristan!

905
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,597
What did he say to you?

906
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,669
What did he say when?

907
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,189
Just then. When he whispered to you.

908
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,915
No... No, he... He was just saying
we should use the lightning

909
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,156
to get you a Babylon candle.

910
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,111
Barter for it, you know.

911
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,670
For the last time, where is the girl?

912
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,673
The girl with the stone!
Where did she go?

913
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,756
-Are you mocking me?
-No...

914
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,236
'Cause if you are, believe me,
you have seconds to live!

915
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,353
What a freak.

916
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,114
Clean this thoroughly.

917
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,228
Bollocks.

918
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,000
If you have quite finished
squandering your magic

919
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,509
on your rather
counterproductive beauty routine,

920
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,756
you might like to know that
the star has returned.

921
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,199
She's back on land.

922
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,517
I know, damn it.
I couldn't reach the lake in time.

923
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,792
No matter. We have found her.
She is on the road to the village of Wall.

924
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,309
If you take the shortcut
across the marshes,

925
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,192
you should arrive in time
to intercept her.

926
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,989
Yvaine.

927
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,716
-Are you trying to break my leg again?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

928
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,593
I just... I can't risk people seeing you.
I don't trust anyone.

929
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,312
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

930
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,150
Yvaine. We're making good time.
Just leave it a minute.

931
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,518
Aren't you tempted?

932
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,158
Tempted? By what?

933
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,239
Immortality.

934
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,037
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

935
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,711
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

936
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,954
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

937
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,072
I mean, even if I could...
Everlasting life?

938
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,594
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.

939
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,795
Well,

940
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,193
maybe if you had someone
to share it with.

941
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,833
Someone you love.

942
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,515
Maybe then it might be different.

943
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,636
Come on, I think we're safe.

944
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,395
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare
has a fearsome reputation.

945
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,594
-What the hell is this?
-What are you doing here?

946
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,676
My name is Prince Septimus.

947
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,519
And you're going to tell me
where I can find the girl.

948
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,714
All right, twinkletoes.
I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

949
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,871
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes.
I just noticed it. Is it normal?

950
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,958
Let's see if you can work it out
for yourself.

951
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,798
What do stars do?

952
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,838
Attract trouble?

953
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,075
That's... All right, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm sorry.

954
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,758
All right, let me... Let me...
Do I get another guess?

955
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,714
Is it... Do they know exactly how
to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorne?

956
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,872
-How long will that take?
-Maybe two days.

957
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,549
But we don't have two days.
Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

958
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,278
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

959
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,080
-Nice cup of Earl Grey.
-Get out, everybody. Get out.

960
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,520
Did he hurt you, Captain?

961
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,077
Did he hurt you, Captain?

962
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,917
Did you tell him
where your nephew and the girl went?

963
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,672
So what's the problem?

964
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,512
It's my reputation.

965
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,150
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

966
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,998
It's all right, Captain.

967
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,075
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

968
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,789
-You'll always be our captain, Captain.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

969
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,955
Captain.

970
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,991
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

971
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,677
Prince Septimus,
your men, they're dead.

972
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,074
Oh, really?

973
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,989
Go on!

974
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,353
I met that woman.
She's friends with the Captain.

975
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,072
He said she trades at the market
near Wall.

976
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,077
-We could hitch a lift.
-Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

977
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,349
-You sure?
-Yes, yes.

978
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,795
Wait! Sorry!
My name is Tristan Thorne. This...

979
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,478
That's my flower.

980
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,112
Eighteen years
I've been looking for that.

981
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,798
Give it to me now!

982
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,432
How dare you?
That was a gift from his mother!

983
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,515
Oh.

984
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,797
Perhaps I was mistaken.

985
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,519
It's all right.

986
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,031
It's obviously very valuable to you,
so you can have it

987
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,593
in exchange for what I need.

988
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,676
-A Babylon candle?
-And safe passage to the wall.

989
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,552
A Babylon candle?

990
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,434
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't deal in black magic.

991
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,675
Really?

992
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,635
Well, can you give us a lift then?
To the wall?

993
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,638
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

994
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,273
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

995
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,590
-Food and lodging on the way?
-Safe passage.

996
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,915
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

997
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,952
in the exact same condition
that you're in now.

998
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,828
Do you have any idea what
manner of thing it was that you had?

999
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,871
Some kind of lucky charm?

1000
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,392
A very lucky charm indeed. Protection.

1001
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,791
In fact, the exact same thing that
would've prevented me from doing this.

1002
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,600
-Oh, my God! What did you do?
-Much better.

1003
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,349
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

1004
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:36,076
Though I'll keep me word.
You shall not be harmed.

1005
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,116
There.
Food and lodging just as I promised.

1006
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,199
Would I be correct in thinking that
you can neither see nor hear me?

1007
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,194
Then I'd like to tell you
that you smell of pee.

1008
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,992
You look like the wrong end of a dog.

1009
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,429
And I swear,
if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1010
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,630
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1011
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,195
Tristan?

1012
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,393
If you can understand me,
look at me now.

1013
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,638
You know when I said
I knew little about love?

1014
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,117
Well, that wasn't true.

1015
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,391
I know a lot about love.

1016
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,436
I've seen it.
I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1017
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,988
And it was the only thing that made
watching your world bearable.

1018
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:19,393
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1019
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,591
Made me want to turn away
and never look down again.

1020
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,269
But to see the way that mankind loves.

1021
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,079
I mean, you could search
the furthest reaches of the universe

1022
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,873
and never find anything more beautiful.

1023
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:44,834
So, yes, I know that
love is unconditional.

1024
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,069
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1025
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,393
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1026
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,233
and, well,
strangely easy to mistake for loathing.

1027
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,915
And

1028
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:10,392
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1029
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,638
I think I love you.

1030
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:20,192
My heart, it feels like
my chest can barely contain it.

1031
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,159
Like it doesn't belong to me any more.
It belongs to you.

1032
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,679
And if you wanted it,
I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1033
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,715
No gifts, no goods,
no demonstrations of devotion.

1034
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,108
Nothing but knowing you love me, too.

1035
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,433
Just your heart

1036
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,078
in exchange for mine.

1037
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,276
The wall is one mile that way.

1038
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,589
There. Though the walk might take
you a little longer than normal.

1039
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,599
Transformation tends to leave the brain
a bit scrambled for a while.

1040
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,234
You...

1041
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,395
Oh!

1042
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,875
I warned you. Save your strength.

1043
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,950
I've been so worried about you.

1044
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,794
Victoria.

1045
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,756
I think I preferred "Mother."

1046
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,957
Come on. There's an inn over there.
Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1047
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,359
I think you need a bath
and a good night's sleep

1048
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,630
before you present me to her.

1049
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,318
Come on. Come.

1050
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,353
-Come on, Tristan. It's not that far.
-Okay.

1051
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,638
-Excuse me?
-Oh!

1052
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,832
-I think you're in my bath.
-Well, close your eyes!

1053
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,279
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking.
Here, I'll turn away.

1054
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,315
All right, you can open them now.

1055
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,752
Did you really mean
what you said in the caravan?

1056
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,914
What l...

1057
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,918
But... But you were a mouse!

1058
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,352
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese!
You didn't...

1059
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,232
I asked you to give me a sign.

1060
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,319
And risk you being too embarrassed
to keep saying such lovely things?

1061
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,876
You want to know what the Captain
really whispered to me that day?

1062
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:04,511
He told me that my true love
was right in front of my eyes.

1063
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,198
And he was right.

1064
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,153
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on,
you got to come up and see this!

1065
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,633
No, thank you.

1066
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,316
-Pervert!
-Suit yourself.

1067
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,471
-lronic, isn't it?
-Yeah. What is?

1068
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,071
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1069
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,795
find the girl, get the stone
and be king forever.

1070
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,148
So unjust.

1071
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,955
Still, at least we will be free.

1072
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,797
You're very close.
She's in the market town.

1073
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,115
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1074
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,196
You speak as if this is good news.

1075
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,029
Do I need to remind you that Wall
is not part of our universe?

1076
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,594
If she crosses the threshold
into the human realm,

1077
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,599
our star becomes nothing more
than a pitted lump of metallic rock.

1078
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,355
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1079
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,349
What?

1080
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,429
Oh, what do you want?

1081
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,552
Sorry.
Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1082
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,399
Ask me again
at a more reasonable hour.

1083
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,555
No, I can't. I have to go.

1084
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,796
Look,
if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1085
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,275
-please, can you give her a message?
-Go on.

1086
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,830
You know, that's the first time
I've ever slept at night.

1087
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,752
I can't believe it.

1088
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,915
Tristan?

1089
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,512
Have you seen my friend?

1090
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,437
He left absurdly early.

1091
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,749
He left?

1092
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,952
He told me to tell you
he's gone to see Victoria

1093
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,833
because he's sorry,
but he's found his true love

1094
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,952
and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her.

1095
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,035
What?

1096
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,355
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.

1097
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,353
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1098
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,593
Happy birthday.

1099
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,788
Tristan.

1100
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,352
What happened to you?

1101
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,278
I found the star.

1102
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,151
I can't believe you did it.

1103
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,589
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1104
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,631
-ls it beautiful?
-Yes.

1105
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,677
Well, it's awfully small.

1106
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,518
Well, that's just a little piece.
A token for your birthday.

1107
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:52,313
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1108
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,676
It's not the star that I want.

1109
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,718
You know what I want.

1110
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,558
Yeah. I do.

1111
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,394
You want to grow up
and get over yourself.

1112
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,598
-Humphrey.
-Thorne.

1113
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,111
You must have a death wish.

1114
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,473
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1115
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,678
She's all yours.

1116
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,234
You really are a perfect couple.
The best of luck to you both.

1117
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:40,797
Well, why would I want this?
It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1118
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,189
Yvaine?

1119
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,117
She can't cross the wall.

1120
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,469
Go on!

1121
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:08,038
Stop! Stop!
If you go through there, you'll die!

1122
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,149
What?

1123
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,312
If you set foot on human soil,
you'll turn to rock.

1124
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,190
Wretched slattern!
Where have you taken me?

1125
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,555
Planning to enter Wall, were you?

1126
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:33,878
If death is what you wish, my dear,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1127
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,037
Are you talking to me?

1128
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,318
You. Small world.

1129
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,477
Anyhow, no, I wasn't.
I was talking to the star.

1130
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,188
What star?

1131
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,229
My slave girl's no star.
Any fool can see that.

1132
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,274
If she was,
I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1133
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,789
a long time ago, trust me.

1134
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,431
Trust you? Not a mistake
I'd be likely to make again.

1135
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,356
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal?
Heads or tails?

1136
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,994
-Oh, God. Time to go.
-She's not going anywhere.

1137
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,912
I think you'll find she is.

1138
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,315
It's all right. You can come, too.

1139
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,993
You can ride in the carriage or
be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1140
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,308
What happened?

1141
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:08,635
Be my guest. I quit.

1142
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,638
Eighty years
I've stopped you people going out.

1143
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,512
What I should have been worrying about

1144
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,039
was those people
from the other side coming in.

1145
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,752
All right,
just tell me what happened!

1146
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,632
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1147
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,915
No!

1148
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,469
Come on!

1149
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,229
Go on!

1150
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,794
The star!

1151
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,269
And who else?

1152
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,392
A slave for us. It will be nice to
have someone to help mop up

1153
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,590
when we've finished with our little guest.

1154
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,039
Oh, good work, sister.

1155
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,913
And just in time, I see! You look awful!

1156
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,879
Who are you?

1157
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,355
What business do you have here?

1158
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,914
Septimus?

1159
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,476
I knew your brother, Primus.

1160
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,149
Unless you wish to meet him
in the afterlife,

1161
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,840
I suggest you answer my question.
What are you doing here?

1162
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,110
I might ask you the same thing.

1163
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,997
There are four of them.

1164
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,479
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1165
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,955
Wait.
How do I know you can be trusted?

1166
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,548
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1167
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,557
-No.
-Well, then, let's go.

1168
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,150
Get off me! Get off!

1169
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,316
-Una?
-Septimus.

1170
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,839
-Una!
-Sister!

1171
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,597
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1172
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,360
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1173
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,073
I'm your mother.

1174
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,748
-Rather well.
-Good riddance to you. Yes.

1175
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,275
Oh!

1176
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,830
Let's put out those flames.

1177
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,508
Shall we?

1178
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,957
So, what happens now?

1179
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,995
We have to learn to live with each other.

1180
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,269
Forever?

1181
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,232
Let's get on with it.

1182
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,917
Be the man that I know you are.

1183
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,228
-Get outside.
-Okay.

1184
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,315
Go.

1185
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,832
-Tristan!
-Get him.

1186
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,274
Get off!

1187
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,912
Get out!

1188
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:35,838
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming?
Frog or tadpole?

1189
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,669
Septimus?

1190
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,549
Tristan!

1191
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,828
Youth.

1192
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,988
Beauty.

1193
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,029
It all seems meaningless now.

1194
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,597
My sisters are dead!

1195
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,670
Everything I cared about gone.

1196
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,675
Go.

1197
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,148
Go!

1198
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,275
No!

1199
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,871
I owe you thanks, boy.

1200
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,278
What use was her heart to me
when it was broken?

1201
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,396
And you got rid of my sisters
and now I can have it all for myself.

1202
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,952
-Hold me tight and close your eyes.
-What? Why?

1203
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,238
What do stars do?

1204
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,915
Shine.

1205
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,238
-Bravo!
-Yeah!

1206
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,868
Very good.

1207
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,033
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1208
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,597
I couldn't have done that without you.
No star can shine with a broken heart.

1209
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,712
I thought I'd lost you.

1210
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,678
But you came back.

1211
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,275
Of course I did. I love you.

1212
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,789
Come on.

1213
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,308
Tristan.

1214
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:15,270
The last surviving male heir
of the Stormhold bloodline.

1215
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,518
It's you, Tristan.

1216
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:26,118
But if he's the new King of Stormhold,
then...

1217
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:15,552
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1218
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,559
Yeah!

1219
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,398
My gift to you.

1220
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,479
To you both.

1221
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,034
Thank you.

1222
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,834
They ruled for 80 years.

1223
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,838
But no man can live forever,

1224
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:19,951
except he who possesses
the heart of a star.

1225
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:25,072
And Yvaine had given hers
to Tristan completely.

1226
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,751
When their children and grandchildren
were grown,

1227
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:33,832
it was time to light the Babylon candle.

1228
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,912
And they still live happily ever after.
