No. You have to
travel 1,000 miles or so.

himself another hat.

No. Not at all.

It's a fine hat, Mr. Donnelly,

Now, listen to me, lad. There's
a man I want you to box.

He's a goddamn Italian and I
want you to spill his blood.

I'll box and I'll win.

But your boys don't
own me, Mr. Bourke.

Joseph, look at me.

Look at me.
Look at me.

1607

Joseph, look at me.

1608
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,079
I feel myself dying.

1609
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,079
No. No, you stay looking at my eyes.
Look at my eyes, Joseph.

1610
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,199
Shannon?

1611
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:32,239
No, you're not dying.

1612

Look!
You've got your land.

1613
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,121
But all the land in the world
means nothing to me without you.

1614

Joseph...

1615
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,687
I tried to prove myself to you,

1616

is Joseph loves Shannon.

That's all that matters to me.

1621

Hey, Shannon.

1622
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,639
Joseph, Joseph, no.

1623
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,679
Shannon.

1624
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:28,848
No, no, stay with me.
Stay.

1625
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:30,765
Joseph, no!

1626
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,690
No. Joseph, look at me. Joseph!

1627
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:39,160
Joseph, please.
Please don't leave me.

I loved you.

I loved you from the
first time I saw you.

1641

I often wondered about that.
