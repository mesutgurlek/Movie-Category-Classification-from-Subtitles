00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,080
get the lights.

(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
Okay, you know what? No. It's...

159
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,917
Honey, I'm totally fine if we don't.

160
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,544
No, I just... I would...

161
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,630
No, I would love to.
Let me just get my head around it, 'cause...

162
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,965
Okay. We don't...

163
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,134
Honey, it's fine. Seriously.

164
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,636
No, it's totally cool if we don't.

165
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:33,888
Are you sure?

166
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,473
Because those potato skins
made me kind of gassy.

167
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,267
- Let's use a rain check.
- Okay.

168
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,395
- Are you sure?
- I will light up your life next time.

169
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,773
- Or we could just keep it uh-town?
- What?

170
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,943
- Keep it uptown? Do the fast version?
- No, it's okay.

- Thanks for reading aloud, Phil.
- It's okay.

180
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,396
This part really spoke to me.
I mean, to walk 20 miles for water,

181
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,732
and then to suddenly discover
that you're menstruating?

- Oh, my God. I could not stop crying.
- Me, too.

I literally could not stop crying.

00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,863
Me, too, but figuratively.

185
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,283
No. No, literally.

186
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,621
I literally could not stop crying.

187
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,206
Quite sad.

188
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,710
- Quite sad?
- Mmm.

189
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,296
What he means is it's really very moving.

190
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,631
Yeah.

191
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:55,177
You have no idea what it is like

192
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,224
to be a teenage girl having your first period

193
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,185
under Taliban rule.

194
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,813
That is true.

195
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,190
And neither do you.

196
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,902
Mmm, but...

197
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,282
- Hey, Phil, can I get a hand in the garage?
- Yes, please. Yes. Thank you.

198
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,492
Okay. Excuse me, ladies.

199
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,995
(MUTTERING) Oh, my God.

200
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,872
- Do you have your period now?
- Yeah.

201
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,083
PHIL: You should really read this.

202
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,835
It's about a girl
getting her period in the desert.

203
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,298
Can't wait. I don't know how you agree
to still do those book clubs, buddy.

204
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,632
Well, that's marriage, right?

205
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Sometimes you do stuff
you don't wanna do.

206
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,971
- Not me. Not anymore.
- What... What do you mean?

207
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,806
Haley and I are splitting.

208
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,225
What?

209
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,020
- But you guys are happy.
- No, Phil, we're not.

210
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,522
No, no, no. No, you guys are really happy.

211
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,983
No, Phil, we're really not.

212
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,612
Brad, okay, well,
why are we here, then, in your house,

213
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,657
- having book club?
- I haven't told the kids.

214
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,368
Can't tell the kids.

215
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,495
Just, please, keep it under your hat
until next week

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,664
when we go public with it. Don't tell Claire.

217
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:10,586
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened? I mean...

218
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,172
I thought everything was fine. Really.

219
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,966
The next thing I know,
Haley starts getting more and more distant,

220
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,677
and eventually she tells me,
and I'm quoting here,

221
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,431
"I'm... I'm strangling
in the noose of sameness."

222
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,892
So, at first, I was pissed. I really was.

223
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,019
But then I realized,
I know what she's talking about, okay.

224
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,937
We're just cemented
in these roles together,

225
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,314
and there's no breaking out of it.

226
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,482
It's like that Asian dude

227
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,651
- in Sixteen Candles, Long Dik Dog.
- Long Duk Dong.

228
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,279
- Long Duk Dong. That dude.
- Gedde Watanabe.

229
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,615
That's... Him. He can't play...

230
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,036
No matter how hard he tries,
he can't play a doctor.

231
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,579
Oh, yeah. No. It'd be like,

232
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,581
"Why is Long Duk Dong
dressed up like a doctor?"

233
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,209
Right? And that's us!

234
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,755
We're stuck.
We're just stuck in these roles,

235
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,965
this routine, and it's...

236
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,761
I mean, we're not even a couple anymore.
We're just, like...

237
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,974
We're just excellent roommates.

238
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,102
The most excellent roommates.

239
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:13,816
- I... I don't think you're Long Duk Dong.
- What do you think?

240
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,407
I know that Haley
must be hurting right now.

241
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,618
And I'm betting you
she's gonna change her mind.

242
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,081
Best fucking decision I ever made.

243
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,375
Seriously, I have never been happier.

244
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,710
I can do whatever I want. I can go dancing.

245
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,505
When was the last time
you and Phil actually danced together?

246
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,756
I don't know. Our wedding?

247
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,884
Okay, well, I wanna dance every night.

248
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,761
And I wanna take my top off,

249
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,013
and I wanna get it on
with three guys at the same time

250
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,098
'cause I can.

251
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,808
Three guys at once? That's a nightmare.

252
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,602
That is, literally,
a recurring stress dream that I have.

253
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,813
I can only think ofjobs for two.

254
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,441
- Oh, no. I got it.
- Yeah, there's that one.

255
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,860
I just don't understand how this happened.

256
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,780
He just sort of went on auto-pilot.

257
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,365
I don't understand what you want.

258
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,242
I feel like we know each other too well.

259
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,539
I know everything about him.
I know that croutons make him gag.

260
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,292
And he knows that
if I have five glasses of wine,

261
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,252
I'm gonna try to make out with a black guy.

262
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,629
- You're still doing that, huh?
- Yes.

263
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,924
It's the same conversations,
the same schedule.

264

Having sex in the same position
twice a week.

265
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,429
You guys were having sex twice a week?

266
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,055
Yeah, it was that rare.

267
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,310
Yes. Rare is why I was surprised.

268
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,272
You are a lot like Nasrin, Claire.

269
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,151
- (SCOFFS) I'm not like Nasrin.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

270
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,487
Why are we talking about me?
You're the one going crazy.

271
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,948
Because you are like Nasrin.
Because you are ashamed

272
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,742
- of how vibrant you are.
- Oh, come on...

273
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,660
You deserve to feel sexy, Claire.

274
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,288
And you should be able to dance again.

275
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,248
And you need to walk among the birds.

276
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,876
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
I don't really understand that metaphor.

277
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,754
- It's not...
- And I feel plenty vibrant.

278
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,006
Okay, maybe not
three-guys-at-once vibrant,

279
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,175
but that is gross. That's...

Phil makes me feel vibrant
in different ways.

281

We have a date tomorrow night.

Great. Okay. Well,
enjoy the potato skins and the salmon.

283
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,771
Walk among the birds.

284

00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,603
- Oh, boy.
- Who, might I ask, are you,

461
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,522
to be asking us who we are?

462
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,484
We just wanted to have
a few words with you, if that's okay.

463
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,363
- And what is this about?
- I think you know.

464
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,615
Why don't we save everyone
a lot of embarrassment,

465
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,867
have this conversation in private?

466
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,245
Okay. But can I have
the rest of my risotto wrapped?

467
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,082
Because these truffles are amazing
and super expensive.

468
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,210
Get up. Now.

469

- Okay.
- We'll follow you.

- That's an expensive bottle.
- Yeah, I know.

We didn't hurt anyone, right?

If I were you, I wouldn't say another word,

I wanna talk to your boss right now!

boring couple from New Jersey.

You know what we want.

Did you really think you could steal
from Joe Miletto and get away with it?

Okay, someone somewhere
is making a huge mistake.

- This is a mistake.

We don't know anything
about a ransom note.

- We don't have a flash drive, I assure you.
- No.

515
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,573
You were sitting at the table.

516

The girl at the front said
you were the Tripplehorns.

- No, no, no, no.
- Okay, let me... Okay. Let me explain.

518
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,414
My husband, very sweetly, but delusionally,

519
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,167
thought that we could
make it here early enough to get a table.

520
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,752
And we didn't. We were late,

521
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,838
because he won't listen
to the lady in the car,

522
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,800
- so they were very rude to us.
- They were so rude! That one guy...

523
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,386
And when we heard them
calling the reservation for Tripplehorns,

524
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,263
- he was, like, "Us! Us!"
- "Us! Us!" That's...

525
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,223
CLAIRE: And so we took it.
PHIL: Just going for it.

526
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,474
And then we had a great time.

527
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,767
I'm not gonna lie to you.
We had a great time.

528
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,478
- So much fun.
- The food, unbelievable.

529
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,938
- So good.
- So good.

530
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,107
- But then you came over...
- We had this rice thing...

531
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,693
Look, shut up! I don't wanna hear that.

532
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,196
So you just took
somebody else's reservation?

533
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,614
- For the record, I was against it.
- I...

534
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,408
But my husband gets
these plans in his head,

535
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,202
...and it becomes, like, a thing.
- I'm an idiot sometimes.

536
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,912
Shut up. Shut up.

537
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,583
- I believe you're the Fosters.
- Thank you.

538
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,086
I also believe
you go by the alias "Tripplehorn"

539
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,796
...and that you stole my boss's property.
- No. No.

540
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,173
And now you're just
too scared shitless to admit it.

541
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,385
So I will give you three seconds
to give us back the flash drive!

542
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,137
What... Okay. The three seconds game?

543
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,389
Sorry, sir. But, you know,
I play this every day with my kids.

- That's not scary.

I've got it! I've got it! I've got it!

553
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,452

- I've got the flash drive.

- Thought so.
- Where is it?

555
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,542
It's in the park.

- The park?
- Could you be more specific?

just guys from the restaurant.

that we are supposed to meet our friends,
who are a gay couple.

That's really nice of you,
but I don't think that's gonna close it.

765
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,557
Are you kidding me?

766
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,225
- What? What is she saying?
- She's saying...

767
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,811
What is that little bitch saying?
Herjeans are too tight!

768
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,482
You see, the thing is, my dad's been saying
I should jack your rate for a while now.

769
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,734
So, I could miss the party,

770
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,779
but, I think, rate-wise,
we're talking somewhere north of 30.

771
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,238
I see them.

772
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,574
- Pay it!
- Okay, fine. Fine. Katy, that's fine.

773
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,618
Just get the kids out of the house
right now.

774
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,453
Don't go out the front door.
Go out the back door.

775
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,662
Take them over to your house.

776
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,498
Okay, now I'm sensing
some kind of element of danger here.

777
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,624
No. No.

778
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,334
'Cause that's gonna run you
an extra five per.

779
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,252
Fine! Fine! Just get the kids out right now!

780
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,463
Tell them we love them
and everything is gonna be okay!

781
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,048
Everything's okay! Tell them we love them.

782
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,424
- Bye.
- Okay.

783
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,176
Sucker. Kids!

784
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,677
- Now what?
- They're safe. They're safe.

785
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,472
We need to find someplace
with a lot of people. A lot of people.

786
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,274
Hi, hi. Excuse me.

787
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,443
Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.

788
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,279
Our names are Claire and Phil Foster.

789
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:53,408
We are from New Jersey,
and through a series of strange events,

790
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,536
we have been confused with someone else.

791
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,789
And now, some unruly criminals,
who are also policemen...

792
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,541
- Right.
...are hunting us as prey.

793
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,086
Again, we're not the bad guys, they are.
We're not going to hurt you.

794
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,546
Honey, stop saying that,
'cause it makes it sound

795
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,589
- like we are gonna hurt them.
- No, no. They get it.

796
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,926
We need a place to hole up and hide,
and we don't have any money

797
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,428
because these criminals, these dirty cops...

798
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,848
Hey, hey.
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

799
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,891
Okay, this is the oldest scam in the book.

800
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,143
Beat it, junkies.

801
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,769
- MAN: They make me sick.
- So dirty.

802
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,563
Let's go.

803
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,523
We are on our own.

804
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,194
This whole night was a mistake.

805
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,822
We never should've come in to this city.
This was a crazy idea.

806
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,992
It wasn't a crazy idea.
It was just dinner in Manhattan.

807
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,828
One night, one date where we're just not
talking about the kids the entire time

808
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,414
- or what we have to do next week.
- And look where it got us.

809
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,040
We should call 911.

810
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,042
Honey, this is Joe Miletto
we're talking about.

811
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,461
- So?
- So? Those cops that tried to kill us?

812
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,963
They're in his pocket.

813
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,883
This guy owns cops!
We can't trust any cops.

814
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,802
What are we gonna do? We can't go home,
we can't go to the police...

815
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:58,515
Okay, okay, okay.
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorns, why?

816
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,100
Because they have the flash drive.

817
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,437
All right,
what if they gave him the flash drive back?

818
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,897
Why would they do that?

819
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,524
Because we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna make them do it.

820
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,943
Once Miletto has the flash drive,
this thing ends.

821
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,695
Okay. I like that. I am completely with you.

822
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,948
I just have to ask you one question,
and do not judge me.

823
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,950
What is a flash drive?

824
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,244
- Seriously?
- Phil, I can't...

825
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,831
Okay, it's a little storage disk
that you stick in the side of a laptop.

826
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,042
Oh, it's a computer sticky thing? That's...

827
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,377
In my office we call it
a computer sticky thing.

828
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,422
Okay. Okay. We need to get
the computer sticky thing to save our lives.

829
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,634
How? We don't know anything
about the Tripplehorns.

830
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,427
That's not entirely true.

831
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,471
We know where
they were going to have dinner tonight.

832
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,474
- Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

833
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,690
Hi, we were... Hello? Up here.

834
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,902
We were in here earlier,
having dinner with our friend Sam-I-Am.

835
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,238
- You mean Will.i.am?
- Okay.

836
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,114
Is that what you call him?
That's weird. I don't like that.

837
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,824
- Yeah, it is weird.
- No, listen, anyway,

838
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,744
we were here, and Will.i.am thinks
he left his phone at the table,

839
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,162
so we need to check at the table.

840
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,373
I'd like to check the table for the phone,
if you don't mind.

841
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,833
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Look at me. Can you... Oh, God.

842
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,919
- We need to check the table for the phone.
- What's your problem?

843
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,921
- Hello? Hello? Anything?
- Oh, my God.

844
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,089
- Here we go.
- How are you not getting this?

845
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,424
- He needs to check the table for the phone.
- Fine. This way.

846
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,593
- Wow. I just wasted half my life.

He said he left it on the table.

849

Okay, we got a phone number.

856
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,426
How do we use it to find their address?

857
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,387
I think I know someone who can help.

Wait, how do you know this guy, again?

859
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,976
I showed him a bunch of houses upstate.
I mean, it was a few years ago,

860
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,895
but I remember
he was some kind of security expert.

861
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,148
Anyway, he ended up
buying a place down here

862
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,899
from an agent in this office.

863

but maybe we can find it in the files.

- No, I don't. Can I have your coat?

- Yeah.

00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,972
come home, clean the house,
pick up the kids,

1065
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,848
take them to soccer,
bring them back from soccer,

1066
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,809
cook dinner, clean up that dinner,

1067
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,978
give them a bath
and get them into their pajamas,

1068
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,521
which is a fight every night.

1069
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:20,066
It's a big surprise to everybody every night
that they have to wear pajamas.

1070
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,113
And then, after I have washed everybody
else's food and boogers off of me,

1071
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:29,534
I use whatever energy I have left
to physically put myself into our bed

1072
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,036
instead of lighting up for you, so...

1073
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,122
Yeah, let's pull over.
This is a great time to...

1074
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,540
PHIL: Yeah, you know what?
We have to... Yes.

1075
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,917
We have to pull over.
I know you work hard, honey.

1076
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,878
But you know what would
make all the hard work 10 times easier?

1077
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,171
Me.

1078
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,216
If you would just trust me enough
to handle things once in a while,

1079
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,928
but, no, you don't.
You have to do it all yourself, your way.

1080
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,140
You got me screwing up before I even get
a chance to come through for you.

1081
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:55,059
And, yeah, you know what?
Maybe, occasionally,

1082
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:58,730
I might buy the toy made of Chinese lead,

1083
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,523
or I might make a sandwich for Ollie

1084
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,693
that, God forbid,
breaches the jelly perimeter,

1085
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,946
but if you just let me do something for you,

1086
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:10,241
I think that I would surprise you. I really do.

1087
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,786
I know I'd surprise you.

1088
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:19,459
You think I don't hear myself?
You think I like sounding like a total bitch?

(SIGHS)

1090
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,801
- Brad and Haley are splitting up.
- I know.

1091
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,222
Do you ever think about leaving me?

1092
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,308
No.

1093
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,939
Really? You never fantasize about
leaving me for another man?

1094
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,649
No, never. No.

1095
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:49,197
Never. No, God, if anything,
I fantasize sometimes about being alone.

1096
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,867
- What does that mean?
- (SIGHS) I don't know.

1097
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,329
Just, there are times
when I've just thought about,

1098
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,414
on my worst day, just, you know,

1099
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,249
leaving our house
and just going someplace.

1100
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:05,880
Like checking into a hotel
and just being in a quiet room by myself.

1101
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,925
Just sitting in a quiet air-conditioned room,

1102
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:13,221
sitting down, eating my lunch
with no one touching me,

1103
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,641
drinking a Diet Sprite, by myself.

1104
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,227
That sounds awful.

1105
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,062
Look, I just wanna have one day

1106
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,440
that doesn't depend on
how everybody else's day goes.

1107
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:27,110
It's not like I have
some gross sex fantasy or something.

1108
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:30,071
That I would understand.
That makes sense to me.

1109
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,864
I mean, everybody has gross sex fantasies.

1110
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,909
I mean, obviously yours is with Holbrooke.

1111
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,746
- With his 18-story shoulder muscles.
- He doesn't...

1112
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,540
Mine is with

- Yeah, she's hot.

1117
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,261
- Really? Like, present-day or...
- Present day.

1118
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,472
Well, it's an interesting choice.

1119
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:03,729
Brad said to me
that he and Haley were fine,

1120
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,067
and that they were
just really excellent roommates.

1121

That's not what we are, is it?

No.

Right?

00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:27,086
No.

1125
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,006
We should get going.

- What, the Fosters?
- The Fosters?

- You have a good memory.
- So anyway, they come in,

- That's odd.

So what was on
that computer sticky thing, anyway?

1432
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:26,521
- Just some ledgers and pictures.
- Pictures of what?

1433
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,691
Of services rendered
at one of Joe Miletto's clubs.

1434
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,318
A place called The Peppermint Hippo.

1435
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,278
Ew, Peppermint Hippo. That's...

1436
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,113
Neither of those two words is dirty,

1437
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,700
but somehow together,
that is the filthiest thing I've ever heard.

1438
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,661
Thing is, this ledger

1439
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:46,750
had only pictures
and information about one client,

1440
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,668
District Attorney Crenshaw.

1441
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,503
- The guy with the broom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1442
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:54,174
The Tripplehorns may have stolen
the flash drive from Miletto,

1443
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,759
but they were blackmailing the DA.

1444
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,220
That's ambitious for those two dirtbags.

1445
01:15:58,846 --> 01:15:59,888
Doesn't even matter now, though,

1446
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,058
because the computer sticky thing
is at the bottom of the East River,

1447
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:06,311
which is where we'll be
if those cops catch up with us.

1448
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,147
Okay, you know
I'm not so good with complicated plots,

1449
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,775
- so walk me through this again.
- Hon...

1450
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,276
Honey, if I'm gonna get whacked off,

1451
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:16,404
I at least deserve to understand
why it's happening.

1452
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,782
- What're you smiling about?
- No. You're very sweet.

1453
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,868
We're not going...
Hon, we're not going to get whacked off.

1454
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:22,994
I think we are.

1455
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,414
No, we might get bumped off.
We might get whacked.

1456
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:29,834
Okay. Let me... Okay,
let me break it down for you, all righty?

1457
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:33,213
That guy over there.
Let's just say that guy is Crenshaw.

1458
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,423
He's a DA. He's a good guy.

1459
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,052
He should be busting
people like Joe Miletto.

1460
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,347
He's a gangster. He's a bad guy.
He's very bad.

1461
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,849
But Crenshaw can't bust Miletto,

1462
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:49,271
because Crenshaw goes to Miletto's clubs
to get hookers.

1463
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,733
Oh, boy, I hope she's really a hooker.
That would be amazing.

1464
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:57,445
Now, Miletto makes
a flash drive implicating Crenshaw.

1465
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,489
Which Taste and Whippit steal

1466
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,366
from The Peppermint Hippo,
where she works.

1467
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:05,120
Right, they steal it
so they can blackmail the DA.

1468
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,081
So, those two cops don't work for Miletto.
They work for Crenshaw.

1469
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,165
Right.

1470
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,294
And that's why Taste was acting so weird
when you mentioned Miletto's name.

1471
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,130
- Right.
- Oh, my God, Phil, I totally got this.

1472
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,799
- It has something to do with Crenshaw?
- It has...

1473
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,968
Yes, honey, it has
everything to do with Crenshaw.

1474
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,553
That's the key.

1475
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,722
We have to find a way to get to Crenshaw.

1476
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,934
Well, the Tripplehorns got to him
at The Peppermint Hippo.

1477
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,812
And we're the Tripplehorns.

1478
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,564
Hells yes, we are.

1479
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,653
We're gonna need some help.

1480
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,405
Oh, "whacked off"! Oh! Oh, God.

1481
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,240
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1482
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,163
Hi.

1483
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,373
Is that my tracksuit?

1484
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,418
Yes, it was in the trunk of your Audi,

1485
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,712
which is now parked
over by the East River,

1486
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:59,341
and is probably
in need of significant repair,

1487
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,676
for which I'm sure
I'll be able to pay you back

1488
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,429
over the next several decades.
Also, on my tab,

1489
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:08,767
I would like to add that super old gun
that I stole from your hallway,

1490
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,644
which, incidentally, was not very useful.

1491
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,438
It just went... (EXHALES)

1492
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,357
PHIL: But that's not the reason we're here.

1493
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,651
As impossible as this may be
to believe, Holbrooke,

1494
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:23,365
our night has actually gotten weirder
since we saw you last.

1495
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:26,409
There were cars, then we...
They got hooked, and...

1496
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:27,869
One of them was your car. Anyway...

1497
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,704
I've had an interesting night myself.

1498
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,791
And I'm really tired, so as nice as it was
to see you again, Claire,

1499
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,834
how about you two
go knock on somebody else's door, okay?

1500
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,462
- No...
- No, no, no. No. Here's the thing.

1501
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:41,716
I just wanted
to take my wife to dinner tonight.

1502
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:45,053
I was just hoping
that we would have one night

1503
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:49,641
where we could, you know, feel like new.

1504
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:53,478
And now, all I want to do is get us home.

1505
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:57,190
And I've got a plan.
I've got a way to do that.

1506
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,568
I'm not very good with plans generally,
but I've got one.

1507
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,779
And I need help.

1508
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,490
And even though your pecs
make me wanna kill myself,

1509
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,411
and your girlfriend is so hot it's like
looking through a shimmering jet engine,

1510
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:14,165
I know, and I believe,
that there is a real person

1511
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,961
that understands exactly
what I'm going through right now.

1512

Oh, you guys keep showing up!

1668
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:50,241
Why don't we take a walk
and talk about things privately?

1669
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,578
This could have been so good.

This is part of the plan, right?

1671
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,134
I got to go back in the subway
for a refresher.

1673
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,053
CRENSHAW: Okay.

1674
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:15,641
Let's make this simple, okay?
You give me the flash drive,

1675
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:18,686
or Collins is going to break
both your wife's arms.

1676
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,897
I put the flash drive someplace
no one is ever going to find it.

1677
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:23,566
But if our associate, Mr. Holbrooke Grant,

1678
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,944
doesn't hear from us
every hour on the hour until we're safe,

1679
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:30,281
then he will release
the contents of that drive.

1680
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,452
He's the ex-military guy
we questioned tonight.

1683
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,168
Excuse me, sir,
we're trying to do a rooftop thing.

1684
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:43,669
- Could you just give us a minute?
- Frank?

1685
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:47,423
No! I can't give you a minute.
This is my rooftop, toots!

1686
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,258
Okay.

1687
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,926
It's okay, Claire. We were expecting him.

1688
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:55,056
- What? Oh, my God! I am so lost.
- They were just about to leave, Joe.

1689
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,183
You know, they got a guy on the outside
that has the flash drive.

1690
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,976
Yeah, the flash drive. There's no play here.

1691
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,269
You've seen the flash drive?

1692
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:04,231
Oh, don't worry, though.
We won't say a word about the pictures.

1693
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,983
Just shut your mouth.

1694
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,735
- What pictures?
- Nothing.

1695
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,695
- He doesn't know?
- Know what?

1696
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,366
Oh, wow!
I kind of pulled a boner here. Sorry.

1697
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:17,787
But I get it. I totally know why you'd have
pornographic pictures of the DA.

for a rainy day.

they're gonna come in handy!

- You zip your vagina.

No. No, it's okay! When he says "vagina,"
he means your face.

1702

You said that what was on that drive

1703
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:34,178
were the city contracts
that I flowed your way.

1704

All this time,
I've been keeping the cops off your ass,

- Really dirty, gross pictures.
