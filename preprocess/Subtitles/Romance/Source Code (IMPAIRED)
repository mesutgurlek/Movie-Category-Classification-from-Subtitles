of a woman's name.

What was that name?

118

- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

How is it detonated?

- Right.
- Find the bomb,

00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,057
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

168
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,536
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

169
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,838
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

170
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,678
- CONDUCTOR: Ticket?
- The distraction.

171
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,579
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

172
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,914
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

173
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,113
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

174
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,056
Hey, Grandpa,
what the hell was the delay back there?

175
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,017
- What are you late for?
- What?

176
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,292
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

177
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,334
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

178
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,426
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?

179
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:52,595
Yeah.

180
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,101
He is a comedian.

181
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,836
Sit down.

182
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,231
Freak.

183
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,374
Fans.

184
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,681
That's the guy.

185
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:07,377
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.

186
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:10,548
- (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING)
- We talked about him.

187
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,647
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

188
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:15,420
Glenbrook Station.

189
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,791
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

190
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,123
WOMAN: Damn it!

191
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,563
MAN: I'm sorry.

192
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,761
WOMAN: Just let me get it, okay?

193
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,703
Hey, mister!

194
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,142
Hey!

195
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,305
Hey! You dropped this.

196
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,444
Thanks.

197
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,699
ANNOUNCER: All aboard.

198
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,194
Doors are closing.

199
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,579
This is a Chicago-bound train.

200
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,885
The explosion came from behind me.

201
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,953
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.

202
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,396
MAX: I got time for you.

203
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,331
Next stop, Chicago.

204
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,202
Union Station.

205
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,073
Holy shit.

206
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,517
(BEEPS)

207
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,328
Goodwin?

208
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,160
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?

209
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:37,960
Uh...

210
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,203
Should I...

211
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,333
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...

212
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,443
Okay, um...

213
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,644
(EXHALES)

214
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:54,310
I'm just gonna leave it.

215
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,046
Okay?

216
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,087
I'll be late.

217
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,106
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.

218
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,776
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

219
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,218
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

220
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,619
until we pull into the station, okay?

221
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,053
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

222
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,356
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

223
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,897
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

224
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,464
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?

225
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,263
Sir? Sir.

226
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,697
Is there a problem here, sir?

227
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,206
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?

228
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,743
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

229
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,800
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

230
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,907
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

231
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,037
Hey!

232
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,245
Sean! What are you doing?

233
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,450
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

234
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,313
That's not a good idea.

235
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:05,947
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

236
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,184
He's not any more real than you are.

237
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,658
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?

238
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,922
Not gonna be a next time.

239
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,943
(GASPING)

240
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,673
Stabilize.

241
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,886
Lower your pulse.

242
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,149
Did you find the bomb?

243
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,719
Yes.

244
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,099
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

245
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,068
It's not a concern, Captain.

246
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,902
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

247
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,412
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

248
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,915
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

249
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,143
That's irrelevant, Captain.

250
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,014
I want to talk to your commanding officer!

251
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,314
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

252
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,358
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

253
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,690
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

254
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,858
You've been with us for two months.

255
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,468
Did you ID the bomber?

256
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,571
No. Where's my unit?

257
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,402
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

258
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,777
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

259
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:38,571
What lives?

260
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,082
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

261
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,484
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,990
I need to be briefed.

263
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,168
Sir, I need to give him something.

264
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:00,561
That's fine. Go ahead.

265
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:01,832
Okay.

266
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,504
Get ready to send him back in.

267
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:10,011
MAN: We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do
all the profiles right now.

268
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,878
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

269
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,648
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

270
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,189
killing everyone on board.

271
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,157
And that's the train that you've been on.

272
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,320
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

273
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,962
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

274
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:32,594
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

275
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,400
Every second spent explaining things

276
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,442
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

277
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,537
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

278
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,639
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

279
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:47,209
Now, did you find the bomb?

280
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,588
In the restroom.

281
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,123
Ventilation panel above the sink.

282
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,058
Cell phone detonator.

283
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,955
Are we done?

284
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,461
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

285
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,000
Good.

286
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:10,702
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

287
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:14,233
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

288
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,610
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

289
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,378
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

290
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,112
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

291
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,586
to engulf the passing freight train,

292
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,648
which means the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.

293
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,553
Fifty-two callers.

294
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,118
One of those is our bomber.

295
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,963
I want you to concentrate on the passengers
in your car. Get to know them.

296
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,096
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

297
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,731
quiet or withdrawn.

298
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,469
Who seem nervous.

299
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,170
As always, you will have eight minutes.

300
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,410
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?

301
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes.

302
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,281
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

303
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,449
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.

304
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,890
Everything else is irrelevant.

305
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,052
Charge the drivers.

306
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,255
Okay. Has my father even...

307
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,169
I took your advice.

308
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,134
It was very good advice.

309
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,007
MAN: Watch it.

310
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,674
- CHRISTINA: You're kind of quiet today.
- (CAN OPENING)

311
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,240
Just got a lot on my mind.

312
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:28,307
Careful.

313
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,680
CHRISTINA: Yikes.

314
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,312
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

315
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,484
Ticket?

316
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,550
That was very kind of you.

317
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,999
You're very decent.

318
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,538
Thank you.

319
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,211
You're real.

320
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:55,640
Ticket?

321
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,074
- COLTER: How's everything today?
- It's good.

322
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,618
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

323
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,246
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- I meant behavior on the train.

324
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,951
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

325
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,652
You're a little strange.

326
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:15,992
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

327

with the minister and Denoff there.

He's the expendable one.

00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,168
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

490
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,368
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

491
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,568
- Yes.
- Of course.

492
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,516
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged,

493
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,711
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

494
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,851
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

495
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,618
It contains a short-term memory track

496
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,352
that's approximately eight minutes long.

497
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,857
Like a convenience store security camera

498
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,296
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

499
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,163
Now, in combining these two phenomena,

500
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,799
circuitry that remains viable post-mortem

501
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:03,362
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

502
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,773
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

503
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,741
Sean Fentress died on that train.

504
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,041
Of all the passengers aboard,

505
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,573
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

506
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,486
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

507
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,250
What happens after the eight minutes?

508
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:24,685
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

509
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:29,723
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

510
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:35,371
Source code is not time travel.

511
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:39,068
Rather, source code is time reassignment.

512
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:43,079
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

513
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,479
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy,

514
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:46,948
but source code empowers us...

515
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:50,214
No, but I saved one person.

516
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,847
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

517
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:55,653
I pulled her off the train.

518
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,489
Give me her name.

519
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:02,220
Christina. I don't remember her last name.

520
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,097
Her name was Christina Warren.

521
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,304
- Yes.
- She was 28.

522
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,675
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

523
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,906
Died this morning on the train.

524
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:21,711
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.

525
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:22,809
No, she isn't.

526
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,315
Believe me. She is.

527
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:25,744
Believe me!

528
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,087
She saw me get hit by the express train.

529
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,056
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

530
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:34,257
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

531
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:35,355
What second attack?

532
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,527
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

533
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,233
(STAMMERING)

534
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,101
What aren't you telling me here?

535
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:45,966
We have information
that downtown Chicago is the next target,

536
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,238
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

537
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,709
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

538
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,306
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

539
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:54,777
We're evacuating as we speak.

540
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,445
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

541
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,251
GOODWIN: If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

542
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,849
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

543
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,660
We have very little time left. Out here,
the clocks only move in one direction.

544
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:09,031
Charge the drivers.

545
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,000
GOODWIN: On the upper deck of the next
carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.

546
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,361
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

547
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,736
Inside is a loaded handgun.

548
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,004
Get to it. You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

549
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,905
CHRISTINA: (ECHOING) I took your advice.

550
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,285
It was very good advice.

551
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,558
You're still here.

552
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,686
Of course I am.

553
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:39,751
Guess what?

554
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:42,090
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

555
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:43,957
Good guess.

556
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:45,158
Soda can.

557
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,793
- Coffee spill.
- (TRICKLING)

558
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,672
Listen to me.

559
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,636
Don't answer this.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

561
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,203
You deserve better than that guy.

562
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,509
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

563
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,347
- CONDUCTOR: Ticket?
- How did you know that was...

564
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,211
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.

565
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,913
- How well do you know me?
- MAX: Hey, Grandpa...

566
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,249
Not that well, apparently.

567
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,187
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

568
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,020
a little strange
and was maybe even a little bit dangerous,

569
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:11,151
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

570
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:13,890
No.

571
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,528
Wow. That was honest.

572
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,235
You're beautiful. You're kind.

573
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,401
And you're painfully honest.

574
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,333
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?

575
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,844
It's the new me.

All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

CHRISTINA: No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

583
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,731
He needs medical attention.

584
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:01,101
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train's security box?

585
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,695
Careful, ma'am.

586
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,374
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

587
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,172
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

588
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,215
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?

589
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,788
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

590
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,851
I don't know.

591
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,558
I would call my dad.

592
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,931
I would hear his voice,

593
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,796
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox,
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

598
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,293
Did you make any progress?

599
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:08,160
Can I get access to a phone?

600
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,306
I need to talk to my father.

601
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,370
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

602
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,341
Goodwin, how am I doing?

603
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,180
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

604
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:27,121
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

605
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,854
We are wasting valuable time here.

606
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,032
No, no.

607
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:45,233
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

608
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:48,243
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

(MUTTERING) CAOC-N. What is that?

Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

611
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,516
What are they?

612
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,679
Captain, you should have found a suspect
by now.

613
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,856
This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given you,

614
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,621
don't squander it thinking. Do.

615
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,894
Please contact my father for me.

616
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,035
This will stop at some point, Captain.

617
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:15,427
As soon as you finish the mission.

618
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:18,836
And you're doing really great.

619
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:20,966
And this will end.

620
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,973
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

621
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,348
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

622
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,408
flashlight, something.

623
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,415
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

624
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,629
So, I took your advice.

625
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,987
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

626
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,544
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.

627
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:03,552
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

628
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,419
Were you in the military?

629
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,548
A friend of mine was.

630
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:14,290
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared,
and no one's heard from him since.

631
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,102
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

632
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,728
No.

633
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,699
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

634
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,406
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

635
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,710
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.

636
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:35,444
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

637
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,343
Okay. You owe me.

638
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,052
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

639
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:41,454
Why don't I get one for you now?

640
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,992
Okay. Christina?

641
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:45,783
Um...

642
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,957
I've been having these dreams lately.

643
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,867
Really vivid.

644
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:54,826
And you've been in them.

645
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,930
Really?

646
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,602
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

647
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:02,167
It's just...

648
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,966
Um...

649
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,730
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.

650
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:32,603
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

651
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,269
For what?

652
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:39,808
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

653
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,010
Can I borrow a pen?

654
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,821
Yeah, sure.

655
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,926
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

656
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:54,755
Hey, your bag is a mess.

657
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,698
What are you doing, man?

658
00:43:56,766 --> 00:44:00,429
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.

659
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:01,800
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

660
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,168
Finish your deal.

661
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,174
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

662
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,008
This guy.

663
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:10,138
Don't do that.

664
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:12,477
Nothing. What am I doing?

665
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,545
Jesus.

666
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,243
Dick.

667
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,379
CAOC-N.

668
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,324
- WOMAN: Can you believe that?
- Asshole.

669
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,398
Excuse me, ma'am?

670
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,938
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.

671
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,032
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

672
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:42,376
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

673
00:44:42,445 --> 00:44:43,844
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...

674
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:46,108
Then what was going on down there?

675
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,448
Oh, you know, uh...

676
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:54,854
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually, about this patch.

677
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:56,915
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

678
00:44:56,993 --> 00:45:00,156
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?

679
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,322
Do you know what the "N" stands for?

680
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,699
It's Air Force, and the "N" stands for Nellis.

681
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,067
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

682
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,333
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?

683
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,332
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

684
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,505
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

685
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:19,480
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.

686
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:21,744
All right. Thank you so much.

687
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,028
This is a Chicago-bound train.

688
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,890
Next stop, Chicago,

689
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,332
Union Station.

690
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,663
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

691
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,000
Post Operator.

692
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,641
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

693
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:56,683
Name, please?

694
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,846
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

695
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,823
- Hold the line.
- ANNOUNCER: All aboard.

696
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:03,222
Doors are closing.

697
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,818
OPERATOR: Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

698
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,764
I have to tell you something.

699
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,529
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

700
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:16,834
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...

701
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:19,001
He's dead, Sean.

702
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,802
What?

703
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,344
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

704
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:28,848
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

705
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,443
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

706
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,988
It was on the first site I tried.

707
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,020
His father's name is Donald, right?

708
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,260
This is from last week.

709
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,095
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

711

00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,698

715

"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."

716
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,543
I'm sorry.

GOODWIN: (ECHOING) Captain?

718
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,193
Sean? Talk to me.

719
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,163
Captain?

720
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,134
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

721
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:22,137
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.

722
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,531
Hey, this guy's crashing!

723
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:28,404
(RAPID BEEPING)

724
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:33,073
GOODWIN: Captain, just tell me what you see.
Just look and speak.

725
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:34,912
COLTER: I see a card.

726
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,178
GOODWIN: That's good.

727
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,050
COLTER: Do you copy?
We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.

728
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,216
GOODWIN: That's very good.

729
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:54,761
Am I dead?

730
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:04,805
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

731
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,007
and my father received a medal for me.

732
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:07,674
Your condition's not the issue here.

733
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:10,449
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

734
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,078
Everything else is irrelevant.

735
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:15,315
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

736
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:20,085
Until the person or persons
who blew up that train are in custody, yes.

737
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,093
Goodwin,

738
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,929
one soldier to another, am I dead?

739
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,750
Part of your brain remains activated.

740
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:46,112
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

741
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,315
They still move.

742
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,547
They are a manifestation.

743
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,992
They're just your way of making sense
of all this.

744
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:56,821
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

745
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:02,163
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

746
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,310
MAN: We have core temp dropping.

(RUMBLING)

748
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:40,566
Captain, what just happened?

749
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:48,475
I asked you a question.

750
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:49,745
(SIGHS)

751
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,054
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

752
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:56,182
Where am I?

753
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,015
That's classified.

754
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,421
Fuck you!

755
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,236
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

756
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:12,399
But if we're to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.

757
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:15,911
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

758
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,207
while inside the source code,

759
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,645
even to investigate your...

760
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:22,050
Even to investigate what happened to you.

761
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,845
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

762
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:29,784
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

763
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,793
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

764
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:37,424
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train,

765
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,300
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

766
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,838
If the call even went through,

767
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:45,999
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

768
00:50:47,076 --> 00:50:52,207
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

769
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:55,375
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

770
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:58,943
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

771
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,683
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

772
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:02,447
I'll see if that makes an impression!

773
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:07,155
You cannot alter the continuum
of this reality from within the source code.

774
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,026
This can't be legal, what you're doing.

775
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:12,625
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself

776
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,364
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

777
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:22,237
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

778
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:25,769
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

779

(STAMMERS)

780
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:31,178
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?

781
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,316
That's immaterial.

782
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,650
Any soldier I've ever served with would say
that one death is service enough.

783
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:42,028
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

784
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,329
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

785
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,363
Terminate your service. Let you die.

786
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,730
This is taking too long.

787
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,270
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

788
00:51:58,414 --> 00:52:01,076
I am certain we can find other servicemen

789
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,380
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

790
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,717
being a part of this program an honor.

791
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,880
What? No, wait, what?

792
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:11,082
Send him back.

793
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,187
Charge the drivers.

794
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:21,231
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

795
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,171
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

796
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,869
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

797
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:30,839
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.

798
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:32,970

799
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:34,805
Hey, Grandpa.

Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

802

He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

(SIGHS) I'm still waiting on an answer.

967
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:02,351
Are you married, Captain?

968
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:03,950
Um...

-You deserve to celebrate.
-Sure.

No, I'm fine.

Why? Are you asking me on a date?

Sorry. Poor taste.

- Are you married?
- Hmm?

977
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,437
No.

978
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:27,771
I am divorced.

979
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:32,482
Do you think
there's an alternate version of you?

980
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,850
A Goodwin who made different choices?

981
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:37,685
What do you mean?

982
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:41,694
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

983
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,993
Or just married someone else.

984

A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

985

No, I don't, Captain.

986

What you experienced was a shadow.

987
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,604
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

988

to alter the past.

It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

992
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:20,461
I missed something, Captain.

993
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,798
That train shouldn't have blown up.

994
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:24,361
There must have been a second detonator,

995

It's a computer program, Captain.

997

The girl on the train, all the others,
they're lost.

998
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:37,217
I'm sorry about that.

we told Captain Stevens

1060
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,879
that we were gonna let him die.

1061
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:34,438
Let him die?

1062
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,215
He just saved millions of lives today.

1063

How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?
