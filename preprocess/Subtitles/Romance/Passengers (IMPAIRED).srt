00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,464
Hello.. hello?

00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,649
Oh, hi.

5
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,748
Oh, I'm wide awake.
What's up?

6
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,404
Sources are telling us that
this decision was made...

7
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,268
in the last few minutes at the precaution
and there is no indication...

8
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,295
that this airplane crash was
anything other than an accident.

9
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:39,427
In any case, it is too soon to determine
whether the system malfunction...

10
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:42,543
was involved or whether human error was--

11
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:52,705
- Hello, my dear.
- Hi.

12
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,706
It's freezing.

13
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,707
Thank you for coming so quickly.

14
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,098
Of course.
Thank you.

00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,698
They came down on a beach, near Pinewood.
Just a handful were left, out of 109.

16
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,230
You should handle the whole group.

17
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:08,911
Really?

18
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,962
No, you're gonna have to trust
my judgment on this one.

19
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,771
It's time to shake you out of this
comfort zone you're in.

20
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,577
I'm not in a comfort zone.

Two master's degrees, already?
Ph.D. that never ends?

22
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,602
That sounds pretty cozy to me.

23
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:29,326
Okay, that's the start, mostly,
it's nothing new.

24
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:32,674
One will require little more work,
though. He's euphoric.

25
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,944
He's feeling little
hmm... too good.

26
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:40,990
Uh...

27
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,412
Oh!  I'm sorry--

28
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,474
Oh, excuse me, could you-- ?

00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,522
Come in!

32
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:28,664
Mr. Clark.

33
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,534
I'm Eric.

34
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,743
- Dr. Summers.
- Hi.

35
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,012
May I?

36
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,436
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:39,498
How are you feeling?

38
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,870
I feel great.

39
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,114
Mr. Clark, I'm a therapist.

40
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,778
I'm recommending that the passengers
meet with me in group sessions.

41
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,698
You are?
Well, no thanks.

42
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,351
Oh, okay. I understand.

43
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:57,116
If you'd feel more comfortable,
outside of the group environment...

44
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:58,273
we could meet one on one.

45
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,447
You make house calls?

46
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:04,339
Well, it's.. not.. protocol.. but.. hmm..
sometimes, under special circumstances.

47
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:08,352
What does one have to do to become
a "special circumstance" around here?

48
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,062
Survive a plane crash?

49
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,537
Uhmm..

50
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,593
You have a very lovely way about you.

51
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,646
Hmm?

52
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,531
I mean you're very formal,
but--

53
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,128
it's charming.

54
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,607
Is this your correct
contact information?

55
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,188
Okay.

56
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:32,509
So, umm..

57
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,284
Friday at five?

00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:41,543

60
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:44,993
Is there anyone here for you?

61
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,770
- No.
- I can call someone if you.. want me to.

62
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,109
It's okay.

63
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,501
Feel better.

Yes?

68
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,094
Do you have a sister?

69
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:12,945
Yes.

70
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,062
You should call her.

71
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,483
What?

72
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,576
Better now than later.

73
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,766
You could step out front of a bus
or something, and then what?

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,928

- Your laundry.

Oh, right, oh--

79
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,745
It was sitting in the dryer
for a while.

80
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,549
Oh, I'm sorry, I had an emergency
at work, and I had to run out.

81
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,924
Um, I've noticed that sometimes
you're too busy to pick up...

82
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,011
your newspapers, so I can take them
and hold them for you.

83
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,287
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

84
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:10,602
It's no bother.

85
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:14,915
Oh.. thank you.. but, you know what..
thank you, that's something...

not to let happen again.

you let me know.

I was at peace.

106
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,542
I always knew that I wouldn't live to
an old age so I just thought this is it.

107
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:50,364
I looked around.. and just felt such
a pity for everyone.. all that fear.

109
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,021
when did you first realize
that something was wrong?

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,718
Uh.. we were still up pretty high, and...

111
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:06,674
plane was just cruising along,
and there was this sound...

112
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,593
the lights went up and there was a flash--

113
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:10,994
That's not what happened.

114
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,733
There were no explosions
'till after we hit the ground.

115
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,028
No warning, nothing.

116
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,896
That's right.
It was when we were landing.

117
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,035
Don't tell me what I remember. Okay?

118
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,189
Shannon, Shannon...

119
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:26,752
you said that you looked around
and you saw that fear...

120
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,837
but also that it was so sudden that..
you hit the ground without warning.

121
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:33,582
So?

122
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,564
When exactly did you have that moment
to look around at the others?

123
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:41,737
Does it matter?
Is this a test?

124
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,351
No, of course, it's not a test.

125
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,423
Janice?

126
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,010
Do you remember any of this?

127
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,331
Dean...

128
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,842
there was something you said earlier
I really wanted to talk to you about...

129
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:09,651
beca--

130
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,622
Excuse me for a second.

131
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,323
I'm afraid that's not what happened.

132
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:39,082
The pilot misjudged the approach
and lost control.

133
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,339
Mistakes were made, unfortunately.

134
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,437
This passenger remembers fire on board,
maybe, before impact.

135
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:50,148
But, isn't it common for..
people who are going through this...

136
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:58,833
to be disoriented.. to be unsure
of what he saw.. even delusional.

137
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:04,658
Yes, but it's also possible to be
in a heightened state of awareness...

138
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,090
where every details and
sensations are remembered.

139
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:14,052
Dr. Summers,
let's try to be careful.

140
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,489
I'm not trying to challenge any findings
or put the airliner on the spot.

141
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,925
I'm only thinking of the patients.

142
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,266
Accurate reconstruction of events is
essential to healing process, that's all.

143
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:29,572
Thank you.

144
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,084
- Good day, doctor.
- Good day.

Hi, you scared me.

148
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:05,867
What are you doing here, doctor?

149
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,775
We have an appointment.
At.. umm.. here.

150
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,594
Oh, yeah, the house call.
I completely forgot.

151
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,647
No, it's okay.

152
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:18,954
Wanna a fig?

153
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,766
No, you should probably wash those.

154
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,496
So, let's just clear the air, okay?
I'm not anyone's patient, all right?

155
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,749
Okay.

156
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,467
Cream and sugar for you.

157
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:02,090
You are very attractive.

158
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,246
Thank you.

159
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,737
Eric, you feel fine now,
ecstatic, even, it's common.

160
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,314
But.. when we go through
shocks to the system...

161
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,583
there is often a repression
of negative feelings.

162
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:22,179
Later on, these feelings will creep up
on you. There will be a balance due.

163
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,741
Do you paint?

164
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,565
No.

00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,691
I always wanted to paint.

166
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,212
But I never dared.

167
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,978
What kind of things would you paint?

168
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,371
(Chuckling)

169
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,113
God you just can't help yourself,
can you, doctor?

170
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:41,075
Okay.

171
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,892
I did promise.

172
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,069
What do you do for work?

173
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,347
I'm a VP at Hein Dragg,
it's a brokerage firm.

174
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,785
But I'm not going back to that.

175
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:05,128
I've spent most of my life,
living the wrong way.

176
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,694
See my control towel, over here?

177
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,076
Printer, fax, high-speed Internet,
computers, e-mail, telephone, cell phone...

178
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:20,076
multimessengers, it's horse-shit.

179
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,037
Design to keep people away
from each other.

180
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,623
Did you feel that way before..
before the accident?

181
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,314
No, I was too busy working my ass off,
afraid of the rain.

182
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,016
So, you're re-evaluating your priorities.

183
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,952
Well put.

184
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:48,779
Eric, it's really important that we mean
to revisit your experience.

185
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,575
Okay.

186
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,705
What's the first thing that comes
to your mind about the accident?

187
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:12,399
The wind in my face.

188
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:16,477
Okay, what do you remember after that?

189
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,262
Walking the beach,
next to a rather large bonfire.

190
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,898
Can you remember anything else
between these two events?

191
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,367
One of the other passengers says that
he remembers bright light...

192
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,332
or a loud noise, perhaps...

193
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,198
but something during the mid-flight.

194
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,682
It's okay to cry.

195
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm not gonna cry.

196
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,985
Uhmm..

197
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,890
What else?

198
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,973
Are you sleeping?

199
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:08,192
Of course.

200
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,998
Any dreams?

201
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:12,882
I don't remember.

202
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,332
Stick around, I will awake you
when I'm having one.

203
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,532
No thanks.

204
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,616
Why not?

205
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:24,314
I don't know.

206
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,021
It's frowned upon in
my professional community.

207
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,562
Isn't that silly?

208
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,313
It is silly.

209
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,165
Directions to the group meeting.

210
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,112
You should come by, Eric,
you won't regret it.

211
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,951
You're like a dog with a bone.

212
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,524
Thanks for the coffee.

213
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,237
Hey, Claire.

214
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,024
Drop by any time.

215
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,134
Did you mention me to Eric Clark
before I came along?

216
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,558
- No.
- No?

217
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,363
I've never met him.

218
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,637
He knows personal things about me.

219
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,025
Like what?

220
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:38,414
Not any big things, how to
take my coffee, that I have a sister.

221
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,504
How does he explain it?

222
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,930
No, he hasn't tried,
and I haven't asked.

223
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,191
How is your sister?

224
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,443
Uhmm..

225
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,310
Emma?

226
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,312
Emma, right.

227
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,741
- She's good.
- She's good?

228
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,530
She's good. Yeah...

229
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,940
I've been doing some research
on some PTSD patients...

230
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:59,372
that may have developed
an extrasensory perception.

231
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,676
Really?

232
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,190
It's a.. theory.

233
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,505
Most of combat veterans.

234
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:10,959
So, he's a..
so, he's reading your mind.

235
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:13,660
Hmm?

236
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:16,743
- Yes?
- All right, all right.

237
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,398
(Chuckling)

238
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,501
Claire.

239
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,327
Did they even find any more information
about what happened up there?

240
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,232
Why do you ask?

241
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,491
Well, their initial assessments
are all over the place.

242
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,152
This one passenger, Dean Haschle,
he seems to remember...

243
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,776
an explosion on board.
None of the others agree.

244
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,157
They all have a different story.

245
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,762
There's bound to be some discrepancies.

246
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,944
An explosion would cause
an accident, not a pilot error.

247
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,785
I spoke to a man at the airline, and
he seemed pretty annoyed by this theory.

248
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:55,205
- And..
- Stop, stop, stop. You're not a detective.

249
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,869
Stick to your patients,
and their progresses. That's it.

250
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:04,551
Okay, fair enough, but the huge part of
their progress will be knowing the truth.

251
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:07,196
'The truth heals,' who said that?

252
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,109
I don't know, some dead white guy.

253
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,892
No, you.

254
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,359
Well, how are you finding the work?

255
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:18,022
Well, I should have been doing
this long time ago, well, you knew that.

256
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,987
Better late than never, I guess.

257
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:24,540
This is good. This is good.

258
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:41,645
Does anyone have a contact
with Dean since our last session?

259
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,593
Not surprised that he isn't back.

260
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,023
I don't think this little
get-togethers are any use...

261
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,438
spilling your guts to strangers.

262
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:57,164
Shannon.. have you tried talking
to your friends or relatives...

263
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,833
about what you're feeling?

264
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,902
Loved ones could be great source of comfort.

265
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,134
Nope.

266
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,703
Are you all right?

267
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,503
I'm good.

268
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,218
I'm little tired.

269
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,235
Are you sleeping well?

270
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:17,941
Not really.

271
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,640
We can talk to a physician
and get you something to help you sleep.

272
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:25,532
No.

273
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:31,631
Good night, Shannon.

274
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,854
Do you always offer medication
in front of other patients?

275
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:39,871
Oh, Shannon, I'm sorr--

276
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,492
What qualifies you,
really, to talk to us?

277
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,495
You have no idea
what any of us are going through.

278
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,228
Doctor!

279
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:10,388
Norman?

280
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:11,447
In your car, please.

281
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,718
- What's the matter?
- Let's go. C'mon.

282
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:14,116
Norman.

283
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,813
Please! Just bear with me.

284
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,024
Okay. Okay.

285
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,814
Just pull out here, and make this U-turn.

286
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,144
Why?

287
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,607
Dr. Summers, please.

288
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,453
Okay.

289
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,395
Put on your seatbelt.

290
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:57,679
Where are we going?

291
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,807
Drive past that building,
but don't stop.

292
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:00,408
Okay.

293
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:12,273
There!
There, he is.

294
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,177
That man was here the other day.

295
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,923
He's been following me.

296
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:22,978
Who is he?

297
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:25,963
I think he's with airlines.
They've been monitoring us.

298
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,155
Why.. why would they do that?

299
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:32,565
The other night, when Dean said
he remembered a flash...

300
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:36,997
or something bright,
like a fire, or an explosion...

301
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:39,726
it started coming back to me.

302
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:44,095
They're saying that the pilot missed
the approach or some bullshit.

303
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:47,024
That's wrong.

304
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,586
There was an explosion on board,
I remember it now, too.

305
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,856
Why would they lie
about something like that?

306
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,433
They had another accident, last year,
off the coast of California.

307
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,587
A mechnical failure, another problem
like that would sink them.

308
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:03,330
They're after us now.

309
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,364
Norman, we can't assume that.

310
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,845
You don't know these people.
A corporation like this...

311
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:12,181
it's all about money, they are capable
of anything to save their asses.

312
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:15,685
Norman, I understand that you feel
vulnerable right now...

313
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:19,591
and paranoid feelings are common
amongst people who have been through...

314
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,415
what you've just been through, but.. uh...

315
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,903
I don't think the airline is
after you, okay?

316
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,593
Let me take you home, where do you live?

317
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:04,475
[Phone ringing]

318
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:08,668
Hi, you've reached Hannah,
Paul, Luke, and Emma.

319
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,212
Leave us a message.

320
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,102
Hi, Emma, it's Claire.
I left you a message...

321
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,478
which wasn't easy, but I'm trying, okay?

322
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:25,383
But we're grown-ups, you know,
let's agree to disagree...

323
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,944
you live your life the way you want,
and I live my life the way I want--

324
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,162
I don't want to argue.

325
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:42,555

Hello.

Yeah.

336
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:43,139
Turns out that it's not that difficult
once you dive right into it.

What.. what is it?

I don't know.

Give it a shot.

340
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:53,983
No thanks.

341

No, no, c'mon, here.

How have you been?

How are things?

- Yeah?

Yeah.

No.

I don't know, I just..
you.. saw.. put together.

372
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:08,436
I have a theory about women who
are beautiful, 'cause you're beautiful...

373
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:12,623
who bury themselves under
layers of crap, like you do.

374

I don't bury myself.

- Do you want to hear my theory or not?
- Fine.

376
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:19,031
They're afraid of being desirable.

How touchy feely,
maybe you should have your own show.

Hey!

Thank you.

How did you come to do what you do?

00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:33,866
How does one become
an expert in disasters?

382
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,474
I study children with severe traumas.

383
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:39,403
Children who have shut-off.

384
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,314
Where do you start?

385
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,629
Uh.. by learning their language.

386
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,255
Most of these kids dress up the facts
with fantasies, imaginary friends...

387
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:57,830
storytelling, I..
find my way into their story...

388
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,422
and I find my way back to the truth.

389
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,135
Are you afraid of dogs?

390
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,197
Of course, not.

391
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,374
Because, you know, it's common
among post-traumatic patients...

392
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:26,873
to develop phobias--

393

I was using the term generally.

395
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:34,055
Eric, can I see you again?

396
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:38,288
Yeah.
Of course.

00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,369
In fact, you know what?
Here.

398
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:46,715
It's a key.
It's not my hand in marriage.

399
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:48,514
In case I can't hear
the doorbell or something.

400
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,043
No, I will call first next time. That's
what I really should've done today.

401
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,628
- Sorry.
- C'mon, hey, slow down.

402
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,253
I'm not gonna bite you.

403
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:00,572
Look, I appreciate you wanting to help.

404
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,718
I do. It's a.. it is helpful.

405
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:07,862
It's comforting, thank you.

406
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,961
Okay.
Some ground rules.

407
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:21,849
We are not dating. We're having
conversations that may help you...

408
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:23,842
release some of the feelings
that you're repressing.

409
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,377
I would say my feelings
are not being repressed at all.

410
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:29,275
I will listen to you, and
you will stop coming on to me.

411
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:32,147
- All right?
- All right.

412
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,636
These are my terms now,
if we're going to continue hanging out.

413

Yes, quid pro quo, tit for tat.

415

Tit for tat?

416
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:44,373
Shut up.

417
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,021
Okay, doctor.

418
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,503
All right.

419
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:52,419
- Bye, Eric.
- Something was in your mouth.

420
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:54,957
Bye.

Are you looking for this?

423
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:36,237
Yep.

424
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:38,107
It's so beautiful.

425
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:39,379
Thank you.

426
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,069
And you'd look beautiful in it, I bet.

427
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:44,902
I don't know.. not sure.

428
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,646

Oh, okay, thank you.

430
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:52,494
Sure.

431
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,368
Your key.

432
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,583
Yeah.

433
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:04,073
- A lover's key.
- No.

434
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,410
No, no, he's an acquaintance.

435
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:10,979
An acquaintance who gives away his key,
where do I sign up?

436
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,860
Actually, he's a patient, sort of.

437
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:18,228
Do you like him?

438
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:20,108
No.

439
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,660
No?

440
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,987
Look me in the eye and say that.

441
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,438
I don't like him, he's a patient.

442
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:32,822
So, even if I liked him,
it'd constitute a conflict of interests...

443
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,777
- it's an ethical..
- Right...

444
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,079
- and then you'd have to stop seeing him.
- Right.

445
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,391
And you'd have to put him
out of your mind.

446
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:45,690
- Yeah.
- Right. I've lived like that.

447
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,922
Like what?

448

Spread your wings.

Life's a moment.. just...

Oh, it is. Right.

What's going on?
What's wrong?

Oh? Uh... nothing.

How do you know where I live?

463
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,949
It's in here.

464
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,661
You left it in my place.

465
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,255
I thought you might need it
for tomorrow.

466
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:52,910
Sorry 'bout that.

467
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:54,488
No, it's okay.

468
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:56,432
So, are you.. are you okay?

469
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,870
Are you gonna invite me in.. or.. ?

470
00:34:59,408 --> 00:35:00,191
No.

471
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,879
Got somebody in there?

472
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:03,200
No.

473
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,617
I mean, it's not any of your business.

474
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,419
Anyway, this isn't my normal office hours.

475
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,002
I'm not a patient.

476
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:18,149
No, you're just a creepy guy standing
at my door in the middle of night.

477
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,876
A lovely man. Intriguing.

478
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,053
Okay, good night.

479
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,341
You don't think so?

480
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,270
I'm not gonna stand here
and debate your loveliness.

481
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,671
How about the intriguing part?

482
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:32,295

C'mon, you always have
some kind of feel-good theory.

492
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,204
Why are they missing?

493
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:48,215
I'm so sorry. Would you mind
excusing me for a moment?

494
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:49,751
Okay, go.

495
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,018
What are you doing here, Mr. Arkin?

496
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,659
I'm interested in
the health of the passengers.

497
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:10,835
You're interested in
what they remember.

498
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,179
Yes, of course I am.

499
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:22,556
You're patients are highly susceptible
to external influences right now.

500
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:27,494
So, you just be sure you haven't been
feeding them your own theories.

501
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,735
Have you been able to confirm
that the accident was human error?

502
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:35,792
It's always a human error, doctor,
whichever way you turn it.

503
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:39,504
Someone didn't work hard enough,
or well enough, or cared enough...

504
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:41,688
someone made a mistake.

505
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,939
And in this case, it was an..
overworked pilot.

506
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,137
You're blaming your woes to a dead man.

507
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,820
Stay away. I mean it.

508
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,215
Claire!

509
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:10,816
Eric?

510
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,417
Hey!

511
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:17,177
Eric! Uh.. Eric.. okay...

512
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,682
stay away from the edge, okay?
What are you doing?

513
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:20,610
Just..

514
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,330
Come on up!

515
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:23,978
Uhm...

516
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,338
C'mon!

517
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,011
I'm not so good with heights.

518
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,468
(Chuckling)

519
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:55,578
Are you all right?

520
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:57,826
No.. I.. I'm good. I'm just fine here.

521
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,201
C'mon, come here. C'mon.

522
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,697
Eric! Eric, stop it!

523
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:05,579
I'm sorry. Okay. Here we go.

524
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,956
Do you have me?

525
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,251
Oh, God. Jesus.

526
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:14,246
- Stay there.
- I'm good.

527
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,968
We can't seem to stay away
from each other, can we?

528
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,055
So, what's your sign?

529
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,113
(Laughing)

530
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,338
I was almost married once.

531
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:48,219
I bailed two days before the wedding.

532
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,363
That's...

533
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:53,603
that's terrible.

534
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,460
Yeah, it is.

535
00:39:58,236 --> 00:39:59,740
It was very painful for her.

536
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,092
I was scared.

537
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:09,406
You know what's scary about commitment?

538
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:14,528
Your life becomes real.
It's not a plan.

539
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,696
It's not what you hope for.
It's real.

540
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,470
Your turn.

541
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,058
C'mon, give me something.
Fair is fair. Tit for tat.

542
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,321
There is nothing to tell.

543
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:34,076
I've never been close.
Sometimes, they left me.

544
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:36,070
Sometimes, I left them.

545
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:41,374
There is no sob story.
Not really.

546
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,493
That was very you.

547
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,862
Concise, yet vague.

548
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,775
I'm not like that.
I like clarity.

549
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,879
Clarity for Claire.

550
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,816
I'm so glad I'm amusing you.

551
00:40:58,295 --> 00:41:00,999
C'mon, this is miraculous, isn't it?
We're both sitting here?

552
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,856
That crash.

553
00:41:08,554 --> 00:41:11,394
It's like being born again.

554
00:41:22,308 --> 00:41:23,300
Eric?

555
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:26,693
Eric! Oh, my God, Eric!

556
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:30,502
What?

557
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,710
You, bastard?!
You, fu--

558
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,167
(Chuckling) C'mon.

559
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,682
Yeah.

560
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:53,315
I'm not getting on that thing.

561
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,010
Why not?

562
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:57,995
You're not wearing a helmet?

563
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,299
For crying out aloud, c'mon.

564
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:05,196
Why did you come here tonight?

565
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:34,706
Too fast for you?

566
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,282
No.

567
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:06,556
Uh, so do we need safety vests?

568
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,124
There might be safety vests in there.

569
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,477
Aren't they called life preservers?
Ah, perfect.

570
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,294
So, uh.. this is a nice boat.

571
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:21,183
It is, isn't it?

572
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:23,167
Yeah, how long have you had her?

573
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:24,963
Oh, it's not mine.

574
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:26,015
Then whose is it?

575
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,239
I have no idea.

576
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,215
What?

577
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:31,041
- What?
- Watch your head.

578
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,520
Eric.

579
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:34,402
Can you drive a boat?

580
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:35,882
Yeah.

581
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:38,098
Great, that's wonderful.

582
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,323
Wanna take it?

583
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,883
Oh, no.

584
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,572
C'mon.

00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,072
What are you doing?

588
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,600
Going for a swim.

589
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:11,367
What? Are you serious.. it's freezing.

590
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:17,363
No, well.. yeah,
will be freezing for a moment.

591
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:19,635
Then, it'll be okay.

592
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:27,620
You're just looking
for thrills to feel alive...

593
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,324
it's a normal reaction.

594
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,775
Eric, is it cold?

595
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,311
Okay, I'm not falling for this again.

596
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:52,417
Eric! Seriously, it's not funny.
Stop it!

You've scared the hell out of me!

600
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:09,956
I thought you were drowning.

601
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:11,350
No.

602
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:13,597
Why are you wearing your clothes?

603
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:17,126
Did you jump in to save me?

604
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,078
No.

605
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,581
Come here. Where are you going?

606
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:24,015
C'mon, come back.
Stay a while.

See. It's not so cold.

No, it's not.

What?

00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:51,909
I'm a mess.

613
00:46:54,224 --> 00:46:56,039
- Too late, Claire.
- For what?

614
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,105
To scare me away.

615
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,889
Eric...

616
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:11,049
the first time we met,
you asked me if I had a sister.

617
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:16,228
Do you have one?

618
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:17,916
Yeah.

619
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:20,565
Yeah, you seemed to know that.

620
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,509
Maybe, is that, bossy,
older sister thing you've got--

621
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:27,069
Not.. you're..

What is she like?

624
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,354
She's an activist, a risk-taker.

625
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:50,980
She's a really good mom.

626

She's got many things.

Ah...

628
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:00,566
so, what's the problem?

629
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:04,798
She called me a coward,
and said that I was wasting my life.

630
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,830
I said some pretty horrible things to her.

631
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:14,273
Stuff I shouldn't have said,
stuff that I--

632
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:18,001
Anyway, we haven't spoken in months.

633
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:20,794
Whatever was said...

634
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:24,147
it's not worth it.

Are you following me?

00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:22,337
Is spending nights with your patients
regular part of your therapy?

00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,534
I'm not sure.

658
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,366
Well, just because they're not at
the sessions doesn't mean...

659
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,237
they're in trouble.

660
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:31,895
And patients fall in and out
of the desire for treatment...

661
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:33,983
all the time, isn't that common?

662
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,607
Absolutely, right.

663
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:37,783
What about Eric Clark?

664
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,496
What?

665
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,489
How is he doing?

666
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:43,640
Oh.. good.

667
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:53,154
He.. he's... responding...

668
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,083
I don't know, I don't know.

669
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:08,654
Claire, what's going on?

670
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,638
I crossed the line with him.

671
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:15,802
An ethical line.

672
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:23,696
Our relationship is more personal
than it should be.

673
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:31,915
(sigh) More personal than
it should be.

674
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,627
Yeah.

[Knocking]

676
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:39,326
Hello, Norman?

677
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,375
Norman, it's Dr. Summers, Claire.

678
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,018
Norman.

679
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:40,874
Hey!

680
00:54:42,418 --> 00:54:43,818
Wait! Don't go!

681
00:54:44,626 --> 00:54:48,508
Hey, stop! Don't go!
Please.

682
00:54:51,947 --> 00:54:53,765
Help me! Please, help!

683
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,189
Help me!

684
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:27,091
Do you know me?

685
00:55:29,322 --> 00:55:30,308
No.

686
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,987
I can't remember my own name,
and everything.

687
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,443
Why have you been hanging
around the sessions?

688
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:38,861
I followed one of them
the other day.

689
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,296
The guy who lives here.

690
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:43,454
He looked familiar.

691
00:55:43,503 --> 00:55:45,821
I thought he could help me
figure things out.

692
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,150
But he wouldn't come near me.

693
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:50,624
I can't get anything out
since the accident.

694
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:52,448
You witnessed the accident?

695
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:53,672
I was in it.

696
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:54,551
You were on the flight?

697
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:55,591
Yes.

698
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:59,449
One moment, I'm sitting there...

699
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:04,675
and there is an explosion,
and I'm here, walking around...

700
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,289
what the hell happened?

701
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:11,859
It's okay.

702
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,397
Have you told anyone else
about this?

703
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:17,965
No. Who could I talk to?
I don't know any one here.

704
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:23,607
I'd like you to come with me, please.

705
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:25,303
Perry, it's Claire.

706
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:27,543
I need to talk to you,
call me as soon as you get this.

707
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:31,584

Mr. Arkin.

713
00:59:11,004 --> 00:59:13,464
This man was on board, Mr. Arkin.
He remembers an explosion.

714
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,560
For a woman of science, you have
a strong flare for dramatic, doctor.

715
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:21,841
Passengers are missing, Mr. Arkin.
What do you know about that?

716
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:22,817
Calm down, please.

Where are the other passengers?

00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:26,465
Hiding from you, I bet.

- You're making a fool of yourself.
- ..what's going on?

723
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:31,146
I know you.

00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:32,747
No.

725
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,963
- Yes.
- No.

726
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:35,858
We've met before.

No, we haven't.

01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:46,093
I was raised by an aunt.

on a trail.. he was trying
to rescue her, and they both fell.

They were probably crushed
to be separated from you.

I'm sure they knew that.

What would you tell them
that they don't know?

What would you tell them now?

01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:43,632

that they couldn't help.

01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:23,378
What if survivors weren't even
accounted for? How does that happen?

826
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:27,587
I don't know. I'm..
how do you think it happens?

827
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:30,266
I think the airline is
targetting the passengers.

828
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:32,916
One by one, they are all disappearing.

829
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,765
Maybe, they don't need you anymore.

830
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,317
We got to stop this, Perry.

831
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:40,310
You're looking for the truth?

832
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,662
Yes!

833
01:09:43,038 --> 01:09:47,223
When we lie, we make up
our lies with pieces.. of the truth.

834
01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:49,807
What does that
have to do with this?

835
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,295
So, there must be some reason
why you've latched on...

836
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:55,000
to this elaborate theory
of a cover-up.

837
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:56,713
What?

838
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,313
Maybe it's gone as far as it can.

839
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,355
They got to you, Arkin got to you.

840
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,221
No. Claire.

841
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:06,919
It's not like that.

842
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:10,656
Don't you come near me.
Don't!

843
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:21,969
Is that why you brought me in?
To keep tabs on the passengers?

844
01:10:24,723 --> 01:10:27,068
It's not me.
You don't know me.

845
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,310
They're dead.

846
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:26,040
They are all dead.

847
01:11:33,153 --> 01:11:34,928
That pilot.. he was...

848
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:39,515
he was tired.

849
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:44,076
He was in the middle of a divorce.

850
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:51,460
He wasn't even in the cockpit
when it happened.

851
01:11:51,572 --> 01:11:53,445
Did you know that?

852
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:55,254
Where was he?

853
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:02,614
He left it in the hands of the copilot.

854
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:05,401
He never should've done that.

855
01:12:05,512 --> 01:12:07,440
It wasn't him.

856
01:12:07,878 --> 01:12:11,009
The passengers saw that explosion
outside of the window.

857
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,754
No. It had nothing to do
with the pilot.

858
01:12:13,786 --> 01:12:14,793
No.

859
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:16,578
He tried his best to land
the plane on the beach.

860
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:18,578
If anyone made it,
it was because of him.

861
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,610
You're wrong.

862
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,004
That man is hero.

863
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:22,964
You are wrong!

864
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,820
No.

865
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,857
It.. w..as... me..

866
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:43,096
What?

867
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,858
What did you say?

868
01:14:02,864 --> 01:14:04,081
I'm in your seat. Sorry.

869
01:14:16,257 --> 01:14:27,334
No, no, no..
No! No! No!

870
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:34,357
[Sobbing]

871
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:03,037
Good morning.

872
01:15:04,092 --> 01:15:05,757
Good morning.

873
01:15:11,117 --> 01:15:12,718
I found something.

874
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,141
What's that?

875
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:17,201
A list of passengers.

876
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:28,466
Why didn't you tell me?

877
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:32,025
It's not a sort of thing you can be told.

878
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,674
You gotta figure it out for yourself.

879
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:38,986
When you are ready.

880
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,045
Here you go.

881
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:53,157
Sorry.

882
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,086
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

883
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,263
Coming or going?

884
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,366
Going home.

885
01:16:00,662 --> 01:16:02,135
Me, too.

886
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:04,424
Eric.

887
01:16:04,584 --> 01:16:06,113
Claire Summers.

888
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:35,573
People come back to help you.

889
01:16:35,902 --> 01:16:39,230
Come to terms, lead the way.

890
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:42,815
My grandfather came back for me.

891
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,048
I didn't even recognize him.

892
01:16:46,024 --> 01:16:47,376
And my dog.

893
01:16:48,064 --> 01:16:49,313
(sigh)

894
01:16:57,105 --> 01:16:59,275
Who came back for you?

895
01:17:13,597 --> 01:17:15,197
My aunt, Toni.

896
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,397
And Mr. Perry.

897
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,330
What about the other passengers?

898
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,099
They're like us.

899
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,883
Making their peace with it
before moving on.

900
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:45,779
Nobody survived the crash.

901
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:58,453
And everyone else?

902
01:18:01,023 --> 01:18:04,335
They're just here
to help us find our way.

903
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:25,516
Can we.. hook up in town..
I promise not to bite.

904
01:18:27,725 --> 01:18:29,044
Okay, I promise to bite.

905
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:32,740
Uh.. okay.

906
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,077
- Cool.
- Yeah.

907
01:19:06,805 --> 01:19:07,948
Hey!

908
01:19:20,383 --> 01:19:21,630
Oh, my God!

909
01:19:24,096 --> 01:19:25,359
[Explosion]

910
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,130
Put this on.
Put it on. C'mon.

911
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:45,635
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

912
01:19:45,682 --> 01:19:47,301
No, we're gonna live.
Look at me. Hey, stay with me.

913
01:19:47,357 --> 01:19:49,587
Look at me!

914
01:19:49,949 --> 01:19:54,196
Emma, Emma, I love you.
Emma..

915
01:20:23,771 --> 01:20:27,835
Get down with me.
Claire, c'mon. Get down with me.

916
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:31,117
Don't give up on me.
Don't give up on me. C'mon.

917
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,365
- We're not gonna make it.
- Yes, we are.

918
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:42,758
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.
Yes, yes!

919
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:45,446
You stay right here
with me, okay?

920
01:20:45,486 --> 01:20:48,872
You stay here.
Don't go.

921
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:50,672
Stay with me.

922
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,414
I will be right up
with your sister's mail.
