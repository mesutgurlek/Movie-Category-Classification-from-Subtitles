<i>[ It's The Most Wonderful Time
"Of The Year:" Andy Williams]</i>

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,152
[screams]

3
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,452
My firm's done a tremendous
amount of market research.

4
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,162
We've discovered two things:

5
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:46,750
One, most Americans feel
that Christmas is a time for family.

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,088
Two, most Americans feel that in order
to stand being around their family,

7
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,589
for even one or two days,

8
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,718
they need to swill as much
alcohol as humanly possible.

9
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,055
Now, I'd like you
to meet the Noggertons.

10
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,099
They're a classic American family.

11
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,977
They're together on Christmas,
they're fat-free,

12
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,854
and 10 percent alcohol
by volume.

13
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,316
Enjoy our family, so you can
enjoy your family.

14
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,776
What do you think?

15
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,072
So, you're suggesting we tell people
the only way to get through the holidays

16
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,616
is to drink spiked egg nog?

17
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
I'm suggesting the only way
to get through the holidays

18
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,914
is to buy your farm-fresh, fat-free,
pre-spiked egg nog in a bottle.

19
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,212
- Take care. All right.
- It's all good. How do you do it?

20
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,965
I'm very excited.
I look forward to it.

21
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,717
It went pretty well, huh?

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,093
I'm a genius.

23
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,804
I feel like I could sell
whale steaks to Greenpeace.

24
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,264
Nice image.

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,350
- Here are your tickets to Fiji.
- Ah.

26
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,278
[Drew] Missy, we've been
dating a while.

27
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,739
Let's take our relationship
to the next level.

28
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,824
[Missy] I've hoped you would say that.

29
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,535
[Drew] I got you a little
pre-Christmas Christmas gift.

30
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,287
[Missy] Yeah?

31
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,417
I want you to open it now
because it involves our future.

32
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,670
The future of you and me together.

33
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,673
It's kind of for both of us,
in that way.

34
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,761
[gasps]

35
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,471
[breathless] Okay.

36
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,438
Tickets to Fiji?

37
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,857
Yes. First class.

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,526
Drew, on Christmas?

39
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,320
Christmas is the family holiday.

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,366
I mean, what are we doing? What is this?
I mean, what is going on?

41
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,868
Where is this relationship headed?

42
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,539
Fiji. First class.

43
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,292
- Missy?
- Uh-uh. Okay.

44
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,545
Here's an example
of one of our problems.

45
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,507
You never introduced me to your family.
You never mentioned your family.

46
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,967
Do you even have a family?

47
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,513
How can you be serious about me,
if you're not serious about your family?

48
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,182
You need to get some
serious help, Drew.

49
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,184
I think you're missing the point.

50
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:13,063
If I told you everything about me,
there'd be no more sense of mystery.

51
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,565
Nothing left to discover.

52
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,359
With nothing left to discover,
a relationship dies.

53
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,778
You don't want this to die, do you?

54
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,281
It just did.

55
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,119
Come on. Don't be like that.

56
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,538
You're gonna be like that?
Go ahead. Go.

57
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm going to spend Christmas
with my family.

58
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,126
You can spend Christmas alone.

59
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,339
[Drew] Missy.

60
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:03,864
Kathryn, I need you to get
a Cartier bracelet to send to Missy.

61
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,950
Something expensive,
a lot of diamonds, very flashy.

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,704
- Include a personal note from me.
- What exactly do you want it to say?

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,541
Something personal that shows
the depth of my feelings, my emotions.

64
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,712
- You're good. That's why I hired you.
- Okay, but it's not gonna work.

65
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,426
My man.

66
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,264
Oh, Dougie!

67
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
Doogan. Doog-ray.

68
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,310
Douglas.

69
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,312
It's Drew.

70
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,189
Drew Latham.
[chuckles]

71
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,024
Yeah. What's up, man?

72
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,944
What are you up?
Ah, nothin', nothin'.

73
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, man,
what're you doing for Christmas?

74
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,450
Family? Nice. Nice call.

75
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,286
Uh, you got room for one more?

76
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,582
Well, I think we are that close.

77
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,463
I love Jewish Christ...
I'll light candles, spin the dreidel.

78
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,133
It'll be great,
a matzo ball soup and baklava.

79
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,887
All right, well, that's Greek.
Fine, whatever. I'm just...

80
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,138
You still there?

81
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,518
I know you have a baby.
I'm just saying, like, you know,

82
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,896
they just lie there
and crap themselves, right?

83
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,482
After a while,
how interesting is that?

84
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,569
No, I'm not saying anything bad.
I'm just sayin'...

85
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,404
Huh?

86
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,282
Well, maybe, your wife
doesn't have to come, man.

87
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,367
Maybe it's me and you
for Christmas.

88
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,994
You ever think about that?

89
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,876
Would you mind if I came by
to your house and spent Christmas?

90
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,046
It's like one or two, three days, tops.

91
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,340
[pen scratching]

92
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,599
[sighs] All right.

93
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,268
Merry Christmas.

94
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,690
[jet engines roaring]

95
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,653
[man] Okay, right over here.
Everybody stay together.

96
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,447
All real good.
Okay, you've got Tu-Tu...

97
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,534
[Drew] Doctor Freeman!
Thank God, I found you.

98
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,118
[Freeman] Sir, sir...

99
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,580
I gotta spend Christmas alone.
I'm having a panic attack.

100
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,834
- You gotta help me. Please!
- Who are you? I don't know you.

101
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,169
I'm the boyfriend
of one of your patients.

102
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,921
- You are?
- Missy Vangilder.

103
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,757
[laughing] You're Drew.
You're Drew. Oh, God.

104
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,385
- What does that mean?
- I'm not allowed to say.

105
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,221
- How did you find me?
- I bribed a woman at your service.

106
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,724
She should raise her standards
or you gotta fire her.

107
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,518
She totally caved for 200 bucks.

108
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,478
- Whatever.
- I need a few minutes.

109
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,981
[Freeman] Backpacks on the belt.
Game Boy too.

110
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,276
You gotta help me out.
I don't wanna spend Christmas alone.

111
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,610
If you would just please!

112
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,654
She's gotta put
the bear on the belt.

113
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,239
Can't she walk it through?

114
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,074
She's got to put it on the belt.

115
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,159
- It's a puppy!
- I know it's a puppy.

116
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,161
Put Tu-Tu on
and she'll go for a ride.

117
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,622
- My Tu-Tu!
- I need one second.

118
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,957
If you could just please!

119
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,502
- Okay, gimme the puppy.
- Sir, I need you to step here.

120
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:50,215
- [Drew] You're abusing your child.
- Can you see I've got my own problems?

121
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,260
- Whoa, whoa, now.
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

122
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,431
Okay. Okay.
Hey, I know.

123
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,808
- Heard it on the radio once.
- All right.

124
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,853
Write down your grievances
about your family on paper.

125
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,605
- All your grievances.
- Right.

126
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,482
Go someplace that reminds you
of your childhood,

127
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,152
at sunset and light
that piece of paper on fire.

128
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,864
As the last shred of paper
is burning away, you whisper,

129
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,199
"I forgive you. "

130
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,284
- "I forgive you. "
- Mm-hm.

131
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,578
- And it burns up.
- That's it.

132
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,871
I like it.

133
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,956
- Oh, thanks so much!
- Whoa! All right.

134
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,667
- Have a good vaca.
- Where's my daughter?

135
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,877
- [beeping]
- Sir?

136
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,504
Huh? Oh, there she is.

137
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,465
Whoa! Hey! Come on out!
Come out for Daddy!

138
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,772
My grievances.

139
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,998
Okay, buddy, here we go.
That'll be $ 72.50.

140
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,792
My God!

141
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,585
That's it!

142
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,671
That's the house I grew up in.

143
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,841
How's the $ 72.50 comin'?

144
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,927
Good. It's comin' good.

145
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,887
Keep the meter running.

146
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,621
- [Tom] Almost out of salami.
- [Christine] No.

147
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,331
Well, thank you for telling me.

148
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,126
- I don't wanna run out, that's all.
- God forbid.

149
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,170
- Did Brian eat?
- I don't know.

150
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,714
[shouting] Get down here
and eat your dinner.

151
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,466
- I'm not hungry!
- [Tom] Yeah, you are!

152
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,261
[Christine] Stop yelling at me.

153
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,929
[Tom] I'm not yelling at you.

154
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,224
Brian!

155
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,978
[shouting] Brian!

156
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,149
Get down here please, so your father
can stop not yelling at me!

157
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,109
I'm busy!

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,445
We shouldn't have put
the computer in his room.

159
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,488
He's gonna spend
all his time there.

160
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,866
Oh, Tom.
Welcome to the future, dear.

161
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,451
He's advancing his skills.

162
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,662
One day that computer's
gonna get our baby a good job.

163
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,789
[beeping]

164
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,459
[music plays, woman's voice]

165
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,464
Trust me. What he's doin',
nobody's gonna pay for,

166
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,342
'cause if they did,
I'd have retired at 17.

167
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,516
- [Tom] What?
- There's a guy out there.

168
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,559
Who the hell is that?

169
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,949
[Drew] All right. Alone on Christmas.
I can do this.

170
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:07,496
[sighs] I rid myself
of all my grievances.

171
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,748
Be gone, grievances.

172
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,670
What the...

173
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,173
I forgive you.

174
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,388
Holy Moly. This joker.

175
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,265
[tires screeching]

176
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,706
What are the neighbors gonna think?

177
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,376
Unless they want to get hit, they
shouldn't be burning crap in my yard.

178
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,211
Is he still breathing?

179
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,465
Dear God, Tom.
You've killed the man.

180
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,593
Oh, shit! He's still alive!

181
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,679
[groaning] Hello.

182
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,265
[whimpers]

183
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,229
My name is Drew Latham.
[chuckles]

184
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,108
I grew up in this house.

185
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,320
That's why you came back and
tried to burn it down, Pyroboy?

186
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,488
- Brian, call the cops.
- Oh, no, no, no!

187
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:27,201
That won't be necessary. That's fine.
I was just outside burning,

188
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,828
someone told me to burn
a list of my grievances

189
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,373
outside of the home of my birth
to help me with loneliness issues.

190
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,876
- So, it's all fine.
- Oh.

191
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,922
Any-hoo, apologies
and I'm gonna go.

192
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,383
Would you mind terribly
if I took a look-see around the house?

193
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,886
- I'll give you a tour.
- [Drew] Oh, thank you.

194
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,388
Hold on.

195
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,141
- You got any more matches?
- No. No, no, no.

196
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,643
Are we done with all that?

197
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,102
Yes. The burning. Yes.

198
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,772
It's completely done.
I'm actually better.

199
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,273
I'm watching you.

200
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,655
Wow. I can't believe it!

201
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,407
This is amazing!
It's exactly how I remember it.

202
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,870
- You mean it was always a shithole?
- No. No, it's great.

203
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,503
[squeak]

204
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,506
- Did you hear that?
- [squeaking]

205
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,883
That stair squeaked.

206
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,636
Do you know what we
used to call that squeaky stair?

207
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,806
"The squeaky stair. "
[laughing]

208
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,142
- [squeaking]
- [laughing]

209
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,280
Wow. My old room.

210
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,781
My God.

211
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,076
Hey, look at that!
I can touch the ceiling.

212
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,538
It's much smaller than I remember it.
Did you do something?

213
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,332
Yeah. We had it reduced.

214
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,919
Cost a lot, but yeah,
I think it was...

215
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,462
I think it was worth it.

216
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,756
Man, this is great.
Man, this is the best.

217
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,302
You guys sittin' around
eatin' dinner like a family.

218
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,346
I always wanted that.
This is really wonderful.

219
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,224
[Brian] Wonderful.

220
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,476
So, what's for dessert?

221
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,188
- Kitchen's closed.
- Aw.

222
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,315
- Yeah, I got things to do.
- Ah, boy.

223
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,775
Tom, why don't you
see the man out?

224
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,486
I didn't want to let him in.
I'll call you a cab.

225
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,530
Is that necessary?

226
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,865
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

227
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,534
But you know, man,
I gotta tell ya,

228
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,162
all these years I've been
avoiding Christmas,

229
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,458
and I just realized,
this is what I've been longing for.

230
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,836
A real family, you know?
In a true home.

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,547
That's why I'm thinking

232
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,592
it might be a good idea
if I lived with you.

233
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,802
- [Drew grunts]
- [door slams]

234
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,671
[Drew knocking] Tom! Tom!

235
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,424
Tom, please!
Please let me stay here!

236
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,509
No.

237
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,512
- I'll pay you.
- My family's not for sale, pal.

238
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,306
Tom, I'll pay you $250,000.

239
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,601
Welcome home, son.

240
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,187
[splashing]

241
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,814
Mom.

242
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,530
Tom, that guy is still here.

243
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,408
- Yeah, I know.
- Why is he still here?

244
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,788
He's givin' us $250,000
to be his family for Christmas.

245
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,125
And you agreed to this?
Without asking me?

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,879
Of course I did.
He's giving us $250,000.

247
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,048
How would you like it if I
agreed to this without asking you?

248
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,135
Well, that would depend.
Would we be getting $250,000?

249
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,974
Okay. What exactly
did you agree to?

250
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,270
[sighs]

251
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,196
It's a big day for this family.

252
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,156
- Very well.
- All right.

253
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,118
Mr. Latham agrees
to pay the sum of $250,000

254
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:43,749
to the Valcos for services rendered
until 11:59 pm on Christmas Day.

255
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,627
And for said sum, the Valco family

256
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,005
will aid Mr. Latham in recapturing

257
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,175
those childhood Christmas memories,

258
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,969
- including, but not limited to,
- [sighs]

259
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:00,682
all due festiveness, celebrations,
various and sundry merriments,

260
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,851
and yuletide glee.

261
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,020
Agreed!

262
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,064
Agreed, right?

263
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,358
Fakin' it anyway.
Might as well get paid.

264
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,235
Will there be anything else?

265
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,529
Oh, yeah. I gotta sleep
in Brian's room.

266
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,657
What? No.
Where is this going here?

267
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,952
Like it says in the contract.
I get to sleep in my old room.

268
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,956
Oh, come on. Creepy grievance guy
wants to sleep in my room?

269
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,918
If I wanted that, I'd use a bus ticket
those guys send me on the Internet.

270
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,963
I just wanna sleep in my room,
like it says in the contract.

271
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,173
Brian, you're in the guest room.

272
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,344
My computer's not in the guest room.
How am I supposed to... study?

273
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,304
Use your imagination.

274
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,099
Well, I'm gonna
catch some shut-eye.

275
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,270
Who wants to go Christmas tree
shopping with me in the morning?

276
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,650
Apparently, you all do.

277
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,027
[birds chirping]

278
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,741
[yawns]

279
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,047
I'm home.

280
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,062
Oh!

281
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,149
[Christine] Brian? Brian!

282
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,109
[Brian] I didn't do it.

283
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,402
[Drew] It's all right.

284
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,323
[chuckling] I'll fix it.
I'll fix it. Ow.

285
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,082
[Tom] Well, that should do it,
assuming no other idiot...

286
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,132
Is he eatin' my salami?

287
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,384
That's what it looks like.

288
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,641
- It's 9:00 in the mornin'.
- Oh, I know. It's not breakfast food,

289
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,060
but it was lookin' good.
I had to dog some.

290
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,729
Yeah, it is good.

291
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,982
- Is that the last of it?
- Yep.

292
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,039
Oh. You didn't want some, did ya?

293
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,834
No. It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.

294
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,418
Ah.

295
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,382
[Drew] Kathryn, I hope
you're checking messages.

296
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,176
Should anyone need to reach me,
they can call my cell.

297
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,803
If you need to send anything,

298
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:47,474
the address is 2 Edgewood Road
in Lincoln Wood, Illinois.

299
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,518
Stayin' with my family.

300
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,895
Hey, Dad?

301
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,150
He's talkin' to you, genius.

302
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,529
Yeah, Drew?

303
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:06,118
Would you do me a kindness?
Put this hat on.

304
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,454
My dad used to wear a Santa hat
when we went Christmas tree shopping.

305
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,581
[laughter]

306
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,499
- In public?
- Yeah.

307
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,126
That would be no.

308
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,462
And in private,
that would be no, too.

309
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,214
Please wear the hat.

310
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,551
No. I'm not wearing the hat.

311
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,803
Tom, you gotta wear the hat.

312
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,306
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- Wear the hat, Tom.

313
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,184
Now get it away from me
before I shove it up your ass.

314
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,231
Tom, are you familiar
with the phrase "breach of contract?"

315
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,364
- Give me the hat.
- All right.

316
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:48,785
$250,000. $250,000.

317
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,039
- $250,000.
- [Brian chuckling]

318
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,582
You're lookin' good, Dad.

319
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,417
- [Christine] Tom!
- Shut up!

320
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,377
Eyes on the road.
On the road. Dad.

321
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,046
- Gimme your leg.
- [screeching]

322
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,089
[Drew] No.

323
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,678
Nope.

324
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,472
Oh, wait a minute.

325
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,474
This could be it.
This could be it.

326
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,893
Yep. This is it.
This is the one.

327
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,229
[Drew] You're good.
Excuse me, folks.

328
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,151
Dad, you wanna lift that up,
have respect for the tree? No?

329
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,862
It's gonna be in our house, so...

330
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,657
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are we going with this?

331
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,245
All right. Let's get that baby up there,
hoist that up.

332
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,789
- Get that on the roof.
- [Tom grunts]

333
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,624
All righty.

334
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,294
[Drew] That's pretty good. All right!
You got it. There you go.

335
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,255
Get around it.
Get around on it.

336
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,548
[Tom straining]

337
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:46,051
Brian, get your skinny little ass
out of the car!

338
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,928
[Drew] You got it, Dad.
You got it.

339
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,555
You got it.

340
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,308
Nice one. All right, I think it's good.
I think it's good like that.

341
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,395
Whoo! Christmas time.

342
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,903
- [Drew] How's it look?
- [Brian] It could trigger a seizure.

343
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,531
I know.
Wait till you see it lit up.

344
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,949
I thought it was lit up.

345
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,159
Oh no, no, no.

346
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,829
We gotta sing "Christmas Tree" first.
Tom, you take the lead.

347
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,457
- You want me to sing?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,627
Do I have to?

349
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,004
Yeah.

350
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,299
Would it make any difference
if I didn't want to?

351
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,508
Not really.

352
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,721
Come on.

353
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,808
<i>Oh, Christmas tree</i>

354
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,394
Christine, you wanna
help me out here a little?

355
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,438
No, you're doin' great.

356
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:43,483
You're doin' good, Dad.
Come on. You can do it.

357
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,699
<i>[both] "Oh, Christmas tree"
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

358
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,244
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

359
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,163
<i>You are as green</i>

360
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,081
- "As winter snow"
- "As summer snow"

361
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,459
- Winter snow.
- "Winter snow"

362
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
<i>As in summer's brightest glow</i>

363
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:09,426
<i>Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

364
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:14,723
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

365
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,517
<i>Ahhh</i>

366
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,851
That was great.

367
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,437
- [Drew] That was good.
- [Tom] That was, yeah.

368
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,522
All right.

369
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:26,401
Without further ado, let's fire it up.
Ready? One, two...

370
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,737
- [knocking]
- [groans]

371
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,240
All right, people.
Take five. I'll deal with this.

372
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,200
Thank Christ.

373
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,161
Can I help you?

374
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,791
Yeah. Who are you?

375
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,543
Um, who are you?

376
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,336
[Christine] Alicia!

377
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,672
Hey, Mom. Hi. Who's this?

378
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,966
Mom, who is this?

379
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,759
Okay, what's going on?

380
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:54,137
Dad's rented us for the holidays
to this eccentric millionaire.

381
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,599
[Drew] You have a daughter?
Since when do you have a daughter?

382
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,978
- It's her terrible secret.
- This is gonna ruin everything.

383
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,564
- The whole bit doesn't work.
- Ruin? Know what?

384
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:07,526
Shh. Will somebody say something
that makes some sense right now?

385
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,903
Well, around Christmas,
I get anxiety...

386
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,322
No, no. You stop talking. Mom?

387
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,617
Drew wants a family Christmas,
so we're gonna be his family.

388
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,494
- That's insane.
- Tell me about it.

389
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,330
I never had a sister,
so this is bullshit right here.

390
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,958
Okay. You are my
illegitimate love child.

391
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,460
- Mom!
- And you had no idea about her.

392
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,462
That could be good.
You know what?

393
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,840
- She could be the maid!
- Okay. Enough.

394
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,675
Hey, my baby's home.

395
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,635
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you, Lissi?

396
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,972
Hi. I'm good.
You've obviously lost your mind.

397
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,600
Can I talk to you
in the dining room, please?

398
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,851
You knew about this?

399
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,437
- Stay away from my daughter.
- Okay, Mom?

400
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,606
- This guy is obviously crazy.
- I know.

401
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,983
So, I'm gonna go upstairs,
and take a bath,

402
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,361
and when I wake up in the morning,
he's gonna be gone, right?

403
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,696
Maybe.

404
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,449
I'm not gonna be a good sport
about this, Mom.

405
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,035
Oh, darling, we'd never
expect you to be.

406
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,121
Thanks.

407
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,790
[Drew] Come on, Mom!
It's tree time!

408
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,755
[Drew] Okey-dokey.

409
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,216
All right.
We're back on track.

410
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,679
Yeah.

411
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,974
Okay.

412
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,229
Here we go.
One, two, three!

413
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,317
[Drew] Now it feels like Christmas.

414
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,903
[Brian] I can smell
my eyeballs burning.

415
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,989
[Drew] Very important.
Don't look directly at the tree.

416
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,699
[dog barking]

417
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,251
- Brian!
- What?

418
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,294
Wake up!
It's your brother, kind of!

419
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,713
It's snowing outside!
It's a snow day!

420
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,508
Why are you waking me up?

421
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,969
I don't want you
to miss the fun, man!

422
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,013
What fun?

423
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:04,309
[Drew] Oh! Facial! Iceball!
Whoo! Ha ha!

424
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,436
Look out! Oh!

425
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,230
Right in the nuts!
In the nuts!

426
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,274
- I can't feel my toes.
- Here he comes.

427
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,485
The look of vengeance.
Eye of the tiger.

428
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,445
Oh, oh.
Now he's getting furious.

429
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,406
Whoo! Whoo!

430
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,909
- Whoo!
- [door closing]

431
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,665
- What's up, Tom?
- Brian, go inside.

432
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,502
See you later, Bri.
It was fun.

433
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,462
You like throwing snowballs?

434
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,840
I was just havin' a good time.
You know.

435
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,134
Yeah. Throw one at me.

436
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,511
That's cool.
Don't worry about it.

437
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,138
We're kinda finished now.

438
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,390
Come on.
Like you said, it'll be fun.

439
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,268
It's getting a little chilly.
I don't wanna bother.

440
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,229
- Don't worry about it.
- Ah, come on. Throw it.

441
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,983
All right, I'll throw one,
I'll throw one.

442
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,408
Good one.

443
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,453
Now it's my turn.

444
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,707
No!

445
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,462
That was great.

446
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,756
Any time you wanna do that,
let me know.

447
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,758
We said no iceballs, man.

448
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,635
Oh, did we?

449
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,304
Morning, Mom.

450
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,014
Freak.

451
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,850
You know what?

452
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,230
We may have gotten off
on the wrong track.

453
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,648
We should start over.

454
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,566
- Here you go, Drew.
- Thanks, Mom.

455
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,568
- Mmm.
- Problem?

456
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:40,197
My real mom puts marshmallows
in the hot chocolate.

457
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,408
Know what I was thinking?
If you don't wanna play my sister,

458
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,495
maybe you could be, like,
a wonderful, mysterious

459
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,414
Ecuadorean cleaning lady.
You know?

460
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,376
Or Swedish cleaning lady.
The ethnicity's not important.

461
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,087
But cleaning lady's good.
Oh. Mmm.

462
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:56,672
What?

463
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,842
My real mom used the
mini-marshmallows. Sorry.

464
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:04,513
Speaking of your mom, why aren't you
annoying your own family?

465
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,599
That's not really your business,
is it, Consuela?

466
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,567
[Drew] Ho, ho, ho!

467
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,903
All righty.
Welcome, everyone.

468
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,365
- Here you are.
- What is this?

469
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,994
These are what we
in the business call scripts, Tom.

470
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,830
- Excuse me?
- You don't have to worry about it.

471
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,957
Your role is what we call "small. "

472
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:35,711
Well, you're what we
in real life call "a jackass. "

473
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,755
I don't know about that,
but I do know that my being here

474
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,842
may have caused some awkwardness
within the family.

475
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,428
- You think?
- [Drew] I do, Tom. Seriously.

476
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,098
And it's even possible
that some of it could potentially be

477
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,434
in some small way
partly my fault.

478
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,895
Which part wasn't your fault?

479
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,439
Bop, bop, bop, bop.
I'm talking. Okay?

480
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,817
So what I've done is I went
ahead and wrote a sequence,

481
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,070
so you guys can get a sense
of what I'm going for here.

482
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,740
And we're all gonna
read this aloud.

483
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,118
- I feel like I'm insane.
- That's why you have no lines.

484
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,871
- Mom, I believe you go first.
- Okay.

485
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,831
"Oh, look at us.

486
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,752
I sure hope you like the meal
I so lovingly prepared

487
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,795
for the people I love.

488
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,216
She smiles at Tom. "
Oh, she's...

489
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,844
[Drew] Have you acted?
You've acted before.

490
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,721
- A little theater.
- I can tell.

491
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,266
- I see it. It comes out.
- You were in "Pippin" in high school.

492
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,894
You played Wind.

493
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,313
Tom, you have the next line.

494
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,106
Uh...

495
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,610
"Say thank you to your mother
for all her hard work cooking for us. "

496
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,071
"Thank you. "

497
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,657
"Oh, I don't work nearly
as hard as you, dear. "

498
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,991
Well, that's true.

499
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,119
Tom, let's stay on book, please.
Brian, go ahead.

500
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,915
"Gee, Mom, I love you
like the dickens.

501
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,000
Should we pray?"

502
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:00,462
Gee, Beav, do you think Wally's
gonna give you the business?

503
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,006
Oh, there you are, Consuela.

504
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>Five waters for everyone, please.
Gracias.</i>

505
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,972
[clears throat] Brian,
you were about to say grace.

506
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:15,477
- "Dear God... "
- Brian. We hold hands at grace.

507
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,524
[Brian] "Dear God,

508
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,984
thank you for this meal.

509
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,111
Thank you for blessing us
with a family.

510
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,863
Not everyone has a nice family.

511
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,656
And also we, O Lord,

512
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,076
are so lucky to have Drew
in our lives. "

513
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,870
Amen.

514
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,498
"An emotional moment. "

515
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,500
Sorry, I keep doing that.

516
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:42,087
"Brian, if you eat it all up,
I will let you sleep with me

517
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,340
like I never did
when you were little. "

518
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,970
An awkward moment.

519
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,972
Skip ahead.
That doesn't work.

520
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,975
- That's not supposed to be there.
- What does this mean?

521
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,060
"Doo-Dah enters
in his bathrobe. "

522
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:01,106
Sweet Jim Jiminy!
Cold corn in the mornin'!

523
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:05,694
- This weather is killin' my joints.
- Brian, go get the shovel.

524
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,615
[Drew] Listen to me. When Alicia came,
she totally ruined everything.

525
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,159
Everything was so normal
up until that point.

526
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,577
<i>Silencio, por favor.</i>

527
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,955
So I realized what I had to do
was expand the family.

528
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,833
I had to find my grandpa.
So I went and found my Doo-Dah.

529
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,085
Here he is. My Doo-Dah.

530
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:25,881
Your Doo-Dah looks exactly like the guy
in "Christmas Carol. " Scrooge.

531
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,217
That's right.
I do community theater.

532
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,345
And this Christmas night,
I'm reprising my role as Scrooge

533
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,056
in the Lincoln Wood
Theater Group's production

534
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,892
of "A Christmas Carol. "
I hope you all can make it.

535
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,520
Please stay in character, Saul, okay?

536
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,396
"I'm so glad that you came here.

537
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,191
You're gonna stay for
the whole Christmas holiday. "

538
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,361
Whoa, no, he's not.
I agreed to let you in the house,

539
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:50,239
- not Doo-Doo over here.
- Doo-Dah.

540
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,699
- Nobody's talkin' to you.
- [groans] Look.

541
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,576
I'll give you $25,000.

542
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,413
How you doin', Doo-Dah?

543
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,249
You can stay in the living room.

544
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,668
No, Dad, I'm sleeping
in the living room.

545
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,169
Not anymore.

546
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,839
Where am I gonna sleep?

Kids, don't lose track of time.

Mom, you wanna stick
with Doo-Dah?

555
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,085
- Why me?
- He's your father.

556
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,213
- [Doo-Dah] How come you never call?
- Tom! Tom! Tom!

00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,923
Yes, Drew?

- Kinda.
- Oh, your wife's family.

They hang around your house
all day and drink your beer.

I want the money. I really do.
It's Christine, she keeps...

All right. Let me worry
about Christine, okay?

I'll worry about Christine.

You worry about Tom,
'cause it's Tom time.

- [knocking] Christine?
- Yes, dear?

625
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:22,135
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course, dear. I'm your mother.

626
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,179
You can talk to me
about anything.

627
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:25,472
Great.

628
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,892
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

629
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,437
You sure? 'Cause you just put
a bra in Brian's sock drawer.

Look, Christine, I know what's going on
with you and Tom,

633
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,535
and first of all,
I just wanna say that

634
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,788
I'm feeling a little ripped off here,
you know?

635
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,708
I thought I was getting a real family.
This is bullshit.

636

Well, it's time you grew up
and faced facts, isn't it?

and stop touching each other!

Second of all,

640

I was thinkin' I could do something
to help you, make you feel better.

Oh, I'm sorry, Drew.
Have I been sending you mixed signals?

664
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:35,477
[chuckles] I just thought
maybe instead of sitting around

665

you might like to have some fun.

No, thanks.

You're afraid of fun.
You don't like having fun.

What the hell does that even mean,
"I don't like fun"?

Of course I like fun.

Everybody likes fun. It's fun.

673

All right, so then why
won't you go with me?

674

Because it would be with you.

675

You know what I think?
I think you're afraid.

676

that you will go, and have fun,

and you'd be with me.

of going down this hill.

- Lucky guess. How did you find me?

933
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:35,289
I talked to your secretary and she said
you were with your family.

934
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:36,665
Oh, Drew!

935
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:40,252
I am so happy for you.
And for us.

936
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,379
- For us?
- "I know what this means,"

937
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:44,464
<i>reaching out to your family.</i>

938
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,758
You want to be
more serious about yourself,

939
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:49,011
and more serious about me.

940
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,805
I wanna meet your family, Drew.

941
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,641
I'm sure you will,
and they wanna meet you one day.

942
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,310
Oh, great.

943
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:58,645
Then we can go to Fiji.

944
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:01,398
How about tomorrow?

945
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:04,359
Fiji? Tomorrow?
You're kidding.

946
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:07,571
That's fabulous, actually.
That's perfect.

947
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:12,576
Then tonight we can spend Christmas Eve
together with our families.

948
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,661
Ah...

949
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:17,998
That's gonna be hard
to pull off, you know?

950
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:22,753
It's very short notice, and we...

951
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:28,217
One of the family members
is challenged, and...

952
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:31,929
[clears throat]... requires
a lot of time to put on

953
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,264
- the proper headgear...
- Oh. No problem.

954
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,558
- [seatbelts unlatching]
- We're here.

955
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,061
- You're here?
- Look outside!

956
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,196
Oh, my God!
You're here?!

957
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:54,409
I mean, oh, my gosh!
You're totally here!

958
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,163
My girlfriend's family is here!

959
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,749
You have to help me!
Pretend for a couple hours!

960
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:03,001
We'll leave by midnight.
I'm begging you!

961
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,420
Read paragraph three.
You bailed, it's done.

962
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:08,966
- You write the check and get out!
- What? No! Wait a minute!

963
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,343
Okay, look, I wanna go!
I'm dying to go!

964
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:13,929
I gotta have a life to go back to!
This girl is it!

965
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,139
I can't tell her I rented a family.

966
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,433
I'm sure she already knows
you're crazy.

967
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,603
- It kinda shows.
- A deal's a deal. That's it.

968
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:24,898
- Unless you sweeten the pot.
- That's extortion, Tom!

969
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,442
- I think I hear the doorbell.
- No! No, no! Wait!

970
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:30,863
No, no! I'll give you
another 75 grand. Okay?

971
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,990
But you gotta do it good,
you gotta try.

972
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,200
Or else I'll be so mad
at you guys!

973
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,702
- [doorbell]
- Come on.

974
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,246
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- [Drew] Fine! Sure!

975
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,791
- Missy!
- Hey, Drew.

976
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,710
Mrs. Vangilder. Captain.

977
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:45,836
Come on in.

978
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:48,255
Merry Christmas.
Honey. Merry Christmas.

979
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,382
Welcome to my childhood home.

980
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:51,800
[chuckling] Come on in.

981
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,010
- Hi.
- Hello.

982
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:55,345
I'm Drew's father,
and this is his mother.

983
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:56,471
- Christine.
- Mom.

984
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:57,639
Letitia. Horace.

985
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:00,392
And he's our son.
There's no doubt about that.

986
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:02,561
[Drew chuckling] That's for sure.

987
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:05,105
[awkward silence]

988
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:14,823
Oh!

989
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:18,827
I would love to see pictures of Drew
when he was small.

990
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,914
Oh, we're not gonna bore everyone,
that's embarrassing.

991
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,874
Good idea.
Bath time for baby.

992
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,334
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

993
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:28,295
- Thanks, Mom.
- Look at him.

994
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,963
Drew, are you sure that's you?

995
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,424
Oh, that's me all right.
I remember it well.

996
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,843
That was in autumn
and the photographer...

997
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:38,847
No, I don't think so.
There's no little dingle.

998
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,683
- Nope.
- No.

999
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,936
[Drew] Yes. It's there, but it's not...

1000
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:48,690
You can't see it, because it was
so long that Mom had to tuck it back

1001
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,901
when she gave me a bath.
It got tangled.

1002
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,820
- You remember, Mom.
- Yeah, yeah.

1003
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:55,155
From the moment he was born, it was...

1004
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,534
- ... freakishly long.
- [chuckling] Right. Yes.

1005
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,952
- [knocking]
- I'll get it.

1006
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,370
No, no, no!

1007
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,539
I'll get it, son.
You stay right there.

1008
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,624
[chuckling] Thanks, Dad.

1009
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,709
- So, here we are.
- Yeah.

1010
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:11,421
So are we keeping you folks
from dinner plans, or...

1011
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,257
No, we don't have any plans.

1012
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:15,050
We couldn't possibly impose.

1013
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,052
[Horace] We just got here.

1014
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:19,680
Oh, okay.
Who was that, Dad?

1015
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,808
Doo-Dah.

1016
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,310
Doo-Dah.
Doo-Dah's my grandpa.

1017
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,771
- He'll tell us stories...
- I wanna meet him.

1018
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,898
...about the 1800s.
I know you do.

1019
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,276
We don't usually
leave him outside.

1020
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,361
We usually let him in, Dad.

1021
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,405
- Let's talk, son.
- [Drew] Okay.

1022
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,323
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

1023
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,659
This guy says he's Doo-Dah's understudy.

1024
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,704
- He's not white.
- That's fine, just let him in.

1025
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,330
They don't know he's not right.

1026
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,583
- They don't know him!
- Want me to let him in?

1027
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,792
- Fine!
- Please, Tom.

1028
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,420
This is my grandfather, Doo-Dah.
Here he is.

1029
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,131
Sweet Jim Jiminy,
cold corn in the mornin'!

1030
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:55,841
Ooh. Who are you?

1031
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,510
I'm Saul's understudy.
I just came to help out.

1032
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,220
[understudy] "Feliz navidad. "

1033
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:03,098
- Is he black?
- Yep.

1034
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:07,769
I can't do it.
I cannot do it.

1035
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:11,356
My family's this close to 350.
You're not gonna weasel out now!

1036
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,775
Put some maple syrup
on the ham.

1037
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:24,369
- Drew?
- Huh?

1038
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:26,079
Ah! Ah!

1039
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,666
I'm sorry!
Oh, Jesus!

1040
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,127
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

1041
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,214
I'm gonna leave right away.
I don't want to cause problems.

1042
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,966
- Drew, listen.
- I'm in a bit of a jam now.

1043
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:41,386
- Drew, Drew, wait.
- What? Yes?

1044
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:45,224
I came back here because
I wanted to apologize to you.

1045
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:48,727
Yes, the thing in the park
was a bit garish and obnoxious,

1046
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,479
but that's you.

1047
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,523
Not that you're garish and obnoxious,

1048
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:54,858
it's just that you
do things in a big way.

1049
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,527
Yes, I do, I do.

1050
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:59,196
And I'm touched.

1051
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,908
- Thank you. That means...
- And thank you.

1052
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,171
You smell like fear.

1053
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,218
- There have been some developments...
- I have a gift for you.

1054
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,303
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1055
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,225
No! Hi!

1056
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,935
[laughing] Hi, honey.

1057
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,396
Your mom sent me in here
to get a cheeseball.

1058
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:36,984
- What's that?
- This is a cheeseball.

1059
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:40,946
Let's play a game where you don't
come back till they eat the whole thing.

1060
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,783
[chuckling] This is great.
Your family isn't what I expected.

1061
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,869
I'm glad you wanted to introduce me.

1062
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:48,871
- It's all I ever wanted.
- Me too.

1063
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,165
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. All right.

1064
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:52,958
Yes. I know.
I love you. Okay.

1065
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:56,920
- Fiji's gonna be great.
- It will be great. Fiji time!

1066
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:06,096
That's what this was about?
You put us through this for a girl?

1067
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,515
No, no, no.

1068
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,184
Just...

1069
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:15,063
- Can I open my present now?
- Sure.

1070
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:20,944
I thought this was because
you had a painful childhood.

1071
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,447
I'm sorry. You said you
never wanted to see me,

1072
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,616
so I accepted that.

1073
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,661
I was broken up with her, but she
showed up and wanted to meet my family.

1074
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,539
I couldn't tell them
it was a rented family.

1075
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:36,543
I know you hate me. I hate me.
I hate my own guts.

1076
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,463
I know this is horrible,
but would you just please,

1077
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:41,840
could you help me,
so I can get through this?

1078
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,843
You'll never see me again.
Just take a ride for an hour.

1079
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,137
Your parents will call you
when it's clear.

1080
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:51,433
[Christine] Drew,
your dad wants more salami!

1081
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:52,768
They're playing along?

1082
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:57,231
Your parents, they're crazy.
They think it's fun.

1083
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,107
I'm sorry.
Okay? I gotta go.

1084
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,109
I'll see you.
I miss you. Thank you.

1085
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,487
You're welcome. See ya.

1086
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,701
They think it's fun, huh?

1087
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:14,706
Maybe they're right.

1088
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,543
Your tree, Christine, it's so colorful.

1089
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,212
You know, it reminds me of Mexico.

1090
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:24,758
Not the better hotels, but the colors
of the simple people.

1091
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,135
It's so bright and vulgar.

1092
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,430
- [chuckles]
- Mom! Dad! I'm home!

1093
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:34,935
[Christine] Alicia, you're back.
You're back, Alicia.

1094
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,854
Oh, you're back.

1095
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:40,274
This is our daughter, Alicia.
This is Mrs. Vangilder.

1096
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:42,442
Please. Letitia.

1097
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:45,112
I'm so pleased to meet you. Really.

1098
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,114
And this is our little Missy.

1099
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,284
Oh, Missy, Missy.

1100
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:55,706
Oh, gosh. I've just heard
so much about you from Drew.

1101
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:58,208
God, you're gorgeous.

1102
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,004
And you are so not fat.
Drew! What's the matter with you?

1103
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,672
I'm sorry?

1104
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,632
- Drew, I'm not fat.
- No.

1105
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:08,677
- I was just thinking that.
- You must be Mr. Vangilder.

1106
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,888
- I would never say that.
- Don't mind us.

1107
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,347
We're a bunch of kidders.

1108
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,308
I like the family.

1109
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,977
Oh, well, you obviously
haven't met Brian.

1110
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,022
By the way, where is Brian?

1111
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:26,445
[whimpering]

1112
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:32,201
Here.

1113
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:35,454
Your mom's startin' to like
your grandfather hittin' on her.

1114
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,248
There's one you don't often hear
on Christmas Eve.

1115
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,458
[Missy laughing]

1116
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,419
It's unbelievable.
Poor thing. Poor thing.

1117
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,671
- Excuse me.
- It's true.

1118
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:47,257
What's happening over here?
What's going on?

1119
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,928
- I'm learning so much from your sister.
- Oh, you are. Great.

1120
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:53,347
I didn't know you were
a baton twirler.

1121
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,517
Yeah. Gave away the big secret,
I guess, didn't you?

1122
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,019
Oh, not the big one,
so don't push me.

1123
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,522
Let's go talk to Doo-Dah.
He's telling stor...

1124
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,649
I want you to see
the bracelet Drew got me.

1125
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:06,652
Ooh, Cartier, huh?

1126
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:08,946
Wow. Look at that.
That's just beautiful.

1127
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,198
Well, that's my brother.

1128
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,701
Just never afraid to put
a price tag on his feelings.

1129
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,996
Yeah. That's my sister.
Never understanding there's love,

1130
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,457
you can care and
want to show it in a big way,

1131
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,877
and you shouldn't be put down
and mocked, and made hurt feelings.

1132
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:27,923
When you love somebody,
you don't have to show it in a big way.

1133
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:31,718
So you were slumming when you
were making out with me in the kitchen?

1134
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:40,561
It's a very, very affectionate family.

1135
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,813
- We show our love.
- Italians.

1136
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,773
We're just very warm.

1137
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:47,401
Red hot, even.

1138
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,821
All right, that's it.
Give me this. Get up.

1139
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,656
- Sit down!
- [Christine] Okay!

1140
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,449
Who wants a tour of the house?

1141
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:57,744
- What you're using are stairs.
- [squeaking]

1142
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:00,080
We like these for going up.

1143
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:02,332
This is the bathroom.

1144
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,461
- What are you doing to me?
- What?

1145
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:10,048
- You're killing me.
- No, I'm just playing along, brother.

1146
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,676
I think Missy likes me.
She thinks I'm funny.

1147
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,470
This was little Drew's room.
Now, it's Brian's.

1148
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:16,638
Aw.

1149
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:19,391
Brian, don't be rude.
We have guests.

1150
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:22,853
He'd live in front of the screen
if we'd let him right, Tom?

1151
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:25,606
It's that insatiable appetite
for knowledge.

1152
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,232
Oh, shit!

1153
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:29,401
Brian, what have you done?!

1154
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:32,279
- Tom, I don't know what that is.
- I do.

1155
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:36,158
It's my wife shooting a "V"
for victory with her legs.

1156
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:38,660
It's been a while,
but that's what it looks like.

1157
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:41,663
- [Letitia] Honestly.
- That's my little girl.

1158
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:44,500
- Horace, get our coats.
- What's going on?

1159
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,668
You have no idea.
Missy, get your coat!

1160
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:48,837
- There's ham!
- [Missy] We're not going.

1161
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,964
- We'll stay.
- [Christine] Lighten up.

1162
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:54,051
It's just a picture.
I had pictures taken for fun.

1163
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:56,303
Where would you get
that stupid idea?!

1164
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:03,393
Coats! Someone say coats?
Get the coats. Gotta get coats.

1165
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,980
[Missy screams]

1166
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,649
[chuckles] Oh.

1167
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:16,740
Some things cannot be unseen.

1168
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:19,493
Brian? Brian?

1169
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,704
[Tom] Great.
Just great, Christine.

1170
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,254
I'll be at the Travel Lodge.

1171
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,715
[door slams]

1172
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:41,849
- Merry Christmas.
- Mom? Mom?

1173
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,893
- Oh, dear God.
- Wait a minute!

1174
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:46,812
There's more of Mom's buffet.

1175
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:50,274
If you think we're staying
after that display, think again.

1176
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,068
[Letitia] Trollops who
pose for dirty pictures,

1177
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,946
various incestuous overtones

1178
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,699
and old, unexplained men.

1179
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,577
This is without a doubt
the worst Christmas I've...

1180
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,204
Oh, shut up, Letitia!

1181
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,498
What?

1182
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:10,460
I'll tell you what. I've put up with
your high and mighty act for 25 years,

1183
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:11,920
but they don't have to.

1184
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:15,007
I don't remember you being superior
when you got knocked up

1185
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:18,635
by Skippy Altsheller
and then tricked me into marrying you.

1186
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,640
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry, Missy.

1187
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:28,020
Missy, darling, it's not true.
You were premature.

1188
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,522
Oh, come on, Letitia!

1189
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:34,985
Tell your mother thanks, Drew.
And Merry Christmas.

1190
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,822
Missy, we'll wait for you in the car.

1191
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:42,284
[grunts] You know, really.

1192
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:45,871
Yuletide's a bitch, ain't it?

1193
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,207
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!

1194
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,085
Okay! Fiji.
Let's go to Fiji right now.

1195
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:54,796
You're right, Drew.
Just screw family.

1196
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:57,799
All we need is each other.
Just take me away.

1197
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:02,012
I'm sorry, Missy. I can't.

1198
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:06,099
Just go home, okay?
I'm sorry about all this.

1199
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,645
I'll spend Christmas alone.

1200
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,319
Oh, fine.

1201
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,946
[sobbing] Okay.

1202
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,783
Well, then...

1203
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,953
...the only thing
I have left to say to you

1204
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,121
is I am keeping this bracelet.

1205
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,962
I feel bad drinking liquor
you're gonna need.

1206
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:36,421
I better go.

1207
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,591
- Merry Christmas.
- All right.

1208
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,011
[Letitia] Missy, get in the car!

1209
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:44,888
My God!

1210
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:49,184
Have you lost your mind?
Did you just lose it in there?

1211
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,821
You know, I have to ask,

1212
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,990
just how bad is your real family

1213
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,285
that you would rather
spend your Christmas like this?

1214
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,632
There was no real family.

1215
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:24,803
What do you mean,
"there is no family"?

1216
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,430
You must've had a family.

1217
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:29,933
I mean, you must've had
a Doo-Dah, right?

1218
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,853
I had a friend whose grandfather,

1219
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,981
was called Doo-Dah.
I always liked that.

1220
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:41,987
My dad walked out on us on Christmas

1221
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,697
when I was four.

1222
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,200
It was basically
just me and my mom.

1223
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:52,331
She was a waitress
at the 24-hour coffee shop.

1224
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:56,919
She didn't have a lot of money,
so when Christmas came around,

1225
01:12:57,044 --> 01:13:01,548
it was an opportunity for her
to take a double shift. She did.

1226
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:06,094
And, you know,
my Christmases were,

1227
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,682
basically, I just kind of
sat around the house, you know?

1228
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,976
Then at night,
I'd walk down there,

1229
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:17,481
and Mom would always buy me
a grown-up stack of pancakes,

1230
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:21,068
and I would sit by myself
at the end of the counter

1231
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,736
and eat 'em.

1232
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:28,075
I did that for Christmas every year
until I turned 18.

1233
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,119
I haven't been able to walk
in a coffee shop since, though.

1234
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,996
Where's your mom now?

1235
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,250
Mom died when I was in college.

1236
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,545
I'm sorry.

1237
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:42,714
[Alicia] You know what?

1238
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:46,718
There's nothing that you can do
about those Christmases.

1239
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:49,346
But the one that you
can do something about,

1240
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:54,601
the one that's here and now, you just
spent that destroying my family.

1241
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:57,563
Alicia, just for the record,

1242
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,857
I didn't destroy your family.

1243
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:02,025
What are you talking about?

1244
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:04,611
Your parents are splitting up.

1245
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:07,114
It's obvious.
Brian knows it.

1246
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:11,160
That's why he spends all his time
in his room on his computer.

1247
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:14,496
You just didn't wanna see it.
I can understand that.

1248
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,833
I'm gonna go get my dad.

1249
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,459
Lock up when you leave.

1250
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,818
Well, all right.

1251
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,398
I forgive you.

1252
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,232
<i>No! No, Spirit! No!</i>

1253
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:51,403
<i>I will honor Christmas in my heart
and try to keep it all the year.</i>

1254
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:53,780
[knocking]

1255
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:56,116
No one's home!

1256
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,534
[knocking]

1257
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,119
[groans]

1258
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:02,498
What?

1259
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:03,999
[knocking]

1260
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:05,959
I hear you.

1261
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:11,298
- Are you gonna hit me?
- No.

1262
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,967
Are you gonna do something else
that still hurts?

1263
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:18,222
No. You gonna invite me in?

1264
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:20,599
You just stopped by
to hang out and catch up?

1265
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:23,936
- Reminisce?
- You owe me money.

1266
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,940
Right. The money.

1267
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:30,943
Okay, come on in.
I'll get my checkbook.

1268
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:48,085
You rented my place
when you could've been staying here?

1269
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:54,883
Well, I gotta admit, this is nice.

1270
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:56,301
Thanks.

1271
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:00,514
You still splitting up with Christine?

1272
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:03,809
[Tom] Yeah. I guess.

1273
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,396
That would be a shame.

1274
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,064
[laughs]

1275
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,984
What are you laughing at?

1276
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,904
Nothing. It's just ironic.

1277
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,448
I paid all that money
to be part of your family.

1278
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,285
You're giving it away for nothing.

1279
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,496
[Drew] Look at this.

1280
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:27,374
That's the ticket to Doo-Dah's play.

1281
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:29,334
Yeah. I got mine too.

1282
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:43,849
[Tom] I'm not very good at apologizing.
I don't know if they're in there.

1283
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,934
[Drew] Come on.
What do you have to lose?

1284
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,690
[Doo-Dah] What do you want with me?

1285
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:53,567
[Marley] Much.

1286
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,235
[Doo-Dah] Who are you?

1287
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,905
In life, I was your partner...

1288
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:59,114
See anybody?

1289
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,116
That's Doo-Dah right there.

1290
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,076
What is the reason
for this visit?

1291
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,746
It is getting late
and I've been hard at work.

1292
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,164
He's not that bad.

1293
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,082
[Marley] To warn you, Ebenezer.

1294
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,251
He's not that good either.

1295
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,295
I'm gonna find Christine.

1296
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,298
[Marley] Learn from me.

1297
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:21,970
My spirit never walked
beyond our counting house.

1298
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:28,560
It never roved beyond
our money-changing hole.

1299
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,771
So I am condemned

1300
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:33,816
to wander through the world

1301
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,944
to see what I might have
shared on Earth,

1302
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:40,364
then turned to happiness.

1303
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:43,492
What are you doing here?

1304
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:46,078
[Doo-Dah] You were always
a good businessman.

1305
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,664
Doo-Dah's family, right?

1306
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,169
Brian. It's me, move over.

1307
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:57,631
No, man. Go find one
of the other empty seats.

1308
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:59,883
Move over, Bri. Come on.

1309
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,475
- Where's your sister?
- [both] Shh.

1310
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,896
- Dear Brother!
- Fanny!

1311
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,607
Christine...

1312
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:20,863
If I were to leave,
I wouldn't even know where to go.

1313
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:23,532
Then why leave?

1314
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,244
That's what I'm sayin'.
I don't wanna leave.

1315
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,454
Then don't.

1316
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:35,377
- All right, I won't.
- Okay.

1317
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,882
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

1318
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,967
It's good.

1319
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:54,146
Bri, that girl...
She's kinda cute for you.

1320
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,814
- Talk to her.
- Stop it.

1321
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:59,026
- She's gonna hear.
- I saw you looking at her.

1322
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,903
- Stop.
- I can tell you like...

1323
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:02,529
I can hear you.

1324
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,033
[chuckling]

1325
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:07,409
That's embarrassing.

1326
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:11,705
That's our grandfather.
This is Brian.

1327
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,082
There, Brian.
You're all set.

1328
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:20,881
I'm sorry.

1329
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,675
Is that your brother?

1330
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:27,638
Yeah.

1331
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:30,224
How do we travel exactly?

1332
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:33,852
Through the air. We fly!

1333
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:35,687
Not so hard!

1334
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,898
- Wedgie! Wedgie!
- [people laughing]

1335
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,671
[Drew] Alicia?

1336
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:03,507
- Hey.
- Hey.

1337
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:06,510
Were you in there
the whole time?

1338
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,304
No. I was just here
to pick up my mom.

1339
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:15,310
She's in there with your dad.

1340
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:18,605
They're kinda making out
in the third row.

1341
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,983
- Really?
- Yeah.

1342
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,361
- That's good.
- Look.

1343
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:28,323
I don't expect you to want
to talk to me or anything,

1344
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:33,245
so I'm not gonna bother you
and give you a hard time,

1345
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:36,832
camp outside your place
and stalk you and you know.

1346
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,959
But I do want to say that I'm sorry

1347
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,588
for what I put you through

1348
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,756
and say thank you.

1349
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,768
So who are you renting
for New Year's

1350
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:00,189
'cause you know, us Valcos,
we book up kind of fast.

1351
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,191
[Drew] I see that.

1352
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:05,110
And I'd get on it if I were you.

1353
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:09,156
I'm lookin' for a family
with maybe a bearded,

1354
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:12,826
irascible dad
with a heart of gold.

1355
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:19,374
A brother who stays in his room
all the time by himself,

1356
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,754
and a sister who is...

1357
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:29,802
...wonderful and smart,

1358
01:23:30,803 --> 01:23:33,806
and really beautiful.

1359
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:38,685
Because I think that's
the kind of person that...

1360
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:43,690
...I could fall in love with.

1361
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:47,653
You know anybody like that?
I know it's tough.

1362
01:23:47,736 --> 01:23:48,862
Let me think.

1363
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:51,073
Not offhand,
but I'll get back to you.

1364
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,116
Let me know.

1365
