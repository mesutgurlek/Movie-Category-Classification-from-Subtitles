I don't really have
the same reaction as--

Mmm, nothing.

334

No, no. Wait, Adam.

- Statement?.
- Yeah, I do.

What kind ofstatement
would that be?
It was pornography.

- Oh, no, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

346
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,305
No. Pornography is meant
to titillate, to excite you.

Did you like whatyou saw?.
Did it getyou hot?.

This is, like,
uncalledfor, okay?

354
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,928

- I know what she said.
Why don't you let her speak?.

Okay.

Then, look, all I'm--
I'm saying is that,
in my opinion,

358
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,016
it wasn't pornography,
it was a statement.

how that makes it a statement.

- What do you mean?.
- It's grafifiiti.

362
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,928
It would be a huge statement,
especially fior a town like this.

the person was saying by it.
We don't.

367

But I think it was a gesture,
a kind ofi manifiesto, ifiyou will--

W-W-Wait.
I don't think a person's dick
can be a manifiesto. Uh-uh.
