and hear him jam every month or so.

And he plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

4
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:32,174
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

when I used to drink--

how that song made me feel...

158
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:37,729
Okay? I can't play the Iverson family
game of denying reality...

159
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,398
- where reality is over there,
somewhere...
- Oh, honey, don't.

160
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:43,772
and we hide from it over here
and pretend it doesn't exist.

161
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,677
Okay? It takes too much energy.
Energy that I don't have.

162
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,942
All right. Maybe I don't either...
have the energy.

163
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:52,007
God, that would be good.

164
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,553
All right, we'll start fresh.

165
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,554
Pattern-free.

166
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,786
Within these four walls,
reality will prevail.

167
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,159
And if I slip up,
you-- you let me know.

168
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,130
You'll--
You'll be the first.

169
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:13,535
They say first steps
are the hardest.

170
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,639
The doctor said
you haven't had any visitors.

171
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:27,516
You know me, Mom. I've never been
one to have a lot of friends.

172
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:31,580
Besides, I seem to be
the last of my small crowd.

173
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,716
What about your roommate Jack?

174
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:40,260
He wasn't my roommate, Mother,
and he died a year ago.

175
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,106
Hey, how's the commercial going?

176
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,107
It's on hold for a week.

177
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:53,737
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

178
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,747
and dumb down the concept.

179
00:13:55,815 --> 00:14:00,479
- No Fellini?
- Who? Most definitely no Fellini.

180
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,215
But my play's not falling apart.

181
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,314
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

182
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,484
Bosco, where do you keep
Theater Week?

183
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,587
Top shelf. Between Psychology Today
and Martha Stewart Living.

184
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,234
Uh-oh!
Whoa!

185
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,396
Jesus! Meredith?

186
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,464
Jimmy, grab that side! Grab that side.
Okay. Everyone. All right, fellas.

187
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,137
On three. One--
Oh. Okay. All right.

188
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,874
- Can we say "lawsuit"?
- Uh, are you okay?

189
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

190
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,145
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

191
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:39,351
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

192
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,917
- If I can just find one,
Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

193
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,954
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean--

194
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,400
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

195
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,636
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

196
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,973
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

197
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:03,846
You know I'm not just asking you
to dinner as a preemptive strike
against litigation.

198
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,407
- I'm asking because--
- I'll have dinner with you.

199
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:11,318
- What changed your mind?
- Anybody who can say
"preemptive strike...

200
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,484
against litigation" with a straight face
deserves a dinner companion.

201
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,393
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

202
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,088
This is last week's.

203
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

204
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,597
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

205
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:32,008
- But, Paul--
- No. I don't want anything
to be any different.

206
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,809
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

207
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,078
I don't want a fight. I just--
I just want to talk and make--

208
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:43,485
Look. What about what I want?
You've always controlled everything:

209
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,547
your shows, the kids.

210
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,355
Stop trying to control me.

211
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,418
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

212
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,294
- I just think maybe--
- Don't think.

213
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:57,166
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right?

214
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,435
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

215
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,611
I may have just enough time left
to become an alcoholic.

%

218
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,045
I don't care who had her first. I poke
around her stool looking for worms.

219
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,179
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

220
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,383
All you do is pet her twice a day.

221
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,359
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

222
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,589
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

223
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:01,429
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

224
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,866
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

225
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,804
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's!

226
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,807
You fu--
Harry?

227
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,538
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry! Harry?

228
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,305
Shit! Shit.

229
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,251
Hi. You got a quarter?

230
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,798
Thank you.

231
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,205
The fucking cat is mine.

232
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,173
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

233
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:48,179
Harry. Hey! Hey!
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay?

234
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,206
You can take anything that came
from IKEA. I want the cat,
and I want Pottery Barn.

235
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,718
It--
One more time.

236
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,688
You hang up one more time and l--
[Slams Down Receiver]

237
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,691
Damn it.

238
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,923
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

239
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,901
Thank you.

240
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,473
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

241
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:21,343
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

242
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,215
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

243
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,482
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

244
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,989
Oh, Christ on crutches!
Okay, you know what, Harry?

245
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:36,016
I want to get rid of you as much as l
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

246
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,529
So here's the thing.

247
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,590
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

248
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:47,537
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything!

249
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,404
Yeah! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

250
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:54,344
That's right.
Do we have a deal? Great.

251
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,507
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

252
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,916
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

253
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:03,614
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

254
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:11,756
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

255
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,636
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

256
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,148
- And you?
- Me?

257
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,345
I'm not very good company.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

258
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,656
No problem.

259
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,322
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Uh, don't go. l-l-I'm sorry.

260
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,332
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

261
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,902
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

262
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:58,239
You know, yesterday I would have
said that things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

263
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,744
They sure as hell
got worse today.

264
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:06,148
I'm, uh--
I work in the, uh, Twin Towers too.

265
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

266
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:13,554
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

267
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,992
You're to blame for those?

268
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,427
- Afraid so.
- [Laughs]

269
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:20,431
Everybody blames me.

270

My boss, my wife, my secretary.

271
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,471
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

272
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,270
And I work like a dog...

273
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:34,039
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

274
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

275
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,880
and my boss,
today he tells me...

276
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,857
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

277
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:51,659
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

278
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,991
[Sighs] I wish you could
spend the night.

279
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,003
You know I can't.

280
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,566
- Is this all you want from us?
- Roger...

281
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:06,168
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

282
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:10,045
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

283
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,242
Well, anything
can be different.

284
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,479
But I don't want this to be.

285
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:19,422
I want it to be what it is:
two very sexually compatible
people enjoying each other...

286
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,892
with no obligations,
no complications...

287
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,260
no individual history,
no mutual history...

288
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,765
[Slaps Roger]
and no guilt.

289
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,324
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

290
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,428
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

291
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,133
that you do love your wife.

292
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,480
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

293
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,577
- with three olives,
and my sullen friend here will have--
- A Coke.

294
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,283
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

295
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,222
- The guy on the phone?
- Harry.

296
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,787
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

297
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:02,425
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

298
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,765
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

299
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,271
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

300
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,900
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

301
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:14,434
- You don't do that, do you?
- No.

302
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,481
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

303
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:20,177
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

304
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:25,087
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing a
blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

305
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,557
The sweater was new.

306
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,787
Here's to good riddance Harry.

307
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,797
Good riddance Harry.

308
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,974
Hey, again please.

309
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,207
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

310
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,714
Three.
Nutritional value.

311
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,774
Now, where were we?
Oh, so Harry.

312
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,183
Right.

313
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,313
The sex part wasn't bad.

314
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,323
You know, for a while.

315
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:04,488
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

316
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:09,557
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

317
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:13,935
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

318
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,498
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

319
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:22,570
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right! Here's the topper.

320
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,708
I timed his performance
one night. Right?

321
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:29,151
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

322
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,815
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

323
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,824
Twenty-three minutes, to be exact.

324
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,826
Including credits.

325
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:40,456
Anyway, he's history.

326
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,626
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

327
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,193
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

328
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,364
The best cats are.

329
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,001
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

330
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:56,480
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

331
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,680
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

332
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,824
Thank you.

333
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,491
You don't say very much, do you?

334
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:15,499
- Does anyone, when they're with you?
- Don't get mean.

335
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:21,597
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

336
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,774
So we should do this again sometime.

337
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:30,303
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

338
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:33,010
Let's do something else.

339
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,383
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

340
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,456
I don't date.

341
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:44,292
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

342
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,627
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

343
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,166
but that's, uh, that's a new one.

344
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,203
Doesn't date.

345
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,729
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always-- You're always dancing alone.

346
00:24:57,576 --> 00:25:00,409
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that?

347
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,011
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

348
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,517
or... mean.

349
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:13,087
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

350
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,229
I'm sorry, really.

351
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,823
Your cat's lucky to have you.

352
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,344
My wife had moved them out.

353
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,210
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

354
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,613
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

355
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,515
What way?

356
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,791
That I was a failure.

357
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,659
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

358
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:54,563
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

359
00:25:54,633 --> 00:26:00,071
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

360
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:04,234
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

361
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,437
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

362
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,810
- And you know what the worst of it is?
- What?

363
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,680
The guy that she left me for?
The fucker works for NBC!

364
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:16,187
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

365
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,021
and he doesn't have to lose
any sleep over the Thursday
night fucking schedule!

366
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,630
Honey?

367
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:34,570
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late?

368
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,972
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

369
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,442
They're still robbing us blind.

370
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,605
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

371
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,376
Which is where?

372
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,610
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

373
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,210
Oh, Intercourse.

374
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,756
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

375
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,757
And I know exactly
how they feel.

376
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,424
- Bed.
- [Imitates Dog Panting]

377
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,595
- Come on, Molly. Come on, Crackers.
- [Dog Whimpers]

378
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:14,169
[Waiter]
There you are, sir. Okay?

379
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:18,478
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you
about your wedding ring.

380
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,955
It's really just force
of habit. l, uh...

381
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:29,255
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

382
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,059
- Acrimonious?
- No.

383
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,328
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

384
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:40,269
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

385
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:45,002
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

386
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:49,673
I wanted them,
but she didn't.

387
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,682
- You know, if this makes you
uncomfortable--
- No.

388
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,082
- I can take it off, the ring.
It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

389
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:58,612
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

390
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,717
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

391
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:06,692
- Does it work?
- [Chuckles]

392
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,825
Depends on what I'm wearing.
[Chuckles]

393
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,432
[Sighs] I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

394
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,342
- You're charming.
- [Laughs]

395
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:27,313
- And real.
- [Laughing]

396
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,854
Lovely.

397
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:32,219
What did I say?

398
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,349
Nothing.

399
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,417
No, no. Nothing.

400
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,589
I just, um--

401
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:44,795
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

402
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,362
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

403
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,374
Several, actually.

404
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:54,310
- And which did I fit into?
- Oh, none.

405
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,576
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

406
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,608
Put you in
the "too good to be true" category.

407
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:05,622
Mmm.
But not to worry.

408
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,523
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

409
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:12,120
or... gay or crazy.

410
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:16,333
[Sighs]

411
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,370
Well, it's a definite possibility.

412
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,074
Crazy, huh?

413
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,177
Certifiable.

414
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,179
- [Sighs]
- [TV, Indistinct]

415
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,983
Mom.

416
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,979
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

417
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:40,183
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

418
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,726
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay?

419
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,797
Want to watch another movie?

420
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,425
No. God, no.

421
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,861
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

422
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,071
- Should I get a deck of cards?
- No. Not that kind of game.

423
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:03,979
- What?
- I want each of us to take some time...

424
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:08,247
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

425
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,017
Something private, some secret...

426
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,490
some feeling or memory.

427
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,120
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

428
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:21,495
Uh, I don't know
if I'd be good at that kind of game.

429
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,466
Will you try for me?

430
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,937
[Sighs]

431
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:31,942
Um--

432
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,487
I'm waiting.

433
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,594
I never loved your father.

434
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,596
Not for a minute.

435
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,264
Wow. You're good at this.

436
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,267
- Why did you marry him?
- Oh.

437
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,367
I was pushing 30.

438
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,312
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

439
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,874
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

440
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:16,045
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

441
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,021
People will always--"

442
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,959
People will always die.

443
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,631
People will always die.

444
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,934
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

445
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,377
you strike me
as someone who's been...

446
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,847
burned romantically.

447
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,611
Scalded.

448
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,383
Repeatedly.

449
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:54,687
- Married?
- [Sighs]

450
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,024
- Divorced?
- Yes.

451
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,223
But that was a long time ago...

452
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,562
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

453
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,568
[Chuckles]
Let me guess.

454
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,799
Uh, he was either involved
with somebody else...

455
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,999
or gay...

456
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,009
or crazy.

457
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,011
Actually, yes.

458
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,409
Involved with someone else?

459
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:22,214
- Crazy?
- No. He was gay.

460
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,551
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,353
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

462
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:29,620
- I mean, I'm not sorry. I mean, uh--
- [Laughs]

463
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,021
- Save me.
- It's okay.

464
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,659
He was a great guy.

465
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,694
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

466
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,741
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

467
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:49,174
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but, uh, but we're still friends.

468
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:53,547
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

469
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:58,214
Are there any, uh,
recent or current losers?

470
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,281
No.

471
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:04,385
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

472
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,989
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,664
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,801
This is, uh, going
a little too quickly for me.

475
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,680
I can go slow.

476
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,783
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. l--

477
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:30,947
- Aw! Aw. That's-- You know?
- What?

478
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,456
- I'm swimming ashore.
You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

479
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,925
"Nice guy"? That's--

480
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:40,363
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

481
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,923
Does that mean no second date?

482
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,333
I have a hard time trusting men.

483
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:49,237
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

484
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,875
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

485
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,141
- So?
- So--

486
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,808
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

487
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,817
so I'll be honest with you.

488
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,046
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

489
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,648
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

490
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:09,193
I'll tell you what I don't want.

491
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,627
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

492
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:17,794
This isn't me, Trent--
this dress, the stupid little bows
in my hair. And look at you.

493
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,862
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you?

494
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,341
No. My house is black-tie.

495
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,344
[Giggles]

496
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,341
- Look, I'm sorry, but--
- I know, you have to go.

497
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,786
- I'm already-- Jesus-- two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

498
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,654
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

499
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:44,889
- Until the day I die,
I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

500
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:49,059
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

501
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:53,662
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh?

502
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,104
[Chuckles]
Take care. All right?

503
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:58,642
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

504
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,076
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

505
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,819
Taxi money.

506
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,355
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

507
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,119
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

508
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,963
Look, Trent...

509
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,333
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

510
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,804
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

511
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,307
You can cook dinner
for me Tuesday.

512
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,978
- Okay.
- Good.

513
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,615
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

514
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,846
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

515
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,083
Meet my better half.

516
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:49,559
- Better half?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

517
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,357
Your dog Barley? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

518
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,364
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

519
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,559
- Great.
- Good.

520
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,228
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

521
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:03,070
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows?

522
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,076
I think they're adorable.

523
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,920
[Sighs]

524
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,957
Why did you stay with him?

525
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:30,290
Well, you.

526
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,525
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

527
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,365
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

528
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:42,463
[Sighs]
I was so relieved when he died.

529
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,876
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- [Chuckles] Mmm.

530
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:51,905
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

531
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,543
It's oddly cleansing.

532
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,058
I want to know
what you're like away from me here.

533
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:12,296
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

534
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,702
is what-- ahh-- appeals to me.

535
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,765
You know how to play
your role damn well.

536
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,539
[Laughs]
Guilty as charged.

537
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,383
[Moans]

538
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:34,554
- Roger, what do you want?
- I don't want much.

539
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,754
I just want more of you.

540
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,731
I can't give you that.

541
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:47,964
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

542
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,973
"An anger ball"?

543
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,977
Don't you see?
What's great about you and me...

544
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:59,881
right here, this very moment,
is that we don't come through
that door with a lot of baggage.

545
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,717
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

546
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:07,747
And aren't we lucky?
We don't bring anything in...

547
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,124
and we don't take anything out.

548
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,862
% [Techno, Loud]

549
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:26,707
%

550
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:29,474
You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

551
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:33,483
- What?
- I said you look like
a man in need of a Coke.

552
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:40,351
%

553
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,121
[Laughing]

554
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,493
Uh, my friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a--

555
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:50,261
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

556
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,268
Good memory.

557
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:55,499
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

558
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,671
I've had a terrible day.

559
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,112
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

560
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,650
"How bad was it?" you might ask.

561
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:09,744
-l might if you gave me the opportunity.
-l was saving you the effort...

562
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,756
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

563
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:16,590
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that?

564
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:21,030
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

565
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,762
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

566
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,168
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams?

567
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,867
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites.
Great story.

568
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,638
It's about this girl, Katherine-- moi--

569
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:37,442
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

570
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:40,916
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

571
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:45,115
You see, the women sort of pimp
for Cousin Sebastian.
Are you following this?

572
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:46,986
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

573
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,154
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

574
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:55,689
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

575
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,497
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

576
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:02,232
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

577
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,742
and they--
well, they eat him.

578
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,337
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

579
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:14,077
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

580
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,019
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

581
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,420
from soup to nuts.

582
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,720
If you'll pardon the expression.

583
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,320
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next--

584
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,957
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

585
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:33,834
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

586
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,100
from Suddenly Last Summer...

587
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,041
I am going to puke.

588
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,477
Now, who is up next?

589
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,808
- Um... Joan! You're on.
- [Moans]

590
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,950
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

591
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,789
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.

592
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:03,828
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie?

593
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,732
- I told you.
- I know.

594
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,636
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing?

595
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:12,767
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you?

596
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,778
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night?

597
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:17,644
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

598
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,979
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy.
Okay, blue boy?

599
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:26,888
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

600
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,893
If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

601
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:39,700
Uh, now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay. Uh, moving on.

602
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,898
-No, they--
-[Hannah] Do you ever hear from Wendy?

603
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:46,569
- [TV Volume Decreases]
- What on Earth made you think of Wendy?

604
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:51,240
- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days.
- Yes.

605
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,715
Very old. Ancient.

606
00:42:55,353 --> 00:43:00,154
Well, do you?
Do you ever hear from her?

607
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:02,158
Any reason I should?

608
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:05,753
Any reason you should keep

- Honey, you sounded
like John Wayne in a bathhouse.

[Imitating John Wayne]
Well, as a matter of fact,
this is my first time here.

767
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:50,673
[Laughs] I'm 28 years old,
in case you're wondering.

And that's in real years,
not Heather Locklear years.

- Well, I just didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding.

the fuck you're doing in this place.

Um... I had a...
fight with my wife.

777
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:20,639
- Old story.
- Well, it's an old story...

778

You can always tell.

792
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,514
It's called "gay-dar."

- I'm not gay or anything.
- No, no, no.

It's just something about him.

Wendy came along at a time
when I needed somebody.

802

If this is supposed to be making me
feel better, you're failing miserably.

803
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,993
It didn't mean
that I didn't love you.

804
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:57,264
In fact, it meant that I did love you.

805
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,499
Well...

806
00:54:59,573 --> 00:55:04,169
you seem to have been loving
a lot of people right about then:

Hannah, we've been married
for 40 years.

You know I spent a lot of time
that summer with Wendy.

815

Our production company
did throw us together.

816
00:55:29,203 --> 00:55:31,797
If I remember correctly, I hired her.

817
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:36,309
Right. We were launching
your first show.

818
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:39,813
And... well, Wendy was a big help.

Oh, I'll bet.

- Were you really in love with her?
- Yes.

821
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:52,325
Yeah, I was.
I remember wishing then that I wasn't.

822
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:54,588
I couldn't think straight
for a whole year.

823
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,996
- That's when you lost all that weight.
- Yes.

- I thought it was overwork.
- It was Wendy.

- I didn't love you any less.
- Oh, don't.

- I didn't.
- Don't.

Mm-hmm.

sleep with her?

And you didn't want
to sleep with her?

Oh, boy.

842

A couple times during the movie
I thought you ducked out on me.

843
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:16,275
I had to use the bathroom.

844
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:19,608
Well, at crucial times like
these, you should inform a girl
about having a small bladder.

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,444
It saves her
from abandonment fantasies.

00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:25,952
Would it help at all
if I told you I didn't sit down to pee?

847
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:28,613
In this theater,
I don't sit down to pee.

Maybe.

I'm not asking
to go with you, you know.

851
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:45,137
We can take this slowly.

852
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:48,299
Joan, this isn't anything.

853
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:51,970

and it won't be anything ever.

That is so sweet.
He never wants to see her again...

857

dismembered in the underground parking.

You had a great love.

Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

Well, it can only be once for me.

mythic emotional plateau.

1095

But you fell in love, she left you...

1096
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:52,173
and now you're dealing with
love's most common byproduct:

1097
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,213

1098

It-- It's hard to talk about.

1101
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,423
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

1102
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:10,519
Really terrific.
I go and hear him jam every month or so.

1103
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:13,793
He plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

1104
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:17,597
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

1105
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:21,970
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

1106
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,975
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

1107
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:27,809
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

1108
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,974
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

1109
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,984
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

1110

It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

Love, for instance."

1114
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:46,488

and he said...

"Definitely. Most definitely.

1116

dancing about architecture."

He might be right.

Well, I should say that
I finished tonight.

1220
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,427
It wasn't what you had in mind?

1221
01:21:36,502 --> 01:21:38,436
Ultimately, no.

1222
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:43,999
Well... I'm sure you'll find
something you enjoy.

1223
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,514
I mean, to keep you occupied.

1224
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,510
I'm going to try.

1225
01:22:01,093 --> 01:22:03,357
[Laughs]

1226
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:06,023
Well, as the British say,
I'm knackered.

1227
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:11,134
You know what Saturday is, don't you?

1228
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:13,137
I do.

1229
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:15,639
Okay.

1230
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,142
It might be easier if we meet there.

1231
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,804
Whatever's easier.

1232
01:22:20,879 --> 01:22:24,645
All right. Did you feed the dogs?
You gave them their pills?

1233
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:28,483
Okay. Well, don't forget to turn out
the light before you come to bed.

1234
01:22:28,554 --> 01:22:31,318
- I won't.
- Tomorrow's trash day.

1235
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:42,564
[Doctor] There isn't much more
we can do, except ease the pain.

1236
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:46,160
All right.

1237
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:48,502
Ease the pain.

1238
01:23:02,254 --> 01:23:04,518
- Mom?
- Yes, honey.

1239
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,581
- Mom?
- I'm here.

1240
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:09,355
Wh-Where's Jack?

1241
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:13,023
- He's not here.
- He was just here a minute ago.

1242
01:23:13,098 --> 01:23:15,999
- No?
- No.

1243
01:23:16,068 --> 01:23:20,300
- It was... you who were here.
- Yes, I'm here.

1244
01:23:20,372 --> 01:23:24,866
- You are here, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm here.

1245
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,643
Tell me about death.

1246
01:23:46,565 --> 01:23:49,500
Remember a long time ago...

1247
01:23:49,568 --> 01:23:52,059
when you were still
inside my belly...

1248
01:23:52,137 --> 01:23:55,834
and the contractions began?

1249
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:01,243
Well, they're beginning again.

1250
01:24:01,313 --> 01:24:05,181
- Read me that story.
- What story?

1251
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,185
The one with the rabbit
and the rocking chair.

1252
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,751
- Good Night, Moon?
- Yeah.

1253
01:24:13,826 --> 01:24:17,284
I like the ending.
Read me the ending.

1254
01:24:34,546 --> 01:24:38,141
Good night, comb.

1255
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:41,448
Good night, brush.

1256
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,988
Good night, nobody.

1257
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:49,493
Good night, mush.

1258
01:24:52,398 --> 01:24:57,335
Good night to the old lady
whispering hush.

1259
01:24:59,405 --> 01:25:01,339
Good night, stars.

1260
01:25:03,075 --> 01:25:07,671
Good night... air.

1261
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:14,283
Good night, noises...

1262
01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:19,457
everywhere.

1263
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,337
[Crying]

1264
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:17,280
Do you ever wonder if
while we spend all this time
anthropomorphizing our animals...

1265
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:19,783
maybe they're just
anthropomorphizing us?

1266
01:26:19,852 --> 01:26:21,877
- [Blanche Purring]
- Hmm.

1267
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:25,446
I didn't think so.
Who? Keenan?

1268
01:26:25,524 --> 01:26:29,290
No. Trust me,
I'll never hear from him again.

1269
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:33,957
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm fresh out of jokes.

1270
01:26:34,032 --> 01:26:37,468
What, is that a rhetorical question?
Why is my life so complicated?

1271
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:41,302
Gee, I don't know.
Why is your life so fucking simple?

1272
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:43,967
- [Knocking]
- Hold on. There's someone at the door.

1273
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:46,704
Well, I don't know until I answer it,
do l? Yeah, I'll ask who it is.

1274
01:26:46,778 --> 01:26:48,712
Hold on.
Yeah.

1275
01:26:52,985 --> 01:26:54,646
Hi.

1276
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,813
Hi.

1277
01:26:56,889 --> 01:27:00,222
Um, I'm just on the phone.
I'm gonna wrap it up, okay?

1278
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:04,886
[Closes Door]

1279
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:12,403
M.C.I.

1280
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:14,735
They're geniuses at tricking you
into conversation.

1281
01:27:14,806 --> 01:27:17,536
I can't stop thinking about you.

1282
01:27:17,609 --> 01:27:19,440
I love conversations that
start with the guy saying...

1283
01:27:19,511 --> 01:27:21,376
"l can't stop thinking about you."

1284
01:27:21,446 --> 01:27:24,074
Mind you, I've never actually
been on the receiving end
of any of those conversations.

1285
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:26,083
Just looking at you
makes me happy.

1286
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,278
I have--
I have to sit down.

1287
01:27:31,256 --> 01:27:35,625
When we're together,
whether or not I show it...

1288
01:27:35,694 --> 01:27:40,188
[Groans] I just can't wait to hear
the next words out of your mouth.

1289
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:44,395
But right now I need to ask you
to do something for me.

1290
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:46,403
Anything.

1291
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:50,134
Shut up.
Just for a moment.

1292
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:52,938
I've been-- I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

1293
01:27:54,546 --> 01:27:58,312
I have no idea
why you're so relentless...

1294
01:27:58,383 --> 01:28:00,977
particularly, given the arsenal
of defenses I've thrown at you.

1295
01:28:01,053 --> 01:28:02,987
But...

1296
01:28:04,723 --> 01:28:10,628
no matter how hard I've tried to block
out everything that you've said...

1297
01:28:10,696 --> 01:28:12,721
the message has been received.

1298
01:28:16,168 --> 01:28:19,433
In a place inside me
that I thought had died.

1299
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:23,235
But it hasn't.

1300
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:28,776
And that place inside me
is alive and well.

1301
01:28:32,351 --> 01:28:34,444
I can't make any promises...

1302
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:36,953
but...

1303
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:39,786
I'd like to try and be with you.

1304
01:28:42,427 --> 01:28:46,454
It won't be easy,
but I'd like to try.

1305
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,761
Can I say something?

1306
01:28:56,942 --> 01:29:00,639
You're right.
It won't be easy, but...

1307
01:29:00,712 --> 01:29:03,647
[Laughing]

1308
01:29:03,715 --> 01:29:05,910
that's okay.

1309
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:11,550
I want to be with you, but,
you have to understand, l, um--

1310
01:29:11,623 --> 01:29:13,648
- We can't--
- Have sex.

1311
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:17,161
It may not be the conventional wisdom,
but it's the only way I can do this.

1312
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:19,356
At least for the time being.

1313
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:22,700
That's not a problem?

1314
01:29:22,768 --> 01:29:28,331
When was having sex
or not having sex not a problem?

1315
01:29:28,407 --> 01:29:33,174
To be honest, it's gonna
be difficult not to express
physically what I feel for you...

1316
01:29:33,245 --> 01:29:37,648
but...
we can look for other ways.

1317
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:42,813
There's nothing wrong
with holding each other. Hmm?

1318
01:29:42,888 --> 01:29:45,379
Nothing at all.

1319
01:29:45,457 --> 01:29:47,391
And sleeping with each other.

1320
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:49,393
We can do that.

1321
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:52,225
And... loving each other forever.

1322
01:29:53,765 --> 01:29:56,859
- What did I ever do to deserve you?
- [Laughs]

1323
01:29:56,935 --> 01:30:01,201
Usually that line is screamed at me
by somebody running out the door...

1324
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:05,039
not standing in front
of me and staying.

1325
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:07,874
It makes for a nice change.

% Lay it down, child %

1327

% Lay it down, child %

01:30:16,888 --> 01:30:22,485
% And walk into this room %

[Joan Sighs, Giggles]

1330
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,934
[Trent] Ah, flowers.

1331
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:33,835
How thoughtful.

1332
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:36,999
Whoo. We like the same merlot.

1333
01:30:37,075 --> 01:30:40,010
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

1334
01:30:40,078 --> 01:30:42,569
[Laughs] Excellent.

1335
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:44,672
Come on in.

1336
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,684
Wow.

1337
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:55,518
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

1338
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:57,858
I have a little confession to make.

1339
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:01,194
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

1340
01:31:01,266 --> 01:31:03,359
- Oh.
- [Doorbell Rings]

1341
01:31:03,435 --> 01:31:05,369
- [Laughs]
- I can order delivery.

1342
01:31:05,437 --> 01:31:07,530
All right.

1343
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:09,870
Chinese food is my specialty.

1344
01:31:19,551 --> 01:31:21,985
What are we making?

1345
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:24,146
Some hemlock.

1346
01:31:24,222 --> 01:31:26,747
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

1347
01:31:26,825 --> 01:31:31,159
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

1348
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:35,097
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

1349
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:37,499
You know that's not true.

1350
01:31:37,569 --> 01:31:42,871
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love?

1351
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,676
- No.
- Well, I do.

1352
01:31:46,745 --> 01:31:50,181
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

1353
01:31:50,248 --> 01:31:56,016
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

1354
01:31:56,087 --> 01:31:58,021
And if it's true love...

1355
01:31:58,089 --> 01:32:01,525
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

1356
01:32:01,593 --> 01:32:03,527
and it brings out
the best in you...

1357
01:32:03,595 --> 01:32:08,032
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

1358
01:32:08,099 --> 01:32:11,364
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1359
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:15,736
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

1360
01:32:15,807 --> 01:32:19,140
Feel that I was worth loving.

1361
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:21,645
Because somehow I knew...

1362
01:32:21,713 --> 01:32:26,047
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

1363
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:31,481
- You couldn't have it with me?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

1364
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:33,649
but I'd forgotten it.

1365
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:36,489
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

1366
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:39,394
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

[Laughs]

1368
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:46,165
And Wendy made me remember...

1369
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,833
that I was a pretty terrific fellow.

1370
01:32:49,908 --> 01:32:52,342
Bully for Wendy.

1371
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:56,346
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

1372
01:32:56,414 --> 01:32:58,041
Why?

the right choice.

made me love you more...

1391
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:18,124
