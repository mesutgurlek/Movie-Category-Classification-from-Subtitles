1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,439
(piano music plays)

2
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,705
(humming)

3
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,019
(sighs)

4
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,857
- Morning, Paddy.
- Morning, Kate.

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,905
Looking lovelier than ever.
If I was only a younger man...

6
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,702
Oh, shut up!

7
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:28,046
Mum, it's me,
your daughter.

8
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,925
- Post.
- Have a cup of tea with me.

9
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,007
Can't.
I'm running late. Sorry.

10
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,394
(knocks on glass)

11
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,367
(piano music plays)

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,670
- He's at it again.
- Who? At what?

13
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:59,049
The new neighbor,
barbecuing or something.

14
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,146
I've heard he's from Poland.

15
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,022
Oh, well, you know, maybe Polish people
like to barbecue a lot.

16
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,754
I can't find your...

17
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,262
- oh, here it is.
- Where do you put this?

18
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,356
It's my toothbrush thingy.
Just stop fiddling.

19
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,094
Prescription.

20
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,330
Now listen, you do not
have to keep taking these.

21
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,338
- The doctor said.
- I like to.

22
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,703
Makes me feel better.

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,436
All right, well, listen. I'm off.
I'll, um...

24
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,467
See you later, or call you later.

25
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,241
You got that date thing tonight?

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,612
(groans)

27
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,948
I don't know.
Maybe.

28
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,547
Time and tide, Kate,
as your father liked to say.

29
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,319
Was that from his terrace
in the south of France?

30
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,322
Sorry. That was mean.

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,889
(sighs)
Hug me.

32
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,162
Hug me!

33
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,929
Bye, Mum.

34
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,168
I am a cow.

35
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,471
- (piano notes play)
- Put my score up first.

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,447
- They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
- But I want to see it.

37
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,006
- Put it up.
- I'm backed up already.

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,713
Johnnie, you were the one that was late.
Just put it up.

39
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,650
(orchestral music playing)

40
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:29,338
- (keyboard clacks)
- Okay.

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,674
Listen, Harvey, Marvin wants me
to present my ideas while you're away.

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,077
Huh?

43
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:42,844
Look, I'm not doing myself any favors here,
Harvey, but I'd watch your back.

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,220
Harvey:
Marvin. Hey, Marvin.

45
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,849
Hey, Harvey.
Shouldn't you be in London?

46
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,723
Yeah. I'm heading there now.
What's going on?

47
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,729
Johnnie said something about
you wanting him to present on Monday?

48
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,821
Oh, yeah. No, no.

49
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,095
I was just thinking that, with you being in
London, you should stay a while.

50
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,295
- What?
- There's no need to rush back.

51
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,362
- Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
- What?

52
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,736
Well, Johnnie can do it.

53
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,468
I mean, he can pitch
the Samuelson account.

54
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,169
No. I'm coming back.
Those are my connections.

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,576
- They have been for years.
- I know. I'm just...

56
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,410
They've got new people there,
you know?

57
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,211
I think they might want
something different.

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,445
I really want to come back.
I should be there in person.

59
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,975
In person?

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,715
Yeah. I want to
stand behind my music.

61
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,019
But nobody cares, Harvey.

62
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,820
They're demos.
They're already pressed.

63
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,759
Nobody gives a shit.
They don't need to see you.

64
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,785
They don't need to see me.

65
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,527
I'm back Monday, Marvin.
I'm coming back.

66
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,532
Well, you better land this one,
Harvey.

67
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,200
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

68
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,607
Say it.

69
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,975
There are no more chances,
Harvey.

70
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,246
(keys jingle)

71
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,344
(car door opens)

72
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,651
Enjoy London.

73
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,292
(engine starts)

74
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:35,027
- Are you on a holiday?
- No. Business.

75
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,934
You?

76
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,439
Oh, my daughter's
getting married.

77
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,736
Congratulations.

78
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,606
Yeah, thanks.
Well, kind of.

79
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,774
She's American, he's American, and they're
still getting married in London.

80
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,808
I told her we have a perfectly good
wedding system here.

81
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,892
I mean, they both work in London.
That's why they're...

82
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,986
- There you are, Sir.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.

83
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,725
- Can I just give you this?
- Yes.

84
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,428
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

85
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,336
(sighs)
Does flying make you nervous?

86
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,772
No.
I do it all the time.

87
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:19,972
Oh. I don't like it.
I have to fortify myself.

88
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,206
You know that old joke,
one guy says to the other...

89
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,413
Tell you what, I have got meetings
in the morning, when we land,

90
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,148
so I think I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

91
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,588
- Sure.
- Sorry, I just...

92
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,422
I'll be useless
if I don't get some sleep.

93
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,950
No, no.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

94
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,000
- Morning, Aggie.
- Morning, darling.

95
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,839
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,109
"A filmy layer
on the surface of a liquid."

97
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,740
Scum.

98
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,115
(laughs)
Scum!

99
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,518
"Manicure tool,"
four and four.

100
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,885
Oh, come on, Aggie.

101
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,823
- What? I'm just testing you.
- Nail file!

102
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,882
(laughs)

103
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,326
Sorry, sorry.
(sighs)

104
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,956
Morning. Morning.

105
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,024
Oh, thank God
you're my boss, Kate.

106
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,662
- Morning, Aggie.
- Morning, darling.

107
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,934
So, we still on for tonight?

108
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:25,034
- Matt's definitely bringing Simon.
- No, no, no. I'm scared.

109
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,170
Oh, now, don't be scared!
He's gorgeous!

110
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,410
He's a big, strong, confident,
gorgeous fella.

111
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,940
You'll love him.
He's beautiful.

112
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,613
Right. Look, I'll come, but only
if you two swear blind

113
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,486
you will not leave me
on my own with him.

114
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,424
Oh, no, no.
Promise. Absolutely.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,121
- Kate: Can I trust her?
- No.

116
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,152
Of course you can trust me.
We'll drive you home.

117
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,792
We'll drive both of you home,
depending on what home you're going to!

118
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,234
- Oh, shut up.
- Yeah. He's got his own business.

119
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,861
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,394
What kind of business?

121
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,135
I don't know exactly.
I think it's stationery.

122
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,008
Oh. I've always loved stationery.

123
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,246
So not a business trip, then.

124
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,051
Man: No. Unless you count
three grandchildren as work.

125
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,921
- Some might.
- That's true.

126
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,223
Thank you very much for your time.
You're all done.

127
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,489
- Thank you.
- Safe trip home.

128
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,396
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

129
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,633
Excuse me. I wonder if I could trouble you
for two minutes of your time.

130
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,641
- Won't take a second.
- No.

131
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm tired, you know?

132
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,879
Yes, I do.

133
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,814
Where to, Sir?

134
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,086
Hi, Susie.
It's your dad.

135
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,529
Uh, I made it, uh, and I'm in a taxi
on the way to the hotel.

136
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,725
Uh, I guess all you guys
are already there.

137
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,202
Anyways, I really look forward
to seeing you and everybody else.

138
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,363
I can't wait. Love you.
Bye-bye.

139
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,041
Hi, it's Harvey Shine here.

140
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,538
Just want to confirm that Mike
is going to be in the mix Monday.

141
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,017
And I'm reachable by my cellphone.

142
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,987
You probably have the number on file, but
just in case,

143
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,890
it's 917-384-5368.

144
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:25,421
You may need an international code, so,
you know, I think you have to dial 044,

145
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,160
or maybe, uh, not sure.

146
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,228
It could be 011.
You can try 44 then 1 and then 917.

147
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,106
Whatever it is, whether it's 044
or 44 or 011,

148
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,270
after that, you may have to
put a 1 be...

149
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,177
- (beep)
- Hello?

150
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,591
Hi.

151
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,063
I'm with the wedding party.
There should be a room for me.

152
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,429
Harvey Shine.

153
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,698
Yes. We have
a double room for you.

154
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,139
Good.
Is everyone else checked in?

155
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,336
I'm not sure, Sir.

156
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,505
My daughter... Susan Shine?

157
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,574
She may already be going by
the name Wright... Susan Wright.

158
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,076
W-R-I-G-H-T.

159
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,851
No, sir.
No one of that name.

160
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,723
Sir, Room 522.

161
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,867
(window clicking)

162
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,115
Oh, boy.

163
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,986
(cellphone ringing)

164
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,718
Hello?

165
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,059
Hi, Susie.

166
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,930
I'm here. Where are you?
Where is everybody?

167
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,992
Oh. I didn't realize.

168
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:14,097
I thought the plan was
for everybody to stay together.

169
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,405
No. I just wasn't sure.
I...

170
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,072
No. I just... I didn't know
I was gonna be here by myself.

171
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,705
I thought that...

172
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:28,118
Anyway, so, your mom,
she rented a house for all of you, huh?

173
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,987
Oh, come on.
I'm a big boy.

174
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,491
I'm happy here.
It's very cozy.

175
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,018
Yes, I have the address.

176
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,499
Yeah. I love you, too.
I'll see you there.

177
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,170
(cellphone ringing)

178
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,371
Hello, Mum.

179
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,773
What are you wearing?

180
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,801
- Purple dungarees.
- Oh, you're not.

181
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,542
No, not really. I'm wearing a miniskirt
and a boob tube.

182
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,380
- They're totally back in.
- Oh, you're just being silly.

183
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,908
(laughs)

184
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,717
Now, don't be nervous.
Just be yourself.

185
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,781
Yes, thanks for the advice.

186
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,658
Oh, listen.
I've been thinking about Greece.

187
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,754
Yeah. Okay.
Well, can we talk about that later?

188
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,287
All right. Bye!

189
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,266
Bye.

190
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,472
- Kate.
- Ah.

191
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,880
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm so sorry.

192
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,476
- Don't tell me your mother...
- Yeah.

193
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,009
Is that mine?

194
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,522
Cheers.
Thank God. Oh.

195
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,424
She's, um...

196
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,190
She's just on about some Pole living
next to her who's barbecuing a lot.

197
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,960
- Oh, very suspicious.
- Well, that's what she thinks.

198
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,330
Well, they're here.

199
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,857
- Okay.
- He's at the bar.

200
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,234
Very nice fella.
Very chatty.

201
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,795
- Okay.
- I like him. I like him.

202
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,204
- There's Matt.
- Hey.

203
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,799
(chuckles)
Hi, Matt.

204
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,503
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

205
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,377
- I'm good, too.
- Kate, this is Simon.

206
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,812
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

207
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,213
So you're in stationery?

208
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,117
Um, I'm IT... computing.

209
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,348
- You told me it was stationery.
- Oh!

210
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,878
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, love.

211
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,823
Well, there's a bit of stationery involved.

212
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,383
Mainly computing, though.
(laughs)

213
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,918
- So not stationery.
- Let's sit down.

214
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,294
It doesn't matter.

215
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,662
Sorry, Matt.
It's just that I...

216
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,327
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,700
Cheers, lads.

218
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,168
Hmm.

219
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,300
Shit.

220
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,494
Yeah, I just...
I just got off the plane last night.

221
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,354
(people talking)

222
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,721
- Hey, Harvey!
- Hey. Scott.

223
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,756
- Harvey, you made it.
- Scott, how are you, man?

224
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,735
Hey, whoa.
What's up?

225
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,034
This is Susan's father... Harvey...
Harvey Shine.

226
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,735
This is Josh Hillman
and my best man... Pete Turner.

227
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,800
- How you guys doing?
- Good. How you doing, Harvey?

228
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,540
- Great.
- Yeah, it's great to see you.

229
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,378
Yeah, you too.
How you holding up?

230
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,941
Great, great.
Can't wait to marry Susie, really.

231
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,012
- Is she here?
- Oh, she's in there.

232
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,647
She'll be thrilled you're here.

233
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,987
- I'll just go and find her.
- Yeah.

234
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,492
- (cellphone rings)
- Ooh. I got to take this.

235
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,153
Grab that phone.

236
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,389
Hello?

237
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,555
Yeah, it's Harvey.

238
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,189
No no no no,
that's not right.

239
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,257
I need this.
I need Mike.

240
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,030
No. I told him two weeks ago.
I booked him.

241
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,127
What?

242
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,797
No, but I...

243
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,331
Look, just tell him
to call me, okay? It's...

244
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,401
I booked him!

245
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,207
Uh, I'll talk to you later.

246
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,806
I'm sorry.
It's always something.

247
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,111
Sure. Yeah.

248
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,880
So, what's your field, Harvey?

249
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,979
Well, I'm in the music business.

250
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,887
Oh, wow.
Doing what?

251
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,258
You know, TV,
background, commercials.

252
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,753
- Cool. What kind of stuff?
- Commercials.

253
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,325
- Sounds profitable.
- Yeah, it can be.

254
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,735
So, you guys...
you work for Scott?

255
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,000
We work with Scott.

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,101
- And what is that, oil?
- Yeah, it's...

257
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,772
Well, that can be profitable.

258
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,872
Has its moments.

259
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,715
Yeah, okay. I think I should
just look for my daughter.

260
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,380
Absolutely. Hey, nice to meet you.
We'll see you in there.

261
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,787
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah, sure.

262
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,222
- He's got to be younger than me.
- (cellphone ringing)

263
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,419
Well, look, he's young.
He'll have plenty of energy.

264
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,654
(laughs)

265
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,528
- He's lovely. Big hands on him.
- You'll just say anything.

266
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,225
No, it's not...
don't answer that phone call.

267
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,460
I've got to answer it.

268
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,525
Kate, it's your mom.
You know it's your mom.

269
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,900
I know.
She's on her own. Come on.

270
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,427
Yeah, and so are you.

271
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,999
She is, like, human contraception, honest
to God.

272
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,600
- She's ruining your sex life.
- Shut up.

273
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,271
You go. You go.

274
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,677
Hello, Mum?

275
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,512
Yeah.
Can I ring you back?

276
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,383
Yeah, 'cause I'm out.
Okay, bye.

277
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,896
(sighs)

278
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,608
Hi.

279
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,769
Hi.

280
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,301
I'll see you guys.

281
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,404
Hi!

282
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,937
Wow. Let me look.
Let me look.

283
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,472
Whoa.

284
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,018
You look beautiful.

285
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,412
Thank you.

286
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,120
- You look...
- Like a bad lounge act.

287
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,322
(laughs) No, you don't.
You look very, very nice.

288
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,390
No. They told me that everyone
was going to wear white here.

289
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,267
(laughs)
But I was misinformed.

290
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,170
It looks good.
I like it.

291
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,333
Thank you.

292
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,674
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

293
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,778
So, uh, that's your guy?

294
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,479
Yeah.

295
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,886
It's a long way to come to see two
American kids get married.

296
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,981
Sorry for the inconvenience.

297
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,790
No. That's just a bad joke
'cause I'm jet-lagged. I'm sorry.

298
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,491
Have you seen Mom?

299
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,194
- No. Is she here with Brian?
- Yep. They're over by our table.

300
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,862
Oh.

301
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,500
So, is the house your mother rented
for almost everyone nice?

302
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,134
- Dad.
- What?

303
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,270
No. I just got to
get it out of my system.

304
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,041
I'm sorry.
It really is good to see you.

305
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,846
Give me a hug.

306
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,753
- Hey, look who I've got.
- Hi.

307
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,881
Oh, my gosh.
Hello.

308
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,357
We'll talk later.
Go ahead.

309
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,053
Hi. Bye.

310
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,755
- Hey.
- Hi.

311
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,263
I'm Matt. This is...

312
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,097
- Sorry. We've got to go.
- No.

313
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,727
Babysitter just rang.

314
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,499
Wee bit of trouble at home
but nothing serious.

315
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,335
- Nothing serious.
- Nothing serious at all.

316
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,772
But you stay.
You stay.

317
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,070
All right.

318
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,511
You enjoy yourself, you miserable cow,
and turn that phone off.

319
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,242
- You working tomorrow?
- Yes, half day.

320
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,216
I can't believe
you give yourself Sundays.

321
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,116
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- Okay.

322
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,211
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

323
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,588
Looks like we've been set up.

325
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,789
Yes.
(laughs) Sorry.

326
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,492
No, it's not your fault.
I mean, I'm fine with it.

327
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,398
I mean, I'm happy
to meet new people.

328
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,370
Yes. Yes. Yes. So am I.

329
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,429
Why don't you sit down?

330
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,102
So, you're Oonagh's boss.

331
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,239
Yes.

332
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,612
I'm saying "yes" a lot.

333
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,982
- Uh, yeah.
- (laughs)

334
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,884
Sorry.

335
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,548
Would you like another drink?

336
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,490
Uh, sure.
I'll get them.

337
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,619
No no no, it's fine.
What would you like?

338
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,597
Can I have a, uh...
can I have a glass of white wine?

339
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,122
- Anything dry.
- Dry.

340
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,395
Thanks.

341
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,604
- Hey, Mel.
- You all right?

342
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,377
- Andy.
- Nice to see you.

343
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,611
Gwen.

344
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,176
(cellphone ringing)

345
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,390
Mum, can you stop...
stop...

346
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,427
Hang on.

347
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,956
Hang on.
I can't hear you.

348
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,628
Just hang on a sec.
Hang on.

349
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,230
(crowd chatting)

350
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,375
Man: That's true.

351
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,405
That's exactly what happens nowadays,
you know?

352
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,649
Hi.

353
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,677
Hey.

354
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,485
- Harvey.
- Jean.

355
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,583
- Harvey, good to see you.
- You too.

356
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,787
- You're looking good.
- Hi.

357
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,889
So our little girl's
getting married.

358
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,833
(chuckles)

359
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,998
Harvey, you remember the Watsons.
Barry and, of course, Jill.

360
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,506
- Jill: Hi.
- Barry.

361
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,599
Harvey.

362
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,271
Boy, I haven't seen you guys
since Jean and I, uh...

363
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,870
You look well.

364
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,508
Thank you.
You look weller.

365
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,812
- (both chuckle)
- Thank you.

366
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,342
- Barry, you too.
- Thanks, Harvey.

367
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,979
It's good to see you.
How's your son?

368
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,616
- Jean: Daughter.
- Jill: Betsy's fine.

369
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,523
Right.

370
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,668
(cellphone ringing)

371
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,805
Sorry.
I got to take this.

372
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,336
Can you hold on, please?

373
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,848
Sorry.

374
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,752
It's gonna take two hours max,
no longer.

375
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,351
Have you told him
it was for me?

376
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,625
Look, we have to go back.
He'll tell you.

377
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,564
Just have him call me, okay?

378
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,829
All right.
I really got to go.

379
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,301
Okay, bye.

380
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,930
(crowd laughing, chatting)

381
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,271
Hi.

382
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,213
Kate, sorry.
I bumped into these guys.

383
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,716
Couldn't shake them.
Everyone, this is Kate.

384
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,480
- That's okay.
- Andrew, Melissa, and Gwyn.

385
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,817
- Gwen.
- Gwen, sorry.

386
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,288
Sorry. I hope we're not barging in
on you.

387
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,416
Kate: No, no.
Not at all. No.

388
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,393
So, how do you two
know each other?

389
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,157
Um, we don't, actually.

390
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:16,293
We've got some friends in common...
Oonagh and Matt.

391
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,635
And Matt came.
And Kate works with Oonagh.

392
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,936
- They had to rush home.
- Bumped into each other.

393
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:23,963
Yes.

394
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,000
- Are you on a blind date?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,911
- No. It's not a blind date.
- (all laughing)

396
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,609
Shall we just leave you to it?
Shall we leave you?

397
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,119
No no no no no.

398
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,789
- I mean...
- (all laugh)

399
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,487
(sighs)

400
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,994
Jeanie, did you move me,
my sweetheart?

401
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,595
- No, darling.
- Dad, I moved you.

402
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,502
I thought it might be easier
if you needed to get up.

403
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,665
Oh, sure.
Okay.

404
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,140
(glass tinkles)

405
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,303
Shall we have a quick toast
just to get things started?

406
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:04,509
I'm going to save my big speech
for tomorrow.

407
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,709
(all laugh)

408
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,515
Dear Susan and dear Scott,

409
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,850
I just want to take us all back

410
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,951
to that wonderful holiday
that we had in Rome together

411
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,962
and wish you salute, eh?

412
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,590
All: Salute!

413
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,759
Because Jean and I
love you both so much,

414
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,329
and we're so happy that Scott
is gonna be part of our clan now.

415
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:31,240
And so, I say, many, many,
many happy, happy years ahead.

416
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,710
- Salute.
- All: Salute!

417
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,714
Uh, my turn.

418
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,013
(cellphone vibrating)

419
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:46,049
I thought it was off.
Sorry.

420
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,519
Um...

421
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,897
To a great couple.

422
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,767
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

423
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,105
- And cheers again!
- Cheers again.

424
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,339
- Let's eat!
- Scott: Yes! Good idea.

425
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,608
(both laugh)

426
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,619
Actually, I'm sorry.
Maybe I should call you dad.

427
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,588
All: Aww!

428
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,163
(no audible dialogue)

429
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,358
Harvey.

430
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,764
Hello, Jean.

431
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,427
Could I have a glass of water,
please?

432
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,099
No ice.

433
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,505
Thank you.

434
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,551
Are you okay?

435
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,644
I'm excellent.

436
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,917
Go a little easy,
okay, Harvey?

437
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,384
Why?

438
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,831
Are you afraid I'm going to
embarrass you again?

439
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,663
No, I'm...

440
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,135
I'm afraid you're gonna
embarrass yourself, Harvey.

441
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,728
(sighs)

442
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,364
We're here for Susan.
This is her weekend.

443
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,807
It's Scott and Susan's weekend.

444
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,911
(laughs)

445
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,107
You're good.
You're still good.

446
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,877
I mean, you've always known

447
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,545
how to make me feel
like a piece of shit in 30 seconds.

448
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,747
Well, you gave me
a lot of practice.

449
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,154
Why'd you marry me?

450
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,795
I was... I was very young,

451
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,324
and you were lots of fun.

452
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,566
And how's Brian?
Is he fun?

453
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,973
He thinks I'm fun.

454
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,207
Harvey, go home now.
Get some sleep, hmm?

455
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,980
Come back,
and see your daughter get married.

456
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,113
Our baby girl's
getting married.

457
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,864
(sighs)

458
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,871
- Hey.
- Hey.

459
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,677
- Susie.
- Dad.

460
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,650
(sighs)

461
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,811
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

462
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,616
- How you doing, huh?
- I'm good.

463
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,213
- You enjoying yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:11,092
That Scott seems like
a very good guy.

465
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,824
He is.

466
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,061
I'm sorry I haven't had a chance
to talk to you.

467
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,591
No no, don't you worry about me.
I'm fine.

468
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,764
This is about you and Scott.
This is your weekend.

469
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,033
- Huh?
- Yeah.

470
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,803
So, how's work?

471
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,744
Oh, it's all right.
It's, uh...

472
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,076
It's just different.

473
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,514
It's sound design now.
It's not music anymore.

474
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,279
It's a business,
so it's computers and digital,

475
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,755
and you just hit a button,
and it's a triangle chime.

476
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,882
- (laughs)
- But it's what it is.

477
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,414
Are you still writing
your own stuff?

478
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,486
Well, when I get home,
I play a little.

479
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,490
(crowd laughs)

480
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,100
So, listen, um...

481
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,371
I'm really sorry to tell you this,

482
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,609
but I have to
get back to New York

483
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:07,277
'cause I have
a really important account waiting.

484
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,912
It's very serious.

485
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:15,449
So I won't be at the reception in the
evening, but I will be at your ceremony.

486
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,860
That's where you're getting married.

487
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,422
I wouldn't miss that.

488
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,263
Okay.

489
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,293
Uh, Dad...

490
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,700
I've been thinking,

491
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,008
and Brian's
been a really big part of my life

492
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,879
for the past few years...

493
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,543
and...

494
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,023
I'm gonna ask him
to give me away tomorrow.

495
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,255
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,905
(Sighs)

497
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,002
Okay.

498
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,446
I want you to go be with your friends, and I
want you to have a good time,

499
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,848
- and I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

500
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,290
(sighs)

501
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,799
(all laugh)

502
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,667
No, but seriously,
I mean, the thing is...

503
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,412
Excuse... sorry.

504
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,283
(breathes deeply)

505
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,286
Harvey: Right here's good, friend.
Thanks. I want to walk.

506
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,293
Excuse me, could you take me
to Wilton Green?

507
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:48,812
By the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

508
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,978
You may kiss the bride.

509
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,012
To Heathrow.

510
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,149
Spirits?
Champagne?

511
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,856
Okay. Excellent.

512
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,169
(horns honking)

513
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,443
Can we go another way?

514
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,206
You're having a laugh,
ain't you?

515
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,644
It'll be bad everywhere.

516
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,678
(both arguing)

517
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,858
Sorry.

518
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,894
I'm sorry.
I have the 1:30 to JFK.

519
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,566
I'm sorry, Sir.
I'm dealing with a passenger.

520
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,041
- I want to go straight to the gate.
- I will answer all your questions,

521
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,102
- but you will have to wait.
- Okay. Ma'am, excuse me.

522
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,273
- I'm on the 1:30 flight to JFK.
- Sir... Sir, there is a queue.

523
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,783
I appreciate that,
but I'm on the 1:30 flight to JFK.

524
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,250
That flight's now closed.

525
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,116
No no no, the plane
doesn't take off for 40 minutes.

526
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,985
Sir, the gate
is already closed.

527
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,115
But all I have is hand luggage.
Please, just let me through.

528
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,422
- Sir, that is not hand luggage.
- What, this?

529
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,453
- Now will you let me on, please?
- No, Sir.

530
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,862
When's the next flight?

531
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,163
(sighs)

532
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,726
The earliest I can get you on for sure is
tomorrow morning.

533
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,204
- Tomorrow?!
- Sir, you're gonna have to stay calm.

534
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,800
Marvin, it's Harvey.
Listen, the traffic was crazy.

535
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,572
I'm gonna have to reschedule slightly.

536
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,340
Come on, Harvey.
The traffic?

537
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,143
- Jesus. Come on.
- Frank can set up.

538
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,649
I'll e-mail them
the queue numbers,

539
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,514
and then I'll be there at lunchtime
at the latest.

540
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,383
I'll come straight
from the airport.

541
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,617
Look, just stay in London, will you? Just
enjoy your daughter's wedding.

542
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,749
No no, Marvin, it's fine.

543
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,452
- There's no problem.
- Harvey.

544
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,361
Frank knows exactly what to do, and Mike
is gonna be right there to help.

545
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,560
- Harvey, we've got to talk.
No no no. No, listen.

546
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,366
I'll be there at lunchtime, Marvin.
It's okay. It's all set up.

547
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,099
- Harvey?
- Yeah? What?

548
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,937
- It's over.
- What?

549
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,704
- What do you mean?
- It's out of my hands.

550
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,612
There's people I got to answer to.
I'm letting you go.

551
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:40,515
We'll talk
when you get back.

552
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,200
Hi.

553
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,226
Can I have a Johnnie Walker,

554
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,363
and if you have a black label,
neat?

555
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,048
Thanks.

556
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,317
Another, please.

557
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,916
It's okay.
Thank you.

558
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,733
- Aw, shit!
- (woman murmurs)

559
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,293
Sorry.
Vulgar American.

560
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,710
How you doing?

561
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,418
I'm sorry, by the way.

562
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,356
For what?

563
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,757
Weren't you the gal who tried to
ask me some questions,

564
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,284
and you were just doing your job,
and I was rude?

565
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,763
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:05,292
I don't remember, really,
but you probably were.

567
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,861
Most people are.

568
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,897
Hmm.

569
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,705
Good book?

570
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,938
Would be
if I could finish it.

571
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,537
Ooh!

572
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,009
(laughs)

573
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,579
- That'll help.
- What?

574
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,454
I said, "That'll help."

575
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,426
- What? This?
- Mm.

576
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,451
Oh, yes it will,
and it is.

577
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,361
Right.

578
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,397
It'll help as much as that trashy novel and a
glass of Chardonnay.

579
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,667
(sighs)

580
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,609
Sorry.

581
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,809
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,748
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

583
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,551
Go away!
Stop apologizing.

584
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,058
It's just that I've had
a really shitty day.

585
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,424
Join the club.

586
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,828
Oh no, yours may have been shitty,
but mine was shittier.

587
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:10,527
Mine was major shitty, you know?
Huh?

588
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,437
How shitty?

589
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,046
I missed the plane, I
lost my job,

590
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,208
and my daughter,
who's getting married today,

591
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,984
decided that she wanted her stepfather
rather than me to give her away, okay?

592
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,957
And that took it
to major shitty.

593
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,358
Fair enough.
You win.

594
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,659
What do you say,
let me make it up to both of us,

595
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,500
and I'll buy you lunch?

596
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,367
Or tea. How about tea,
if it's teatime?

597
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,175
Thanks very much, but I don't know you,
and you don't know me, so...

598
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,704
That's exactly why
we should have tea together.

599
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,512
It's very sweet of you,
but thank you. No.

600
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,851
- Well, you've got your book.
- Mm.

601
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,889
(cellphone ringing)

602
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,054
If that's for me,
I'm in the shower.

603
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,163
Aren't you gonna answer it?

604
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,002
No.

605
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,410
Should I take that
as a hopeful sign?

606
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:33,179
If it is, you can give me
a little wider smile.

607
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,622
(sighs)

608
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,744
Thank you.

609
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,044
See?

610
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,709
We're having lunch together.

611
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,912
No, we're having lunch
next to each other.

612
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,080
Ah.

613
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,523
By the way,
Harvey... Harvey Shine.

614
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,361
Kate Walker.

615
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,954
So, why aren't you
at the wedding?

616
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,362
(vacuum whirring)

617
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,203
I knew there was something
that was missing.

618
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,398
I had to get back for work.

619
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,770
What, for the job
you just lost?

620
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,867
(chuckles)
Yes, exactly.

621
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,210
Did you enjoy it,
the job?

622
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,148
Yes. No.

623
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,912
Yes, originally.

624
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,077
What was it?

625
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,151
I write jingles.

626
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,059
- Wow.
- That's a normal response.

627
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,723
(chuckles) Did you always want to write
jingles, or was...

628
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,062
was there something more?

629
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,227
(laughs)

630
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,531
What?

631
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,504
No no, I love it.

632
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,804
You cut right through it.
I like that.

633
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,107
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- You should.

634
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,945
I would have given anything...

635
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,113
to have been a jazz pianist.

636
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,147
Were you good?

637
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,794
No. Not good enough.

638
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:32,965
Sorry.
I... can be a bit nosy.

639
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,138
Yeah, and I like it.

640
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,267
- Do you believe me?
- Mm.

641
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,842
I have to tell you that
is a relief to find someone

642
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,751
who actually says what they're feeling and
what they're thinking.

643
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,018
Especially in a place
that's supposed to be...

644
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:57,221
you know...
Britain, English, reserved.

645
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,389
Oh, no no. Haven't you heard?
We're a nation changed.

646
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,800
Ever since Diana died, we're all sort of
flowing out of us like water.

647
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,303
You guys showed us the way,
actually.

648
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,067
No more
stiff upper lip for us.

649
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,573
And what is that, exactly?

650
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,473
- What?
- "Stiff upper lip."

651
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,712
I'm not sure,
it's kind of...

652
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,739
that whole clenched thing.

653
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,082
- Clenched?
- I think so, you know.

654
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,054
See, when you cry,
your lips wobble,

655
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,080
and when you're being strong,
they don't.

656
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,752
Like this.

657
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,262
No, that's sort of
more like a bulldog.

658
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,891
No, don't do that. You look like
you've got no teeth at all.

659
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,562
It's my first attempt
at a stiff upper lip.

660
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,002
- Who does...
- I don't really kn...

661
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,972
I think it's the sort of tension
in your jaw.

662
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,338
Who does that?

663
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,070
- Aristocrats.
- The aristocrats?

664
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,737
Posh people.

665
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,947
- Thank you. I enjoyed that.
- Me too. Where are you going?

666
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,980
- I'm just going to a class, actually.
- What kind of class?

667
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,390
- Writing.
- Ah.

668
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,758
It's just a thing,
twice a week, I do.

669
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,127
I've got to get the Heathrow Express,
actually, so...

670
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,791
- I see.
- What about you?

671
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,961
I don't know. I guess I'll stay
in a hotel near here.

672
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,061
- I have a flight in the morning.
- Oh, so it's... yeah.

673
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,935
- Okay.
- Bye-bye, then.

674
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,235
- Bye.
- Good luck.

675
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,174
- (cellphone ringing)
- There's your phone again.

676
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,199
(both chuckle)

677
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,143
Hello?

678
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,775
Yes.

679
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,048
Harvey: Sorry. I'm sorry.

680
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,250
Sorry.

681
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,263
Hi.

682
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,598
Sorry.

683
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,298
The thought of staying at a hotel
near the runway unnerved me.

684
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,306
(chuckles)

685
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,173
- Do you mind?
- No no no.

686
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,178
Excuse me.

687
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,039
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

688
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,074
You ran.

689
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,180
Well, I wish you'd been on the car
four cars down.

690
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,819
So...

691
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,661
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

692
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:51,964
- Where we going?
- Um, Paddington.

693
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,333
Oh.

694
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,472
So, here's the taxi rank.

695
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,915
I suppose it's bye-bye again.

696
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,316
Oh.
(chuckles)

697
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,082
They'll take you to wherever
you want to go... any hotel.

698
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,249
You mean instead of me
walking you to your class?

699
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,960
Carry your books.
I'll throw that in.

700
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,699
Sure.

701
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,192
Is that a "yes"?

702
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,931
Yes.

703
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,234
Why not?

704
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,169
In which case, we um...
we have to go...

705
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,734
we have to go back this way.

706
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,372
You mind
if I just drop these off?

707
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,348
Sure.

708
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,867
(laughs)

709
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,645
It's like " Yours is a glorious country,
Honeychurch!"

710
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,672
Know that? Line from a book.
"Room with a View."

711
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,708
Ah. E.M. Forster.

712
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,721
- Mm-hmm. Have you read it?
- No.

713
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,780
(laughs)

714
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,621
- Do you think less of me?
- No no, not at all.

715
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,458
It's just... I think
we're just very different.

716
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,259
Probably.

717
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,130
- Is that bad?
- No.

718
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,294
I don't think so either.

719
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,600
- (cellphone ringing)
- Hang on. Sorry.

720
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,000
- Oh, sorry. I should get this.
- Go ahead.

721
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,408
Hello, Mum? Hello.

722
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,844
Sorry. I've been busy.

723
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,643
Yeah.

724
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,674
No. I'm out, actually.

725
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,585
Yes yes, with someone.

726
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,987
No, with someone else.

727
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,253
Yes, a man.

728
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,661
Oh, you did, did you?

729
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,694
What,
an actual body?

730
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,396
Okay, listen.

731
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,410
Listen, I'll come
in early tomorrow morning,

732
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,537
and we'll check it out together,
all right?

733
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,945
All right. All right.

734
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,108
Bye-bye. Bye.

735
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,549
Yeah, I love you, too.
Bye. Bye.

736
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,213
- Sorry. My mum.
- She worries about you?

737
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,518
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

738
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,024
Well, about herself, actually.

739
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,549
She's convinced
she's living next to Poland's answer to,

740
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,290
- I don't know, Jack the Ripper.
- Oh.

741
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,025
Do you live with her?

742
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,090
Oh no. No no no.
God, no.

743
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,295
- (laughs)
- Near, not with.

744
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,361
She's all right.
She means well.

745
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,839
She just had
a really rough ride of it is all.

746
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,034
Why?

747
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:49,307
Oh, well, my dad ran off to France
with his secretary,

748
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:53,146
and then, about four years ago, she got
cancer, but she's completely recovered.

749
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,980
She's fine.
She just doesn't want to admit it.

750
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,212
You know.

751
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,687
So...

752
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,919
she's bored is what I think it is,

753
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,928
so she's made my situation,

754
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,592
which is what she calls me
"being single," her major distraction.

755
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,658
It's like a sort of hobby for her,
if you like.

756
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,192
I see.

757
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,996
Sorry.

758
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,530
- What?
- No. I was just...

759
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,738
- I was just talking too much.
- No no, you're not.

760
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,043
- No, I am.
- No, you're not.

761
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,776
Anyway, we're here.
This is my class.

762
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,856
(sighs)
So, how long is your class?

763
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,324
An hour.

764
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,291
I can... I can wait.

765
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,866
Well, it's getting cold.
You don't want to wait, do you?

766
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,529
Not that cold.

767
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,334
(clock chiming)

768
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,273
Okay.

769
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,276
Careful.

770
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,307
I might get
the wrong impression.

771
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,890
(doorbell rings)

772
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,560
(doorbell rings)

773
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,535
So, uh, how did it go?

774
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,094
Well, the usual.

775
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:31,801
Lovely, mild-mannered Mike
gave us the latest installment

776
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,174
from his psychosexual thriller.

777
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,042
He's 86.

778
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,474
Shall we keep walking?

779
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,816
Okay.

780
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,845
It's nice.
It's nice today.

781
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:51,260
Do you ever wish you could just live
a different life just for a day

782
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,785
just to see
what it would be like?

783
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,127
Do you have an idea
what yours would be?

784
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,632
Mine?

785
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:02,628
I think it would take place in Spain...
definitely...

786
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,005
in a little house, inland.

787
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,340
- And what would you do?
- Write a book.

788
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,672
I mean, you know,
not "Middlemarch" or anything.

789
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,307
- George Eliot.
- Yeah. Have you read it?

790
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,841
No.

791
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,251
So, your book...

792
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:22,020
Would be just a
really good holiday read,

793
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,651
you know,
for the beach or a plane.

794
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,161
I've got one of those inside me.

795
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,163
And this house that you'd live in...
- Cabana.

796
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,459
- Cabana.
- Yeah. Please.

797
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,295
Sorry...
that you'd write in,

798
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,995
would it have a view?

799
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,027
Yes, across the plains,

800
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:39,441
with a little stream running around it
to bathe in.

801
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,205
- Bathe in?
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,303
- No showers?
- No.

803
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,111
Rustic.

804
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,780
Okay okay okay.
I'll adjust.

805
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,314
I'm there, only if you're
receiving guests, that is.

806
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,396
Sure.

807
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,264
You may visit,
Harvey Shine.

808
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,565
Well, thank you,
Kate Walker.

809
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,036
(Rockabilly music plays)

810
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,868
# I'm a guy
that likes his fun #

811
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,498
# When I fight,
you'd better run #

812
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,671
# I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun #

813
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,407
# I'm going down
to the middle of town #

814
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,210
# I'm gonna shoot
that first man down #

815
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,912
- (no audible dialogue)
- # I'm a mean, mean son of a gun #

816
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:26,719
# My skin's hard as leather,
I'm as tough as any man #

817
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,488
# When I have to shave myself,
I use an old tin can #

818
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,224
# I wash my face in boiling wax,
scrub myself with a gunnysack #

819
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:38,098
# I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun #

820
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,536
# I'm mean,
I'm mean, I'm mean #

821
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,029
# I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun... #

822
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,044
(no audible dialogue)

823
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,274
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

824
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,575
What happened between you
and your daughter?

825
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,207
Uh, I don't know.

826
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,342
(sighs)

827
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,718
Somewhere along the way,
I just lost her.

828
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,386
I woke up one morning,
and I...

829
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,829
I realized...

830
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,131
that I didn't belong
in that house.

831
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,235
You know, I always had this feeling
in my stomach...

832
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,573
(sighs)

833
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,205
that they were
a bit embarrassed by me.

834
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:11,525
I mean, if you see them now with Brian, my
daughter's stepfather,

835
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,962
you know, they just...
it just makes more sense.

836
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,057
I mean, they really look right
together.

837
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,339
And I was not
a great father.

838
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,916
Is the wedding reception
still going on?

839
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,355
I don't know.

840
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,094
Am I still on New York time?
What time is it?

841
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,530
About 7:00.
Where is it on?

842
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,796
Grosvenor House.

843
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,325
Well, you have to go.

844
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,564
- No no no no no.
- Yes, you do.

845
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,593
No.

846
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,504
No, Harvey.
It's ridiculous you're not there.

847
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,441
- You have to go.
- They really don't want me.

848
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,344
Harvey, she's your daughter,
and you're her father. You have to go.

849
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,810
Harvey, I really mean it.
It's absolutely unforgivable.

850
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,410
You have to go.

851
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,252
- Come on.
- I'm thinking.

852
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,759
You come with me.

853
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,988
No. I...

854
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,691
I can't go
to a wedding reception in...

855
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,427
bloody green polyester.

856
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,163
Are you trying to get me
to buy you a new dress?

857
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,229
- Is that what this is all about?
- No.

858
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,069
- It is! Yes, it is!
- No, it's not.

859
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,598
- I'm not coming.
- Come as my bodyguard.

860
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,702
- No. No.
- Come as my friend?

861
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,873
(clock chiming)

862
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,124
Okay.

863
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:57,161
I am not spending
more than 200 on that frock.

864
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,862
- Is it a deal?
- Yes. Yes.

865
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,872
# I'm a guy
that likes his fun #

866
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,703
# And when I fight,

867
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,768
# I'm a mean, mean, mean

868
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,575
# I'm going down

869
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,479
# I'm going to shoot

875
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,494
# I'm mean,
I'm mean, I'm mean #

876
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:39,030
# I'm a mean, mean,
mean son of a gun #

877
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:43,341
# I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun. #

878
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,871
Oh.

879
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,110
Where was it?

880
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,881
Hello.

881
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,952
(elevator bell dings)

882
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,792
(sighs)

883
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,094
(doors open)

884
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,003
(people chatting)

885
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:36,090
- My ex-wife just clocked you.
- Did she?

886
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,327
Huh? Oh.

887
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,892
- You should go say hi.
- Okay.

888
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,897
Here comes my daughter.

889
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,067
- Hi.
- Hi.

890
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,076
- I didn't go.
- I'm glad.

891
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,842
Uh, this is, uh, Kate.

892
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,315
- Oh, hello.
- A friend.

893
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,978
How do you do?
Congratulations.

894
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,044
You look fantastic.

895
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,112
Thank you.

896
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,623
I'm so sorry
I've gate-crashed, actually.

897
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,387
- No, she...
- But it was your father.

898
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,018
He insisted.

899
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,757
No no. It's fine.
I'm sure there's room.

900
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,527
No no no no.
We'll just fit in wherever.

901
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,296
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?

902
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,429
- Could you find them a seat?
- Sure.

903
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,340
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have
your attention, please?

904
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,606
It's time now
for the best-man speech.

905
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,112
Oh. Except we seem to be
missing the bride.

906
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,412
You may have seen her...
dark hair, white dress.

907
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,884
Oh, there she is.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

908
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:33,855
Without further ado,
our best man, Pete Turner.

909
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,691
- Pete: Thank you, Josh.
- Hi.

910
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,425
And thank you, Jean and Brian,
for such a beautiful occasion and for...

911
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,558
You do know
this is the children's table.

912
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,865
Yes.

913
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,701
I'm gonna need to take you
back to the early '90s,

914
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,230
when a tall,
far-too-cheerful Chicago man...

915
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,301
- Kate: Hello.
...walked into my room at Duke...

916
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:58,678
- Bit of a chatterbox.
- Mm.

917
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,704
(sighs)

918
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,241
And finally, I'd like to
propose a toast to Susan

919
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,254
for making
my friend Scott complete.

920
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,381
All: To Susan!

921
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,949
Cheers.

922
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,336
Ladies and gentlemen, it's now time
for the father of the bride

923
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,204
to say a few words.

924
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,004
Tonight, that enviable task

925
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:32,174
will fall to the ever-charming,
ever-distinguished Brian,

926
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,012
ladies and gentlemen.

927
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:45,285
Well, that was
quite some speech, Peter...

928
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,922
quite something to follow.

929
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,593
- But I will try.
- (glass tinkles)

930
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,899
- Brian.
- Yes, Harvey?

931
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,599
Excuse me for interrupting.

932
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,632
I think he said
"father of the bride."

933
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,975
Ah, yes.

934
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,405
May I?

935
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,645
Go... go ahead, Harvey.

936
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,351
Hi, everybody.

937
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,259
Um...

938
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,288
I think there's something

939
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:28,236
that Jean and I learned
from our failed marriage,

940
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:34,699
and that is that it's the children
of divorce that suffer the most,

941
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:39,772
and the child of Jean and Harvey Shine has
had her share

942
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:43,308
of pain and disappointment, but...

943
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,949
and this is a tribute to you, Susan... it has
served her well

944
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:52,360
because she's somehow
separated herself

945
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:56,798
from the fracture
of her birth family

946
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:03,932
to become a strong and determined
and independent woman.

947
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,804
And yet...

948
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:10,302
you've kept your sensitivity
and your vulnerability

949
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,440
and your loveliness...

950
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,384
and you look
quite beautiful tonight.

951
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,529
Um...

952
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,328
(sighs)

953
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,334
- Scott?
- Hey.

954
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,928
You're a lucky guy,
and I'm a lucky guy

955
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,634
because I'm looking forward
to you being my son.

956
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:43,676
You are my son-in-law.
(laughs)

957
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,305
I've never had a son.

958
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,747
Okay.

959
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,775
Well, no pressure,
but, Jean,

960
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,687
I look forward to grandparenting
with you,

961
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,918
but that's no pressure, Scott.

962
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,017
(crowd chuckles)

963
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,364
I toast you, Scott.

964
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,861
I toast your wife...

965
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,006
my daughter.

966
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,271
I toast our family.

967
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,838
And if I can just linger
a moment longer,

968
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:24,513
I'd like to hand this back to you, Brian, with
a note of gratitude.

969
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:30,119
Thanks for being there.

970
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:41,434
I would like to ask you all to please stand
up and join Harvey and I

971
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:46,135
in a toast to the bride and the groom... to
Susan and to Scott.

972
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,078
Susan and Scott!

973
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,889
# Baby, I'm yours #

974
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:05,823
# Baby, I'm yours #

975
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,456
# And I'll be yours #

976
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:17,133
# Until the stars
fall from the sky #

977
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:24,170
# Yours until the rivers
all run dry #

978
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:30,448
# In other words, until I die #

979
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:34,047
# Baby, I'm yours #

980
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,990
Harvey. Harvey.

981
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:45,866
# And I'll be yours
until the sun no longer shines #

982
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,569
- Hi.
- Hi.

983
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,007
- Don't cry.
- I won't.

984
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,906
Oh, Susan.

985
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,507
Oh, thanks for coming back,
Dad.

986
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,653
Thanks for having me back.

987
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:13,185
# Do my best to keep you satisfied #

988
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:17,188
# Nothing in the world
can drive me away #

989
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,133
Huh? Ready?

990
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,795
Whoo!

991
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,826
(laughter)

992
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,499
(disco music plays)

993
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,787
# Hold it #

994
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,722
# Hold it #

995
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,818
# Don't let go #

996
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,829
# Baby #

997
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,730
# Baby #

998
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:54,226
# Not too slow #

999
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,675
# Higher #

1000
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,621
# Higher #

1001
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,819
# Make me know #

1002
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:21,592
# Move it faster #

1003
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,896
# Don't let go #

1004
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:43,118
# Don't let go, don't let go,
don't let go #

1005
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,300
(jazz piano ballad plays)

1006
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,335
(ballad ends)

1007
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,862
Is that one of yours?

1008
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,135
Yes.

1009
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,370
It's lovely.

1010
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,673
(inhales sharply)

1011
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,208
Don't go.

1012
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,746
Okay.

1013
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:05,316
- We have to hurry.
- Why?

1014
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,194
Because I'm gonna dance
your socks off.

1015
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,667
(dance music plays)

1016
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,231
Bye! Bye! Bye!

1017
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,928
Okay!
Oh, the bouquet!

1018
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,941
Three, two, one!

1019
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,103
- (crowd cheers)
- Yay!

1020
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,806
Have a great time.

1021
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,342
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry! Bye-bye!

1022
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,854
Bye!

1023
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,448
- Good luck.
- Thank you, and thank you.

1024
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,490
Crowd: Bye!

1025
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,497
Bye.

1026
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,503
(engine starts)

1027
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:40,251
- You all right?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

1028
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,622
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Sure.

1029
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,590
Excuse me.

1030
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,835
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1031
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,734
- Why?
- "Why"?

1032
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,329
Well, you did
about five different dances.

1033
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,001
No, no. I mean, why is it called " cutting a
rug"?

1034
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,610
I love these fountains.

1035
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,877
Children play in them
in the summer.

1036
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,714
They sort of sit on them.
(chuckles)

1037
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,744
They sit their little bottoms down,
and then they get tickled by the water.

1038
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,483
They love it.

1039
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,496
I don't think
I've stayed up all night...

1040
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,966
since I was a student.

1041
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,102
You got sad.

1042
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,908
Why?

1043
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,618
I was pregnant once.

1044
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,954
Didn't have it.
I mean...

1045
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,591
I didn't think twice about it.

1046
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,098
That's what smart girls did.

1047
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,693
Yeah.

1048
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,629
I do...

1049
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,436
I do sometimes wonder,
you know, wh...

1050
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:15,311
whether they would be funny
or clever or...

1051
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,413
Oh, I don't know...

1052
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:22,719
neurotic.

1053
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,852
Stupid, really.

1054
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,122
I don't know why
I told you that.

1055
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,236
Meet me here tomorrow, okay?

1056
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,000
What?

1057
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:45,844
Right here,
right in this spot, noon.

1058
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,405
Okay?

1059
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:51,146
What about your flight?

1060
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,190
I don't have to go.

1061
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,354
Why?

1062
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,567
Oh, shut up, Harvey.

1063
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,800
Stop it.

1064
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,377
You think that now,
you wait till tomorrow.

1065
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,546
Today is tomorrow.

1066
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,185
Harvey.

1067
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,991
We don't know anything
about each other.

1068
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,021
(chuckles)
You're, you know...

1069
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,057
- Old.
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

1070
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:41,501
Well, okay, you're a bit older.

1071
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,129
I'm...

1072
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:46,039
(sighs)

1073
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,975
I can be mean.

1074
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,104
So can I.

1075
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:55,310
No. Truly cantankerous.

1076
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,846
Cantankerous, I've never been.

1077
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,253
(laughs)

1078
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,424
I should be going.

1079
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,630
I'm very serious.

1080
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:16,195
I'll be here waiting at noon,
okay?

1081
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:19,805
(sighs)

1082
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,935
Okay?

1083
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,636
Harvey Shine.

1084
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,716
Tell me what time!

1085
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,275
Noon!

1086
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,254
I can't hear you!

1087
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:09,314
Noon!

1088
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,724
(laughs)

1089
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,820
Top o' the morning
to you, Sir.

1090
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,389
I'm afraid they're both out of order, Mr.
Shine.

1091
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,957
If you wouldn't mind
using the stairs.

1092
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,468
I wouldn't mind at all.

1093
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,199
(humming)

1094
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,503
(whistling)

1095
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,279
Whew!

1096
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,426
(grunting)

1097
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,986
(panting)

1098
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,760
(footsteps approach)

1099
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,896
- Are you okay, Sir?
- Huh?

1100
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,098
What's the problem?
Are you okay?

1101
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,734
- Uh.
- Can you...

1102
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,975
I'm gonna bring you a doctor.
Just wait here, please.

1103
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,174
Shit.

1104
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,615
Hey.

1105
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,017
Hey!

1106
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,180
Hey!

1107
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,551
- Morning, James.
- Morning, Kate.

1108
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:54,721
- You all right?
- Ooh!

1109
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:58,290
Actually, can I have, um,
can I have some grapes?

1110
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,994
I've got some lovely
seedless grapes today.

1111
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,094
All right, then. Give us a little
bunch... three quids worth.

1112
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,764
- Okeydoke.
- That'll do me.

1113
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,068
Thank you.

1114
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,905
Man: Clutching his chest?
Yeah?

1115
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,036
All right.

1116
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,222
Sir, you said that you've been
drinking more coffee than usual.

1117
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,227
- Yes, but I have to be somewhere.
- And you're under stress.

1118
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,661
- You haven't been sleeping well.
- Yes, but I already told the nurse.

1119
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,495
Please, I've been up all night, I'm under
stress, but I have an appointment.

1120
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,763
Okay, sir, try and calm down.
I just need you to stay tonight.

1121
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,099
I have to be somewhere.

1122
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,581
It looks to me like arrhythmia,
which is an irregular heartbeat.

1123
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,950
Yes. I told the nurse
it's called SVT's.

1124
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,286
I've had it since I was a kid, and I left my
medication in New York,

1125
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,792
so if you can just make me out
a prescription for Digoxin.

1126
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,886
Digoxin, yeah. That's right.
We can do that, no problem.

1127
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,056
First, I just need to rule out
all other possibilities.

1128
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,690
No, no. It's arrhythmia.
Please, Doctor.

1129
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,792
- I have an appointment.
- I'm 99% sure it is arrhythmia.

1130
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,334
Nurse, can you do a 12-lead ECG
and send for tests troponin?

1131
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,737
You can't keep me here.

1132
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,707
No. You cannot keep me here.

1133
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,676
Also a thyroid function, please.
Thank you.

1134
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,975
And can you arrange a monitor bed
for him for tonight?

1135
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,920
Okay, Mama. It's me. Done.
I've got to get to work.

1136
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,524
Why don't you stay
and have some lunch?

1137
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,160
I can't.
I've got to go.

1138
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,568
Not to pry or anything,

1139
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:20,041
but why is there a large smoked ham under
the stairs?

1140
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,599
Oh, that. Yes.

1141
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,305
It's, um...
The neighbor gave it to me.

1142
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,644
The Polish neighbor?

1143
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,515
So, probably not
a mass murderer.

1144
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,349
Probably not.

1145
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:33,684
(chuckles)

1146
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,452
Are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

1147
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,427
Yeah. Of course I will.
I'll be fine.

1148
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,191
Men. Who needs them?

1149
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,391
Remember, we've got Greece
to look forward to.

1150
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,526
Yeah.

1151
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,735
Got lipstick on your face.
See you.

1152
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,834
- Morning, Kate.
- Morning, Paddy.

1153
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,812
- Lovely as ever.
- Thank you.

1154
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,421
Right.

1155
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,829
Right.

1156
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:19,129
Okay, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

1157
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,759
Thank you.

1158
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,798
(phone ringing)

1159
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,834
(sighs)

1160
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,641
Hello. PSA.
Heathrow branch.

1161
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,672
Hello.
Is there a Kate Walker there?

1162
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,241
- It's Harvey.
- Hold on.

1163
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,186
Kate, it's for you.
Some guy called Harvey.

1164
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,191
I'm sorry,
she's, uh, not here.

1165
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,461
Please, this is important.

1166
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,601
Kate!

1167
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,471
I'm sorry.
She's busy.

1168
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,033
She won't come.

1169
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,602
Okay, thanks.

1170
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:11,447
Sir, if I can get you
to sign here.

1171
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,386
Sure.

1172
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:17,389
- (cellphone ringing)
- Thank you.

1173
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:22,021
Hello?

1174
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:25,625
Hey, Harvey. It's Marvin.
Where are you?

1175
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,862
I'm still in London, Marvin.

1176
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:31,031
Well, you get yourself back here,
my friend.

1177
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,701
I got some great news.
You were right.

1178
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,768
The Samuelson account,
none of the kids could handle it.

1179
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,177
They couldn't nail it.

1180
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,647
They ended up picking
one of your old tunes.

1181
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,775
They want you to come back
and update it.

1182
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:47,050
We need you back, Harvey.
Your old room's here waiting for you.

1183
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,422
Harvey?

1184
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:53,553
- Oh, well, that's great, Marvin.
- Yeah. Yeah. It's great.

1185
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,620
Look, I know
when to eat humble pie.

1186
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,633
So, hey, when can you
get back here?

1187
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,895
Harvey?

1188
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,397
I'm not coming back.

1189
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,303
What?

1190
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,274
I quit.

1191
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,368
What do you mean you quit,
Harvey?

1192
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,844
Look, man, you need us.

1193
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:14,280
No. You know, I don't.

1194
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,683
As you said, it's my last chance.
Look, I got to go.

1195
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,681
Taxi!

1196
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,491
Taxi, Heathrow.
I'm in a hurry.

1197
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:52,948
- Hi.
- Hi.

1198
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,081
I'm looking for Kate Walker.
Kate.

1199
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,351
Who wants to know?

1200
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,757
A friend.

1201
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,891
Oonagh, there's a man out here
asking for Kate.

1202
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,695
- He says "a friend."
- Yes.

1203
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,601
- Friend?
- Well, more than a friend.

1204
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:12,164
- More than a friend?
- Yes.

1205
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:16,109
- Are you the American?
- Yes, that's right.

1206
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,375
She likes you.
I can tell.

1207
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:23,111
Don't you go messing her around, now.
Don't you hurt her.

1208
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,449
Oh, I won't.
I wouldn't.

1209
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:29,389
She's not here.
She's left for the day.

1210
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:32,587
You might still find her
at her class.

1211
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,254
In fact, it starts about now.

1212
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,457
It's down at the South Bank.
Called the National.

1213
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,693
- Yes, I know.
- Oh, you know, do you?

1214
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,633
- Yes.
- Go on. Go and get her.

1215
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,972
See you, Harvey.

1216
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:52,571
"The blood oozes from his wound like dark
chocolate on a warm summer's day.

1217
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:55,242
He could still smell her on his glove...

1218
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:59,049
that deep, penetrating smell of sex.

1219
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:03,717
It was silent, but with the faint sound of
dripping sweat.

1220
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:07,319
Salt was the taste
that he remembered most...

1221
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:11,196
so salubrious, so sensual,

1222
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,463
so sexy."

1223
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,433
- (applause)
- Oh, thank you.

1224
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,477
Here you go.

1225
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,332
(laughs)

1226
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,702
(clock chiming)

1227
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,112
- Hey.
- Hi.

1228
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,676
You still here,
still in London?

1229
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,347
Sure.

1230
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,289
- Can I explain?
- No no.

1231
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,295
- You don't need to explain, Harvey.
- I want to.

1232
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,058
- No, honestly. I don't need to...
- Kate, please.

1233
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,032
- I was in a hospital.
- Oh, God. Why?

1234
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:21,399
No. It's nothing.
I left my pills in New York.

1235
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,336
I have this irregular heartbeat.

1236
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,669
- I had it since I was a kid.
- Arrhythmia.

1237
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:30,110
- How do you know what it is?
- 'Cause my father has it.

1238
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,739
Well, young men get it, too.

1239
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,749
(laughs)

1240
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:38,116
Aw, Kate, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there.

1241
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,916
- Oh, it's fine, Harvey.
- No.

1242
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,288
I had a lovely time, Harvey,
and I like you... I really do.

1243
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,792
Thank you.

1244
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:47,693
But, you know, I don't really do fountains
at noon either.

1245
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,162
I mean, I live in...

1246
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,392
Well, I live in Wilton Green,
and you live in wherever you...

1247
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,697
- I live in White Plains.
- Exactly.

1248
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:58,172
And Monday morning, life kicks in,
and we're not teenagers.

1249
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,369
Got a life and our jobs and our family
and everything, and I had a lovely time.

1250
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,674
- I won't forget it. Thank you. But...
- What?

1251
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,944
- Well, it's not, you know, real life.
- It is.

1252
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,382
- No, it isn't, Harvey.
- It is.

1253
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:13,854
- No, it's not, Harvey.
- No. It is real life.

1254
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,413
- It's real life for me.
- No, no. I know. I know.

1255
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,053
But it's not just about you, is it?
It's about me, as well.

1256
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,826
You don't know anything about me.
Look at me. I mean, it's pathetic.

1257
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:26,095
I actually expected you
not to show.

1258
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,661
In fact, I think I actually almost wanted you
not to show

1259
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:32,070
because it's just sort of easier
that way.

1260
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,405
You know,
you just dive in there.

1261
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,672
You just whoosh anywhere.
It's the deep end,

1262
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:41,080
and I'm not a bloody swimming pool,
Harvey, and I'm not...

1263
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,016
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it.

1264
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,575
I'm not gonna do it
because it'll hurt.

1265
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,678
Sometime or other, there will be...

1266
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:50,748
you know, it's not working,
or I need my space, or whatever it is,

1267
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,589
and it will end, and it will hurt,
and I won't do it.

1268
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:53,958
I won't do it,
and I won't...

1269
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:55,986
(sobbing)

1270
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:25,887
(bicycle bells jingling)

1271
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,390
You see,
what I think it is, is...

1272
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:05,160
is I think I'm more comfortable
with being disappointed.

1273
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,898
I think I'm angry with you
for trying to take that away.

1274
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,110
(cellphone ringing)

1275
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:34,161
Mum, I love you,
but not now.

1276
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:42,798
Should I take that
as a hopeful sign?

1277
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,440
If you give me
just a little wider smile.

1278
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,779
(laughs)
Oh, shut up, Harvey.

1279
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:06,090
So how's this going to work,
Mr. Shine?

1280
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:10,120
I have absolutely no idea.

1281
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,398
But it will.

1282
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,768
I promise you that.

1283
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:25,906
Shall we walk?

1284
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,850
Yes.

1285
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,901
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1286
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,641
Hang on a sec.

1287
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,946
Oh. (sighs)

1288
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,618
That's better.

1289
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,651
I think
you're my kind of girl.

1290
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,493
(chuckles)

1291
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,631
Why don't you ask me
those questions?

1292
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,796
Which ones?

1293
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:26,102
You know, at the airport,
when I avoided you.

1294
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,040
- Oh, the questionnaire.
- Yes.

1295
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,568
Oh, okay. Name?

1296
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,308
Harvey Shine.

1297
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:35,782
Place of residence?

1298
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,285
I'm in transition.

1299
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:12,447
# Where do we go from here? #

1300
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:16,116
# Where can we hide? #

1301
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:23,654
# 'Cause I made a U-turn,
and I'm still alive #

1302
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:27,657
# Where do we go from here? #

1303
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:31,194
# And where did they put
the signs? #

1304
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,800
# 'Cause I need an exit #

1305
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:38,801
# After this life #

1306
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:42,748
# And where is
this better place? #

1307
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:46,379
# And where are
these better times? #

1308
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:50,050
(doorbell rings)

1309
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:53,549
# And we cannot find #

1310
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,823
- Hi.
- Hello.

1311
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:03,599
I wanted to say thank you
for the ham,

1312
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:07,699
and sorry for taking so long
to say thank you.

1313
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,266
You're welcome.

1314
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,335
- It's smoked.
- Yes.

1315
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:15,906
- Please, come in.
- Oh, no. I can't. I shouldn't.

1316
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,817
- I have to...
- Please.

1317
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:24,319
Perhaps, um...

1318
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,817
Perhaps you could just show me
how to cut it.

1319
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,831
Absolutely.
Please, come in.

1320
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:38,269
# I've got my foot down,
it's too slow #

1321
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:48,440
# Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo #

1322
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:50,383
# Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo #

1323
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:53,182
# Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah #

1324
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:57,885
# Can you hear me
calling out? #

1325
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:02,089
# Look how much fun
we had #

1326
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,896
# And now
it's all turning bad #

1327
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:10,302
# I've got my foot down,
it's too slow #

1328
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:17,339
# Look how much fun
we had #

1329
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:21,109
# Now it's all turning bad #

1330
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:25,381
# I've got my foot down,
it's too slow #

1331
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:32,519
# Look how much fun
we had #

1332
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,291
# Now it's all turning bad #

1333
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:40,960
# I've got my foot down,
it's too slow #

1334
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:44,335
# You should know. #

1335
01:31:44,336 --> 01:31:45,336
