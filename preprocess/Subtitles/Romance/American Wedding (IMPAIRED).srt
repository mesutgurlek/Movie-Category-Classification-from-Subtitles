In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

772
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:54,490
First of all,
what-what you're feeling is so normal
and perfectly natural.

773
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:59,462
Marriage is not about, uh,
animal lusting and-and kinky sex games.

774
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:04,160
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

775
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,169
It's-It's deeper than that.

776
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:09,172
The longer a marriage lasts,

777
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,174
uh, the longer you can go,

778
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:13,176
uh, without sex.

779
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:16,714
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

780
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:18,715
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

781
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:20,842
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

782
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,045
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

783
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:26,647
Uh, and I mean that
in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

784
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:29,283
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh...

<i>This bed is on fire</i>
<i>with passionate love </i>

1760
01:38:15,318 --> 01:38:19,186
<i>The neighbors complain</i>
<i>about the noises above </i>

1761
01:38:19,288 --> 01:38:23,725
<i>But she only comes</i>
<i>when she's on top </i>

1762
01:38:27,463 --> 01:38:30,762
<i>My therapist said</i>
<i>not to see you no more </i>

1763
01:38:30,866 --> 01:38:34,632
<i>She said you're like a disease</i>
<i>without any cure </i>

1764
01:38:34,737 --> 01:38:38,764
<i>She said I'm so obsessed</i>

<i>Laid </i>

1770
01:39:01,063 --> 01:39:04,863
<i>Caught your hand inside the till</i>
<i>Slammed your fingers in the door </i>

1771
01:39:04,967 --> 01:39:08,835
<i>Fought with kitchen knives</i>
<i>and skewers </i>

1772
01:39:08,938 --> 01:39:12,874
<i>Dress me up in women's clothes</i>
<i>Messed around with gender roles </i>

1773
01:39:12,975 --> 01:39:15,569
<i>Dye my eyes and call me pretty </i>

<i>Moved out of the house</i>
<i>so you moved next door </i>

1778
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:39,199
<i>I locked you out</i>
<i>You cut a hole in the wall </i>

1779
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:43,135
<i>I found you sleeping next to me</i>
<i>I thought I was alone </i>

1780
01:39:43,239 --> 01:39:48,108
<i>You're driving me crazy</i>
<i>When are you coming home </i>

1781
01:39:52,548 --> 01:39:56,507
<i>Laid </i>

<i>Threw away my reputation </i>

1788
01:40:31,153 --> 01:40:34,816
<i>One more song</i>

1795
01:40:53,142 --> 01:40:55,508
<i>And every penny</i>
<i>from my last paycheck </i>

1796
01:40:55,611 --> 01:40:58,478
<i>I've blown it on you </i>
