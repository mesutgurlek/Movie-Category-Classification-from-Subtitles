I've just got to cry or something.

your birthday present.

You open it. I want to talk to Brick.
Brick, come over here.

-You bought it yourself last Saturday.
-I said quiet!

What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

657

I love humanity. That's my reward.

you might get elected...

I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

to jump even the low ones.

Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

936
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,472
MAGGlE: Skipper didn't like me.

937
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,636
BRlCK: Why didn't Skipper like you?

938
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,400
-You know he was against our marriage.
-Why?

939
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,195
-Because it meant less freedom for you.
-Freedom to do what?

940
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,794
Freedom to run from town to town.

941
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,150
Planes, trains, always running!

942
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,438
-Football practice, dirty stories--
-Nobody forced you to come along with us!

943
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,349
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

944
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,030
BRlCK: Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

945
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,673
Football, baby!

946
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,155
The idea of football smelled.

947
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,153
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

948
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,510
He didn't need any team of his own.

949
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,076
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

950
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,469
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

951
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,908
BRlCK: You're a liar!

952
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,036
He wasn't good enough on his own.

953
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,470
Professional football is a business...

954
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,669
...not a social club!

955
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,316
You mean the business of making money?

956
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,988
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

957
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,153
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

958
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,629
Not from the first day to the last.

959
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,876
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

960
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,479
He lapped them up.

961
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,150
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

962
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,079
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

963
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,475
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

964
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,398
By the man I worshiped.

965
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,875
That's why I hated Skipper.

966
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,115
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

967
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,312
Is that true?

968
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,912
Oh, Big Daddy....

969
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,429
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

970
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,152
Skipper was drunk.

971
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,511
So are you most of the time.

972
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,359
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

973

[lncredulously] Are you....

974

Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

MAGGlE: You know what happened.
BRlCK: I don't know!

976
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,072
I wasn't there.

977
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,033
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

978
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,196
-I was in the hospital--
-Skipper played.

979
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,633
He played all right!

980
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,956
His first professional game without Brick.

981
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,990
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

982
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,633
Go on, tell him.

983
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,671
You're a sports announcer.

984
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,032
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

985
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,038
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

986
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,674
...and stumbled and fell apart.

987
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,879
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

988
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,433
And it was all over:

989
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,512
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

990
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,278
Bad breaks. An off day.

991
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,429
MAGGlE: No, baby.

992
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,559
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

993
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,790
Outside: big, tough, confident.

994
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,791
Inside: pure jelly!

995
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,195
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

996
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,994
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

997
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,911
That little episode was not on TV.

998
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,192
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

999
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,719
He was sick.

1000
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,519
Sick with drink.

1001
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,948
He wouldn't come out.

1002
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,359
He'd busted some furniture...

1003
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,069
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

1004
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,515
So I went to his room.

1005
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,394
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

1006
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,919
He was half crazy.

1007
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,712
Violent and screaming one minute...

1008
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,115
...weak and crying the next.

1009
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,676
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

1010
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,195
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

1011
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,990
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

1012
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,509
I thought he'd hit me.

1013
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,391
He walked toward me...

1014
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,509
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

1015
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,349
Then he did the strangest thing.

1016
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,438
He kissed me.

1017
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,548
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

1018
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,031
And then I knew what I was going to do.

1019
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,117
I'd get rid of Skipper.

1020
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,915
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

1021
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,953
I'd prove it by showing...

1022
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,596
...that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.

1023
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,838
He didn't need any coaxing.

1024
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,917
He was more than willing.

1025
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,350
He even seemed to have the same idea.

1026
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,157
You're just trying to whitewash it.

1027
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,510
I'm not!

1028
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,438
I was trying to win back my husband.

1029
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,518
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

1030
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,631
Even that.

1031
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,272
But at the last second...

1032
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,112
...I got panicky.

1033
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,714
Supposing I lost you instead?

1034
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,432
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

1035
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,112
So I ran.

1036
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,154
Nothing happened!

But not if it meant losing you.

Skipper won out anyway.

1094
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,035
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

1095
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,430
And I couldn't pick it up.

1096
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,508
So that's when he killed himself?

1097
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,909
Yes.

1098
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,676
Because I let him down.

1099
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,512
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1100
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,872
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

1101
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,071
And I can stop thinking.

1102
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,838
I'm ashamed!

1103
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,271
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

1104
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,359
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

1105
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,032
BlG DADDY: And it's here right now.

1106
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,154
BlG DADDY: You're just feeling sorry
for yourself. That's all it is. Self-pity!

1107
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,470
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

1108
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,632
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

1109
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,549
...playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1110
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,796
Life ain't no damn football game.

1111
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,991
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1112
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,636
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

1113
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,469
...pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

1114
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,755
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1115
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,279
Heroes in the real world...

1116
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,836
...Iive 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.

1117
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,677
Mendacity! You won't--

1118
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,476
[Gasps] You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1119
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,676
The truth is pain and sweat...

1120
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,953
...paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

1121
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,151
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

1122
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,158
...and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1123
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,353
Now, here.

1124
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,191
The truth is you never growed up.

1125
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,470
-Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
-Get away.

1126
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,711
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

1127
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,440
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

1128
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,153
-Can you face the truth?
-Try me.

1129
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,878
BRlCK: Sure, somebody else's truth!

1130
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,632
-You're running again.
-Yeah, I am.

1131
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,234
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

1132
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,756
...and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and--

1133
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,757
Please, let me go home.

1134
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,758
-What did you say?
-I don't remember.

1135
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,957
-There won't be any happy returns?
-Forget it.

1136
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,594
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1137
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,911
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

1138
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,599
I'll outlive you.

1139
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,835
I'll bury you.

1140
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,996
-I'll buy your coffin.
-That's right.

1141
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,111
Many happy returns.

1142
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,438
They were lying...

1143
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,959
...weren't they, son...

1144
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,470
...about that report from the clinic?

1145
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,839
This pain...

1146
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,672
...that keeps grabbing at me....

1147
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,153
It's death...

1148
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,395
...ain't it?

1149
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,793
Answer me!

1150
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,513
The truth!

1151
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,355
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1152
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,919
[Thunder rumbles]

1153
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,110
Brick, wait!

1154
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,397
[Sound of splintering wood]

1155
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,559
[Brick laughs]

1156
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,230
Look at us, Maggie.

1157
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,829
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

1158
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,317
...stuck in the....

1159
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,112
I hurt him, Maggie.

1160
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,478
I hurt him really bad.

1161
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,318
What's the matter? What's happened?

1162
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,318
-Why is Big Daddy--
-We've got to talk to you.

1163
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,516
GOOPER: Get Dr. Baugh!
MAE: Where is he?

1164
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,471
I don't know, just find him.

1165
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,396
Doc!

1166
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,600
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

1167
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,875
Sweetheart!

1168
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,276
BlG MAMA: Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1169
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,313
BlG MAMA: What are you doing?

1170
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,998
I'm coming down.

1171
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,838
DR. BAUGH: No need to, lda.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1172
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,911
If that pain gets too bad...

1173
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,672
...this is morphine...

1174
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,752
...and a syringe.

1175
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,914
The instructions are written out.

1176
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,995
It's no use pretending anymore.

1177
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,714
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1178
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,830
Make it easy on yourself.

1179
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,519
Here.

1180
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,759
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

1181
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,436
Why?

1182
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,870
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

1183
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,319
Why can't I go down to him?

1184
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,879
Well, he's....

1185
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,674
His stomach's upset, lda.

1186
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,317
All he needs is a peppermint.

1187
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,431
GOOPER: It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1188
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,598
-lt'll be painful.
-Painful things can't always be avoided.

1189
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,990
So I've noticed. But there are times--

1190
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,952
It's time we all had our talk.

1191
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,355
What talk are you talking about?

1192
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,996
GOOPER: What were they fighting about?
DR. BAUGH: We didn't discuss it.

1193
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,310
MAE: What's he doing in the cellar
all alone?

1194
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,879
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1195
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,195
You heard why.

1196
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,551
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1197
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,310
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1198
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,115
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1199
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,798
Isn't that so?

1200
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,996
Of course that's so.

1201
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,472
He loves his family.

1202
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,234
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1203
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,079
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1204
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,720
MAGGlE: It's the party and the excitement.

1205
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,388
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1206
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,919
Did you notice how he ate?

1207
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,195
He ate like a P-l-G hog.

1208
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,671
GOOPER: I hope he doesn't regret it.

1209
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,109
Who?

1210
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,879
Big Daddy?

1211
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,436
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1212
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,230
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1213
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,873
BlG MAMA: And candied yams.

1214
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,272
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1215
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,030
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1216
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,355
What's that?

1217
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,788
Gooper say he hopes--

1218
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,195
Shoot! Gooper says!

1219
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,960
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1220
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,076
Ain't that so?

1221
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,828
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1222
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,158
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1223
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,920
...he wasn't doomed to...

1224
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,915
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1225
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,316
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1226
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,630
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1227
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,230
Doc, come here!

1228
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,673
I don't need any doctor.

1229
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,557
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1230
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,119
I want Brick.

1231
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,751
He'll be down directly.

1232
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,235
BlG MAMA: Sticky rain
always makes me sick.

1233
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,800
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1234
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,998
BlG MAMA: What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1235
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,994
Big Mama needs you.

1236
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,758
They'll tell her without me.

1237
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,359
Please, Brick.

1238
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,154
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are--

1239
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,754
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1240
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,996
Let them have it all.

1241
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,509
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1242
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,830
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1243
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,038
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1244
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,593
What I can't stand is....

1245
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,717
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1246
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,359
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1247
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,154
Careful, your claws are showing.

1248
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,594
Close that door.

1249
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,392
Don't close that door.

1250
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,912
Let a little air circulate.

1251
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,114
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1252
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,033
What discussion of what?

1253
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,714
BlG MAMA: Maggie, Brick!
GOOPER: Now, now, Big Mama--

1254
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,360
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1255
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,398
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1256
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,755
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1257
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,190
MAE: Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1258
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,356
-He don't need no cure.
-Of course not.

1259
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,113
GOOPER: He'll just drink
all the whisky in the state.

1260
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,236
BlG MAMA: Stop that kind of talk!

1261
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,909
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1262
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,553
Good for you!

1263
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,794
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1264
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,190
BlG MAMA: What are you all
surrounding me for?

1265
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,197
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1266
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,310
Are you all crazy?

1267
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,631
-You calm yourself, sweetheart.
-You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1268
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,114
How can I calm myself...

1269
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,078
...with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?

1270
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,831
What's all this about?

1271
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,035
Sit down, Mae.

1272
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,993
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1273
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,519
Truth!

1274
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,960
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1275
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,559
The truth is as dirty...

1276
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,829
...as lies!

1277
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,791
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1278
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,279
DR. BAUGH: Well, lda....

1279
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,634
I want to know!

1280
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,118
-Somebody must be lying.
-Sit down, Mama, please.

1281
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,478
I want to know about my husband.

1282
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,235
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1283
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,396
One of the best clinics in the country.

1284
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,948
The best in the country, bar none.

1285
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,680
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1286
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,114
Right, Doc?

1287
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,229
Sure of what?

1288
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,476
MAGGlE: Not now!
MAE: The test was positive!

1289
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,595
Mae, shut up.

1290
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,272
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1291
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,229
Hopeless?

1292
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,000
MAE: Now, now, darling.
GOOPER: You had to know.

1293
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,879
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1294
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,197
DR. BAUGH: It's gone past the knife.
MAE: He's dying, Big Mama.

1295
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,470
You get away from me, Mae!

1296
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,476
I want Brick.

1297
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,551
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?

1298
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,229
Brick!

1299
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,634
Mama, please.

[Big Mama sobs]

1301
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,513
GOOPER: I'm your son, too.
MAE: Gooper's your firstborn.

1302
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,636
GOOPER: Now, listen to me!
BlG MAMA: No!

1303
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,917
-He'll be in pain.
-Gooper and I think--

1304
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,473
GOOPER: Mae, shut up!

1305
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,352
-Do you want to see him suffer?
-No.

1306
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,829
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1307
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,560
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1308
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,319
[Gasps repeatedly] No.

1309
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,154
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1310
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,992
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1311
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,073
GOOPER: lnstead of the needle, haven't
you got a pill to make the pain disappear?

1312
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,676
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1313
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,031
GOOPER: Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate....

[Thunder rumbles]

1315
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,756
Does Brick know?

1316
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,191
You know, honey...

1317
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,389
...we was never a very happy family.

1318
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,115
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1319
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,437
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just....

1320
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,310
You know how some homes are happy.

1321
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,877
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, "Now we'll be happy here."

1322
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,631
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1323
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,956
And we'll help each other be happy.

1324
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,951
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1325
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,874
Margaret, honey...

1326
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,354
...you've got to help Brick.

1327
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,032
Make him pull himself together.

1328
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,834
BlG MAMA: He'll take hold of things.
MAE: What things?

1329
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,276
The place.

1330
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,398
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1331
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,828
We've all had a shock.

1332
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,753
-Let's be realistic.
-Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough--

1333
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,957
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1334
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,349
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1335
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,035
My husband is not going to die!

1336
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,549
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1337
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,995
-We're hoping too.
-We intend to pray for him.

1338
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,191
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to--

1339
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,191
Gooper is your firstborn!

1340
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,949
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1341
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,669
Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.

1342
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,598
GOOPER: Will you let me talk, please?

1343
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,079
Yes, of course.

1344
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,273
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1345
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,833
Almost single-handed.

1346
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,430
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1347
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,034
Mama, let's be fair.

1348
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,950
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1349
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,429
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

Mae....

1351
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,834

He never thought of it as a duty.

place ruined by a drunken ex-football hero.

1355
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,512
Shut up about my husband!

You shut up!

1357
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,477
He has no right to slander--

1358
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,240
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

1359
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,875
...which don't include you!

1360

and drink with Brick?

the Sugar Bowl this year.

1363

Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

1364
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,512
It was the punch bowl, honey.

1365

The cut-glass punch bowl.

1366
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,071
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1367
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,116
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

1368

What about his malice toward Gooper?

sordid reasons on earth.

Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

1389

You know why she's got no kids?

1390

MAE: Ask her big, beautiful husband.
GOOPER: Mae!

1391
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,394
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

1392
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,515
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

1393
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,153
How would you know?

1394
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,668
How would he know?

1395
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,677
Did he ever let anyone love him?

1396
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,348
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

1397
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,954
...he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1398
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,680
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

1399
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,199
He said get married. I did.

1400

Do you believe that, Gooper?

1709
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,679
-No.
-Well, I do!

1710
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,790
Keep still.

1711
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,118
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1712
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,839
That's the truth.

1713
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,229
Amen.

1714
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,397
MAE: You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1715
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,039
-Be still, Mae.
-She made it up.

1716
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:44,237
-I said shut up.
-Don't you try to kid us.

1717
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,398
She's not kidding you.

1718
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,876
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even--

1719
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,155
GOOPER: Keep quiet!

1720
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,755
MAE: We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1721
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:00,272
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1722
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,438
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1723
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,117
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1724
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,795
BRlCK: You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."

1725
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,518
-That's a lie!
-No.

1726
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,388
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1727
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,790
Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.

1728
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,198
MAE: Why don't you
say something, honey?

1729
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,233
All right, honey.

1730
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,475
Shut up!

1731
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,354
Maggie?

1732
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,715
Yes?

1733
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,472
BRlCK: Come on up here.

1734
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,755
Yes, sir!

1735
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,236
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1736
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,631
[Soft instrumental music]

1737
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,760
Thank you for keeping still.

1738
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,196
For backing me up in my lie.

1739
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,629
Maggie....

1740
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,835
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1741
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,754
Lock the door.

1742
