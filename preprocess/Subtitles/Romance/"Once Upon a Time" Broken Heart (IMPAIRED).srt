about everything.

When

But the minute things got tough,
you didn't come to anybody.

186

You decided that you would
figure it out on your own.

187

I'll meet you there.

The vault has already forged
Hook as its new Dark One.

He went this way.

We've got to start

But this new

we need as many allies
as we can get.

It's worth a try.
