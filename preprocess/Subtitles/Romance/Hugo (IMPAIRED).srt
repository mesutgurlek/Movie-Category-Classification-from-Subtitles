this one can write.

141
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,665
It must've been made in London.

142
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,371
Where Mother was from.

143
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,918
She was from Coventry, but she...
moved to London.

144
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,254
Magicians used machines like this
when I was a boy.

Some walked, some danced,
some sang.

146
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,554
But the secret was always
in the clockwork.

147
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,593
Huh, look at that.

148
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,565
Can we fix him?

149
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,398
Oh, I don't know, Hugo.

150
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,779
He's badly rusted.

151
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,611
And finding parts to fit
will be very hard.

152
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,488
Of course we can fix him.

153
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,123
We're clockmakers, aren't we?

154
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,330
But only after I've finished
my work at the shop

155
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,498
and at the museum, hmm?
You understand.

156
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,722
We'll put this back in.
Just steady it...

- You've finished with school!

00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,911
There'll be no time for that
when you're in them walls.

Good morning, sir.
Can I help you with anything?

I need my notebook.

Why do you need it so badly'?

- Sorry, I...
- I saw.

00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,863
- Are you crying?
- No.

238

Hold still.

Look, there's nothing wrong with crying.

Sydney Carton cries.
And Heathcliff, too.

- In books, they're crying all the time.
- I can do it.

242
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,965
I need to talk to you.
It's terribly important, but...

243
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,676
But not here. We're too...

00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,229
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

246
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,982
Only to the most wonderful
place on earth.

[door bells tinkling]

Ah, Isabelle.

00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,328
May I present to you
Monsieur Hugo Cabret,

00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,989
a very old and dear companion.

252

Monsieur Cabret.

Hello.

254
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,383
Well, thank you for this.

255
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,346
I think I'm halfway in love with
David Copperfield. Photography'?

- Back corner, left, top shelf.
- Thank you.

257
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,527
[Hugo] Listen, what's so important?

258
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,113
Papa Georges still has your notebook.

259
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,699
He didn't burn it.
That was all a trick.

260
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,957
- Why?
[sighs] I don't know.

261
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,210
All I know is the notebook
made him very upset.

262
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,498
And he and Mama Jeanne stayed up
very late talking about it.

263
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,677
Well, you see, I think he was crying.

264
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,641
Why are you helping me?

265
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,062
Because this might be an adventure.

266
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,565
And I've never had one before...

267
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,610
outside of books, at least.

268
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,273
And I think we should be very...

269
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,868
clandestine.

270
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,490
OK.

271
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:47,662
By the way, my name's Isabelle.
Do you want a book?

272
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,958
Monsieur Labisse lets me borrow them,
and I'm sure I could get one for you.

273
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,546
No.

274
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,966
Don't you like books?

275
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,552
No... No, I do.

276
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,595
My father and I used to read
Jules Verne together.

277
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,401
[Isabelle] Well, come on.

278
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,070
[Hugo] How do I get my notebook back?

279
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,952
[Isabelle] Well, I think you
should stand up to him.

280
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,284
And don't tell him we talked.

281
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll help you if I can.

282
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,618
Be steadfast.

Go away.

285
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,564
Fix it.

286
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,327
I said, fix it.

287
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,042
I know you've been
stealing parts from the shop.

288
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,624
You might as well use those
you haven't stolen yet.

Give me my notebook.

292
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,568
You've got a bit of talent.

293
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,614
But you'll have to prove there's
more to you than being a thief.

294
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,901
- You can earn your notebook.
- How?

295
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,114
Come to the booth every day.

296
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,531
I'll decide how long you must
work for each item you stole.

297
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,701
And it will be up to me
to decide when...

298
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,835
you've earned
your notebook, if ever.

299
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,045
- I already have a job.
- "Thief" is not a job, boy.

300
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,462
I have a different job.
But I'll come when I can.

301
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,137
You begin tomorrow. Go away.

302
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,928
I'll begin now.

00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,390
His hand was trespassing
inside a paper bag, with the intent

331
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,857
- of removing its contents.
[boy sobbing]

332

[Station Inspector]
The object of his plunder? A pastry.

Be quiet!

Keep... Stop your sniffling,
you little urchin,

336
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,335
- with your filthy little mitts.
[weeping]

337
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,167
No, of course I wasn't talking to you.

338
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,457
I have only the highest respect for you.
Please.

339
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,256
No, that was not a comment
about your wife.

340
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,259
- That's absurd.
[sniffing]

341
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,848
I have not heard any of those rumors.
No, I was not aware of that.

342
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,513
Well, I'm sure she will return.

343
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,556
- Come on, you little vermin.
[boy sobs]

344

[man] So here's the little
pastry thief, eh?

345

[Station Inspector]
Apologies about your wife.

347
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,239
What do you think I should do about her?

348
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,150
- What? About what?
- Leaving me.

349
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,239
[gasping sob] - Oy!

350
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,074

- Nice try.

351

Go on, get in there!

- Do you think it's mine?
- What?

353
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,411
I don't know what to do.
She's having a baby, you know.

354
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,046
- Sure it's yours?
- Who else's could it be?

355
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,209
Of course it's yours. When's the last
time you had relations with her?

356
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,422
- Uh...
- Any time in the last year?

357
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,805
- No, I don't think so.
- Very suspicious, then.

358
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,965
If you should see her, please...

359
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,805
Oh. You sure you want her back?

360
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,220
[man] Oh, yes, yes.
I love her very much.

361
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,359
[Isabelle] Ready?
One, two, three!

362

[Hugo] <i>Robin Hood.</i>
I saw this movie.

365
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,168
With Douglas Fairbanks.
Did you see that?

366
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,670
I've never seen a movie.

367
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,127
- What?
- Isn't it appalling?

368
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,338
You've never seen <i>a</i> movie?
Not ever?

369

Papa Georges won't let me.

370
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,681
- He's very strict about it.
- I love the movies.

371
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,309
My father always took me
for my birthday.

372

Hugo...

373
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,269
is your father dead?

374
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,655
I don't want to talk about it.

375

Isabelle...

376
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,799

[indistinct chatter]

00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
We could get into trouble.

That's how you know it's an adventure.

Come on!

385

And I'd better not see
you in here again!

[door slams]

387

[Hugo] Why doesn't Papa Georges
let you go to the movies?

388
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,109
[Isabelle] I don't know. He never said.

389
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,279
I bet my parents would've let me.

390
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,865
What happened to them?

391
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,488
They died... when I was a baby.

392
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,123
But Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne,
they're my godparents,

393
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,874
so they took me in.

394
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,083
They're very nice about most everything,
except the movies.

395
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,248
[Hugo] My father took me
to the movies all the time.

396
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,965
He told me about the first one
he ever saw.

397
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,176
He went into a dark room,
and on a white screen,

398
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,969
he saw a rocket fly
into the eye of the man in the moon.

399
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,808
- It went straight in.
- Really?

400
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,644
He said it was like seeing
his dreams in the middle of the day.

401
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,981
The movies were our special place...

402
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,236
where we could go
and watch something and...

403
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,403
we didn't miss my mum so much.

404
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,662
You think about him a lot, don't you?

405
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,336
All the time.

406
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:25,134
Hugo, um... where do you live?

00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,191
There.

409
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,357
[Hugo] My uncle taught me
how to run the clocks.

410
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,901
So I just keep on doing it.

411
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,114
Maybe he'll come back one day,
but I doubt it.

412
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,496
Aren't you afraid someone will find out?

413
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,537
Not as long as the clocks keep
on running and no one sees me.

Just keep on walking.
Act natural.

[Isabelle] Good day, monsieur.
- Where are your parents?

422
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,747
I work with my Papa Georges
at the toy booth.

423
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,007
Surely you've seen me there before.

424
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,669
And this is my cousin
from the country, Hugo.

You'll have to forgive him.

He's quite... simple-minded.
Doltish, really.

Poor thing.

431
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,375
Seems Maximilian doesn't like
the cut of your jib, little man.

432
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,715
He is disturbed by your physiognomy.

433
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,132
He is upset by your visage.

434
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,935
Why would he not like your face?

435
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,561
Eh?

436
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,522
Well, perhaps he smells my cat.

437
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,571
- Cat?
- Yes.

438
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,200
Christina Rossetti's her name,
after the poetess.

439
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,911
Would you like me to recite?

440
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,618
My heart is like a singing bird

Whose nest is in a water'd shoot

442

My heart is like an apple tree

Whose boughs are bent with thick-set...

444

All right, all right.
I know the rest.

445
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,463
That's enough poetry for today.

446
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:17,349
I love poetry, particularly
that poem by Chris... tina.

447
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,598
- Rossetti.
- She's... yeah.

448
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:22,183
She's one of my favorites.
I know it's Rossetti.

449
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,480
I know it's Rossetti.

450
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,813
I love poetry, just...
not in the station.

451
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:32,822
We're here to either
get on trains or get off them.

452
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,450
Or work in different shops,
is that clear?

453
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,658
- Yes, sir.
- Watch your step.

Now, since I just saved your life,

458
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,182
how about letting me see
your covert lair?

459
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,604
- My what?
- Where you live, in the walls.

460
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,823
I have to go now. I have things to do.

Hold on!

462
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,114
You've seen my house.
Isn't it about time that I saw yours?

463
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,998
After all, I am your only friend.

464
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,658
You're not my only friend.

465
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,169
Being enigmatic really doesn't suit you.

466
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,001
- What are you up to?
- I've got to go.

I should never have left

[voice quavers] Oh, children.

What have you done?
Where did you get this?

540
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,682
You'll call me a liar.

541

No, Child.

542

A mechanical man drew it.

Do you have him?

544
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,360
My father found him in a museum.

545

Nobody wanted him.

546
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,119
We fixed it.

547
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,751
No, but it needed my...

548
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,622
my key.

549
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,300
- The key I gave you.
- No, no, Mama, he...

550
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,763
No. No, you take this away.
Can't dredge up the past now.

551
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,053
Whatever happens, you don't let
Papa Georges see it.

Please.

558
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,746
There are things

[whispers] Quiet!

563
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:34,054
Now just keep quiet. I'll find a way
to get him out of the apartment.

564

Not a noise from either of you.

I was looking for your notebook.

Not on the stairs? Didn't you
see her when you were going past?

There was a lobster

Up until today, I believed
that he died in the war...

What have we here?

Jules Verne. Yes, indeed.

- Not unknown in France.
- One of our finest.

Very good plates.

Monsieur Labisse gave me

He's always doing that,
sending books to a good home.

That's what he calls it.

He's got real... [sighs]

Purpose.

What do you mean?

773
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,809
[Hugo] Everything has a purpose,
even machines.

774
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:54,151
Clocks tell the time
and trains take you places.

775
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,361
They do what they're meant to do.

776
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,070
Like Monsieur Labisse.

777
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:03,823
Maybe that's why
broken machines make me so sad.

778
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,909
They can't do what they're meant to do.

779
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,920
Maybe it's the same with people.

780
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,256
If you lose your purpose,
it's like you're broken.

781
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,633
Like Papa Georges.

782
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,765
Maybe we can fix him.

783
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:27,309
Is that your purpose, fixing things?

784
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,978
I don't know.

785
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,768
It's what my father did.

786
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,773
I wonder what my purpose is.

787
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,569
I don't know.

788
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,576
Maybe if I had known my parents...

789
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,498
I would know.

790
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,011
Come with me.

791
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:11,774
[Hugo] Right after my father died,
I would come up here a lot.

792
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,818
I'd imagine the whole world
was one big machine.

793
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,659
Machines never come
with any extra parts, you know.

794
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,240
They always come with
the exact amount they need.

795
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:32,461
So I figured if the entire world
was one big machine...

796
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,799
I couldn't be an extra part.

797
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,961
I had to be here for some reason.

798
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:46,013
And that means you have
to be here for some reason, too.

Don't say anything.

Not really.

804
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,595

No, he has no... no relatives.

I... I deeply apologize, madame.
I thought you were expecting us.

847

I will leave immediately

No, Mama. Mama, please
don't make them leave.

I-I don't wish to impose

but if this is to be
the only time we meet,

853
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:29,055
please, let me express to you

854
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,316
the profound debt of gratitude
I owe your husband.

855
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:38,814
When I was a boy,
I saw all his films.

856
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,616
They inspired me.

857
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,200
Your husband is a very great artist.

858
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,586
Oh, I am so pleased

859
01:28:56,748 --> 01:29:00,924
you remember my husband's films
with such fondness.

860
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:06,016
But... he's so fragile now.

861
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,475
It only hurts him to remember the past.

862
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,855
Then we will take our leave, madame.

863
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,695
And I do hope you'll
forgive me for saying...

864
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:28,539
you are as lovely now
as you were in the movies.

865

[Isabelle] Mama?
- You were in the movies?

866
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,047
She appeared in almost all his films.

867
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:42,336
- You were an actress?
- Well, I... [sighs]

868
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,255
Was a long time ago, children.
It was...

869
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,560
It was another time. I, uh... I...

870
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,643
Well, I was another person.

871
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,018
Would you like to meet her again?

872
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,106
We have a film.

873
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,993
One of Georges' films?

874
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,659
That's not possible. They're all gone.

875
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,578
May we show you?

876
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:16,371
[Hugo] Please.
- Oh, yes, please, Mama. Please.

877
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,635
[whispering]
Just be quick with it.

878
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,433
[Isabelle] You were an actress,
a real cinema actress!

879
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:34,062
- It's impossibly romantic, Mama.
- It wasn't like that.

880
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,724
We weren't movie stars
like they have today.

881
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:42,104
But we did have fun.

886
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,375
[Mama Jeanne] But of course.
We tinted the film.

887
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:48,512
We painted it by hand,
frame by frame.

888
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,394
Mama, it's you!

889
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:08,982
Yes.

890
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:39,471
[Mama Jeanne] Oh, beautiful.

891
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,866
You were beautiful.

892
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,909
[Papa Georges] She still is.

893
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:28,362
I would recognize the sound
of a movie projector anywhere.

894
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:35,656
[Mama Jeanne] Georges...

895
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,912
you've tried to forget
the past for so long.

896
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:48,541
It's brought you nothing
but unhappiness, hmm'?

897
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,169
Maybe it's time to try and remember.

Yes.

901
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,619

<i>But then the war came.</i>

<i>Tastes had changed,

984

<i>No one wanted my movies any more.</i>

985
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,303
<i>Eventually I...
I couldn't pay the actors...</i>

986
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,969
<i>or keep the business
running, and...</i>

987
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:58,432
<i>and so my enchanted castle
fell to ruin.</i>

988
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,562
<i>Everything was lost.</i>

989

<i>I burned all my old sets
and costumes.</i>

991
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:24,378
<i>I was forced to sell my movies
to a company</i>

992
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,461
<i>that melted them down
into chemicals.</i>

993
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:34,214
<i>These chemicals were used
to make shoe heels.</i>

994
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,981
<i>With the little money I had from selling
my films, I bought the toy booth...</i>

995
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,026
<i>and there I have remained.</i>

996
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:54,821
The only thing I couldn't
bring myself to destroy

997
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:57,658
was my beloved automaton.
[voice breaking]

998
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:03,705
So I gave him to a museum,
hoping he would find a home.

999
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:07,839
But they never put him on display.
And then the museum burned.

1000
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:12,840
It's all gone now.
Everything I ever made.

1001

Nothing but ashes
and fading strips of celluloid.

1002
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:24,438
My life has taught me
one lesson, Hugo,

1003
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:27,851
and not the one I thought it would.

1004

They found his corpse in the Seine.

1032

It's been down there
for many months, it seems.

Can't say I'm surprised.

1034
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,909
He was an inebriant

- Yes, he was a drunk!

Scram! Shoo!

1038
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,377
He could've drunk
the entire River Seine. [Chuckles]

- No.

- Don't do this!

Do not leave my office.

You don't understand,
I've got to go.

1050
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:30,784
You'll go nowhere
until your parents are found.

1051
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,247
I don't have any!

1052
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,162
Then it's straight
to the orphanage with you.

1053
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:39,042
You'll learn a thing or two there.
I certainly did.

1054
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:42,257
How to follow orders.
How to keep to yourself.

1055
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:44,467
How to survive without a family.

1056
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:49,557
Because you don't need one.
You don't need a family.

Police headquarters,
7th arrondissement?

1058
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:58,068
Yes, it's me again.
Another orphan.

1059
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,947
Has been a busy week.

1060

littering, pillorying,

Oh, she came back?

Oh, you think it's yours?
Excellent.

1066
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,173
Well, I suppose you'll find out
in seven months.

1067
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:28,216
[laughs] Pardon me. Oh, in March?
I'll try to come.

01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,056
I... I tend not to plan
that far ahead.

Are you sure?

1070
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:35,931
Well, oh, that's very flattering.

appropriate for me to be the godfa...

01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:57,380
[applause]

1129
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:00,042
[indistinct conversation]

1130
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:05,173
For years, most of his films
were thought to be lost.

1131
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:09,094
Indeed, Monsieur Méliès
believed so himself.

1132
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,136
But we began a search.

1133
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:14,728
We looked through vaults,
through private collections,

1134
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:18,360
barns and catacombs.

1135
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,235
Our work was rewarded
with old negatives,

1136
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:27,324
boxes of prints, and trunks
full of decaying film,

1137
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:29,705
which we were able to save.

1138
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:33,618
We now have over 80 films
by Georges Méliès.

1139
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:35,661
[applause]

1140
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,588
And tonight, their creator,

1141
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:46,506
and the newest member
of the Film Academy faculty,

1142
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:49,515
is here to share them with you.

1143
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:01,027
[cheering]

1144
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,909
[woman] Bravo!

1145
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,453
[man] Bravo!

1146
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:26,507
Ladies and gentlemen...

1147
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:29,760
I...

1148
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:42,395
I am standing
before you tonight...

1149
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:47,024
because of one
very brave young man...

1150
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:54,991
who saw a broken machine...

1151
01:55:57,451 --> 01:56:01,706
and against all odds, he fixed it.

1152
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:07,795
It was the kindest magic trick...

1153
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,431
that ever I've seen.

1154
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:23,902
And now, my friends,

1155
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:30,363
I address you all tonight
as you truly are:

1156
01:56:30,525 --> 01:56:34,780
Wizards, mermaids...

1157
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:41,496
travelers, adventurers...
magicians.

1158
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,431
Come and dream with me.

1159
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:28,394
Yes, you can start with the thaumatrope,
the zoetrope, the praxinoscope.

1160
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,564
Any study of the history of film
must begin with the...

1161
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:34,108
Poppy'? The cave pictographs at...

1162
01:58:34,274 --> 01:58:35,742
- Niaux.
- Niaux.

1163
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,824
About canine socialization.

1164
01:58:38,987 --> 01:58:40,580
Not canine romance?

1165
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:44,585
Oh, Monsieur Frick, do I detect
a pearl in your oyster?

1166
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:47,838
[Station Inspector] The boy designed it.
It does not squeak at all.

1167
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,256
Don't forget to smile, darling.

1168
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,043
Well, which one?
I've mastered three of them.

1169
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:59,509
Don't worry. I'm now a fully
functioning man. Aren't I, dear?

1170
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:04,396
Tap the deck. And it's up,
it's up, it's up... It's there!

1171
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:08,645
- Is this your card?
[man] That is my card.

1172
01:59:10,602 --> 01:59:16,280
<i>[Isabelle] Once upon a time,
I met a boy named Hugo Cabret.</i>

1173
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,370
<i>He lived in a train station.</i>

1174
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:26,080
<i>"Why did he live in a train station?"
you might well ask.</i>

1175
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,080
<i>That's really what this book
is going to be about.</i>

1176
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:35,503
<i>It's about how
this singular young man</i>

1177
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:40,175
<i>searched so hard to find
a secret message from his father...</i>

1178
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:45,808
<i>and how that message lit his way.</i>

1179
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:50,146
<i>All the way home.</i>

1180
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:55,290
