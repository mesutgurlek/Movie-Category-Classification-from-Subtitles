Last day of school!

<i>Whoa</i>

5
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,617
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

6
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:30,187
<i>How to choose who to be</i>
<i>Well, let's see</i>

7
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:33,320
<i>There's so many choices now</i>

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,422
<i>Play guitar, be a movie star</i>

9
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:41,631
<i>In my head a voice says</i>
<i>Why not try everything?</i>

10
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,799
<i>Why stop? Reach for any dream</i>

11
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,968
<i>I can rock</i>

12
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:51,707
<i>'Cause it's my life</i>
<i>And now's the time, who will I be?</i>

13
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,680
<i>It's up to me</i>

14
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:58,050
<i>All the never-ending possibilities</i>

15
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,816
<i>That I can see</i>

16
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:04,327
<i>There's nothing that I can't do</i>
<i>Who will I be?</i>

17
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:10,060
<i>Yes, I believe I get to make the future</i>
<i>What I want to</i>

18
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:15,400
<i>If I can become anyone</i>
<i>And know the choice is up to me</i>

19
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,939
<i>Who will I be?</i>

20
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,671
<i>I wanna find the who I am inside</i>
<i>Who will I be?</i>

Mitchie's Songs

<i>I wanna show the</i>
<i>The way that I can shine</i>

00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,426
<i>Who will I be?</i>

24
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:42,263
Oh, cool. <i>Hot Tunes</i> is on.
Turn it up, please.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,834
<i>The pop star phenom Shane Gray</i>
<i>may have gone too far this time</i>

26
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:46,994
SHANE GRAY
SCANDAL

27
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:50,369
<i>when he stormed off the set</i>
<i>of the new Connect 3 video. </i>

28
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:54,501
<i>Word is the other members</i>
<i>of Connect 3 are fed up. </i>

29
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:57,581
<i>This final stunt cost his label</i>
<i>thousands of dollars,</i>

30
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,479
<i>but may cost them</i>
<i>the rest of their record deal. </i>

31
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:03,478
What is wrong with that boy?
He's got everything.

32
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,020
Except a clue.

33
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:08,148
<i>The message is clear,</i>
<i>he needs to clean up his act. </i>

34
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,589
<i>And to give him time to do it,</i>

35
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,628
<i>the Connect 3's summer tour</i>
<i>has been canceled. </i>

36
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:20,030
Look what I found in the crisper.
A Camp Rock brochure.

37
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,162
Or should I say another
Camp Rock brochure?

38
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,706
Hmm. Look at that.

39
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,935
Oh, and great cheese omelet,
by the way.

40
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,877
You should definitely add that
to your catering menu.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,414
So you have no idea
how this brochure got in there?

42
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,144
Or the one taped
to the vacuum cleaner?

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,748
Sweetie, I know you wanna go
to this camp.

44
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:42,849
And I'm sorry,
but we just can't swing it right now.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,325
With Dad expanding the store

46
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:47,989
and my catering business
just taking off...

47
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,225
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,494
I know.

49
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,464
Got to go.

50
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,334
Last day of school.

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,305
Don't want to be late.

52
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,524
- Hey, Mitchie.
- Hey, Sierra.

53
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,821
Let me be the first to say
<i>Shing Sha Ji,</i> Mitchie.

54
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,327
It means, "Happy summer, Mitchie."

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,332
Guess who got an A-plus
in AP Mandarin? Me. Again.

56
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,026
So, how'd it go this morning?

57
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,831
It didn't. Camp Rock is a no-go.

58
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,066
But you have to go.
Camp Rock is, like, the music camp.

59
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,837
Anybody who wants to be somebody
in music...

60
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:38,005
All of which you already know. Sorry.

61
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:39,309
Me, too.

62
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:43,352
I was just so excited to have a summer
that was all about music. And...

63
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,115
I know.

64
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:47,952
So, what are you going to do
this summer?

65
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,724
So, how was work?

66
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:01,763
You know Barney's. We serve burgers
with a Barney's smile.

67
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,301
- So what's for dinner?
- Burgers.

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,970
Well, our world-famous Torres burger.

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,469
Um...

70
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:11,741
I'll pass.

71
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,647
Okay. I can't stand it. Tell her.

72
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:18,153
- Well, Steve, she just got home.
- Tell me what?

73
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,314
- Okay, honey. Drum roll.
- Mom?

74
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:23,484
Okay. You're going to Camp Rock!

75
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,427
- What?
- She said you're going to Camp Rock.

76
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,125
Well, actually, we're going.
Connie's Catering is going camping.

77
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,293
Business is slow in the summer,
this is a steady job,

78
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:36,065
and you get to go to camp
at a discounted rate!

79
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,538
But you have to help out in the kitchen.

80
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:40,041
Thank you!
Thank you, like, a million times!

81
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,111
Oh.

82
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,208
CAMP ROCK

83
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,984
CONNIE'S CATERING

84
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:37,058
- We're here.
- Yeah. Are you excited?

85
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:41,069
A little. Okay, a lot! Yes! Major!

86
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,971
Thank you, Mom.
I'm gonna have so much fun.

87
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:46,133
Whoa.

88
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,946
Whoa.

89
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:02,884
Okay. Sweetie, let's get settled in.

90
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,957
Settled.

91
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:11,131
That's great. Brown Cesario.

92
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:15,001
Camp director/founding member
and bass guitar of the White Crows.

93
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,563
And you must be Connie Torres,
our new cook.

94
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:19,972
That's me.

95
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:22,773
And this is my daughter.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,075
- Who's already gone.
- No worries.

97
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:27,377
She probably just wanted
to get out there, get to it,

98
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,576
you know what I mean?

99
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,552
When the music calls,
you got to answer.

100
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:35,455
I can't wait for you to meet her though.
She has got a great voice.

101
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,460
- Look at me, I'm already bragging.
- Oh, you got to brag, love.

102
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:42,157
Learned that from the Mickster. Jagger.

103
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:43,324
You knew Mick Jagger?

104
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,924
Yeah. Backed him up for years.

105
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,264
Great times, great times.

106
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,135
But not as great as the time

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,834
- when I toured with Aerosmith.
- You knew Aerosmith?

108
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,656
Sorry. I didn't... I didn't see you.

109
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,058
Obviously.

110
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:19,161
That's Tess Tyler,
the diva of Camp Rock.

111
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,668
Is she really good?

112
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:23,433
She's good at trying too hard
to be good.

113
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,940
Understandable,
'cause her mom's TJ Tyler.

114
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:29,638
The TJ Tyler?
She's got like a trillion Grammys.

115
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,680
A trillion and one, I think.

116
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:32,942
Hi, I'm Caitlyn.

117
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,610
Camper today,
top-selling music producer tomorrow.

118
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,777
Check me out.

119
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,616
<i></i>

120
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,649
- Cool. I'm Mitchie.
- Hi.

121
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,594
Hi, gang! I'm Dee La Duke,

122
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,096
the musical director here
at Camp Rock.

123
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,132
Hi, Dee.

124
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,964
Here at Camp Rock we sing.
So let's hear that again.

125
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,869
<i>Hi, Dee</i>

126
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:01,411
Sounds good. A little pitchy in places,
but we'll fix that by the Final Jam.

127
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,579
<i>Hey! We're here to rock it out</i>

128
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,705
<i>At least I know I am</i>

129
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,977
<i>We plan to be the winners onstage</i>
<i>at Final Jam</i>

130
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,245
- <i>Holler</i>
- <i>Holler</i>

131
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,377
<i>Put your hands up</i>

132
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,647
- <i>Hey, hey</i>
- <i>Come on, everybody</i>

133
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:12,813
<i>Get your hands up</i>

134
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:16,882
Okay, okay. Settle down.
You're having too much fun.

135
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:20,191
Okay, this summer is not just
about the Final Jam.

136
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,231
We have a lot of work to do.

137
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,197
You're gonna get new music skills,

138
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:27,498
you're gonna find your sound,
create your own style.

139
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,265
Holler!

140
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,398
And figure out
who you want to be as artists,

141
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:34,636
but most of all have fun!

142
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,647
And drum roll, please.

143
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:47,218
For the first time,
we're gonna be joined at camp

144
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:51,488
by a very special celebrity instructor.

145
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,593
I don't want to waste my summer
at some camp.

146
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:57,189
I'm Shane Gray, for crying out loud.

147
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,758
Hey, man, we used to love this place.
Three years ago we were campers.

148
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,772
Yeah, man,
this is where Connect 3 connected.

149
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,270
And you get to see your Uncle Brown.

150
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:09,106
Not a selling point.

151
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,544
Look, man, right now
you're the bad boy to the press.

152
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,047
And the label has a problem with that.

153
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,015
Which means
we have a problem with that.

154
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,815
Actually, I don't really have a problem
with that.

155
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:21,447
We have a problem with that.

156
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:26,325
This camp thing is supposed to fix it.
It's good P.R., so do your time.

157
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,126
Enjoy the fresh air. Get a tan.

158
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:32,360
Oh, and can you make me a birdhouse
or something?

159
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,398
One word, payback.

160
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:38,098
That's two words.

161
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,908
By the way, we told the press
you'd be recording a duet

162
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,575
with the winner of Final Jam.

163
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,777
What?

164
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,326
- Shane! What's the haps, man?
- Hey. What's up, Uncle Brown?

165
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah.

166
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,804
I hear there's an open mike tonight.

167
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:18,540
Yeah.

168
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:19,945
Are you gonna sing?

169
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,814
In front of all those people? No way.

170
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,387
Sweetie, I hear you in your room.

171
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:28,049
You're really good. Mom's Honor.

172
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:33,290
And if you're nervous, so what?

173
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,159
Everyone is nervous.

174
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,732
That's why I'm making
so much food tonight,

175
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,630
'cause people eat
when they're nervous.

176
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:42,102
Not me. I don't think
I can eat another burger ever.

177
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,968
Okay. Why don't you go
take the trash out to the Dumpster

178
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,600
and then set up in the mess hall?

179
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,474
I'll finish up here.

180
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:59,180
<i>You think you're hot</i>
<i>But I'm sorry you're not exactly</i>

181
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,315
<i>who you think you are</i>

182
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:04,791
<i>Can't tell you what</i>
<i>What you haven't got</i>

183
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,126
<i>But when we walk into the room</i>

184
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:10,597
Once again from the top, girls.

185
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,466
<i>You think you're hot</i>
<i>But I'm sorry you're not exactly</i>

186
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:17,472
<i>Who you think you are</i>

187
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:20,042
<i>Can't tell you what</i>
<i>What you haven't got</i>

188
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:22,611
<i>But when we walk into the room</i>

189
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:27,040
Work with me here, people!

190
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,777
Hello? We're trying, but you...

191
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:32,184
If we want to win,
you guys have to listen to me.

192
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,551
Let's go again.

193
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:38,054
<i>You think you're hot</i>
<i>But I'm sorry you're not exactly</i>

194
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,028
<i>Who you think you are</i>

195
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,929
<i>Can't tell you what</i>
<i>What you haven't got</i>

196
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,433
<i>But when we walk into... </i>

197
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,913
Come on, guys. I learned my lesson.

198
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,955
I showered in cold water,
I have looked at a tree.

199
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,150
It's been three hours.
I need hair product.

200
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,193
I guess it's time
to embrace the natural look.

201
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:14,729
Oh, have fun.

202
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,223
Guys.

203
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,901
There he is!

204
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,034
Where'd he go?

205
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,316
<i>Do you know what it's like</i>
<i>To feel so in the dark</i>

206
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,388
<i>To dream about a life</i>

207
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:42,151
<i>Where you're the shining star</i>

208
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,092
<i>Even though it seems</i>

209
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,289
<i>Like it's too far away</i>

210
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,494
<i>I have to believe in myself</i>

211
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:55,093
<i>It's the only way</i>

212
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,607
<i>This is real, this is me</i>

213
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,645
<i>I'm exactly</i>
<i>Where I'm supposed to be now</i>

214
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:08,411
<i>Gonna let the light shine on me</i>

215
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:11,419
<i>Now I've found who I am</i>

216
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:15,082
<i>There's no way to hold it in</i>

217
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,751
<i>No more hiding who I want to be</i>

218
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,988
I think he went that way.

219
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,087
<i>This is me</i>

220
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:39,474
Hello?

221
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:42,478
Hello?

222
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:47,546
Who's in here?

223
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,792
There you are, sweetie.
I've got all the food set up,

224
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,167
so you, princess, are free.

225
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,967
Got to find something to wear.

226
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:06,668
Honey, it's camp.
It's not a fashion show.

227
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,267
Have you seen these kids?
They have a lot.

228
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,971
My usual is not going to cut it.

229
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:15,211
Oh, I think you look cute,
in a non-mom way.

230
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,785
Totally.

231
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:20,322
This, this is safe.

232
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:21,981
It's also mine.

233
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:24,322
Honey, wear your own clothes.

234
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:25,985
You'll be fine.

235
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,596
Be yourself.

236
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,829
Oh, those are pretty.

237
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,502
Hey, Caitlyn.

238
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,044
Hey, Mitchie. This is Lola.
Lola, Mitchie.

239
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,080
So, is this your first year?

240
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:47,411
- Yeah. Any advice?
- You're gonna love it here.

241
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,816
And this year, I hear the food
is supposed to be better.

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,114
Let's hope.

243
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,280
<i>Hey, Camp Rockers!</i>

244
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,051
<i>Next up, let's have</i>
<i>a big Camp Rock welcome</i>

245
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,318
OPENING NIGHT JAM

246
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,587
<i>for Lola Scott!</i>

247
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,930
Wish me luck.

248
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:09,763
<i>Who's got what it takes to be my guy</i>

249
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:12,034
<i>What it takes to make me shine</i>

250
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:15,703

251

<i>What it takes to make this beat flow?</i>

254
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:27,482
<i>Everyone talks about</i>
<i>What they think they need</i>

255
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,990
<i>They making up a list of things</i>
<i>One, two, three</i>

256
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,357
<i>Everyone is different</i>
<i>but where we can agree</i>

257
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,657
<i>Every girl wants her boy</i>
<i>To treat her sweet</i>

258
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:37,062
<i>Don't think that being mean</i>
<i>Will get you anywhere</i>

259
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,328
<i>Don't think that acting cool</i>
<i>Will make me wanna care</i>

260
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,666
<i>I need your respect</i>
<i>If you're gonna be the one</i>

261
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:44,205
<i>And if you must apply</i>
<i>Then try to get the job done</i>

262
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:47,799

268
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,590
<i>I've been contemplating</i>

269
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:10,291
<i>What it takes</i>
<i>To make me give my heart</i>

270
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,927
<i>Could you be the one?</i>

271
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:19,407
<i>Standing in the crowd</i>
<i>I'm waiting to find out</i>

272
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,239
<i>I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, oh</i>

273
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:25,837

<i>What it takes to make this beat flow?</i>

279
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:52,003
Wow! She's amazing!

280
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,906
Yeah, she should be.
Her mom's on Broadway.

281
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,002
Broadway? Wow.

282
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:00,242
Yeah, but the kids around here
don't care about that.

283
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,578
It's all about the bling.

284
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:04,482
That's why Tess over there
runs this camp.

285
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:09,987
Great. Something wicked
this way comes.

286
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,082
Hey, Caitlyn.

287
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,958
Your folks still wowing them
on the cruise ship?

288
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:17,362
- Actually they work in...
- Hi, I'm Mitchie.

289
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,630
Oh, hi. I'm Tess Tyler.

290
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:25,606
- I know. Wow, I love your mom.
- Of course you do.

291
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,266
I'm Mitchie Torres.

292
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:30,608
Hey, is your dad Nicky Torres,
the composer?

293
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,544
My dad staged one of his shows.

294
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:33,673
No.

295
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,843
- So what does he do?
- He owns a hardware store.

296
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,087
But my mom...

297
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,455
- Yeah?
- What?

298
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:48,520
The president of Hot Tunes TV.

299
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:49,723
In China.

300
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:53,063
Yeah, it's a huge market over there.

301
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,002
- Wow. Cool.
- So cool.

302
00:17:56,105 --> 00:18:00,508
Major cool!
Okay, so have you met anybody?

303
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,373
Yeah, like everybody.

304
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:06,141
Last summer I was in, like,
three music videos.

305
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,876
Yeah, but, I mean,
you could hardly see me.

306
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:09,076
I was in the back.

307
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,675
- Wow.
- Wow.

308
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,778
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

309
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:16,120
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

310
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,022
What are we thinking?

311
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,360
There's an extra bed in our cabin.
It's yours if you want it.

312
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:23,762
- Really?
- Totally.

313
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:28,303
We're gonna be great friends.
Come on, sit with us in the VIP section.

314
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,676
I'm good. Thanks for asking.

315
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:39,745
Can you believe
not one of the cookbooks

316
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,249
has a recipe for chili for 300?

317
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:45,651
You don't need a recipe.
Everyone loves your food. It's official.

318
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,246
- Really?
- Camper's honor.

319
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,883
So, how was Opening Night Jam?
Did you sing?

320
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,188
No. But I met some girls,

321
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:53,922
and they want me
to move into their cabin.

322
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,327
And I know I have to help
in the kitchen,

323
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:56,955
but I'll just get up earlier
and meet you here.

324
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,159
Sweetie, of course you can move
into the cabin.

325
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,758
It'll be fine.

326
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:05,033
I got to get back to these cookbooks
'cause I got a rep to protect.

327
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,744
Peggy! Could you please stop that?
I can't hear.

328
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,479
Guys.

329
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,284
Which color?

330
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,951
Ella, they're exactly the same.

331
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,153
So you see my dilemma!

332
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:30,062
Mom? Hey. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm totally settled in.

333
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,293
Guess what? Shane Gray is...

334
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:38,332
Yeah. Yeah,
you can totally call me back.

335
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:39,772
Love you, too.

336
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,605
Have a good concert.

337
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:44,645
As usual.

338
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:46,078
What, Tess?

339
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,615
Hey, guys.

340
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,446
- Hey, Mitchie.
- Hey.

341
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:52,553
So, which bed is mine?

342
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,054
That one.

343
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,717
- But...
- Peggy doesn't mind. Do you?

344
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,392
I guess not.

345
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,860
One bag?

346
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:08,459
You can't possibly have all your clothes
in there.

347
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:12,864
Right. Well, I threw a lot
of my clothes away.

348
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, I just got tired of them.

349
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,738
And you kept this?

350
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,281
Yeah, well, it came from China.

351
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:22,749
A little boutique called <i>Shing Sha Ji. </i>

352
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,752
- Wow.
- Totally wow.

353
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:26,219
What does that mean?

354
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:29,485
Happy summer.
Yeah, that store is the bomb.

355
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,818
Wow! Really cool bracelet.

356
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,223
It's from my mom.

357
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,823
Every time she wins a Grammy,
she adds a charm.

358
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:41,961
Love it. Totally blingalicious.

359
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,739
So, is that your diary?

360
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,105
No. My songs.

361
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:50,042
You write songs?

362
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,979
Yeah, but they're probably
not that good.

363
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,174
Come on.

364
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:57,116
Well, I bet they are good.
Let's hear one.

365
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,212
- No.
- Why not? We're friends now, right?

366
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:03,857
Yeah. Okay.

367
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,529
<i>This is real, this is me</i>

368
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:15,070
<i>I'm exactly</i>
<i>where I'm supposed to be now</i>

369
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:18,834
<i>Gonna let the light shine on... </i>

370
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,439
Yeah, it's not really that good.

371
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:27,414
What? That was totally good.
Right, Tess?

372
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:28,711
Totally.

373
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,481
What the...

374
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,418
Mitchie?

375
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,387
You're dreaming.

376
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,289
You're a rock princess.

377
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:13,794
Okay. I rock.

378
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,840
Hey! Plenty of room over here,
<i>mi amore. </i>

379
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:02,968
- Yuck. You're going to chase her away.
- As usual.

380
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,637
- Good morning.
- Hey, guys.

381
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:05,839
- Hey.
- What's up?

382
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,779
Slumming, I see.

383
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:10,546
- What?
- Hey, Mitchie. Over here.

384
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,951
You better go. The queen awaits.

385
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,385
Your music. Are you any good?

386
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,591
I don't know. Maybe. Kind of.

387
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:21,754
Word of advice.

388
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:25,095
You wanna be friends with Tess,
don't be.

389
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:26,395
Mitchie.

390
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:30,795
See you around.

391
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:38,712
What happened to you this morning?

392
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,639
Um...

393
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,477
Early riser.

394
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:43,916
Yum. Toast.

395
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:49,656
- What?
- Rise and shine, superstar.

396
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,256
- Don't make me do this, Shane.
- Go away.

397
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,261
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.

398
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,233
Don't say I didn't warn you.

399
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,237
Fine. I'm up, okay? I'm up.

400
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,332
All right. We've both got classes
to teach. Yours starts in five.

401
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,771
And you might wanna put that mattress
out in the sun.

402
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:14,372
It's the only one you're gonna get.

403
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:17,615
Can you put some water in that vase?

404
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,654
Flowers look parched.

405
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:21,017
Four minutes!

406
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:39,772
Whoa!

407
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:44,608
If the class is a-rocking,
I'm-a glad I came knocking.

408
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:47,740
So, let's hear
what I'm working with this year.

409
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,318
- Who wants to sing first?
- Oh! Oh!

410
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:55,618
My goodness.
All right. Eeny, meeny, miny, you.

411
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,854
Me?

412
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,758
Can't argue with the finger.

413
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:02,262
I'll do it.

414
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:04,731
No. The finger picked her.

415
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,796
Well...

416
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,531
Okay.

417
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:19,909
Right. Let her rip.

418
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:26,479
<i>Who will I be? It's up to me... </i>

419
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:31,754
All right. I know you're singing a solo,
but it's so low, I can't hear you.

420
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:33,886
All right? So, bit louder.

421
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:43,060
<i>Who will I be? It's up to me</i>

422
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:49,600
<i>All the never-ending possibility</i>
<i>That I can see</i>

423
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:54,172
<i>There's nothing that I can't do</i>
<i>Who will I be?</i>

424
00:25:54,283 --> 00:26:00,153
<i>Yes, I believe I get to make the future</i>
<i>What I want to</i>

425
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:05,558
<i>If I can become anyone</i>
<i>and know the choice is up to me</i>

426
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,595
<i>Who will I be?</i>

427
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:10,630
She's great.

428
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,698
- That was great.
- That was so amazing.

429
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:16,260
That's not bad. Not bad at all.
Is that an original?

430
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:19,068
Yeah, but it's mine, but...

431
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:23,236
No buts. It's good.
Let me have a high five.

432
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:25,813
- Oh, thanks.
- All right.

433
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:29,245
I didn't know that you were
that good. You totally rocked it.

434
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,581
Totally.
- Thanks.

435
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,120
So, I've been thinking,

436
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:36,350
and you have to sing with us
in Final Jam.

437
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,690
Your vocals in the background would
be, like, amazing.

438
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:45,197
And we never let people in our group.
But you? A must. So you want in?

439
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:48,998
Well, I was thinking about singing solo
for Final Jam.

440
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:52,836
Solo in your first Final Jam?
That's brave.

441
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:53,931
You'll be fine.

442
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:58,377
Well, of course she'll be fine.
It's just that, I know how nervous I get.

443
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:01,382
Well, I'm sure I'll be nervous
at first, but...

444
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:04,509
In front of all those people,
but, yeah, you'll be fine.

445
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,850
- You've done it before.
- Done what before?

446
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:09,447
You've never sang
in front of an audience?

447
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,016
Well, yeah. I mean, choir.
I mean, I was never lead or anything,

448
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:16,326
and I was sort of in the back,
but it's still an audience.

449
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:20,300
Wow. You are brave.
Come on, girls. Let's get started.

450
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:22,768
Well, maybe a group would be better.

451
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:24,100
If you think so.

452
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:26,674
Yeah. No, it'll be fun. I want to.

453
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,209
- If you're sure.
- I'm totally sure.

454
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:33,608
- I gotta run.
- Where?

455
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:37,709
No. I mean, I got to call my mom.

456
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,185
China time.

457
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:42,484
Okay, okay. So, here's what...

458
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:48,619
- Sorry. I'm late.
- Oh. That's okay, honey.

459
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:50,756
The last batch of cookies
is in the oven.

460
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:51,924
You can start cleaning up.

461
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:55,026
I'm gonna take these down
to the storage room.

462
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:03,805
Hello?

463
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,107
Hello?

464
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:10,178
Hello?

465
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,345
I can hear you.

466
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:22,586
Hi.

467
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:24,957
Do you work here?

468
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,404
Yes.

469
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:33,032
Wow. You really get into your work.

470
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,769
I'm Shane.

471
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,708
But I'm sure
even the kitchen help knows that.

472
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:40,805
- Of course. It's nice to meet you.
- Actually, it's not so nice.

473
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:43,749
See, my manager said he sent over
my food allergy list,

474
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:47,754
but since I couldn't even go near
my breakfast this morning...

475
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:51,383
- Can I just talk to whoever's in charge?
- Excuse me?

476
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:52,517
What?

477
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,858
Well, you're kind of being a jerk.

478
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:57,159
- And you are?
- A person!

479
00:28:57,266 --> 00:29:00,793
And there's a way to talk to a person
and that's not it.

480
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:07,597
Well, I'll have my manager
send it over again.

481
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,802
Fine.

482
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,081
Thank you?

483
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,518
Much better.

484
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:28,993
Yeah, I like that.

485
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:30,725
I don't need a chaperone, Unc.

486
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,802
Seeing how you blew off
your class yesterday, you sort of do.

487
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,961
I didn't sign up for this.

488
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:39,006
- Get my agent on the phone.
- "Get my agent"?

489
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,167
What happened to you, man?

490
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:44,940
That kid on that TV,
that's not who you really are.

491
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:47,447
In there, Shane.

492
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:50,416
What happened to the kid
who just loved music?

493
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,044
- He grew up.
- Big whoop!

494
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:55,851
Stop acting like it's all about you.

495
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,687
In my world, it is.

496
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:02,522
Oh, look. We're in my world.

497
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:06,362
And in my world, you're considered
an instructor at this camp,

498
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:09,437
which means you've got to instruct.

499
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,206
Starting with hip-hop dance at 2:00.

500
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,436
And five, six, seven, eight.

501
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,386
And five, six, seven, eight.

502
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,085
Okay, you guys. Remember,
when he gets here, act cool.

503
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:34,424
Wait, when who gets here?

504
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,191
Shane.

505
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:39,790
Wait, he's teaching this class?

506
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,426
Great.

507
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:44,005
Wait, is that flour in your hair?

508
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,407
No. No, it's Chinese body powder.

509
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,137
Pretty cool, huh?

510
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:54,614
Grab a mike and a hat.
Follow me if you can.

511
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,319
Hurry.

512
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:01,684
Let's go.

513
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:05,919
Hurry.

514
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:12,894
<i>Yeah</i>

515
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:17,264
<i>First stop hit the groove</i>
<i>Let the music play</i>

516
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:21,469
<i>Next stop yeah everybody</i>
<i>It's time to celebrate</i>

517
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:24,546
<i>Here we go so let your flow show</i>
<i>Make the dreams you got become real</i>

518
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:25,670
Across the floor.

519
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:29,239
<i>Let's do this, let me hear you now</i>
<i>Show me how you feel</i>

520
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,717
<i>Let's start, start, start the party</i>

521
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,688
<i>Come on, come on, everyone</i>
<i>Let's sta-sta-start the party</i>

522
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,759
<i>What you waiting for now?</i>

523
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,055
<i>Start, start, start the party</i>

524
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:43,996
<i>Come on, come on live it up</i>
<i>Let's sta-sta-start the party</i>

525
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:45,088
Everyone circle. Face the front.

526
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,730
<i>I know you're never gonna wanna stop</i>
<i>Let the music take us to paradise</i>

527
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,404
<i>Let's close our eyes</i>
<i>Feel the groove wanna shake us</i>

528
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:02,610
<i>Everywhere and everybody turn it up</i>
<i>Let's start the party</i>

529
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,021
<i>Party</i>

530
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,390
<i>Gonna have a good night</i>

531
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,792
<i>Party</i>

532
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:21,301
<i>Let's start, start, start the party</i>

533
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:24,201
<i>Come on, come on, everyone</i>
<i>Let's sta-sta-start the party</i>

534
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:25,330
Crisscross.

535
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,409
<i>What you waiting for now?</i>

536
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:29,670
<i>Start, start, start the party</i>

537
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:33,509
<i>Come on, come on, live it up</i>
<i>Let's sta-sta-start the party</i>

538
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:35,640
<i>I know you're never gonna wanna</i>
<i>Come on let me hear you holler</i>

539
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:37,946
<i>Party's never ever gonna stop</i>

540
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,088
Talk about dancing to the beat
of a different drum.

541
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:46,984
You any good on the drums?

542
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,162
Man, you're a drummer, dude.

543
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,936
The drummer controls the beat.

544
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,373
The rhythm's in your hands.

545
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:02,967
Yeah, I guess.

546
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:05,069
Now we just have to work on getting
that beat from those sticks

547
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,647
to those feet.

548
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:13,379
Where were you this morning?

549
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,920
- Oh, no.
- Hi, girls.

550
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:19,783
Hi.

551
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:23,431
Hi. So, yummy breakfast.

552
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,466
Oh. How would you know?

553
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,296
There's hardly anything on your plate.

554
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:31,099
Morning carbs, definite no-no.

555
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:32,230
Yeah.

556
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:35,242
Well, I just wanted
to meet Mitchie's new friends.

557
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:37,278
This is Ella, Peggy, and Tess.

558
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:38,676
- Hi.
- Hi.

559
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,111
- Hi.
- Hello.

560
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:47,911
Well, I see you girls are really busy,
so I'll talk to you later.

561
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,689
Okay. Do you know her?

562
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:53,885
Yeah, don't you?

563
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:55,486
She's cooked for everybody

564
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:59,431
from Jessica and Nick pre-breakup
to Pharrell.

565
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,230
Really?

566
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:03,964
Yeah, I'm shocked
the camp even got her.

567
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:07,439
You mean, Jessica ate these eggs?

568
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,537
Yeah.

569
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:24,624
That's cool.

570
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,459
- It's like your old stuff.
- Yeah.

571
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,656
I was thinking the group can change up
our sound.

572
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,699
Do some different stuff.

573
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,965
So you coming up to the campfire?

574
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,696
Yeah, right.

575
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:38,932
All right. Well, you sit in here
by yourself, superstar.

576
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,373
'Cause you're right. Way cooler.

577
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,287
So, your friends, they seem nice.

578
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,254
Tess is interesting.

579
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,890
I know, but she's better
once you get to know her.

580
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:10,404
Yeah? And have you?
Have you gotten to know her?

581
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:12,370
Yeah. I guess.

582
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:15,374
I don't know. She just doesn't seem
like she's your type, you know.

583
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:18,002
- You've always been so...
- Invisible.

584
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,812
I was going to say independent.

585
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:28,716
Hurry up and finish those potatoes
if you wanna get to the campfire.

586
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:37,598
So we call this the Campfire Jam.
It's about expression.

587
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:40,497
The freedom to be
who you really wanna be.

588
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:43,531
Hit it!

589
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:05,093
<i>I'm too cool for my dress</i>
<i>These shades don't leave my head</i>

590
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:08,390
<i>Everything you say is so irrelevant</i>

591
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:11,557
<i>You follow and I lead</i>
<i>You wanna be like me</i>

592
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:16,366
<i>But you're just a wannabe</i>
<i>Love it or hate it</i>

593
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,770
<i>Me, myself, and I agree</i>

594
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,639
<i>You'll never catch up with me</i>

595
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:24,735
<i>'Cause I'm too cool</i>

596
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,074
<i>Too cool</i>

597
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:30,345
<i>Yeah, I'm too cool to know you</i>

598
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:33,649
<i>Don't take it personal</i>
<i>Don't get emotional</i>

599
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:37,350
<i>You know it's the truth</i>
<i>I'm too cool for you</i>

600
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:41,156
<i>You think you're hot</i>
<i>But I'm sorry you're not exactly</i>

601
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,993
<i>who you think you are</i>

602
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,966
<i>Can't tell you what</i>
<i>What you haven't got</i>

603
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,335
<i>But when we walk into the room</i>
<i>I'm too cool for you</i>

604
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,908
<i>You see some are born</i>
<i>With beauty brains and talent</i>

605
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:56,136
<i>And they got it all</i>

606
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,842
<i>While others have to try all their lives</i>

607
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:03,918
<i>Still they never get the call</i>

608
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:08,213
<i>That's the difference</i>
<i>between you and me</i>

609
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,791
<i>Obviously</i>

610
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:15,823
<i>I'm a natural, I'm the real deal</i>

611
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:20,231
<i>I can't help the way I am</i>

612
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:23,099
<i>Hope you don't misunderstand</i>

613
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,173
<i>But I'm too cool</i>

614
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:26,570
<i>Too cool</i>

615
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:30,805
<i>Yeah, I'm too cool to know you</i>

616
00:37:30,912 --> 00:37:34,143
<i>Don't take it personal</i>
<i>Don't get emotional</i>

617
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:38,310
<i>You know it's the truth</i>
<i>I'm too cool for you</i>

618
00:37:57,372 --> 00:37:59,567
Did you enjoy singing backup?

619
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,321
Can't a guy get some peace?

620
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:20,553
Sorry.

621
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:24,027
- Sorry.
- You said that already.

622
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,290
I'm sorry. I...

623
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:30,994
Was that you playing?
It sounded kind of different.

624
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:34,041
Than my usual stupid cookie-cutter
pop star stuff?

625
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:37,339
- Sorry to disappoint.
- You didn't.

626
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,605
I liked it.

627
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:42,444
I mean, it was good
for stupid cookie-cutter pop star stuff.

628
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:47,179
Wow, you really know
how to make a guy feel better.

629
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,655
I thought you loved your sound.
You created it.

630
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:52,989
- You're like a Camp Rock legend.
- Some legend.

631
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:57,155
I only played the music
that the label thinks will sell. That's it.

632
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,665
You don't think that song would sell?

633
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:01,201
I don't know.

634
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:05,001
Well, you'll never know if you don't try.

635
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:10,341
And, by the way, I know of one girl
that would buy that song.

636
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:20,746
Oh, I'm so sorry!

637
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:24,387
Actually, I'm so not.

638
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,384
I would respond, but...

639
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:29,429
But you are responding
by saying that you're not responding.

640
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,158
Shut up.

641
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:36,631
Okay, that was on purpose.

642
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:40,731
Doesn't matter.
Anything makes that outfit look better.

643
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,469
See?

644
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,169
Okay.

645
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:46,770
- Nice, Caitlyn.
- Good shot.

646
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:49,976
Stop. Hey, no, you guys, stop!

647
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:53,177
- Stop.
- My spaghetti slipped.

648
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:55,256
I can't believe you did that!

649
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:56,847
Neither can I.

650
00:39:58,393 --> 00:39:59,553
Busted.

651
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:11,235
I hate when I have to be uncool.

652
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:16,935
Lay it on me.

653
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,535
- She's always been jealous of me...
- She's impossible.

654
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:21,115
...and she cannot stand the fact
that I'm probably to win Final Jam,

655
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:23,582
- so she spilled...
- Whoa!

656
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:26,245
Enough. Make it plain.

657
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:29,221
Who was the first one to throw food?

658
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:31,121
That's easy. Caitlyn.

659
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,428
- That's technically true, but...
- No buts.

660
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:45,899
Since you wanna play with food,

661
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:48,874
I can hook you up
with a job this summer.

662
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:52,071
From here on out,
you're on kitchen duty.

663
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,943
What? I mean...

664
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:57,041
Ew.

665
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:01,347
- But...
- Again with the buts.

666
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:05,053
Look, it's settled.

667
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:08,662
Happy cooking.

668
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:11,998
Thanks a lot.

669
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,472
- Oh!
- You hungry?

670
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,206
Just a little bit.

671
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:29,045
Do you have a second?

672
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:30,712
Um...

673
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,853
- Sure.
- I wanna run something by you.

674
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:54,068
<i>Every time I think</i>
<i>I'm closer to the heart</i>

675
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:59,579
<i>Of what it means to know</i>
<i>Just who I am</i>

676
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:04,518
<i>I think I finally found</i>
<i>A better place to start</i>

677
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,516
<i>But no one ever seems to understand</i>

678
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,328
<i>I need to try to get to where you are</i>

679
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:22,033
<i>Could it be you're not that far?</i>

680
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:25,470
<i>You're the voice I hear inside my head</i>

681
00:42:25,573 --> 00:42:27,700
<i>The reason that I'm singing</i>

682
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:30,573
<i>I need to find you</i>

683
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:33,374
<i>I got to find you</i>

684
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:39,545
<i>You're the missing piece</i>
<i>I need the song inside of me</i>

685
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:42,214
<i>I need to find you</i>

686
00:42:42,323 --> 00:42:44,757
<i>I got to find you</i>

687
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:51,765
<i>I've been feeling lost</i>
<i>Can't find the words to say</i>

688
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:57,670
<i>Spending all my time</i>
<i>Stuck in yesterday</i>

689
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:03,468
<i>Where you are is where I wanna be</i>

690
00:43:04,612 --> 00:43:10,642
<i>Oh, next to you, and you next to me</i>

691
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:17,123
<i>Oh, I need to find you</i>

692
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:24,061
<i>You're the voice I hear inside my head</i>

693
00:43:24,165 --> 00:43:29,364
<i>The reason that I'm singing</i>
<i>I need to find you</i>

694
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:32,998
<i>I got to find you</i>

695
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:38,102
<i>You're the missing piece</i>
<i>I need the song inside of me</i>

696
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:41,080
<i>I need to find you</i>

697
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:43,650
<i>I got to find you</i>

698
00:43:47,088 --> 00:43:48,146
Wow.

699
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,948
I heard this girl singing,

700
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,494
and it kind of reminded me
of the music that I liked.

701
00:43:54,596 --> 00:43:56,928
So I started playing around
with some chords, and...

702
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,523
- I know it's not finished, but...
- No. No, it's good.

703
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:03,068
It's really good. And I don't lie.

704
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

705
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:12,607
I don't know.

706
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:14,443
You seem different.

707
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:17,907
Good different.

708
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:22,815
Yeah. Definitely different.

709
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:32,089
So, I better get going.

710
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,168
Back to the kitchen?

711
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,238
- What?
- To get some dip for these chips?

712
00:44:38,206 --> 00:44:40,037
Oh!

713
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:43,338
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

714
00:44:55,957 --> 00:44:58,425
Hey, Mom, how you doing?

715
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:00,824
I'm all right. How are you?

716
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:04,660
I am great.
I'm wonderful, I'm fantastic, I'm...

717
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:07,257
- Putting chips into bowls...
- Right.

718
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:11,729
Hey, Mrs. Torres.

719
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,637
Hi, Caitlyn. Thanks for coming in early.

720
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:16,676
Taco Night takes
the entire kitchen staff

721
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:18,439
and our six hands.

722
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:20,474
Six?

723
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:22,277
Yeah. My daughter.

724
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:24,351
So can you please start in
on the onions?

725
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,615
Brown wants to talk to me
about next week's campfire pig-out.

726
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:28,814
Sure.

727
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,127
Hey! You must be hands five and six.

728
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:37,392
I didn't know Connie had a daughter.
I'm Caitlyn.

729
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,231
Do you need some help?

730
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:48,068
Mitchie?

731
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,643
Wait a minute.

732
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:54,181
You're the cook's daughter.
She's your mom.

733
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:56,750
Oh, this is rich.

734
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,081
But apparently you're not.

735
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:03,556
So what are you waiting for, huh?
Run. Go tell everybody.

736
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:06,684
- Maybe I should.
- Fine. Whatever.

737
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:10,321
How long did you think
you could keep your little secret?

738
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:13,124
Longer than this.

739
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:14,258
Why?

740
00:46:15,436 --> 00:46:17,404
- Why do you care?
- Oh, I don't.

741
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:20,030
But when I tell everybody,
I want the whole backstory.

742
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:22,735
I just wanted to fit in, okay?

743
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:26,336
I think your whole charade is stupid
and immature.

744
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,972
You're hiding behind some crazy lie.

745
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:34,353
What about you, huh? You hide, too!

746
00:46:34,455 --> 00:46:37,253
The whole
"I don't care about anything" attitude?

747
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,191
Well, if you don't care,
why are you here?

748
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:45,497
What happened to you?

749
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:49,163
She got drowned in her lies.

750
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,760
What, Caitlyn?

751
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,001
Nothing.

752
00:46:56,377 --> 00:46:59,005
- Caitlyn, wait!
- No, no, no, no. You can talk later.

753
00:46:59,113 --> 00:47:02,571
First you got to get out
of these wet clothes. Come on.

754
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:06,686
Says here in this magazine
I'm Shane's type.

755
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:09,552
It's just a matter of time.

756
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:12,524
"Warm, funny, talented."

757
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:14,754
You? I don't get it.

758
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,963
- Hey, guys, what are you doing?
- The question is, what were you doing?

759
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:22,730
- You're always AWOL.
- What?

760
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,430
Hey, Mitchie, I was thinking.

761
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,873
After camp, maybe we could come
to visit you and your mom in China

762
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:31,501
and go to that Happy Summer store.

763
00:47:31,612 --> 00:47:33,807
Sure. My mom would like that.

764
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:39,442
Okay, guys.
Tonight is the Pajama Jam.

765
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:43,217
So, outfit check.
White shorts and green hoodies.

766
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:47,153
What? Green is Shane's favorite color.

767
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,229
It was in the magazine.

768
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:07,640
- All right!
- The other lemmings are over there.

769
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:10,479
- Look, Caitlyn, about what...
- Save it, Mitchie.

770
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:12,780
If that's even your real name.

771
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:18,520
- Hey.
- Hi.

772
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,620
Are we ready?

773
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:25,699
Where are your T-shirt and shorts?

774
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,030
Yeah, I thought that we were supposed
to wear the same thing?

775
00:48:29,137 --> 00:48:31,162
The backup singers should wear
the same thing.

776
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:33,331
Not the lead singer, hello!

777
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:38,512
<i>Next, give it up for the awesome</i>
<i>Caitlyn Geller!</i>

778
00:48:41,716 --> 00:48:44,844
<i>And this is in honor</i>
<i>of you awesome Camp Rockers. </i>

779
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:49,186
<i></i>

780
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,093
She's really good.

781
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:03,394
Hey. Shane likes her, too.

782
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:10,610
Help! Help, there's a snake! Snake!

783
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:15,711
It's just the power cord
to the sound system, Tess.

784
00:49:15,817 --> 00:49:18,581
Oh. Right. My bad.

785
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:23,883
- You are so full of it!
- What?

786
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:26,118
You can't stand
that people might actually like

787
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:28,024
what other people do.

788
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,425
Okay. What is that?

789
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:34,968
She said, "Whatever, major loser."

790
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:40,465
Oh, wow, Tess.
"Whatever, major loser?"

791
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:44,978
That is so last year.
I mean, everyone knows that.

792
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:48,879
Oh, well, I guess not everyone.

793
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:07,591
Hey! Does this look like a record, girls?

794
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:08,691
Huh?

795
00:50:08,803 --> 00:50:11,966
I mean, a CD.
Does this cookie look like a CD?

796
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:16,134
'Cause I want it to look authentic
next to my eighth note cupcakes.

797
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:19,070
Everything looks great, Connie.

798
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,375
These theme nights are so busy, huh?

799
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:24,280
Oh, I gotta go get the ice cream
for my Rolling Stone cones!

800
00:50:24,385 --> 00:50:25,852
See you later.

801
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:29,288
So, did you sign up for Final Jam?

802
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,117
Yeah.

803
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:35,818
So, what are you thinking about doing?

804
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,524
This is freaking me out.
Why are we talking?

805
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:41,227
I don't know. Maybe I'm slumming?

806
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:46,667
Or maybe I wanted to set
you up for that!

807
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,334
My gosh.

808
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:56,882
So, thank you for yesterday, but...

809
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:59,612
Hey. I always stick up for my friends.

810
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,086
It's fun being friends with Tess.

811
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:04,081
How would you know?

812
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:09,254
Because I was friends with Tess.
I know, it's hard to believe.

813
00:51:09,363 --> 00:51:12,161
More like impossible. What happened?

814
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:16,200
Tess doesn't like competition,
and she felt I was.

815
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:19,398
See, with her, there can only be
one star. Herself.

816
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:23,032
Look, I know it's fun being
friends with her.

817
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:27,877
She can make you feel so important
and she's popular, but so what?

818
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:31,474
Oh, come on.
Being popular is so not a "so what."

819
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:34,115
No, there are perks.

820
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,820
Like... Well, like...

821
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:39,715
Like singing backup to Tess
all the time?

822
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:42,455
Like never getting to say
what you really feel?

823
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:45,293
Oh, and those exciting short outfits?

824
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,900
Those were real high points.
You're right. Sell your soul.

825
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,606
Hey. I'm on your side.

826
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:57,769
Oh, shoot.
I was supposed to go meet up with...

827
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:01,310
We're practicing for Final Jam.

828
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:04,248
Of course. Her Highness awaits.

829
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:11,723
<i>Hand-clapping,</i>
<i>hip-shaking... </i>

830
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:14,785
Hello?

831
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:16,362
Hey, buddy,
how's my birdhouse coming?

832
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:17,897
- Jason!
- Sorry. It's not my fault

833
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:19,091
you didn't ask him to
make you anything.

834
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,861
- I didn't want anything.
- Well, I wanted a birdhouse! So what?

835
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:21,935
And what do you need a birdhouse for?

836
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:23,230
Because I wanted to see
more birds in...

837
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:24,964
Guys. Guys.

838
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:26,164
Sorry.

839
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,104
Listen. About me recording
with a camper.

840
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:30,939
- You gotta do it, man. No go-backs.
- Yeah. No go-backs.

841
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:32,239
It's, like, the Golden Rule.

842
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:34,109
No, dude, the Golden Rule
is "Tell the truth."

843
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:35,614
Dude, then it can be, like,
the Silver Rule.

844
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:37,809
- Why is it the Silver Rule?
- Okay, fine, the Copper Rule.

845
00:52:37,918 --> 00:52:39,579
- The Copper Rule?
- Well, give me tin at least.

846
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:40,745
Guys.

847
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:42,286
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

848
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,255
Listen. I've been thinking about
the whole recording thing,

849
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:46,155
and I think it's really cool.

850
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,591
Are you getting too much sun?

851
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:49,720
'Cause we can bring you a hat
when we come to visit.

852
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,494
I'm fine. And remember, whoever wins,
no go-backs. See you guys Saturday.

853
00:52:57,538 --> 00:52:59,062
Now I just have to find that girl
with the voice.

854
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:04,242
Hey, Andy! Buddy.
You wanna do me a favor?

855
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:05,703
Sure.

856
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:14,744
Shane Gray is looking for the girl
with the voice.

857
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:18,586
<i>Start, start, start the party</i>

00:53:55,796 --> 00:53:57,388

<i>I know you're never gonna wanna stop</i>

876
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:11,409
<i>Let the music take us to paradise</i>

877
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:13,241
<i>Let's close our eyes</i>

878
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:18,182
<i>Feel the groove</i>
<i>Wanna shake us</i>

879
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,877
Aren't you gonna get in line?

880
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:23,479
Oh, it's not me. Trust.
Anyway, he's never heard me sing.

881
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:28,287
<i>Turn on that radio</i>

882
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:31,387
<i>As loud as it can go</i>

883
00:54:31,499 --> 00:54:35,367
<i>Gotta dance until my feet</i>
<i>can't feel the ground</i>

884
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,135
So, does your voice sound better
over here?

885
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:44,638
Why don't we get in one of these things
and you can tell me.

886
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,846
Really?
- Yeah. It was awesome.

887
00:54:50,684 --> 00:54:51,742
Yeah.

888
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:55,946
I don't think
we're doing this right.

889
00:54:56,056 --> 00:54:58,650
What? You don't like going in circles?

890
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:04,531
So, have you found
your special girl yet?

891
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,365
Why? Are you jealous?

892
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:09,095
- Jerk.
- Hey.

893
00:55:09,203 --> 00:55:12,229
Being a jerk is a part
of the rock star image.

894
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:15,407
Keeping up an image can be tiring.

895
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:17,836
But it keeps the posers away.

896
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:23,411
I never know if people are hanging with
me for the free stuff or for the parties.

897
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:25,678
Oh. Definitely the free stuff.

898
00:55:25,786 --> 00:55:26,775
Funny.

899
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:28,855
Come on.
I know you're really not a jerk.

900
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:31,288
I mean, you're helping Andy
with his dancing,

901
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:34,225
and those screaming girls
seem to like you.

902
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:36,319
Which brings me back
to the whole jealous thing.

903
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,796
I take that back. You are a jerk.

904
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:55,611
- It must be the same for you, too, huh?
- What?

905
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:58,241
Because of your mom,
and her job at Hot Tunes.

906
00:55:58,352 --> 00:56:00,684
People probably are always
fake around you.

907
00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:03,757
Yeah. Right. Totally.

908
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:08,591
You know, it's nice talking
to someone who gets it.

909
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:11,631
Yeah. Me, too.

910
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:23,509
Seriously, Mom.
Okay, we're done with the dishes.

911
00:56:23,611 --> 00:56:25,203
Okay, girls, have fun at the campfire.

912
00:56:25,312 --> 00:56:26,506
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks.

913
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:29,139
- I love you, Mom.
- Love you, too. Bye!

914
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,255

<i>Hey, guys. I got a surprise for you. </i>

921
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:07,513
<i>Guys, come on out. </i>

922
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,760
<i>So we're gonna play something new. </i>
<i>Let us know what you think. </i>

923
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:28,532
<i>Music</i>

924
00:57:29,043 --> 00:57:34,481

00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:39,713
<i>Can't feel the ground</i>

927
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:45,224
<i>Say goodbye to all my fears</i>
<i>One good song, they disappear</i>

928
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:48,784
<i>And nothing in the world</i>
<i>can bring me down</i>

929
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:50,625
<i>Can bring me down</i>

930
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:53,892
<i>Hand-clapping</i>
<i>Hip-shaking</i>

931
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,561
<i>Heartbreaking</i>
<i>There's no faking</i>

932
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:01,903
<i>What you feel</i>
<i>when you ride it home, yeah</i>

933
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:07,379
<i>Music's in my soul</i>
<i>I can hear it</i>

934
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:09,972
<i>Every day</i>
<i>And every night</i>

935

<i>It's the one thing on my mind</i>

00:58:12,886 --> 00:58:16,344
<i>Music's got control</i>

<i>And I'm never letting go, no, no</i>

938
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:25,024
<i>I just wanna play my music</i>

939
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,958
<i>Music</i>

940
00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:34,335
<i>Got my six-string on my back</i>
<i>Don't need anything but that</i>

941
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:37,535
<i>Everything I want is here with me</i>

942
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:39,305
<i>Here with me</i>

943
00:58:39,413 --> 00:58:44,578
<i>So forget that fancy car</i>
<i>I don't need to go that far</i>

944
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:50,214
<i>And what's driving me is</i>
<i>following my dreams, yeah</i>

945
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:53,215
<i>Hand-clapping</i>
<i>Earth-shaking</i>

946
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:55,989
<i>Heartbreaking</i>
<i>There's no faking</i>

947
00:58:56,096 --> 00:58:59,998
<i>What you feel</i>
<i>When you're on a roll</i>

948
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,362
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

949
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:05,234
<i>Music's in my soul</i>

950
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:06,738
<i>I can hear it</i>

951
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,400
<i>Every day</i>
<i>And every night</i>

952
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,138
<i>It's the one thing on my mind</i>

953
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:15,738
<i>Music's got control</i>

954
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:20,218
<i>And I'm never letting go, no, no</i>

955
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,845
<i>I just wanna play my music</i>

956
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:26,551
<i>I just wanna play my music</i>

957
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,855
<i>Can't imagine what it'd be like</i>

958
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:30,054
<i>What it'd be like</i>

959
00:59:30,164 --> 00:59:36,034
<i>Without the sound of all my heroes</i>
<i>singing all my favorite songs</i>

960
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:39,162
<i>So I can sing along</i>

<i>Music's in my soul</i>

01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,791
<i>Every day</i>
<i>And every night</i>

01:00:11,572 --> 01:00:15,064
<i>Music's got control</i>

<i>I just wanna play my music</i>

01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:25,213
<i>All night long</i>

975
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:27,479
Yeah!

976
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:45,567
Man, they loved it. You were right.

977
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:47,970
I know I was right. What did I do?

978
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:51,533
Not you. Shane.
The label has to let us do this.

979
01:00:51,645 --> 01:00:53,704
They won't. Look at what they made us
call the band.

980
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:56,408
Yeah! How can we do that?

981
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,945
If we hit the studio tonight, we can
get them a demo by tomorrow.

982
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:00,485
I mean, they can't say no
once they hear this.

983
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:01,645
They can't?

984
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:05,280
Guys, I can't just leave.
I'm not finished here yet.

985
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:06,984
All right, man. Do what you gotta do.

986
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:09,062
We are talking about finishing
my birdhouse, right?

987
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:12,155
- Come on! See you at Final Jam.
- Bye.

988
01:01:14,468 --> 01:01:15,958
off the chain. That was so great.

989
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:19,362
That was the best song ever.
It was so great.

990
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:22,374
- That was so amazing. And...
- I know, he was so...

991
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:23,868
Did you see them?

992
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:27,413
Hey, Mitchie.
Tell us about your mom again.

993
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:33,085
Her mom is a great person.
What's your mom like?

994
01:01:33,887 --> 01:01:35,445
She's like a mom.

995
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:41,393
I mean, I know she's the president
of Hot Tunes TV China,

996
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,898
but tell me again about
how important she is.

997
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:46,192
She...

998
01:01:47,734 --> 01:01:49,292
I'm sorry. What?

999
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:53,034
She's pretty cool.

1000
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,866
And...

1001
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:03,140
And she's not the president
of Hot Tunes TV China.

1002
01:02:04,184 --> 01:02:07,950
What's that? She's not president?

1003
01:02:08,822 --> 01:02:11,484
You mean, you lied to everybody?

1004
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:12,881
No. I was...

1005
01:02:12,993 --> 01:02:16,360
So, she's what? A vice president?
Treasurer?

1006
01:02:16,463 --> 01:02:17,521
Tess.

1007
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:21,498
Shut up. Go on. Tell us.

1008
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:24,561
No.

1009
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,501
- She's a cook.
- A cook?

1010
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,169
At Hot Tunes China.

1011
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:34,073
No.

1012
01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:36,407
Here.

1013
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:39,051
So you lied.

1014
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,183
Your mom cooks our food,
and you help her.

1015
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:46,886
That's the only way you could
afford this camp, right?

1016
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:49,053
You're a real jerk.

1017
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:52,757
Maybe. But at least
I'm not a big, fat liar.

1018
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:55,557
Come on, guys.

1019
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:56,863
Mitchie.

1020
01:02:58,038 --> 01:03:01,064
Mitchie has dishes to do. Let's go.

1021
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,299
Shane.

1022
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:06,174
- You were lying all summer?
- Yes, but I...

1023
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,874
You know, I'm so used to
people pretending around me.

1024
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:12,076
- I was not pretending!
- And I really thought you were different.

1025
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:13,846
But you're just like everyone else.

1026
01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:17,321
You wanted to be friends
with Shane Gray, not me.

1027
01:03:17,424 --> 01:03:20,018
- Trick's on me, huh?
- I was just trying...

1028
01:03:20,127 --> 01:03:23,528
Save it for your interview
with <i>Pop Informer</i> magazine.

1029
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:26,324
I know I gave you an earful.

1030
01:03:29,202 --> 01:03:31,329
Not here, you don't. Come on.

1031
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,352
So what exactly happened last night?

1032
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:53,824
Nothing.

1033
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:57,522
Didn't look like nothing to me, mate.
You look crushed.

1034
01:03:57,631 --> 01:04:00,259
Pummeled. Absolutely destroyed.

1035
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,198
I got it, Uncle Brown.

1036
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:04,666
Look, whatever.

1037
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:08,636
I'm just gonna focus on my music.
Change my sound.

1038
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:12,269
I don't wanna get sidetracked
with liking someone anyway.

1039
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,607
You still looking for that girl?

1040
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:16,740
What?

1041
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:19,577
I'm plugged into the
camp gossip, mate.

1042
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,614
It's crazy.
I have her song stuck in my head.

1043
01:04:24,224 --> 01:04:26,852
<i>This is real</i>
<i>This is me</i>

1044
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,056
<i>I'm exactly where</i>
<i>I'm supposed to be now</i>

1045
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:33,098
<i>Gonna let the light</i>

1046
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:47,372
Mitchie's
Songs

1047
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,608
"This is real, this is me,

1048
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:52,480
"I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1049
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:55,146
"Gonna let the light shine on me."

1050
01:05:01,962 --> 01:05:05,363
Mitchie, you are so never
going to see Final Jam.

1051
01:05:17,944 --> 01:05:19,741
What a joke.

1052
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:28,180
"I hope you
don't misunderstand. I'm just too cool."

1053
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:31,451
You know? I mean,
"I'm like too over you."

1054
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,321
You know what I mean?

1055
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,593
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

1056
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:45,035
So, Final Jam is coming up,
and I know you're all very excited.

1057
01:05:45,138 --> 01:05:47,504
Yeah! You know it!

1058
01:05:48,642 --> 01:05:50,439
So here's some advice.

1059
01:05:52,913 --> 01:05:55,108
It's not all about your image.

1060
01:05:56,183 --> 01:06:00,051
None of it means anything unless
people see who you really are.

1061
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:04,555
And your music has to be
who you really are.

1062
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:09,795
It's gotta show how you feel.
Or it doesn't mean anything.

1063
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:18,066
I didn't know you felt so ashamed
of yourself.

1064
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:19,866
I'm not ashamed.

1065
01:06:19,973 --> 01:06:23,670
It's just, for once, I just wanted
to fit in and be popular.

1066
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:26,837
What do you mean?
You have plenty of friends at home.

1067
01:06:26,947 --> 01:06:30,713
I have one. And the last time I checked,
no one was busting their butts

1068
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:34,548
to sit next to us at the lunch table.
And when I got here I just...

1069
01:06:34,654 --> 01:06:38,784
I just wanted it to be different.
You know? Just once.

1070
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:44,797
My sweetie, you are so much
more than you can see.

1071
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:47,958
You don't have to lie about
who or what you are.

1072
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:51,666
I'm not just saying it
'cause I'm your mom!

1073
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:53,096
Mom.

1074
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,234
Okay, I admit I'm a little bit biased.

1075
01:06:56,576 --> 01:07:00,034
But it is so true. You are talented.

1076
01:07:00,447 --> 01:07:03,939
Your music speaks to people.
People wanna listen to you.

1077
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,484
And it is not just me and your dad.

1078
01:07:10,223 --> 01:07:12,282
That's what I said.

1079
01:07:15,128 --> 01:07:18,063
That was funny.
I know, I want to do that.

1080
01:07:22,235 --> 01:07:24,635
Hey, guys. Can I sit with you?

1081
01:07:27,574 --> 01:07:30,771
I guess.
But you have to give me your cake.

1082
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,042
Okay, deal.

1083
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:38,078
You know, sitting with the kitchen help
is really hurting my rep.

1084
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,412
What rep?

1085
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:44,719
Believe me, it's probably not that funny.

1086
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,425
The chicken was kind of dry.

1087
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:56,024
Could you tell your mom to be
just a little more careful?

1088
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:57,664
Tess!

1089
01:08:00,307 --> 01:08:04,266
Stop talking to me like that.
Stop talking to everyone like that.

1090
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:07,645
I may be the cook's daughter,
and my father may not be rich,

1091
01:08:07,747 --> 01:08:10,807
but I'm a much better person than
someone who feels good about herself

1092
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:13,613
because she makes everyone
else feel bad.

1093
01:08:13,753 --> 01:08:15,584
And I'll take that any day.

1094
01:08:15,689 --> 01:08:18,817
If it wasn't obvious,
you're so out of the group.

1095
01:08:23,697 --> 01:08:25,892
Then we'll make our own group.

1096
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,158
CAMP ROCK
FINAL JAM - 5 DAYS

1097
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:40,806
FINAL JAM
PREP

1098
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:46,205
- I don't know why this is so fascinating.
- I don't think you're doing that right.

1099
01:09:46,312 --> 01:09:49,679
- Wait. Look, I'm a pro.
- Don't get it in my macaroni.

1100
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:51,216
I'm sure they have it!

1101
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,717
Okay, she has officially lost it.

1102
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,789
No, I didn't lose anything.
You guys stole it.

1103
01:09:57,557 --> 01:09:59,286
- What?
- What's going on here?

1104
01:09:59,392 --> 01:10:03,795
Tess thinks that Mitchie and Caitlyn
stole her charm bracelet.

1105
01:10:03,897 --> 01:10:04,864
What?

1106
01:10:04,964 --> 01:10:07,865
I'm sorry, Brown, but these girls
would never do such a thing.

1107
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:10,458
Yeah. Look, let's just settle this, right?

1108
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,537
But...

1109
01:10:11,638 --> 01:10:15,199
I know it was her. She was lying
all summer about who she is.

1110
01:10:15,308 --> 01:10:16,935
Who knows what else she'd lie about?

1111
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:20,240
- Now, wait a minute.
- Mom, don't.

1112
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:22,814
If she wants to look, let her.
This is stupid.

1113
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:26,113
Okay, look, let me just scope this out,

1114
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:29,211
and then I'll have a quick look
in your cabin. Right?

1115
01:10:29,322 --> 01:10:30,880
- Fine.
- Whatever.

1116
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:37,121
You're not gonna find anything,
'cause I didn't...

1117
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:48,500
That's it. That is my charm bracelet.

1118
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:50,200
There's gotta be some mistake.

1119
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,335
Like what?
I snuck into the kitchen and...

1120
01:10:52,445 --> 01:10:55,209
Tess, I got this. All right?

1121
01:10:55,949 --> 01:10:58,179
I am totally wigged-out.

1122
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:00,410
Yeah. So are we.

1123
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,714
I'm not.

1124
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:06,924
Well, rules are rules,

1125
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:10,390
and since it's the end of camp,
I have no choice.

1126
01:11:10,497 --> 01:11:14,058
I've gotta ban you guys
from the rest of camp activities,

1127
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,193
until the end of Final Jam.

1128
01:11:17,303 --> 01:11:19,635
We didn't do anything. She's lying.

1129
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:21,730
- Do you have any proof?
- No, but...

1130
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:25,038
Well, then I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

1131
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:32,075
Until the end of Final Jam.

1132
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:52,895
Camper mates, and matettes,

1133
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,060
I am holding the lineup for Final Jam.

1134
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,934
I am gonna pin it up on the wall.

1135
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,032
Let me get out of the room before
you all come and have a look at it.

1136
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:05,043
All right! Goodness me.

1137
01:12:07,181 --> 01:12:08,478
This is so not fair.

1138
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:09,742
I know.

1139
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:13,117
Guess who?

1140
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,187
Dude, you're in the room.
I can see you.

1141
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,188
I can see you, too, man.

1142
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:18,457
I've missed you.

1143
01:12:18,559 --> 01:12:19,821
Group hug.

1144
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:24,352
Much better. It hasn't been
the same just hugging Nate.

1145
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:26,528
Yeah, it hasn't been.

1146
01:12:27,334 --> 01:12:28,824
So, good news.

1147
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:30,801
The press is here and they're gonna
cover the whole night.

1148
01:12:30,904 --> 01:12:33,429
- The label loves it.
- That's awesome!

1149
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,067
Hey, man, where's this amazing singer
you've been looking for?

1150
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:38,906
What? I know things.

1151
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,939
Hoping to find her tonight.

1152
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,616
This was supposed to be a fun summer
that was all about music,

1153
01:12:49,723 --> 01:12:52,715
and all I did was get caught up
in Tess drama.

1154
01:12:53,427 --> 01:12:54,792
It happens.

1155
01:12:55,128 --> 01:12:57,858
I can't believe I agreed to be
some background singer

1156
01:12:57,965 --> 01:12:59,933
just because I got intimidated.

1157
01:13:00,033 --> 01:13:02,297
That's what Tess can do to you.

1158
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:05,370
No. I did it to me.

1159
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,038
I've never seen Brown so harsh.

1160
01:13:09,977 --> 01:13:11,706
I know. He just kept repeating

1161
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:14,212
"Until the end of Final Jam."

1162
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:17,342
I know. I was there.

1163
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:23,082
What?

1164
01:13:23,824 --> 01:13:25,052
What?

1165
01:13:25,325 --> 01:13:27,418
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1166
01:13:28,262 --> 01:13:29,991
CAMP ROCK
Theater

1167
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:40,067
<i>Okay. Who's stoked? Yeah!</i>

1168
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:42,038
FINAL JAM

1169
01:13:42,142 --> 01:13:44,337
<i>All right! All right!</i>

1170
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:47,068
Yeah!

1171
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:53,779
<i>Okay, campers, friends, family,</i>
<i>Camp Rock fans, this is it. </i>

1172
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,754
<i>Tonight music history will be made</i>

1173
01:13:56,857 --> 01:14:01,920
<i>as Camp Rock finds</i>
<i>a new Final Jam winner!</i>

1174
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:06,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

1175
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,501
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on</i>

1176
01:14:09,603 --> 01:14:10,865
<i>Look at me</i>

1177
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,209
This is not amateur night.
This is serious.

1178
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,299
We did it right!

1179
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,040
No! You didn't. You never do!
I'm trying to win here.

1180
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:23,548
You guys may be used to losing,
but not me.

1181
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,584
I'm tired of picking up the slack.

1182
01:14:25,686 --> 01:14:27,984
Stop telling us what to do!

1183
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,350
You're the one
who's ruining everything.

1184
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:31,515
You're too intense all the time,

1185
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:35,493
and I am sick and tired
of picking up your slack, too!

1186
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,426
Peggy, come back here!

1187
01:14:40,734 --> 01:14:43,328
Who needs her?
She was holding us back.

1188
01:14:44,037 --> 01:14:46,232
Now you really better not mess up.

1189
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:50,709
You know what? Don't worry about me.
Do it yourself. I'm done.

1190
01:14:52,145 --> 01:14:56,741
BTW, your lip gloss is
so not glossy anymore.

1191
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,383
All right.

1192
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:06,756
<i>This year, the Final Jam winner</i>
<i>will not only get a Camp Rock trophy</i>

1193

You won! You won!

1396
01:28:41,808 --> 01:28:43,776
You gotta go! You gotta go!

1397
01:28:58,224 --> 01:28:59,486
<i>Way to go, Margaret!</i>

1398
01:28:59,592 --> 01:29:03,551
<i>You just got yourself a chance</i>

1399
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:10,226
<i>Congratulations, Peggy. </i>
<i>You deserve it. You were amazing. </i>

1400
01:29:16,209 --> 01:29:18,837
You did it! I mean, I did it. We did...

1401
01:29:20,346 --> 01:29:22,405
You guys were really great.

1402
01:29:22,849 --> 01:29:23,838
Thanks.

1403
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,008
Yeah.

1404
01:29:25,117 --> 01:29:28,951
So, I told Brown you guys
didn't take my bracelet.

1405
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,748
Wow.

1406
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,320
Thank you.

1407
01:29:35,428 --> 01:29:37,157
See you next summer.

1408
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:38,821
Sure.

1409
01:29:52,612 --> 01:29:55,206
Mitchie. You were fabulous.

1410
01:29:55,314 --> 01:29:57,782
Honey, I'm sorry you didn't win.

1411
01:29:57,884 --> 01:30:02,218
But I did. I won the best summer
of my life. Thanks to you.

1412
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:08,023
I love you.

1413
01:30:09,161 --> 01:30:11,652
- We'll see you in a few, okay?
- Okay.

1414
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:16,828
So I guess my search is over.

1415
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:19,864
That depends on
who you're looking for.

1416
01:30:19,972 --> 01:30:21,462
Hi, I'm Mitchie.

1417
01:30:21,574 --> 01:30:22,871
I'm Shane.

1418
01:30:23,943 --> 01:30:25,740
You up for a canoe ride later?

1419
01:30:25,845 --> 01:30:27,540
I wouldn't miss it.

1420
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:37,883

Three Months Later

1463
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:37,660
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1464
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,896
Whoa.

1465
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,301
- It's incredible.
- Awesome.

1466

- Wow.
- So cool.

1467
01:33:45,811 --> 01:33:49,872
Caitlyn, we know you said you built
a little recording studio...

1468
01:33:49,982 --> 01:33:53,440
But this is the coolest thing I've seen
since my mom's tour bus.

1469
01:33:53,552 --> 01:33:55,520
Oh. Phenomenal!

1470

01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:20,242
I'm excited.

1480
01:34:21,147 --> 01:34:25,311
Okay, let me just adjust some things.
All right, get your headphones.

1481
01:34:26,519 --> 01:34:28,646

<i>How can we see what's ahead?</i>

1507

<i>The world keeps on turning</i>

1508
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,207
