This is a story of boy meets girl.

5
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,743
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

6
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,662
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...

7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,873
until the day he met "the one."

8
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:27,007
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music...

9
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:29,672
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

The first was her long dark hair.

The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

No, I'm not a lesbian.

Well, you don't

Well, what does
that word even mean?

There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

For Tom Hansen, this was the night
where everything changed.

625
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,238
That wall Summer
so often hid behind-

626
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,908
the wall of distance, of space, of casual-

627
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,162
that wall was slowly coming down.

628
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,958
For here was Tom, in her world,

629
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,462
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

630
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,798
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

really, really fast.

I'm, like, superhuman.

And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

644
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,590
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.

I'm free. I'm safe.

routinely told.

I'm messed up. I am.

Mm-hmm.
- You ever do this?

945
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,595

you had with someone, replay it
in your head over and over again,

- Can I ask you a question?

953
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,997
Yeah.
- She never cheated on you?

No. Never.
- She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

No.
