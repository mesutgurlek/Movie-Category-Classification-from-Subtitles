00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,642
and several other clients.

161
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,011
We've been told by the FBI
that he's fled the country.

162
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:37,480
Uh, I'm sorry. Where the hell is he?

163
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,449
That doesn't really concern the I.R.S.

164
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:40,850
Then why are you here?

165
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,385
Mr. Wheeler, you owe the government

166
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,887
$40 million in back taxes.

167
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,858
Hey. You're early. Come on in.

168
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:51,995
Want some breakfast?

169
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,863
No, thanks. I already ate.

170
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,531
You might have some company today.

171
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,933
Gunnar's back.

172
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,102
He's got about a month's
worth of laundry to do,

173
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,770
so he decided to hit the laundromat.

174
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:02,205
Okay. Uh...

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,440
You know, Cadence really missed
you yesterday. What happened?

176
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,408
Were you sick or something?

177
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,777
I was with Juliette.

178
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,579
And I don't want to lie to you about it.

179
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:11,180
She's back in town?

180
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:14,117
No, not yet, but I got a
text from her a few days ago.

181
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,752
Oh, what do you mean a few days ago?

182
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,120
I didn't know if I should tell you.

183
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:18,688
Of course you should tell me.

184
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,889
I mean, we're... we're friends.

185
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:22,925
I know, but Juliette's a
friend, too, and she's...

186
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:25,361
The one who pays your salary?

187
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,429
- Look...
- [Sighs]

188
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,031
...I was skeptical, too.

189
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,700
But it turns out she left
Luke's tour to go into rehab.

190
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,268
And now that she's clean,
she's checked herself

191
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,337
into a treatment center
for postpartum depression.

192
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,773
Avery, she knows she's sick.

193
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,641
And she's working with
this amazing doctor.

194
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,276
No, em, she's manipulating you.

195
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,577
She knows I won't talk to her,

196
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:42,979
so she's using you to get to me.

197
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:44,314
No, that's not what she's doing.

198

<i>- I'm telling you...
- That is exactly what she's doing!</i>

199
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,083
Juliette hates herself
for what she's done,

200
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,451
and... and she's afraid to face you.

201
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:50,853
You know what? I can't
deal with this right now.

202
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,188
You should leave.

203
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,589
Avery, I'm here to watch Cadence.

204
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,757
Not anymore.

All I can tell you is
the longer you put it off,

things to get back to normal.

You know, like, the talent
here is... is really insane.

My first week here,
I walk into this club

in printer's alley, you know,

it's midnight on a Tuesday,

and these cats are just
killing it, you know?

And... and the music never stops.

Listen, I'm looking
forward to this record,

277
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:41,757
but some people are not
taking your little detour

278
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:44,160
into country music
particularly seriously.

279
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:46,762
I mean, what do you say,
Markus, to those critics

280
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:49,865
who think that all of
this... just a bit of a lark?

Well, can I jump in on that, please?

not that much difference

The lines are really blurred.

287
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,254
Frankly, this is the best music

00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,715
we've ever heard from Markus Keen.

289
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,150
It's the most authentic,
and all I can say

290
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,286
is everybody can
download the album tonight

291
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,220
and hear for themselves.

00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,557
thank you very much for
being with us this morning.

can download Markus'

brand-new album tonight,

But he embezzled from
your personal finances

All right, so, how do we handle it?

302
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:35,998
Honestly?

303
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,014
- Bankruptcy.
- [Laughs]

304
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,982
At least then you could
protect some of your assets.

305
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,884
No, the most important
thing to protect right now

306
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,854
is the brand, and
"bankruptcy" is an ugly word

307
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,022
when it comes to business.

308
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,524
Agreed, but so are "back taxes."

309
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,160
We need to handle this as
quickly and quietly as possible.

310
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,595
Can you pay it, make it go away?

311
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,696
I don't care how rich you are,

312
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,798
nobody's got money like
that just sitting around.

313
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,466
So, what do we do?

314
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,201
Well, with bankruptcy off the table,

315
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,637
I suggest we start liquidating assets,

316
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,339
convert as many as we can into cash.

317
