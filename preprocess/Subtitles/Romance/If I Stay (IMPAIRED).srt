Well, I was certainly bred
to be a rocker. Mmm-hmm.

319
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,735
But I have this theory
that I was switched at birth.

320
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,569
Okay. That explains it.

321
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,810
No, but seriously.

322
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,935
I don't know, I've always
kind of felt like

323
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,009
this Martian in my family.

324
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,088
I don't look like
either of my parents.

325
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,975
My mom's this tough chick
and my dad's all outgoing

326
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,800
and I went and chose
Beethoven and the cello.

327
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,295
When I was eight,
I saw this old video

328
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,722
of the Ramones playing
<i>I Wanna Be Sedated.</i>

329
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,215
And it felt like
my head exploded.

330
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,935
And I was like, "I have to
learn to play the guitar."

331
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,089
So, my uncle hooked me up
with this old Fender.

332
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,682
Yeah, that thing saved my life.

333
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,522
You didn't really get those tickets
from a family friend, did you?

334
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,330
That was two weeks
of pizza delivery tips.

335
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
Why?

336
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,775
Why me?

337
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,290
Because I like
to watch you play.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,048
You go to another place.

339
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,205
And you're beautiful.

340
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,210
You get this crease in
your forehead right there.

341
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,331
Why do I have this feeling you're
about to mess up my entire life?

never hurt anybody.

When we first
started playing out.

1183

Right before the show, Liz talked
me into going to the liquor store

and getting her a Red Bull.

So I go in

1186

and there's this drunk dude
buying a bottle of Jack.

1187

And I realize it's him.

It's my old man.

1189
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,531
And I just

1190
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,325
stop cold.

1191
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,888
And he just looks right at me

1192
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,005
and walks out.

1193

I played like I was on fire.

thought I was good.

been talking about us.

1427
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,610
That he could.
(BOTH LAUGH)

1428
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,495
Promise me.

1429
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,885
I promise you.

1430
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,811
Wait, what am I promising?

1431
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,361
That we'll spend next
New Year's together.

1432
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,726
Even if we're in different
places, you'll still be with me.

1433
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,775
No, that's not good enough.
Not Skyping,

1434
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,201
not texting, together.

1435
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,404
Baby, you know we can't
promise each other that.

1436
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,166
I guess we both know
where this is heading.

1437
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,365
Yeah, I guess so.

1438
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,604
KAT AND WILLOW: (SINGING)
<i>The old thing...</i>

DENNY: All right.
HENRY: Delicious!

1440
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,930
DENNY: What are you looking at?
(LAUGHTER)

1441
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,361
KAT: Because we're fascinated.

1442
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,521
HENRY: You!
WILLOW: Fascinating.

1443
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,335
HENRY: You're a spatula man now.
(DRUMMING ON TABLE)

1444
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,249
KAT: Look it, a drummer.
WILLOW: He's totally drumming with it.

1445
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,289
DENNY: Come on, give me your plate.
All right, get ready.

1446
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,975
Hey! There she is.

1447
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,095
Hey!

1448
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,645
KAT: Happy New Year!

1449
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,215
DENNY: If you're still drunk,
you're totally grounded.

1450
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,924
If not, I'm gonna let it slide.

1451
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,241
I'm definitely not drunk.

1452
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,801
Well, you were still out all
night so come on. Spill.

1453
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,086
How was the party?

1454
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,486
Fine.

1455
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,051
KAT: How was Adam?

1456
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,804
Okay, everybody. Let's move
this party to another room.

1457
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,446
Let's go.

1458
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,489
Take your mimosas.

1459
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,404
DENNY: We'll go watch
the Rose Parade.

1460
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,642
WILLOW: (WHISPERS)
Come on. Let's go.

1461

(MIA SOBBING)

1462
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,810
I'm sorry.

1463
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,325
Oh, God, it's gross.

1464
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,970
It's not gross.

1465
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,411
Oh, God.

1466
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,455
You wash, I'll dry.

1467
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,606
Yeah.

1468
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,285
Make us feel better.

1469
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,329
Warm water, soap.

1470
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,126
Oh, God.

1471
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,521
I'm such a mess.

1472
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,015
You know, we had this

1473
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,168
perfect year
and a half together.

1474
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,721
And now, we're just moving
in different directions.

1475
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,205
Is it over?

1476
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,521
Yeah.

1477
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,855
You're supposed to
break up with someone

1478
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,375
because you're not
in love with them.

1479
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,448
Not because you're completely
in love with them.

1480
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,449
But what do I know, right?
I'm only 17.

1481
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,882
You know plenty.

1482
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,731
It's just very inconvenient to
fall in love when you're 17.

1483
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,575
Especially if
it's the real thing.

1484
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,575
You know, if we weren't
musicians, we could just...

1485
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,206
We could just go
to college together.

1486
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,964
You know, like normal people do.

1487
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,735
There's no such
thing as normal, Mia.

1488
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,935
Every relationship is rough.

1489
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,015
I don't have to tell you that.

1490
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,135
Yeah, I know.

1491
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,161
Don't blame it on music.

1492
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,243
Yeah, but music's the reason
we're breaking up.

1493
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,564
That is bullshit, Mia.
You know that.

1494
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,569
What am I gonna do?

1495
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,286
I am being completely
torn in half.

1496
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,895
You're going to go to Juilliard

1497
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,410
and play the hell
out of your cello.

1498
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,603
Or you're not.

1499
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,215
You're gonna stay with Adam

1500
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,322
and have lots of
amazing adventures.

1501
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,090
Or you're not.

1502
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,130
Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's
gonna smash into a meteor.

1503
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,645
Or it's not.

1504
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,682
Life is this big fat
gigantic stinking mess.

1505
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,968
But that's the beauty of it too.

1506
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,762
Whatever you do, I support you.

1507
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,610
Either way, you win.

1508
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,046
And also either way there's
something that you lose.

1509
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,283
What can I say, baby?

1510
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,282
True love's a bitch.

1511

(MACHINE BEEPING)

1512
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,201
Gramps.

1513
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,204
Gramps, what do I do?

1514
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,561
I've been trying to think

1515
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,691
of what Denny would
want me to say to you.

1516
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,204
The kid was a helluva
of dad, wasn't he?

1517
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,442
He sure had me beat.

1518
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,049
I remember the day
that he quit the band.

1519
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,411
He just up and said,

1520
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,291
"That's it.
The time has come."

1521
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,042
I was surprised.

1522
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,929
I never really liked
the way the band sounded,

1523
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,048
but I knew how
important it was to him.

1524
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,642
And so I asked him, I said,
"Why are you quitting?"

1525
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,895
And he said,

1526
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,575
"You make sacrifices
for your kids."

1527
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,364
"For your kids."

1528
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,575
He said that
without even blinking.

1529
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,568
That's why he quit the band.

1530
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,171
For Teddy.

1531
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,560
For you.

1532
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,843
It was when he heard
you play so well.

1533
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,401
I think that's when
it clicked for him.

1534
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,246
Your incredible talent, it...

1535
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,407
He just couldn't believe it.

1536
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,605
And all he wanted to do
was to give you more.

1537
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,808
So, he quit the band,

1538
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,684
he sold his drum kit

1539
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,450
and he bought you that cello.

1540
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,965
Sacrifice.

1541
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,491
That's what we do for the
people that we love.

1542
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,603
And here's mine, Mia.

1543
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,284
I want you to live.

1544
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,281
I want that more than
anything in this world.

1545
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,967
I want you to fight
like hell to stay with us.

1546
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,290
But, with everybody else gone,

1547
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,482
I know it might
not be what you want.

1548
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,804
It might be too hard for you
to keep fighting, so...

1549
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,529
If you wanna go,

1550
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,167
(VOICE BREAKING)
I want you to know it's okay.

1551
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,565
It's okay.

1552
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,003

Hey.

1558
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,695
So many people
have come to see you

1559
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,121
I've lost count of them all.

1560
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:54,255
There are like 30 people

1561
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,805
in that waiting room.

1562
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,164
Some are related to
you and some aren't,

1563
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,523
but we're your family.

1564

You still have a family, Mia.

1569
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,610

gonna remember you.

<i>early this fall before things
started to go bad with Adam.</i>

a special feel to it.</i>

01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,571
<i>You brought out fast</i>

1744
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,490
<i>The things I said were true</i>

1745
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,291
<i>I'm taking them back from you</i>

1746
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,927
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1747
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,242
<i>I don't want you anymore</i>

1748
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:37,767
<i>I don't want you
to feel the same as me</i>

1749
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,201
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1750
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,841
<i>But now I'm letting you know</i>

1751
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,241
<i>I just wanted to feel</i>

1752
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,161
<i>The life in me</i>

1753
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,127
<i>I miss you</i>

1754
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,602
<i>I wish you</i>

1755
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,643
<i>Will let me be</i>

1756
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,287
<i>Just leave it</i>

1757
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,575
<i>We stopped breathing</i>

1758
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,570
<i>I need to be free</i>

1759
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,881
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1760
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,168
<i>But now I'm letting you know</i>

1761
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,415
<i>I just wanted to feel</i>

1762
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,163
<i>The life in me</i>
