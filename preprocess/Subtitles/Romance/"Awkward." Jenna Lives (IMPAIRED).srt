out of the party with me.

In high school,
perception's everything.

10
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,903
And being dropped off by a parent

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,088
is like owning a rolling backpack

12
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:32,824
or kissing your grandparent
on the mouth.

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,326
Unsavory.

In an environment where
everyone was playing the role

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,666
the only way to survive was to assert

17
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,833
some kind of independence.

18
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,001
All right, all right, all right.

You need to blend,
and then change that shirt.

21
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,842
People are gonna think that
we can't afford nice things.

22
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,178

And it's backless,

23
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,514

Jenna, it would not kill you
to take a risk.

Be bold once in a while.

28

My mother's perception
of being bold

29
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:04,982
was free-boobin'.

30
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,316
I'd had enough.

00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,615
If you're not into the shirt,

32
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:15,734
at least take these so you look hip.

But what I really needed
was an excuse to talk.

00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,885
Matty said he wasn't ready to be
in a relationship with anyone.

38
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,320
But maybe he just didn't want
to be in a relationship with me.

39
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:55,365
And why would he?

40

Where were we?

Oh, I don't know.

164
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,275
Thanks for saving me
some tots, Kel.

165
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,901
What would I do without you?

166
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,062
McKibbs, nice hat trick
yesterday, man.

167
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,298
Oh, thanks, dude.

168
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:47,782
Oh, hey.
I didn't see you there.

169
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,826
I'm so hungry.

170
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,745
- You hungry?
- Starved.

171
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,305
I could eat, like,
four sandwiches or something.

172
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,790
Maybe some soup.
Mmm.

173
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,876
Well, I think they have
chicken tortilla.

174
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,087
So listen, I know we never
talked about it,

175
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,248
but you know I didn't try
to kill myself, right?

176
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:04,674
Misunderstanding.

177
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,012
Okay.

178
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,431
Uh...Jell-o?

179
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,425
Mmm. Hello.

180
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,186
Uh...

181

Your mouth is saying okay,
but your eyes are saying,

182
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,064
"save me from this lunatic."

183
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,265
Which I totally understand
because I'm rambling

and sounding like a whack job.

185

But just so you know,
I was having a bad day,

186
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,779
and I slipped-- I had an accident.

187
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,572
Normal people have accidents.

188
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,841
And that's exactly what I had
because I'm perfectly normal.

189

[Forced laugh]

Oh, what was I <i>saying?</i>

191
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,289
You're--
you're totally normal.

192
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:40,001
- Yes.
- I got it.

193
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,252
- I'll see ya.
- Okay.

194
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:44,923
Matty ditched me
to bring that chick a sandwich?

195
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,825
I fooled around with the guy
at least eight times,

196
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,053
and he never bought <i>me</i> a sandwich.

197
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,263
He just bought her a sandwich.
We have to follow them.

198
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,432
Who?

199
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,059
Your face is all red,
and you have crazy eyes.

200
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,394
Did you feed the rabid squirrels
in the quad?

201
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,671
Listen, those shirts
are spreading,

202
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:00,772
and I know Matty's seen them.

203
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,007
Did you see those people
wearing them?

204
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,399
I just need to find out
if they're together.

205
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,901
You're going
to a dark place, J.

206
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,511
Stay with us.

207
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,571
I just need concrete proof
that they're dating.

208
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,033
I knew it.

209
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,202
You're totally cashing in
on my faux suicide attempt.

210
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,454
That is illegal.
I could have you arrested!

211
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,655
You're stalking me.
Admit it.

212
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,124
I saw you at least
five times last period.

213
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm an office aid.

214
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,129
Mm. Yeah?
Take the damn shirt off--now.

215
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,380
You are ruining my life.

Those are mine.

- Take it off.
- No.

218

Take it... off.

219

- No.
- Fine.

220
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,390
I will.
Just stop it, okay?

221
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,766
People are getting the wrong idea.

222
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,810
They think I'm crazy, okay?
Just stop it!

223
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,520
Stop stalking me,
stop with these stupid T-shirts!

224

Just stop it!
Just stop it! Just stop it!

- Stop it!
- You're crazy.

226
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:56,242
Does this really
warrant detention?

227
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,676
If you were 18,

228
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,812
it could warrant
some time in the slammer.

229
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,081
Sorry I couldn't give you
special treatment.

I mean, I could have,

231
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,784
but there were so many witnesses.

232
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,716
I see some new faces...

233
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,551
Mixed in with the old.

234
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,136
To the rookies--

we're on the honor system here.

236
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,263
Now, I'll be back to check on you,

237
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,434
but you won't know when.

and piles of work.

Sometimes it feels like
I have detention too.

246
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,701
We have exactly two hours.

Starting now.
[Snaps]

248

Two hours for, uh, for what?

249

Valerie's nap.
We're heading to Giuseppe's.

250
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,046
Guess Jenna plus
was a regular in detention.

251
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,181
And the leader among the rebel herd.

252
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:12,403

being bad... was good.

From the small bird tattoo
on her ankle

00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,662
to the simple carmex she wore
instead of lip gloss,

256
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,373
everything about Jenna plus was cool.

So what are you in
detention for, wonder boy?

259
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,337
I was caught holding
the hose at the bonfire.

'cause I was on the phone having
a meltdown with this guy.

Was she talking about Matty,

269
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,693
or was I having a paranoia stroke?

of maybe getting back together.

I was Matty's rebound?

Breaks are hard.

with another person,

he's indifferent, he doesn't call me.

I need ranch.

489
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,810
You don't seem like the type
that would be in detention.

490
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,562
Maybe you don't know
what type I am.

491
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:51,110
So, um...

492
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:52,900
How do you guys know each other?

493
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,780
Who, Liv?

494
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:58,948
She's kinda my girlfriend.

495
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,407
In-law.

496
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:03,088
She and my brother have been
off and on for a while.

497
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:06,458
I don't really know what's going on.

498
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,878
Weird.

499
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,381
So you two kinda look alike.

500
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,503
[Laughs]

501
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:18,571
Yeah.

502
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,220
Nah, she's way prettier
than me.

503
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,975
It was our first lunch
together.

504
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,045
And I realized it wasn't
my stigma or another girl

505
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,347
keeping me from Matty.

506
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:30,605
It was how I saw myself.

507
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,819
Next on <i>Awkward.</i>

508
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:34,753
You know this is
a charity <i>league.</i>

509
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,527
Not a charity, right?

510
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,823
We are gonna rock
the knick knackers.

511
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:38,821
We are!

512
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,991
You have to be cruel
to be kind.

513
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,325
Both: Sadie wrote the letter!

514
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,827
Do you think Matty
knows Jake kissed me?

515
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,412
No way.
Guys don't talk.

516
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,122
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton.
- What?

517
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,331
[Glass shatters]

518
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,160
