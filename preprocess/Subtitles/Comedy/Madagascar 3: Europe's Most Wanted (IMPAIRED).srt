This circus means everything to us.

And if you do anything
that threatens this circus,

633
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,680
you will have to answer to me. Capisce?

I capisce, cool. Trust me, we're cool.

[Alex groans] This is a disaster!

726

[Gloria] We blow all
our money on a bad circus,

727
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,720
- and we're not any closer to New York!
- If anything, we're further away!

We could have at least bought a circus
that knew how to circ!

I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

- Are you kidding me?
- You must have some money left over.

00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,800
I used it to buy teeth
and then have them capped in gold.

Now I can eat apples!

Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.

[Marty] No promoter is sending this show
to America. It's toe up!

736
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
[Gloria] Now it makes sense. No wonder
the circus master was so happy to sell.

Shh!

- Uh, yeah. Sort of.
- Incredible!

- I hope this is important.
- Come this way, Alice!

756
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,080
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like New York Knicks.

757
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,440
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.

Whoa.

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,440
What is this place?

760
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,320
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,

761
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
but there is something you must know.

762
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,760
There was a time
when Circus Zaragoza,

763
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,560
we were a great circus!

764
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,240
Numero uno in all the Europa!

765
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,080
And Vitaly...
he was the biggest star of us all.

766
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,240
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.

767
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

Make the hoop smaller.

771
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,520
- Like this?
- Smaller.

[Stefano] It had never been done before
because it was physically impossible!

777
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,000
And the people... they loved it!

778
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,480
[female] Viva Vitaly!

779
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,920

782
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,800
[Stefano] And the hoop, she got smaller!

783
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
Like the ring

784
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,720
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.

785
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,600
Bravo, Vitaly!

786
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
[Stefano] He would not stop pushing.

787
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,080
And one fateful day...

788
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,720
...he push too far!

789
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,720
Light the hoop on fire!

790
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,320
[gasps]

791
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:47,320
[cheering]

792
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,000
[Stefano] He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.

793
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,360
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.

794
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,360
And he lost everything.

795
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,720
His wife, she run off with a musician.

796
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,280
He lost his dignity... his fame...

797
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,040
...his passion... and his fur.

798
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,040
And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.

799
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,200
Scusi. Vitaly!

800
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,880
- [growls]
- [shrieks] Nothing!

801
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,880
His only passion now is the borscht.

802
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,600
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.

803
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,480
So when he lost his passion,

804
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,720
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

805
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,400
- This is why we need your help.
- What sort of help?

806
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,520
You can teach us to do new circus.
Americano style!

807
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,960
We find a new passion.

808
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,080
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!

809
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
[chair squeaking]

810
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
A!

811
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,720
I know. It is stupido idea.

812
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,760
We are a lost cause.

813
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,640
No, no, this isn't stupido.
This could work!

814
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,520
- What?
- What you just said.

815
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,720
- [gasps] What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

816
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,840
- What?
- Your stupido idea!

817
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,880
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

818
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,200
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

819
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,880
Some say I'm even slightly below.

820
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,480
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

821
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,160
I call it Phase 4-7B,
wherein, in order to get home,

822
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,440
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!

823
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,880
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

824
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,760
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

825
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,520
- [angry shouting]
- I missed.

826
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,560
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

827
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,120
Circus has been same for generations!

828
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,320
We make good,
classic family entertainment.

829
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,120
Aha! But last few generations,

830
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,480
families... not so entertained.

831
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,160
[clears throat]

832
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,640
That's right.
Families not so entertained

833
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,360
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

834
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,440
It's missing passion.

835
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,240
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

836
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,040
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

837
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,160
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

838
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,120
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

839
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,880
But those days are over.

840
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,080
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

841
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,880
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

842
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,880
Circus is not about the acts you do.

843
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,600
Circus is in here.

844
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,000
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?

845
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,760
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

846
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,160
[scoffs] You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

847
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,480
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,

848
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,680
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

849
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,040
and completely flipped the paradigm.

850
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,360
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

851
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,640
And one of them
completely in the nude.

852
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,680
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

853
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,800
Take off their clothes?

854
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,640
- No. They got rid of the animals.
- [Stefano] What?

855
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,120
- Say it ain't so!
- [Gia] Che stupida! No animals...

856
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,360
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!

857
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,760
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

858
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,760
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

859
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,040
I mean, they cannot... [clears throat]

860
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,400
I think you understand what I'm saying!

861
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,320
- Yeah!
- Yes!

862
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Uh... No!

863
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

864
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,800
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

865
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,240
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

866
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
- [cheering]
- [roaring]

867
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,280
We'll make an all-animal circus!

868
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,720
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

869
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,000
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

870
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,840
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

871
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,680
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

872
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,600
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

873
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,600
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?

874
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,360
Fur power!

875
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,160
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

876
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,840
You and me, baby! An act together!

877
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,880
I love it!

878
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,160
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!

879
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,360
- Uh, dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

880
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,440
[humming] Me and you! We got this!

881
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,760
[stammering] But I can't dance.

882
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,720
- [chanting] Fur power!
- Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

883
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,880
Ah! I do not trust this lion.

884
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,560
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

885
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,880
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

886
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,760
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.

887
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,240
You know our circus is in trouble.

888
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,640
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.

889
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,760
Circus always stay together.

890
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,920
[sighs] OK. I do one hoop.

891
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,000
[squeals]

892
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,840
I want a hug, too!

893
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,240
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

894
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,600
[laughing]

895
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,760
[engine rumbling]

896
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,200
[tires squeal]

897
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,200
Attention! I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

898
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,640
[monitors beeping rhythmically]

899
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,520
[slow instrumental intro begins]

900
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,920
[singing "Non je ne regrette rien"]

901
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
[man shrieks]

902
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,120
[music slows, softens]

903
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,880
[singing finale]

904
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,920
[music crescendos]

905
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,320
[song ends]

906
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,600
[yodeling]

907
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,480
[Mort giggling]
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

908
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,480
[Stefano] More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

909
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,320
Are you really going
to shoot yourself out of that thing?

910
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,360
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

911
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,880
to be a human cannonball!

912
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,720
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.

913
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,040
Is it dangerous?

914
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,800
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!

915
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,520
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

916
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,560
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

917
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,640
Sí. That's means yes!

918
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
Ready for launch?

919
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,000
Ready for launch!

920
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,840
Fire in the hole!

921
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Wait!

922
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,520
[screaming]

923
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,400
[groans]

924
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
Mamma mia!

925
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,120
Help me!

926
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,320
[Stefano's voice echoing]

927
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,120
Rico! Get the cannon ready!
Same charge!

928
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,160
- [Skipper] Fire in the hole!
- Oh!

929
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,640
[screaming]

930
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,560
Oh, oh! [shouting gleefully]

931
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,360
- ["Born Free" playing]
- All right! [laughs]

932
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,560
Oh! Whoo!

933
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,600
Yeah!

934
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,280
[howling]

935
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,600
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

936
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,400
Whoo! I was flying! I was effin'-L-Y-in'!

937
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm proud of you, but... [whimpers]

938
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,280
...I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

939
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.

940
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,920
Here, wrap this around you.

941
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
All right, I got you! I got you!

942
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,480
- [shouts happily]
- [howling]

943
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,120
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

944
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,800
- I'm going to fly, baby!
- Oh, yes! What a triumph!

945
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,160
- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!

946
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,040
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

947
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,120
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.

948
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,600
He's got us pegged.

949
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,520
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

950
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,080
- [buzzes]
- [screams]

951
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,760
Oh, that was great!

952
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,720
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

953
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,880
- [Freddie] I want to try that!
- Jonesy! Jonesy!

954
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,920
Whoo! Hey. Hi.

955
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,320
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.

956
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,400
Oh, thanks.

957
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,760
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

958
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,800
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

959
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,720
- I know they don't rhyme.
- Trapeze is my passion!

960
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,360
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

961
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,000
You can teach me!

962
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,440
- What?
- Teach me.

963
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,360
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

964
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,120
So that kind of rules that out.

965
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,200
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.

966
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,280
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

967
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,640
"Show me"? What are we, five?

968
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,560
I am five, yes.

- [dance music plays]
- [Melman] Dancing.

971
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,200
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

972
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,880
I mean, the music
totally throws off my timing.

973
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,760
You want excitement? Ha-ha!

974
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,400
Check it out.
Who's on a tightrope, huh? Huh?

975
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Who's on a...

Melman! Oh, my gosh!

979
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,560
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

980
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,400
- I'm coming right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

981
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,680
- Melman?!
- [yelling]

982
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,920
Ah! Ah! Ah!

983
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,240
Calm down, Melman.

984
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,600
I'm going to fall
and break all of my neck! Ah!

985
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,360
Just look at me. Look at me.

986
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
- All eyes on me.
- OK.

987
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,600
- Come to me.
- [stammering] I can't.

988
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,680
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

989
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,280
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

990
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,000
Maybe because you've never tried.

991
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,280
No, I have tried.

992
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,480
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

993
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,280
You practiced? For me?

994
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,240
Yes, but it's no use.

995
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,000
I never know
what to do with my arms.

996
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,160
- [shouting]
- Hold it.

997
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,840
That part is so easy, Melman. OK?

998
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,960
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.

999
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,280
See? Two steps forward.

1000
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,120
One step back.

1001
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,960
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

1002
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,920
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

OK. [exhales] Whoo! All right.

1006
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,080
So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?

1007
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,200
Uh, this is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

1008
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,520
OK, how do we begin?

1009
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,880
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

1010
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,400
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.

1011
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,680
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. OK.

1012
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,560
- Do you need a push?
- No.

1013
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,920
Just watch and learn!

[♪ Peter Asher:
"Love Always Comes as a Surprise"]

- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

grab your peduncle,

If that's not a red-blooded

We need to get this show on the road.
Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.

Roger that.
Oh, and keep an eye out for Dubois.

Aye, aye, guvnor!

The promoter is in the house!

- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!

- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.

- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

Have you seen Vitaly?

01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,240
Vitaly... he will not go on!

- I tried everything I could.

Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

1073
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,640
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.

1074
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,880
- Vitaly, what are you doing?
- You missed.

1075
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,160
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?

1076
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,040
They have good show without me.

1077
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,400
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

1078
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,040
You get fake foot, then you walk.

1079
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,640
- I don't want fake foot! OK?
- [groans]

1080
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,320
What happened to "circus stick together,"
huh? "The show must go on."

1081
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,800
Clichés.

1082
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,160
Come on, man.
Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

1083
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,480
What other guy?

1084
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,680
The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!

1085
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,360
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.

1086
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,600
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?

1087
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,920
That Vitaly is no more.

1088
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,760
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,

1089
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,360
but your friends
haven't given up on you.

1090
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,920
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,

1091
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,680
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

1092
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,400
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?

1093
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,320
[groans] It is impossible.

1094
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,960
[sighs]

1095
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,400
It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

1096

Because I did the impossible!

I was once a brave tiger.

You were never circus?

You can still do cannon solo.

But... I want to do solo act with Marty!

1212
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,400
And what do I do?

1213
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,360
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?

1214

No.

1215

We can do impossible!

1216
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,480
And we never go back
to way we used to be.

1217
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,000
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.

Well... we're here.

- Home.
- Huh.

1222

My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.

1223
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,240
Look at the mural.

1224
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,240
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?

1225
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,600
Wow.

1226
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,480
I forgot about that wall
in between us, Melman.

1227
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,280
- Mm-hmm.
- Was that always there?

1228
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,280
Guys, I'm sorry
I ever left the zoo in the first place.

1229
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,920
What do you mean?

1230
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,960
I mean, if I had just stayed put,

1231
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,040
we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.

1232
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,720
Leaving the zoo was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1233
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,600
Really?

1234
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,840
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.

1235
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,360
- [Julien] Yeah!
- It was exciting!

1236
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,680
- It was romantic.
- It was dangerous.

1237
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,320
I never felt so alive!

1238
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,800
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.

1239
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,320
I only wish we'd realized that sooner.

1240
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,920
I'm really going to miss those guys.

1241
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,640
What do you say we go back?

1242
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,640
Really?

1243
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,080
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!

1244
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,720
But what do we tell them?

1245
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,840
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.

1246
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:44,880
It's worth a shot.

1247
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,240
[in Russian accent]
And if we go down in flames, so be it!

1248
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,920
- [Gloria] Yes, let's do this!
- [Julien] I like it!

1249
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,160
[Marty] Yeah, yeah!

1250
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,720
Is my neck getting longer?

1251
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,840
Feel my fur. It's so soft.

1252
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,600
