1
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,831
<i>CHARLES:  You're not
concentrating. I can tell.</i>

2
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:41,236
You're thinking
about e-mails or text
messages or handbags.

3
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:46,808
ANNIE: You don't know that.
You don't know what
I'm thinking about.

4
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,176
(WHISPERING) Lautner.

5
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,111
Okay, I might not
know the specifics

6
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:52,147
but I know it's some
kind of useless racket

7
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,748
that's keeping you
from concentrating.

8
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,652
I could be
thinking about
the cure for cancer.

9
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:00,088
In fact,
I may have
just cracked it.

10
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,824
And now you're trying
to get me to erase it
from my hard drive.

11
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:04,694
You couldn't
cure a UTI

12
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,596
if you owned
a cranberry farm.
(GASPS)

13
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:09,198
Hey! I have never had
an infected urinary tract.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,933
Oh, really?
No, I have not.

15
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,635
And you've never
had HPV either?

16
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:13,836
No!
All right.

17
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:14,937
No human papillomavirus?

18
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,072
Watch your mouth!

19
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:17,673
Hey!
Watch your mouth.

20
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,875
I smack too.
I was vaccinated.

21
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,611
I was vaccinated.

22
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:24,614
'Cause, unlike you,
I was born after
the polio vaccine.

23
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,115
What are you talking about?
I am five years
older than you.

24
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,984
How do I know that?

25
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:31,654
I see no
documentation of that.
For all I know you're 45.

26
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:34,657
Listen to me!
I am 35 years old. Okay?

27
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,659
You're 45! You're gray!

28
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,327
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Buddy, don't grab my hair.

29
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,763
It's thin.
I don't like when
you pull my hair.

30
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,298
Then let go of my wrist.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,133
Okay.

32
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,102
On three.
Truce? Okay.

33
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:48,137
Three, two, one.
One, two, three.

34
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,639
Okay. Don't grab my
hair again, okay?

35
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:51,374
Okay. Well, then
don't hold me down.

36
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,776
It makes me self-conscious.
That's my only way
to defend myself.

37
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,111
I'm being serious though.
Will you please concentrate?

38
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,746
Yes.
Okay.

39
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,315
That's it.

40
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:02,185
Take three deep breaths.

41
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,187
(INHALING)

42
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:14,798
This is the only moment
you need to be worried about.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,768
There's no yesterday.

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,269
There's no tomorrow.

45
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,204
There's just right now.

46
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,141
You're not
late for anything.

47
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,677
And you're not
gonna miss anything.

48
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,146
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

49
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,250
And you're exactly who
you're supposed to be.

50
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:36,353
You're absolutely perfect.

51
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,723
And whatever happens today

52
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,092
is exactly what's
supposed to happen.

53
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:48,065
And if you want

54
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,767
I'll spend
every moment with you
for the rest of your life.

55
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,840
Okay, I want.

56
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:10,321
You're gonna have
a wonderful day today.

57
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,123
You don't have to be
nervous about anything.

58
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,825
Okay, I'm not.

59
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,126
You promise?

60
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,795
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

61
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,469
You're so
terrible on the eyes.

62
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,872
I don't know why
I share a bed with you!
You're disgusting!

63
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,847
RANDY: That's a lot!
That's a lot of space.
Forget it. I've got a friend.

64
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,949
Hey, you!
Is Charlie awake yet?

65
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,784
'Cause I've got to
pick him up. We've got
a meeting in town.

66
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,018
I thought I'd
swing by and grab him.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,286
Yeah, he's inside.

68
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,955
Right.
You doing all right?

69
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,957
Yeah.
Yeah, good!

70
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,358
Are you okay, Randy?

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,961
No. No. Why?
Why? What's wrong?

72
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,363
You're just a little sweaty.
But it's not a big deal.

73
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,933
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
That happens.

74
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,368
I hate it.
You don't need to apologize.

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,770
Okay.
Okay.

76
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,404
Bye, Randy.

77
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,773
You too!

78
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,243
Yes. I'll do that. I'll...

79
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,311
Someone's calling.
Hold on, hold on.
Just a second.

80
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,880
God damn it!
Son of a bitch.

81
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,917
Damn it!

82
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:13,952
Damn it!

83
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,989
Oh, shit! Fuck!

84
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,423
Hey. Hey. No!

85
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,393
Fuck! No! No!

86
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,945
Oh! Oh! No! Kids!
(SCREAMING)

87
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,880
Oh, God!

88
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,489
(SHOTS FIRING)
What the fuck!

89
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,029
Mom!

90
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,363
Oh, no! Kids!

91
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,298
Mom!
RANDY: No!

92
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,499
(SCREAMING)

93
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,606
When I tell you
to stay in park
you fucking stay in park!

94
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,842
You stay in park
or I will break you!

95
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,176
Hear me?

96
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,878
CHARLES: Hey!
What are you doing?

97
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,446
What the fuck are
you doing, Randy?

98
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,948
Nothing!

99
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,116
What do you mean nothing?
I look out my window

100
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,118
and you're
ghost riding your van
in the backyard, man!

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,887
You're blasting
holes in everything!

102
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,858
Shut the fuck up, Charlie!
Shut the fuck up!

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,061
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Wait! Let me get
my badge! Don't worry!

104
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,563
No! Don't go anywhere!
I got my badge!
This car is malfunctioning!

105
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,866
CHARLES: Randy!
You blew her window out!

106
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,634
You've got to be
more careful than that!

107
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:37,470
Would you shut the fuck up?
I'm trying to explain to this
lady what happened!

108
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:39,339
Hey! Why don't you
explain to me, man?

109
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,941
It's my yard
you're driving through!

110
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:45,078
You're assaulting
a minivan with a firearm?
Jesus, Randy!

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,913
I had a fucking accident!

112
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,918
Okay? I had
a fucking accident!
All right? I'm embarrassed!

113
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,921
Okay? Are you happy?
I spilt my coffee
all over me!

114
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,556
Listen, I didn't know
you spilt your coffee, okay?

115
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,958
Yeah, it spilt on
my shirt and on my pants!

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,995
I'm sorry.
Listen, it's all right.
Are you okay?

117
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,198
Yeah. I think so.

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,633
So you spilt your coffee?

119
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,668
Yeah. I spilled it on
my shirt and on my pants.

120
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,204
And then you fell
out of your van?

121
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:14,074
Or were you
firing first and
then you fell out?

122
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,176
I don't want to
talk about it out here.

123
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,444
Okay.
Okay.

124
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,612
You want to come inside?

125
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:21,015
Get me out
of this yard, man!

126
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,416
You were really
firing that gun, man.

127
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:23,584
Okay. Next subject.

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,588
Hi, Annie. Take a seat.
I'm just finishing this up.

129
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,390
Thanks.
Oh, take your time.

130
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,097
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

131
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,334
What's that?

132
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,505
Uh, I was just taking
a couple of deep breaths.

133
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:46,440
Someone recommended
I try it when I'm nervous.

134
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,109
You know what else works?

135
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,478
Xanax. Oh. It's so good.

136
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,113
All benzos, really.

137
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:54,449
But that one works
extremely well.
Very fast-acting.

138
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:57,018
Huh? I never take Xanax.

139
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,687
Well, you should
really try it.

140
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,957
If you mix it with
wine or beer it sort of
supercharges it.

141
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,724
I should try that.

142
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,694
Why are you nervous?

143
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:09,698
I know,
you know, it's the
end of the semester

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,533
and I also know
there's budgetary issues.

145
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,002
And that you have to
let a few professors go.

146
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,403
And so when I got
the note in my box,

147
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:19,007
I think I just
assumed the worst.

148
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,444
Would you be afraid
to get fired if your job
was to clean the floor

149
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,679
at one of those
coin-operated
jack-off booths?

150
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,181
You know,
where you're the one
holding the mop.

151
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,617
Um, fired from
a jack-off booth?

152
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,419
Where the truckers
go and masturbate.

153
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,621
Yeah. I know what
you're talking about.

154
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,990
Well? Would you?
Um...

155
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:38,059
No. I would not.

156
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,229
And yet, you're here
at Milton Valley,

157
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,131
the jack-off booth
of academia.

158
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,767
I'm not sure
what your point is.

159
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,270
You're too smart and
passionate to work here.
So why do you?

160
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,740
You know, I created
my own major at Stanford.

161
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,576
I have a doctorate
in Non-Violent
Conflict Resolution,

162
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:56,445
which no university
offers as a major.
They just don't.

163
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,248
So I teach intro
to soc classes.

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,251
And I'm... I'm also
in a relationship here.

165
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,753
I'm going to stop you.

166
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:07,289
UC is starting a conflict
resolution program.

167
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,659
I spoke to the head of
the Sociology Department.

168
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:14,563
And she's extremely
interested in hiring you
to run that program.

169
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,332
No way.

170
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:19,668
Now, she's meeting
the other applicant
on Wednesday

171
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,404
and she'll need to
make a decision that day.

172
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:22,238
Their semester
starts in a week.

173
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,440
(WHISPERS) You're meeting
her on Wednesday.

174
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,475
Oh, my God!

175
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:30,046
Thank you so much!
I'm so flattered

176
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:32,114
that you would
even consider me!

177
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:35,484
I just have to check
with my boyfriend Charlie
because he has...

178
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:38,287
He can't exactly
leave, uh, Milton.

Please.
I went to state school.

180
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:44,061
I went to football games
and blacked out
and got date raped.

181
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:46,663
I had abortions.
I worried too much about
what my boyfriends thought.

182
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,532
I got what I deserved.

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,734
But that's not you.

184
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,070
You deserve
so much more than this.

185
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:56,673
RANDY: I hope your
neighbor doesn't report

186
00:08:56,675 --> 00:09:01,344
Why? You're a marshal.
You're allowed to fire
your weapon, aren't you?

187
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:04,614
Yeah, but I've had
a couple incidences.

188
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,152
And this would be bad.

189
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:11,154
Although,
I don't know what more
they could do to me.

190
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,723
This seems like the
bottom of the barrel
as far as being a marshal.

191
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,259
Why did you get stuck
with witness protection?

192
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,563
Because I accidentally
discharged my weapon.

193
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:22,466
Once at a gas station
and another time at
a baseball game.

194
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,367
At a baseball game?
Yes.

195
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:28,538
No! Nobody.
Are you kidding me? No!
It wasn't even my fault!

196
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,107
I'm not kidding you.

197
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:31,575
You shoot your weapon
off at a baseball game

198
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:35,378
It's not crazy
that I would assume
maybe someone got shot.

199
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,780
Listen,
I asked for a revolver.

200
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:39,684
A revolver
has a hammer
that you pull back.

201
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:42,587
And a safety. But no.
What do they give me?
Right.

202
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,589
Jesus Christ, man.
Be careful with that.

203
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,191
Yeah. Look at that.

204
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,559
Okay.

going on. I mean...

I'll just...

211

From now on, don't touch
my weapon anymore. Okay?

212

Listen, I wasn't...
I know we're
friends and everything.

213

And it's kind of
a gray area now
that we are friends.

214
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,281
But do not
touch my weapon
again. It's unsafe.

215
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,482
Okay. I'm sorry.

216
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:14,352
I trained for two years
to be able to do this.

Okay.
So please,
do me a solid.

218
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,456
I'm not going to touch it.
I won't bring it up again.

219
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,790
I promise. I'm not
going to touch it.
All right, thank you.

No, it went
really well.

a job where I could
head my own department.

234
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:34,000
In my field.

235
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,735
And it would be
the first one like it
in the country.

236
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,705
And it would be perfect.

237

Then why are you upset?

238
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,978
Because it's in L.A.

239
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,415
And I would have to
leave and move to L.A.

No, Charlie.

that if I didn't
take the interview

246
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,936
she would fire me.

have my job here anymore.

something, please?

wanted to stay,
I wouldn't let you.

and you wouldn't either.

00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,206
What?
My teaching certificate.
It's at Gil's.

310
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:38,876
You're kidding me.

311
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:41,145
No. And I need it.

312
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,315
Oh, boy.

313
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:57,995
ANNIE: Be back in a sec.

(RATTLING)

315
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:03,334
Oh, my God.

(DOORBELL CHIMING)

317
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,176
Hey!

318
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:15,346
Anne?
What a fun surprise.

319
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,783
Um, listen. I think
I accidentally left...

320
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:20,619
You caught me
in the middle of
doing all my laundry.

321
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,788
Sorry about that. Um...

322
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,790
When I split up
the photo albums,

323
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,959
I think I left the one
with my teaching degree
here with you.

324
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,795
Oh. Okay, well.

325
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,197
That's an honest mistake.
You want to come in
and talk about it?

326
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,701
No, Gil.
I just want the album.
Can you grab it?

327
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,768
<i>Uno momento.</i>

00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,340
<i>Uno momento.</i>

329
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,943
Nice buns!
(SHUSHES)

330
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:47,346
Well, it looks like
we've got quite
a few options here.

331
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:50,882
We can spread them out...
No, that's fine.
It'll be in the back.

332
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,218
All right. Why, pray tell,
are you in such
a hurry to get this?

333
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,320
Um, because
I'm taking a job
in L.A. and I need it.

334
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,690
You're taking a job
in Los Angeles? When?

335
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,893
Uh, now, actually.
We're leaving right now.

336
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,095
We?

337
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,933
You're moving to
Los Angeles with a man
you barely know?

338
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:08,967
Bingo. Okay...

339
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,235
Hold on a second!

340
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:11,937
I'm not letting you
move 500 miles away

341
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,107
with a man named
Charles Bronson,
who you barely know

342
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,110
who happens to
be in the witness
protection program.

343
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,378
Do you know who goes
into witness protection?

344
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,850
Criminals who have
ratted out other criminals
to save their own ass.

345
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,252
Okay! First of all, I never
should have told you
anything about him.

346
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,088
I never should have.
Secondly, you don't
have the authority

347
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,190
to not let me
do anything, Gil.

348
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:33,826
And lastly, he was
given that name when
he entered protection

349
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:36,195
which he entered because
he witnessed a crime. Okay?

350
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,065
He's a good Samaritan, Gil.
Not a criminal. Give me!

351
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,267
You can't just
disappear with that scumbag.
All right? It's unacceptable.

352
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,368
He's probably
going to murder you

353
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,938
Give me the album, Gil!
Give me the album!
Annie. Annie!

354
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,174
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, Gil?

355
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:51,444
Nothing. I was just
giving her the albums
that she asked for.

356
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,346
You're sunbathing, too?
What, you got your top off?

357
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,349
I was doing laundry.

358
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,284
Give her the
fucking books, all right?

359
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:02,121
And when he snaps,
you better hope to hell
that I'm there to save you.

360
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:03,056
Because he's
going to do it.

361
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,257
Okay, Gil. Take care.

362
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,893
Bye, Gil!

CHARLES: What?
(CHUCKLES)

367
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:24,878
ANNIE: What's with this car?

368
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,181
What do you mean
what's with this car?

369
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:31,118
I mean...
It's kind of obnoxious.

370
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh! You think this
car is obnoxious?

371
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,823
'Cause I think it's tits!

372
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:38,092
And I think
most people think
this car is tits.

373
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,793
It sounds like
it's gonna break.

374
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,328
No, it does not sound
like it's gonna break.

375
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,497
It sounds like
it has 700 horsepower.

376
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,034
Believe me,
all dudes love
how this car sounds.

377
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,268
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

378
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:52,072
I'm in a 700
horsepower dude lure?

379
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,240
That's right.

380
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,476
Apologies.
I had no idea.

381
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,078
You definitely told me
this car was broken.

382
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,314
It was when I was
talking about turning the
shed into a craft room.

383
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:01,882
Yeah?
Yeah.

384
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:02,983
So, why did you say that?

385
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,518
Why did I say that?

386
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,121
Holy shnikes,
look at this.

387
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,357
There's a parrot
driving this car.

388
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,760
Uh-huh.
A driving parrot!

389
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:14,095
Oh, man!
I'm gonna be rich!

390
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,164
I found the only
driving parrot!

391
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,066
I was hiding it
in the shed

392
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:19,367
'cause you're
not supposed to
bring anything with you.

393
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:22,237
I mean,
especially not a car.

394
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,773
But I spent a year and
a half building this
thing with my dad

395
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,308
and I didn't want to
just not have it anymore.

396
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,347
You wanted to
bring it because you
built it with your dad?

397
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,283
Yeah.

398
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,352
We weren't the
hottest communicators,

399
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:40,121
but we kind of
worked well together.

400
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,991
So he was into
off-road racing and
we did that together.

401
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,460
And then he was
into building old cars
and we did that.

402
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,229
I think it's sweet.

403
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,000
I want a burger.

404
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,035
Mmm! I want a burger too.

405
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,470
Let's get some beef!

406
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,372
Let's get some
beef up in us.

407
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,477
ANGELLA: What are you doing?

408
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,879
TERRY: I'm on my Pouncer app.

409
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,582
Yeah.
I understand it's an app.

410
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:09,552
I'm saying when you
hit the Pouncer app
what happens?

411
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:14,023
I hit Pouncer.
And it sends out my
exact location on this map.

412
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,426
And then I can see
who else has Pouncer
on the same exact map.

413
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,295
And I can chat with
them in real time.

414
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,163
And be like,
"Hey! Where are you?
What's going on?"

415
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,364
Oh.

416
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:25,968
You're the only one on here.

417
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,103
Yeah.

418
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:30,539
Well, we're in the
middle of nowhere.
There's no gays.

419
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,141
Have you used it
in another city?

420
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,509
Oh, my God.

421
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:36,212
Airports. Vegas.
You know.

422
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,581
Austin lights up like
a fucking Christmas tree.

423
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,885
Ten feet away.
Zero feet away.
Guys wanting to hook up.

424
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:45,154
For coffee? Or like...

425
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:46,989
No. To fuck.

426
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:50,359
Or hand jobs or blowjobs
or kissing. Whatever.

427
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:51,927
So wait, then like,
you just hit a button

428
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,196
and within five minutes
you and a stranger,

429
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:56,031
having sex?
Or having hand jobs?

430
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:59,401
I mean,
that's not the
intention of the app.

431
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:03,540
I think the intention
of the app is to see who's
straight and who's gay.

432
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,376
Like for you,
you're straight
so it's safe to assume

433
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:08,144
that you can
hit on anyone
or flirt with them.

434
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,647
And then I do that,
what happens?
Victim of a hate crime.

435
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,249
Yeah. Not cool.
(PHONE VIBRATING)

436
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,250
Not cool at all.

437
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:14,317
Oh, Gil.

438
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,387
(SIGHS) What?

439
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:19,589
Hey! Did you
change your mind?

440
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:21,491
It doesn't work
like that, Gil.

441
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:24,227
I can't have him
tailed or brought in.
He hasn't done anything.

442
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,998
I'm telling you, the guy
is a fucking Ted Bundy.
Okay, Terry?

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,500
He's probably going
to murder her and do
kinky shit to her body!

444
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:31,968
And that's
gonna be on you!

445
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,336
You're supposed to
be a fucking cop!

446
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:34,971
I am a fucking cop, Gil!

447
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,173
I don't need
you telling me
how to be a cop.

448
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:38,975
I know what I'm
fucking doing, okay?

449
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:41,411
You know what?
You still owe me 1,700 bucks!

450
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:43,179
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

451
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,115
I got you
out of that DUI.

452
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:47,384
That report said
you soiled yourself, Gil.

453

<i>Like a fucking
homeless man!</i>

454
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:50,687
You evacuated.
You shit your pants.

455
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:52,656
I fixed that!
Okay, Gil? Me!

456
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:55,558
Fine.
Forget the 1,700 bucks.

457
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,461
Just do it because
you're my brother. Okay?

458
00:23:00,265 --> 00:23:01,565
Fine. What's the
plate number?

459
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,035

it's not advised,

but technically
I think I can leave.

I'm not trying to
get you fired, okay?

503
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:32,318
I'm leaving

Yeah.

But not in, like,
a homophobic way.

I used it
in place of "lame."

Why wouldn't
you just say "lame"?

Well, same reason
I say "fuck"
instead of "frick."

It's basically the swear

No. It's not.

541

It's a hate word used
to perpetuate homophobia.

542

546
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:19,961
Then you shouldn't say "fag."

I don't use it in reference

Yeah, I think so.
I mean morally,
I feel fine about it.

in reference to a person,
it's all right?

Okay.

611
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,063
I'm proud of you.

612
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,799
Thank you.

613
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:42,801
I'm sure I'll get there.

Oh, who gives a shit?

618
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:54,479
This is probably gonna
get pretty fucking radical.

619
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,648
But I don't want you
to get scared, okay?

620
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,518
I raced all growing up
and I even drove
professionally for a while.

621
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:01,186
Okay.

622
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:03,922
I trust you.

Bye, Gil.

Oh, my God.

00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,834
Hey! Randy?

639
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,071
Randy, are you okay, man?

640
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,240
No! I'm not
fucking okay, Charlie!

641
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,942
I'm in the
middle of a field
that you ran me into!

642
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:17,746
And my gun
started going off, man!
No! I am not okay!

643
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,249
Hey! I'm sorry!
And I don't want
to be a dick,

644
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,785
but you didn't
have to jump your van
onto that field, man.

645
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,788
I got back in my lane
with plenty of time.

646
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,290
Bullshit! I know time.

647
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,060
We would have had
a fucking head-on collision!

648
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:33,396
Okay. You know what?
You're clearly shaken up.

649
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,299
And apparently
you had another incident
with your firearm.

650
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,967
And I think you're
being a little defensive.

651
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,003
I just pulled over
to see if you're okay.
All right?

652
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,338
I am not defensive!
Are you shitting me?

653
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,874
What have I got
to be defending? Huh?

654
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,911
Nothing to defend!
You ran me off the road!

655
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:50,447
My gun went off
'cause of you,
almost killing me!

Hey, Randy?

657
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,050
Are you
really all right?

658
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,453
I am okay. I am okay.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

659
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,988
Yeah.

660
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,191
Do you want me to
call you a tow truck?

661
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,393
Obviously I have
a fucking cell phone!

662
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,763
I was in the
middle of a call when
you wrecked me! Okay?

663
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,465
Okay. Well,
you know what...

664
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:11,201
Wait, Charlie!
Don't go! Don't go, please!

665
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,903
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little embarrassed.

666
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,072
Don't go, okay?
'Cause I'll just
have to chase you.

667
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:20,744
I know you will, Randy.
But will you please be
a little more careful?

668
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,947
I mean,
it really worries me
when I look behind me

669
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,749
and I see your
van is airborne.

670

00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,786

Oh! Hey! Congratulations
on the new job!

673
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,156
Thanks!

674
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,234
when they could shop and
get whatever they wanted?

675
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,269
NEVE: That's a good idea!
Oh, hey.

676
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,172
Leave a pit by itself
right in front of a store.

677
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,008
Well he's not a killer.
Look at that face.

That's what they all say.
Until they need stitches.

crazy bitches
that live with tigers?

680
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,948
What? What are
you talking about?

681
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,919
About the women
who get pet tigers
and then get eaten?

Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah!

683
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,858
You ain't ever gonna
catch no black bitches
living with no tiger.

684
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,260
That's some
white girl shit.

685
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,961
She hates
white bitches, right?

686
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,830
We don't like white
bitches either, do we?

687
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,901
You'll never catch me
doing some shit like that.

688
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,469
Yeah? I live with a tiger
and I ain't no white bitch.

689
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,838
Oh, really?
No.

690
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,106
I'm a tiger?

691
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,340
Yes, ma'am.

692
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:26,845
Just the water?
I don't think we have the
right cookware for that...

693
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,313
Just the water?
Yeah! Mmm-hmm.

That'll be $1.69.

Hi, boss.

00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:41,293
What's up?

697
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,428
Gonna have
a hell of a meal.

698
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,464
Well, the dog
food's not for me.

699
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,366
(LAUGHING)
I'm just teasing.

700
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:51,169
But I don't think
your dog's gonna want to
eat that either, though.

701
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,371
He's lucky I feed him
anything at all after
he tore up my couch.

Mmm.
(CHUCKLES)

703
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:59,344
See? He ain't no lamb.
He's a tiger.

704
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,613
That's right, girl.
He's all tiger.

705
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:06,952
Well, maybe he thought
that couch was healthier

706
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,587
than the landfill
you're giving him.

707

Hey, dude?

708
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:14,025
How about you stop worrying
about what I feed my dog

709
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:16,929
and worry about surfboards,
or whatever the fuck it is
you think about?

710
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:18,931
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:24,437
how much better
the good dog food
is for your dog.

712
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,638
Yeah,
it's 10% more expensive.

713
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,340
But it's like
80% less poison.

714
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:28,541
I just...

715

You trying to get knocked
the fuck out, motherfucker?

716

No, no, no.
Huh?

'Cause you got the right guy.

718

out holding a baby.

Get you where we can
play around a little bit.

Right?

00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:34,708
All right?

Let's eat some dog food.
All right, buddy?

No, I am chill.

Don't do nothing stupid!

739
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,418
You like this. You want it.
You said you liked it!

740
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,354
You said it's good!
Don't you remember?

741
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:50,290
It's high-priced fucking
chicken feet dog food!
Eat it, brother!

00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,558
Baby, let's go, okay?

743
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Yo! Get your man straight!

744
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:55,429
Hey, babe.
I'll be there in
a second, okay?

745
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:58,031
No, man!
Get in the car!
It's just dog food!

746
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:00,434
No! Babe, it's not just
dog food. That's my
whole point about this.

fucking sawdust

and we're not leaving here
until my man samples some.

749
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:07,174
You got it! Just eat it!
No! Just trust me!

750
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,575
I can't eat that shit, man!

751
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,010
Why not?
I can't! Man, I can't!
I'd rather die!

752
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,513
I can't eat this shit, man!

753
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:15,550
Do you understand
what you just said?

754
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:18,152
That you would rather
die than eat that shit?

755
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,721
You understand
how that supports

what I've been
trying to tell you
the past 15 minutes?

Other people,
lives in danger,

they eat
another human being.

759
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:27,729
But you?

760
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,530
You won't even
fucking eat this.

761
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:38,106
Fuck. That's some
profound shit, man.

762
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:40,008
That's some
fucking profound shit.

Hey!

764
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,088
Come on. Come on.

765
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,592
Now, I'm going to
take your dog.

766
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:59,494
But I'm going to
tell you something.

767
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:01,095
It's not cool to wear
those tank tops anymore.

768
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,567
Unless you're wearing it
ironically or something.

769
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,574
Fuck all y'all!

770
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:27,823
Fuck me.

771
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:32,127
Oh, shit.
Get some.

772
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,130
Damn!

773
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:38,133
That's a mean kitty!

774
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,201
Thanks.

775
00:41:39,203 --> 00:41:40,235
What is it? A '75?

776
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,104
Uh, '67.

777
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:44,606
Is that what
they told you, huh?

778
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,242
Shit! Suicide doors.

779
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:49,745
Suicide...
Uh...

780
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,081
You can shut that.

781
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,183
(DOOR CLOSES)
Thanks.

782
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:55,317
Seeing if it worked, guy.

783
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,618
Oh.

784
00:41:58,421 --> 00:41:59,855
That ain't
a stock power plant.

785
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:02,324
No. Not stock.

786
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:03,625
Yeah. How many ponies?

787
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,229
Seven hundred.
Damn!

788
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:08,698
How much?

789
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:10,767
It's 700!

790
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:14,137
No. Into the motor.

791
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,439
What's the price
tag on this build?

792
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:19,175
Reason I'm asking is 'cause
I might do a motor swap

793
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:20,310
with that late
model Ford over there.

794
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,547
Yeah.

795
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:28,218
I can't really
remember everything
that went into it. So...

796
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,854
Ballpark it.

797
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:32,789
You know what?
It was about 14 grand.

798
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,693
Damn. That's commitment.

799
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:38,595
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

800
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,697
That's what I always say.

801
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:42,265
And the South
will rise again.

802
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:46,136
God! You own that too?

803
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:48,304
(LAUGHING)
You know what?
It's a rental, actually.

804
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:49,506
(LAUGHING)

805
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:50,607
Aren't they all?

806
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,808
Oh.
(ENGINE STARTING)

807
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:02,853
Hey. Have you noticed
that there is a certain
type of person

808
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,822
that is attracted
to this vehicle?

809
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,893
Yeah. Like the guy
at the gas station?

810
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:12,229
Yes. Like the guy
at the gas station.

811
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:14,832
Like, if you spent two years
building your dream car

812
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:20,271
that is was also
the dream car of
a certain type of person.

813
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:23,240
Like people who are...
I don't know.

814
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:26,510
Let's just
call them rapists,
out of convenience.

815
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:30,214
If you started
to notice that your
peers were rapists,

816
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:32,850
what do you think that
says about the old you
who built this car?

817
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,754
Look. This car
is designed specific.

818
00:43:36,756 --> 00:43:40,324
What appeals to me
is probably not what
appeals to other dudes. Okay?

819
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,260
I wanted something
that was as fast as hell,
seated six people,

820
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,563
and had a trunk
the size of an SUV's.

821
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,265
But why?

822
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:51,435
I feel like you're
insinuating that I have small
dick complex or something.

823
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:53,304
And I don't. We both
know that's not the case.

824
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:54,805
I have a lot of issues,
but not that one.

825
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:56,473
I'm just teasing you.

826
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:57,942
I don't think couples can
really tease each other.

827
00:43:57,944 --> 00:43:59,544
I think everyone
pretends they can,

828
00:43:59,546 --> 00:44:00,946
but really, there's
always some kind of

829
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:02,614
truth or judgment
in there somewhere.

830
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:04,716
Baloney.
Couples can tease.

831
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,751
Oh, yeah.
It's playful!

832
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:09,621
Well, of course.
I can say to you
you're too fat,

833
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:11,823
or you're too tall
and clearly I'm joking.

834
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:14,693
But anything else
I say I'm probably
hinting at something

835
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,294
that bothers me
about you.

836
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:18,863
But I'm framing it
as a joke, so that
when a fight ensues

837
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,765
I don't have to take
responsibility for it.

838
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:23,735
Do you want to
just go to this place?

839
00:44:24,303 --> 00:44:25,403
Sure.

840
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,448
I feel like you just
got really upset, though.

841
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,749
And I honestly was
just teasing you.

842
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:39,017
Okay. I'll be back
in a second.

843
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:50,362
It's okay if you're
feeling sensitive
and I'll drop it.

844
00:44:50,364 --> 00:44:53,031
The only reason
I want to talk about it

845
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:55,734
is so we can
figure out why.

846
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,306
I think it's just going
home after four years.

847
00:45:00,308 --> 00:45:02,041
It's just bringing
up some weird shit.

848
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:05,344
What kind of weird shit?

849
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:07,880
I don't know.

850
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:09,849
Just weird shit, really.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

851
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:12,952
Oh, my God!

852
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:15,721
Oh, hey!

853
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:17,323
Sorry!
Sorry about that.

854
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:18,658
Sorry. Very sorry.

855
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,759
Our bad. Sorry.

856
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:22,962
Oh, my God!

857
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,964
(LAUGHING)

858
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,033
Get away from the door!

859
00:45:27,035 --> 00:45:29,068
That was a real
life lemon party.

860
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,039
That was grannies and
grampies fooling around!
(LAUGHING)

861
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:35,841
What you buying, baby?

862
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,878
I was just checking
my Facebook page.

863
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,882
I don't know why.
You ain't single and
you've got three friends.

864
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:44,550
What the fuck you be
checking on Facebook?

865
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:46,919
(BOTH LAUGHING)
What are you
checking on Facebook?

866
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:49,555
Maybe Allen put some
new photos of himself

867
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,524
naked in front of the mirror.
I have to stay abreast.

868
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:52,825
You don't
want to miss that.

869
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,335
Get the fuck out of here.

870
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:02,502
What?

871
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:06,006
Get your shit.
We've got to go.
Where are you going?

872
00:46:06,008 --> 00:46:08,408
We got to go. Come on.
Get your shit. We got to go.

873
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,044
That's what happens.
I talked to him
10 minutes ago!

874
00:46:11,046 --> 00:46:13,947
No. He knows where he is.
All right? I'll see you soon.

875
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:15,549
Babe? You gonna
take care of the dogs?
Mmm-hmm.

876
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,683
Did you put the alarm on?

877
00:46:16,685 --> 00:46:17,851
Yes.

878
00:46:21,556 --> 00:46:23,457
(GAGGING)

879
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,092
Hey, honey?
What was Gil screaming

880
00:46:25,094 --> 00:46:27,094
when you were
walking towards the car?

881
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:29,963
He sounded like he
was repeating something.

882
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:32,432
I don't know what the fuck
he was saying. He's nuts.

883
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:34,735
Well, obviously you heard
what he was saying.

884
00:46:34,737 --> 00:46:36,770
He kept repeating it
over and over again.

885
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:38,672
He was just talking shit.

886
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,940
But what was it?

887
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:42,876
Huh?

888
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:45,812
Charlie?

889
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:48,548
What was he saying?

890
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:51,386
He was saying "Yul Perrkins."

891
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:52,920
He was saying "Yul Perrkins"
over and over again

892
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:54,856
so that you would hear
and then we would
be in this fight.

893
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,591
So he won.

894
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:59,527
We're not fighting.
What are you...
Who's Yul Perrkins?

895
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,065
That's my name.
That's my real name.
Yul Perrkins.

896
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:07,802
Perrkins. Yul Perrkins
is my real name.

897
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:12,507
Why on earth would
we fight about that?

898
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:14,675
I don't know.
I just feel like this
is gonna be a fight.

899
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:16,744
Like, why wouldn't I have
told you my name before?

900
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,413
Or that comment you
made about my car.

901
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,149
Or the old me.
I just, you know...

902
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,885
I want everything to be
exactly how it's been
since we've met.

903
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:26,721
I don't want to have
to go all the way back
into my background

904
00:47:26,723 --> 00:47:28,523
just because
we're going to L.A.

905
00:47:28,525 --> 00:47:30,525
Can you calm down?
Come here.
Come here for a second.

906
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:33,060
Please come sit
on the bed with me.

907
00:47:42,638 --> 00:47:48,644
I think Yul Perrkins
is a very cute name.

908
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:51,013
<i>I think it sounds like
a    Sesame Streecharacter.</i>

909
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:53,482
Yeah?

910
00:47:53,484 --> 00:47:56,518
So did all the kids
on the playground.
It was not very cute.

911
00:47:57,654 --> 00:48:00,656
My dad loves Yul Brynner.
He thinks he's a badass.

912
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,158
But no one
in my generation's
ever heard of him.

913
00:48:06,463 --> 00:48:07,963
Can I ask you
one more question?

914
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:08,931
And you promise
you'll tell the truth?

915
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:10,599
Yeah.

916
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,139
Did they assign you
the name Charlie Bronson
or did you get to pick it?

917
00:48:18,675 --> 00:48:19,908
I picked it.

918
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:25,681
Was it 'cause you
thought it sounded tough

919
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:27,916
and you were tired of
having a sissy name?

920
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:30,486
Yeah.

921
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:35,491
That is the most adorable
thing I've ever heard.
Come here.

922
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:42,664
And you loved
Charles Bronson movies?

923
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:49,506
I actually named myself
after that famous
English prisoner

924
00:48:49,508 --> 00:48:52,909
who named himself after
the actor Charles Bronson.

925
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:57,580
And I found him
intriguing, I guess.

926
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:59,616
That's weird.

927
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:02,552
To find someone
like that intriguing.

928
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:04,254
It's weird.

929
00:49:04,256 --> 00:49:06,556
Well, look,
I don't know...

930
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:08,658
It sounds stupid now that
I'm saying it out loud,

931
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,226
but at the time it seemed...

932
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:13,863
I didn't know you
then, Annie.

933
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:17,901
So I obviously
picked the wrong name.
And I'm sorry that I...

934
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:20,270
It's fine. Hey. Hey!
You can call me
whatever you want.

935
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:24,307
You're not on trial here,
okay? This is all
just new to me.

936
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:27,710
Come back here. Come back.

937
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:30,313
You want to drop it?

938
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:33,283
Yeah. I would appreciate that.
Okay.

939
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,294
TERRY: 127?
Are you kidding me?
(SIRENS WAILING)

940
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:45,763
Might as well tap me on
the shoulder and say,
"Fuck you."

941
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:28,372
Sir, are you okay?

942
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:30,708
Have you been
in an accident?

943
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,009
What?

944
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:34,612
No. I'm a U.S. marshal.

945
00:50:35,747 --> 00:50:39,316
Okay. Sir, your vehicle
appears to be totaled.

946
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:42,621
And I clocked you at 127
miles per hour back there.

947
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,090
I'm a marshal.
And I've got someone
in witness protection

948
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:46,858
who needs my protection.

949
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,360
I totally understand, sir.

950
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:51,096
Is there any way you
could stay below 100?

951
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:53,231
I'm very worried
about this car getting
up into triple digits.

952
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:58,036
I suppose I could try
to keep it in the high 90s.

953
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:00,205
Thank you.
'Cause just like
it's your job

954
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,707
to be protecting
whoever you may
be protecting...

955
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,376
ANGELLA: Um...
What? Hold on a second.

956
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:05,810
I'll be right back, sir.

957
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,344
ANGELLA: I need
to talk to you.

958
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,346
What?

959
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:10,649
What?

960
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,418
Okay. I wasn't snooping.
But your phone did vibrate

961
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,854
and so I checked
it out and...

962
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:17,088
That's your
Pouncer app, right?

963
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,823
Yeah.

964
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,892
Okay. So that dot
popped up like
two seconds ago.

965
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:23,862
So, there's got to be
another gay guy within,
what, 100 feet of here?

966
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:25,930
Yeah.

967
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:27,866
I mean,
it must be him.

968
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:34,072
Although I don't think
he's gay. He's like 50.

969
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:37,677
There's 50-year-old
gay people, Angella.

970
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,345
We don't grow
out of being gay.

971
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:42,014
Oh, no. I didn't...
That's not what I meant.
I just...

972
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,283
I just think you
should ask him out.

973
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:45,818
What do you mean...
Oh! Because he's gay

974
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,219
and I'm gay I should
just ask him out?

975
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:50,089
Are you instantly
attracted to every
straight person you meet?

976
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:51,323
No.

977
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,224
Come on.

978
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,098
I'm actually
gonna let you go.

979
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,766
But I do need to
see your phone for
a second please, sir.

980
00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:02,134
Why?

981
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:04,904
A small request after
you were driving that fast.

982
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:06,238
Can I see your
phone please, sir?

983
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:08,774
Thank you very much.

984
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:13,045
Yeah. There we go.
That's what I thought.

985
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,447
Uh... Hi.

986
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:16,182
What are you doing?

987
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:19,719
I'm programming
my name and number
in here.

988
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:21,387
Just in case you
ever need "backup."

989
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,189
What are you...

990
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:24,757
Pouncer.
Oh.

991
00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:26,926
I didn't know what...

992
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:28,928
Oh, you had no idea
what it was?

993
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,063
It's okay.
Don't be embarrassed.
I'm a fan of Pouncer.

994
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,798
I Pounce.
You Pounce too, I guess.

995
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:35,736
So, you should be
very flattered,

996
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:37,938
'cause I'm an eight
and you're a five, so...

997
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,172
You have a safe night.

998
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:41,274
Right.

999
00:52:48,015 --> 00:52:50,350
Okay. Do you need to
call me back after you've
collected yourself?

1000
00:52:50,352 --> 00:52:52,519
No, no, no. I'm good.

1001
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:54,988
So I stopped off at
San Andreas and Jackson.

1002
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,389
They were nowhere
to be found.

1003
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,258
I don't think they could
have got as far as Planada.

1004
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,961
So my guess is Mariposa.

1005
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:03,363
We'll take a peek in Planada
on our way up to Mariposa.

1006
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:06,032
Oh, great! Great.
Now, about the girl, Annie,

1007
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:08,335
who's my girlfriend
and a victim in all this.

1008
00:53:08,337 --> 00:53:09,770
Uh, I want assurances...
(PHONE BEEPING)

1009
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:11,538
Hello?

1010
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,773
Did that drop
or did he just...

1011
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,313
Hey, buddy, look.
They have shower caps.

1012
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:21,948
Oh, yeah?
Your favorite.

1013
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,950
Yep.

1014
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:25,519
I'm gonna go get some
coffee for us, okay?

1015
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:26,953
Okay.

1016
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:28,855
I'll be ready to go in 10.

1017
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:29,890
Have a good shower.

1018
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:30,924
Thank you.

1019
00:53:32,227 --> 00:53:33,361
(DOOR CLOSES)

1020
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,006
Come on!

1021
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:42,998
Are you...
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

1022
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:50,472
Fuck!

1023
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:52,274
Fuck!

1024
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:58,914
That fucking hillbilly
from the gas station stole
my engine last night!

1025
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,282
What?

1026
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:02,384
From the Lincoln!
I just went out there
to start it.

1027
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,353
There's no engine inside.

1028
00:55:04,355 --> 00:55:06,288
How do you steal an engine?

1029
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,891
Grind the motor mounts out
and pull it out with
a cherry picker.

1030
00:55:08,893 --> 00:55:10,025
It probably took
him 20 minutes.

1031
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:11,260
Fuck!

1032
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:12,561
Is there anything I can do?

1033
00:55:13,496 --> 00:55:15,063
No. Just finish your shower.

1034
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,365
I'm gonna go to the lobby

1035
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:17,633
and see if they know
someone with a tow truck.

1036
00:55:17,635 --> 00:55:20,435
Okay.
That was a $12,000 engine.

1037
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:24,306
Sorry your engine
was stolen, sweetie!

1038
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:31,247
Where is she?

1039
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:32,115
(MUFFLED)
What the fuck
are you doing?

1040
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:33,449
Where is she, man?

1041
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:35,251
You just fucking
broke my nose!

1042
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:37,587
I don't care!
I swear to God
if you already killed her...

1043
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:42,292
I'm not
a fucking killer, man!
What's wrong with you?

1044
00:55:42,294 --> 00:55:46,029
You were
involved in a homicide!
I am not leaving without her.

1045
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:47,263
Get that fucking
club out of my face!

1046
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:48,665
Don't talk to me like that!

1047
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:51,034
Listen, man! She is fine!
Do you want to see her?

1048
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:53,202
Yes!

1049
00:55:53,204 --> 00:55:55,238
Lower that shit and
I'll show her to you!

1050
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,539
All right! Open the door!

1051
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,608
What the fuck
are you thinking, man?

1052
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,576
Hitting me in the nose
with a golf club?

1053
00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:02,011
I didn't think it
would hurt that bad!

1054
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,246
Jesus Christ!

1055
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:08,685
I've been through some shit.
I've never seen a
bitch move like that.

1056
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:11,521
Well, if you wouldn't
be such an asshole!

1057
00:56:11,523 --> 00:56:14,290
You know what pisses me off
the most about you hitting me
with this fucking...

1058
00:56:14,292 --> 00:56:15,625
No! I don't really
give a shit either.

1059
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,034
It's that you made me
break my promise to Annie.

1060
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:29,506
That was a shitty
thing to do, Gil!

1061
00:56:31,276 --> 00:56:33,510
That was really
fucking selfish of you.

1062
00:56:36,181 --> 00:56:37,681
Fucking selfish prick.

1063
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:11,148
Oh, fuck! Fuck...

1064
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:25,697
(CAMERA CLICKING)

1065
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,110
Honey!
(SCREAMS)

1066
00:57:39,112 --> 00:57:40,578
I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Honey?

1067
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,180
We have got to go right now.

1068
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:43,715
I will tell you
about it in the car, okay?

1069
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:45,817
What car? I thought
you said the car was...

1070
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:48,386
Baby, this is life or death.
I need you to get out of
the shower this second.

1071
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:49,220
Okay? Let's go.
Okay.

1072
00:57:57,396 --> 00:58:00,365
I don't understand.
What happened to your face?
Why are you bleeding?

1073
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:02,367
Baby, will you please
just get dressed
and pack, okay?

1074
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:04,469
Yes.
The people I testified
against are in the lobby.

1075
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:05,570
We got to get out
of here right now.

1076
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:06,671
Should I call the police?

1077
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:08,139
There's no time for that.

1078
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,774
Why are you bleeding?
Did they hit you?

1079
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:11,409
Baby, just faster, okay?

1080
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:13,311
I'm going
as fast as I can!

They are right out there.
Okay, go baby! Go, go, go!

1084
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:26,092
I'll grab Yul.
You got the girl?

1085
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:28,761
You want me to
take the gun since you're
focused on the door?

1086
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:30,663
I think I can manage both.

00:58:30,665 --> 00:58:31,630
Okay. All right.

1088
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:38,604

Yep. Here we go.

1092
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:44,510
One. Two.

You got
everything you need?
Yes.

Damn it!

1104
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:12,705
Can you grab that?
Yeah, honey...

1105
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:16,643
Okay. Your purse.

1106

It's a remote keyless entry.

For which car?

1110
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,355
It's kind of
a universal one.

1111

I just made it.
Mama, will you just throw
your stuff in the car?

go, go, go. Faster!

just going to get into

Did you just
steal this car?

1119
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:19,740
Yes, I did.
But only because
I absolutely had to.

1120
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:22,443
How did you steal it?

1121
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:24,412
If you lose
your keyless entry
and go to the dealership

1122
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:26,681
they use the
VIN number to get a new
code in their program.

1123
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:28,316
And I got a new code
and I programmed this one.

1124
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:29,684
But how?
How did you get the code?

1125
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,988
I have passwords for
the different dealerships.

1126
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,290
Why do you have
those passwords?

Charlie?

1128
01:00:38,294 --> 01:00:39,827
Look. If we have
this conversation

1129
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:43,297
I'm afraid you're
not gonna want to
be with me anymore.

1130
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:46,300
Okay, well, if we don't
have this conversation,
I can't be with you.

1131
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:47,935
I can't be
with someone
that I don't trust.

1132
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:49,303
So you're just going

I witnessed a bank robbery
that went really wrong.

1138
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:04,752
ANNIE: Yeah.

1139
01:01:04,754 --> 01:01:07,555
What I left out is that
I was kind of involved.

1140
01:01:07,557 --> 01:01:10,259
Not in the violence part,
but in the getaway
driving part.

I'm sorry I didn't
say that to you,

but when I got into
witness protection

1143
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,329
I looked at it
as a new beginning.

1144
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:15,530
And I knew I wasn't going
to be that guy anymore...

1145
01:01:15,532 --> 01:01:16,932
You're a bank robber?

1146
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,268
Charlie?

1147
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,903
No. I didn't actually
rob any of the banks.

1148
01:01:21,905 --> 01:01:23,705
Alex and Allen
did the robbing

1149
01:01:23,707 --> 01:01:26,341
and I did the
driving them to and
from the bank robbing.

1150
01:01:26,343 --> 01:01:29,011
Banks? Plural?

1151
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:30,545
How many times did
you do that, Charlie?

1152
01:01:30,547 --> 01:01:32,281
I don't know. A few.

1153
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:33,448
You don't know?

1154
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,650
Maybe 12 or 13.

1155
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:36,351
"Maybe"? Maybe a dozen?

1156
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:37,686
Maybe a baker's dozen?
You're not sure?

1157
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:39,321
No. It was 13.

1158
01:01:39,323 --> 01:01:43,492
Yes, it was absolutely 13.
This is why I didn't
tell you about this.

1159
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:44,993
Because I knew you were
going to react this way.

1160
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:48,297
Who wouldn't react this way,
Charlie? A sociopath?

1161
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,332
Look, I have
a terrible past.
I'm sorry about that.

1162
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,367
But it has
nothing to do with us.

1163
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:54,636
How'd you do it?
How'd you get off, Charlie?

1164
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:57,005
You testified against
your friends to save
your own ass?

1165
01:01:57,007 --> 01:01:58,774
They were gonna
charge Neve with
accessory to murder

1166
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:00,776
because she cased the job.

1167
01:02:00,778 --> 01:02:04,346
So either I turned
on Alex and Allen,
who did the shooting,

1168
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:05,781
or Neve went to prison
for the rest of her life.

1169
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:07,784
Who is Neve?

1170
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:09,652
The black girl
in the station wagon.

1171
01:02:09,654 --> 01:02:11,654
Why aren't they
in prison, Charlie?

1172
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:13,856
They implied I wasn't
a credible witness
because I was...

1173
01:02:14,758 --> 01:02:17,593
You know,
engaged to Neve.

1174
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:22,432
You were engaged to a woman
who plans bank robberies?

1175
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:24,867
Who are you?

Don't.

01:02:30,574 --> 01:02:32,975
Pull the car over.
I think I'm going
to throw up.

1179
01:02:32,977 --> 01:02:35,678
I can't pull over right now,
or Alex is gonna
shoot both of us.

lose them, Charlie!

01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,740
and we owe each other
those kind of details.

1224
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,780
Look, whatever you're
mad about happened
before we ever met, okay?

1225
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,783
Look! I have not
violated your trust
once since we met.

1226
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,919
Except for completely
lying about who you are.

1227
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:35,822
Look, you may have had
three-ways with dudes
or smoked cocaine!

1228
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:39,225
But if you had,
just because you didn't
disclose that to me,

1229
01:06:39,227 --> 01:06:41,328
doesn't mean
you're a liar!

1230
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,797
I don't care what
you did before we met.

1231
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,599
All I care about
is who you are now!

1232
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,335
Really?
So if I was a pedophile,

1233
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,338
if I had raped children,
you wouldn't care about that?

1234
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,708
If I had been a member of
the Ku Klux Klan? No biggie?

1235
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:59,647
You wouldn't feel like
a complete idiot for having
fallen in love with me?

1236
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:00,348
(PANTING)

1237
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,384
Buddy, I...

1238
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,221
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1239
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,624
I was ashamed.
And I was embarrassed.

1240
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:13,694
And I thought we would
just live in Milton for
the rest of our lives

1241
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,029
and be happy
and have babies.

1242
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,697
And I would be Charlie.
And that would be that.

1243
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,102
What if I did tell you?
Be honest.

1244
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,303
Would you have
fallen in love with me?

1245
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,773
I don't know!

1246
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:29,176
And I'm never gonna know,

1247
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,078
because you took that
decision away from me.

1248
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:36,083
But yes, Charlie!
I find it very difficult
to believe

1249
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,052
that someone who
justified robbing 13 banks

1250
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,421
would ever not be
that type of person.

1251
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,957
It's not exactly
the high profile
background you look for

1252
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,059
when you're choosing
someone to have a baby with.

1253
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,363
You know,
if I was an ex-drug addict
or an ex-alcoholic,

1254
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,733
I guarantee
you would be able
to look past that.

1255
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,901
That's not the point.

1256
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,836
The bottom line is
in any relationship

1257
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:57,139
you can either wallow
in the person's past,

1258
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:59,274
or you can look
at the person that's
right in front of you

1259
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:01,376
and choose
to move forward.
But you can't do both.

1260
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:07,049
I agree.

1261
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,750
Then move forward with me.

1262
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,091
But the person in
front of me lied to me.

1263
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:20,095
Whether you want to call
it that or not, Charlie.

1264
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,136
I need to get to L.A.

1265
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,872
And I'm gonna do
that without you.

1266
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,343
How?

Yeah. I'm fine.
Can you, um...

Can you drive me
the rest of the way
to L.A., please?

1273

Of course.

1274
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:20,823
Or would you rather
go back to our house
and digest all this?

1275
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,925
No, Gil.
I just want
to get to L.A.

1276
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:25,495
I can do that.

1277
01:09:25,497 --> 01:09:27,864
Why don't you hop in
and I'll gather
all your belongings?

1278
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:28,898
Okay.

1279
01:09:32,803 --> 01:09:36,139
Hey, asshole.
Do not even think about
tailing us. I'm serious.

1280
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:37,974
Or what? You're gonna
stab me with that knife?

1281
01:09:37,976 --> 01:09:39,275
I could, if you charged me.

1282
01:09:39,277 --> 01:09:41,177
Yeah? Okay.
I'm terrified.

1283
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:43,246
Yeah, well,
you're the aggressor.

1284

Listen. I still think
you're a fucking turd.

1285
01:09:46,352 --> 01:09:48,352
But I'm sorry
that I clocked you

1286
01:09:48,354 --> 01:09:50,454
and I appreciate you
taking Annie to L.A.

Oh, and we know
who got the best
of who in that scuffle.

1289
01:09:55,994 --> 01:09:57,461

just ask
your previous shirt.

1374
01:14:28,471 --> 01:14:30,671
The fucking
arrogance of you, man!

1375
01:14:30,673 --> 01:14:34,276
I don't understand? What?
You fucking didn't like
the gym equipment?

1376
01:14:34,278 --> 01:14:35,444
There wasn't enough
time for you to read?

1377
01:14:35,446 --> 01:14:36,678
I got butt-fucked.

1378
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:44,486
I got
fucked in the butt
because of you.

1379
01:14:47,323 --> 01:14:49,825
Yeah.

1380
01:14:49,827 --> 01:14:53,095
That's horrible.
I did not realize
that happened in jail.

1381
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,596
I thought that
was a prison thing.

1382
01:14:54,598 --> 01:14:55,797
Yeah, well...

1383
01:14:58,101 --> 01:14:59,634
I guess it's not
exclusive to prisons.

1384
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:09,711
Well, I mean, you've never
been, like, a homophobe.

1385
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,347
It seems like something
you probably worked through.

1386
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:14,116
You're a strong dude.

1387
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:15,484
I don't think homophobia
has anything to do with it.

1388
01:15:15,486 --> 01:15:18,553
The guy was disgusting.

1389
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:19,788
If I was gay
I would still want
to come after you.

1390
01:15:20,656 --> 01:15:22,190
I'm really sorry.

1391
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:24,192
I'm really, really sorry.

1392
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:25,827
Was it a black guy?

1393
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,732
No, it wasn't a black guy.

1394
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,701
That's a pretty fucking
racist thing to say.

1395
01:15:31,703 --> 01:15:34,737
You think that's racist?
Yeah.

1396
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,240
I think that's
the opposite of racist.

1397
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,575
I don't think it would
make a black guy gay
to fuck a white dude

1398
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,477
because we're such
pussies compared to them.

1399
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:43,346
What the fuck
are you even talking
about right now?

1400
01:15:43,348 --> 01:15:45,515
I'm saying if I was
a black dude I wouldn't
feel the least bit gay

1401
01:15:45,517 --> 01:15:48,784
I would think a white guy is
just like masculine chicks.

1402
01:15:48,786 --> 01:15:51,387
Like, Ellen.
She's masculine,

1403
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:53,222
but I would
totally fuck her
if I were single.

1404
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:54,690
I wasn't fucked
by a black guy.

1405
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:56,659
Okay?

1406
01:15:56,661 --> 01:15:57,827
Can we just go?
Okay.

1407
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:03,900
Was it a Mexican guy?

1408
01:16:03,902 --> 01:16:04,934
No.

1409
01:16:16,647 --> 01:16:17,947
Oh, man.

1410
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:22,718
Was it one of
those white guys?
Those fucking Nazis?

1411
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,223
No! It was not
a fucking white guy, either.

1412
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:28,792
Charlie?
It doesn't matter who
violated him. Okay?

1413
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:30,661
It could have been
any number of people.

1414
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:32,396
It doesn't matter
their race, okay?

1415
01:16:32,398 --> 01:16:33,764
It could have
been Latino. It could
have been Tongan.

1416
01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:36,366
It could have
been a Persian...
It was Filipino!

1417
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:39,603
I was butt-fucked by
a Filipino dude, okay?

1418
01:16:39,605 --> 01:16:42,272
Does that fucking
solve your dilemma

1419
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:44,341
of what part of the world
my ass traveled to?

1420
01:16:44,343 --> 01:16:45,209
CHARLES: Well...

1421
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:49,680
I mean, I don't think...
That's not so bad.

1422
01:16:49,682 --> 01:16:53,350
I mean, just like
all black dudes
think of us as women,

1423
01:16:53,352 --> 01:16:57,654
I think of all Asians
as women, you know?
Even the men.

1424
01:16:57,656 --> 01:17:01,325
I feel like you
basically hooked up
with an Asian lady.

1425
01:17:01,327 --> 01:17:03,560
Charlie, just...
No, I didn't hook up with
anybody, bro. I was raped.

1426
01:17:03,562 --> 01:17:04,595
Okay, listen, I don't...

1427
01:17:04,597 --> 01:17:05,696
Fucking hooked up?

1428
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:09,499
I feel partly
responsible for this
and I'm really sorry.

1429
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,934
Well that's
a weird angle, bro.

1430
01:17:20,478 --> 01:17:22,012
ANGELLA: Fucking
back up, Randy!

1431
01:17:28,654 --> 01:17:30,388
Gil, what the fuck
are you doing out here?

1432
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,624
They have Annie.
Alex Dmitri took her.

1433
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:33,891
Get in the van.
Ride with him.

1434
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:35,893
RANDY: Let's go!

1435
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:50,341
<i>RANDY:  Hey...</i>

1436
01:17:56,649 --> 01:18:00,418
Hey, you remember my dad
lives at 1805 Burns in
Spicewood, right?

1437
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,452
I don't remember a place

1438
01:18:01,454 --> 01:18:02,987
I've been to 200 times, no.

1439
01:18:02,989 --> 01:18:05,757
1805 Spicewood
in Burns, California.

1440
01:18:05,759 --> 01:18:06,724
Write that down.
Write that down.

1441
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:28,514
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

1442
01:18:28,516 --> 01:18:30,382
Look at this guy.
Ringing the doorbell
to his own house.

1443
01:18:32,886 --> 01:18:35,754
What's wrong?

1444
01:18:35,756 --> 01:18:39,058
I have not talked
to my dad since
I got arrested, so...

1445
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,592
Yeah, but that's
not your fault.

1446
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,027
He knows you can't
contact your family.

1447
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:45,764
No. You can.

1448
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:48,334
Charlie, you told me
that you couldn't
contact your family.

1449
01:18:48,336 --> 01:18:50,369
I did not tell you that.
You might have assumed that.

1450
01:18:50,371 --> 01:18:51,870
But I never said that.
Okay, fine. Forget it.

1451
01:18:53,907 --> 01:18:54,873
Why haven't you
talked to your dad?

1452
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:58,510
I don't know, uh...

1453
01:18:59,713 --> 01:19:03,015
Shame? Fucking
demoralizing shame?

1454
01:19:09,356 --> 01:19:10,956
(ALEX LAUGHING)

1455
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,991
That's been
four years coming.

1456
01:19:12,993 --> 01:19:14,660
And you deserve
more than just that.

1457
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:16,095
I know.

1458
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:19,366
Yeah, I don't know
what pisses me off
the most, Yul.

1459
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:21,501
The fact that
you got involved
in all that shit,

1460
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:24,037
or that you ran off
like a coward when
everything blew up.

1461
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:27,407
I didn't raise
that person.

1462
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:29,442
That's not my son.

1463
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:34,047
And you used the Lincoln.

1464
01:19:34,815 --> 01:19:36,383
Our project car.

1465
01:19:37,118 --> 01:19:38,151
Makes me sick!

1466
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,487
Yeah. Me too.

1467
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:45,692
Now, why are you
all together again?

1468
01:19:45,694 --> 01:19:47,727
Not by choice.

1469
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:50,630
I buried something in
the pasture that Alex wants.

1470
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:51,865
Hey, Mr. Perrkins.
How are you?
Good to see you.

1471
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:52,866
Mr. Perrkins.

1472
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:55,101
Now, who's this one?

1473
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:59,873
This is Annie. She is my,
or was, my girlfriend.

1474
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,841
Prior to all
this being revealed.

1475
01:20:02,576 --> 01:20:03,977
Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.

1476
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:08,581
Clint Perrkins.

1477
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:14,053
Good. Good. Good.
This feels right.
This feels right.

1478
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:15,456
Want to go to the pasture?

1479
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,893
Good to see you.

1480
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:20,761
You know I'm going to shoot
you in the back of the head

1481
01:20:20,763 --> 01:20:22,129
if you don't
find this money?
You know that?

1482
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:23,631
What are you going to
do with this money, Alex?

1483
01:20:23,633 --> 01:20:25,900
They know
the serial numbers
on half these bills.

1484
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:27,501
I don't think they're
gonna be caring
about serial numbers

1485
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:28,502
in Iraq, bro.

1486
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:31,172
Get the fuck out of here.

1487
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:33,207
You're going to buy dinar?

1488
01:20:33,209 --> 01:20:34,642
How the fuck do
you know about dinar?

1489
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:36,777
If you buy $100,000
worth of dinar

1490
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:38,846
and it goes to the value
of the Kuwait dollar,
you're looking at

1491
01:20:38,848 --> 01:20:40,214
$300,000,000.
$300,000,000.

1492
01:20:40,216 --> 01:20:42,917
Heaven forbid either of you
ever worked for something.

1493
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:45,019
Hey, Clint? Why don't
you think of this gun
as a microphone?

1494
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:47,121
When it's not in your hand
you shut the fuck up. Okay?

1495
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:52,226
It's none of my business,
but just so you know,

1496
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:55,196
the Charlie that...

1497
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,732
Yul, that I've known
for the past year

1498
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:01,001
I think is the one that
you were trying to raise.

1499
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:04,071
He's actually
a pretty good boy.

1500
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:05,940
Yeah.

1501
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:07,875
Hey, give me that shovel!

1502
01:21:07,877 --> 01:21:09,910
Boy, you look like
a monkey fucking a football.

1503
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,078
Oh, I got it, Pops. Thanks.

1504
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,179
Allen. Let him do it.

1505
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:14,249
That is bullshit, though.

1506
01:21:15,952 --> 01:21:17,052
Hey, uh...

1507
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,223
I'm sorry
I disappeared like that.

1508
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:25,093
I couldn't handle
letting you down on
top of everything else.

1509
01:21:25,095 --> 01:21:26,928
It was just
too much for me.
And it was

1510
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:29,965
cowardly.
And I'm sorry.

1511
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:34,970
I'm racing Class 1 now.

1512
01:21:34,972 --> 01:21:36,238
Get out of here.
Class 1?

1513
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,975
Yep. I bought a Tatum,
700 horse.

1514
01:21:39,977 --> 01:21:42,110
You should drive it.

1515
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:44,179
Motherfucker will go over
or through anything.

1516
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:46,281
It's a...

1517
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:02,063
Good luck with the dinar.

1518
01:22:02,598 --> 01:22:03,865
Oh, man.

1519
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:05,267
It's gonna be huge, Yul.

1520
01:22:05,269 --> 01:22:08,670
if you weren't
such a shitty
motherfucking friend.

1521
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:09,906
All right. Let's go.

1522
01:22:09,908 --> 01:22:11,007
Don't touch me!
What, bitch?

1523
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,008
Ow!

you've got the fucking
money! Just go!

No, no!

I can't see
a goddamn thing.
Are you sure?

Yes.

01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:37,110
Okay, you know what?
It's 2:30.

1575
01:26:37,112 --> 01:26:38,912
So I think we're just
gonna have to chance it.

1576
01:26:38,914 --> 01:26:42,882
Well, I mean, we've got to
get on the freeway to
get to UC from here.

1577
01:26:42,884 --> 01:26:44,384
And this thing isn't
exactly highway legal.

1578
01:26:44,386 --> 01:26:46,186
So I think we should...

1579
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:48,521
I can call a cab.

1580
01:26:48,523 --> 01:26:50,924
But you don't have
time to call a cab.

1581
01:26:50,926 --> 01:26:54,427
Then I'll be late.
Or I won't make it.

But I don't want you

I don't care if
I get arrested, okay?

I promised you that
I was gonna get you
to this interview,

01:27:02,137 --> 01:27:03,404
and I'm gonna do that.

1586
01:27:04,272 --> 01:27:06,273
I don't have a job.

1587
01:27:06,275 --> 01:27:08,075
I don't have any friends.

1588
01:27:08,077 --> 01:27:10,311
You don't love me anymore.

all I've got going for me.

1596

You know me
more than anyone.

1597

in love with for
the rest of my life.

the exact same person

1600
01:28:00,664 --> 01:28:03,398
except not say "fag"
when you really mean "lame"?

and call horseshit on the
60 yards, Anderson.

KEITH: Yeah, horseshit.

1609

excess of 60 yards, sir.
Okay.

1610
01:29:19,043 --> 01:29:20,977
And you thought you could
use Big Red's revolver

1611
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:23,012
instead of your own Sig?
This whole thing stinks.

from a previous exchange.

01:29:24,716 --> 01:29:26,148
Yeah, okay.

1614
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,650
I noticed that you
modified your vehicle too.

1615
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:32,355
A little bit more of an
underhaul, wasn't it?
Did you see that? Good God.

1616
01:29:32,357 --> 01:29:35,391
RANDY: It was an extreme
pursuit where I was
temporarily airborne.

1617
01:29:35,393 --> 01:29:38,260
KEITH: You want to lay down?
Take a quick sit?

1618
01:29:38,262 --> 01:29:39,729
You've clearly
got professional
health problems.

1619
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:41,998
My chest hurts
just looking at you.

1620
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,599
You've got total
disregard for equipment.

1621
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:45,735
But somehow...
Somehow

1622
01:29:45,737 --> 01:29:49,306
you managed
to take down Dmitri
without any help.

1623
01:29:49,308 --> 01:29:52,142
And that, my friend,
that's impressive.
Is it not?

1624
01:29:52,144 --> 01:29:56,013
Well, I did receive
some vital backup
from Officer Rathbinn.

1625
01:29:56,347 --> 01:29:57,481

Yeah.

probably gonna get out of
witness protection

1631
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:08,525
for this, big guy? Huh?
Maybe even air marshal.

1632
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:10,360
You like that?
You like the sound of that?

first class,
gun at the ready?

1634
01:30:12,498 --> 01:30:14,064
From your mouth
to Grant's ears.

1635
01:30:14,066 --> 01:30:15,265
I'm gonna whisper
it right in there.

1636
01:30:15,267 --> 01:30:16,600
I'm gonna
see him this afternoon.

1637
01:30:16,602 --> 01:30:17,467
I'll make sure he
knows everything.

1638
01:30:17,469 --> 01:30:19,136
Yeah, we are.

1639
01:30:19,138 --> 01:30:20,771
Hey. We'll even
throw your name in there.

1640
01:30:20,773 --> 01:30:22,272
Really?

1641
01:30:22,274 --> 01:30:23,373
Are you interested in
being a U.S. marshal?

1642
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:24,608
100%. I'm in.

1643
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:25,642
Well, good.

1644
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:31,515
Are you going
to borrow a condom
or can we go?

1645
01:30:31,517 --> 01:30:32,449
We can go.
Okay.

1646
01:30:32,451 --> 01:30:34,184
Nice going.

1647

give you guys a ride
a little bit later.

Well done!

STUDENT: Way to
go green, asshole.

1650
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:10,254
It's bio-diesel, friend.

1651
01:31:11,156 --> 01:31:13,424
Okay. You set?

1652
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,593
That was pretty
amazing. Right?

1653
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:16,561
Will you acknowledge
how cool that was?

1654
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:18,096
Yeah. It was cool.

1655
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,564
Are you all right?
Are you ready?
No.

1656
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:21,466
I'm not. I don't have
my teaching certificate.

1657
01:31:21,468 --> 01:31:26,437
I am covered in mud.
I look like a transient.

1658
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,573
Put your head back.
Close your eyes.

1659
01:31:28,575 --> 01:31:29,807
Okay?

1660
01:31:29,809 --> 01:31:31,309
Take a few deep breaths.

1661
01:31:35,547 --> 01:31:37,815
This is the only moment
you need to worry about.

1662
01:31:39,852 --> 01:31:42,521
You're not late
for anything. We made it.

1663
01:31:42,523 --> 01:31:44,456
You're not missing anything.

1664
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:46,859
You're exactly where
you are supposed to be.

1665
01:31:46,861 --> 01:31:49,495
And you're exactly who
you are supposed to be.

1666
01:31:49,497 --> 01:31:51,663
And you are
absolutely perfect.

1667
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,334
And if you're up for it

1668
01:31:55,336 --> 01:31:57,870
I will spend every
moment with you for
the rest of your life.

1669
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,307
I'm up for it.

1670
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,282
Oh, buddy.

1671
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,419
Okay, buddy.
I've got to go
now because

1672
01:32:14,421 --> 01:32:15,888
there's a job
in there that they
want to give me.

1673
01:32:16,389 --> 01:32:17,656
Go get it.

1674
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:27,599
Good luck.

1675
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:28,567
How do I look?

1676
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,768
Amazing.

01:32:35,409 --> 01:32:36,341
Shut up.

1679
01:32:40,648 --> 01:32:42,649
RANDY: Deep breath.

1680
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:46,286
No matter what happens today
you are an amazing person.

1681
01:32:46,288 --> 01:32:50,356
The test does not have
the power to define you
or validate you.

1682
01:32:50,358 --> 01:32:52,292
What the fuck?
Why do you still have
your Pouncer app?

1683
01:32:52,294 --> 01:32:53,693
Why are you going
through my fucking phone?

1684
01:32:53,695 --> 01:32:55,428
I'm not!

1685
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:58,198
You are! You're snooping
because you have
major trust issues.

1686
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,332
Yes, I've got
a lot of issues.

1687
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:02,268
Okay? No shit.
And this doesn't help.

1688
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,604
I just didn't
erase it, okay?
Not a big deal.

1689
01:33:05,773 --> 01:33:07,407
You promise?
Yes, I promise.

1690
01:33:08,609 --> 01:33:11,311
Okay, you're going
to be great today.

1691
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:13,279
You're going to
be a great marshal.
I know. Let's go.

1692
01:33:43,445 --> 01:33:44,678
(COUGHING)

1693
01:33:45,313 --> 01:33:47,248
No, thank you! Um...

1694
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,382
I'm with somebody!

1695
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:49,316
ANNIE: Excuse me?

1696
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:50,417
On the phone!

1697
01:33:50,419 --> 01:33:55,723
Come back later, please!
Office hours don't start
until next week!

1698
01:33:55,725 --> 01:33:57,725
I'm sorry. I can't
hear you through the door!

1699
01:33:57,727 --> 01:33:59,426
Having trouble hearing you.
Hi! I'm Annie Bean.

1700
01:34:00,829 --> 01:34:01,929
Sandy Osterman.

1701
01:34:03,331 --> 01:34:04,698
Please? Come in.

1702
01:34:07,035 --> 01:34:08,269
(COUGHING)

1703
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:11,805
(COUGHING)

1704
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:14,608
I'm sorry.

1705
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:16,277
I have a medical condition.

1706
01:34:18,046 --> 01:34:19,346
Are you okay?

1707
01:34:19,348 --> 01:34:22,650
Did you sleep
in an outhouse
before you came here?

1708
01:34:22,652 --> 01:34:26,553
No, (STUTTERS)
I apologize. I know
I look unprofessional,

1709
01:34:26,555 --> 01:34:27,755
and I shouldn't have
been covered in dirt.

1710
01:34:27,757 --> 01:34:29,723
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1711
01:34:29,725 --> 01:34:32,660
I was deflecting
because I was embarrassed
about the smoke...

1712
01:34:32,662 --> 01:34:38,366
My vaporizer was broke.
It's not important. Please,
just come over and sit down.

1713
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:40,902
My sister Debby told me
how wonderful you were.

1714
01:34:40,904 --> 01:34:42,070
Wait.
You're Debby's brother?

1715
01:34:42,072 --> 01:34:43,838
Yeah.

1716
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,542
That's funny.
She kept referring to you
as she and her.

1717
01:34:47,544 --> 01:34:48,977
She has thought that was
funny since we were nine.

1718
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,048
That would make me
feel really marginalized.

1719
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:54,749
<i>That's exactly how it felt.</i>

1720
01:34:56,385 --> 01:34:57,419
I like you.

1721
01:34:58,554 --> 01:35:00,388
I think you
should work here.

1722
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,724
(SHRIEKS)
I would love to! Yes!

1723
01:35:02,726 --> 01:35:03,925
<i>I mean, definite.</i>
