You're just going to make me sit here?

You couldn't be safer.
No one knows where you are.

Oh no you don't, don't do it.

- Just hold still.
- Don't please. I don't want it.

Oh, of course.

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,340
Frank Moses was never a target analyst
He's never worked in the field.

332
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,800
This guy has a history.

333
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,860
[CYNTHIA] That's a file number.

334
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,780
You need to visit the back room.

335
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,320
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

336
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,960
I didn't even know this place existed.

337
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,880
It doesn't.

338
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,390
Ahh.

339
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,230
Frank Moses' file.

340
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
You got to be kidding me.

341
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,910
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black ops agent we've ever had.

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
He retired drug lords, terrorists.

343
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
hell he ..., he toppled governments.

344
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

345
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,050
Why was he retired?

346
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,430
He got old.

347
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,640
Then some thumb sucker came along
and tagged him "RED."

348
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,680
Red?

349
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,770
Yeah. RED. you know R..E..D
"Retired - Extremely Dangerous."

350
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah...

351
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

352
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,450
Thanks.

353
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm going to need a data haunt.

354
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,660
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

355
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,620
I want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition the whole goddamn ...

356
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,800
[FRANK] We have to find Marvin Boggs.
His name is on the list too.
354

357
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,220
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

358
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,220
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

359
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,970
Oh, can we have that one?

360
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,250
Wow. All we need is a banjo.

361
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,670
[Shushing] Shhh, shhh. 
[Whispers] Keep your voice down.

362
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't make any sudden moves.

363
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,010
Just stay close to me.

364
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,340
- Don't use your cell phone.
- You took my cell phone.

365
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,430
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

366
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,560
Seriously?

367
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,850
Why are you trying to kill me?

368
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,770
I'm not trying to kill you!

369
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,940
Oh, yeah. You are.

370
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,440
Why would I be trying to kill you?

371
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,070
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

372
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,360
That was a long time ago.

373
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,860
Some people hold on to things like that.

374
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,660
I'm not trying to kill you.

375
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,160
Okay?

376
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,370
So that makes us friends.

377
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,710
Right?

378
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Right.

379
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,880
Good.

380
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,460
You want to take that knife
out of my balls now?

381
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,800
Who is she?

382
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,470
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

383
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,890
Yeah... Hi.

384
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't stay in the open.

385
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Come on, I'll show you the house.

386
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,900
What's that?

387
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,070
Decoy.

388
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
He lives in a car?

389
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,080
Come on in.

390
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,590
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

391
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
So, Let's put it this way.

392
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,930
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

393
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,270
and I could feel their eyes on me.

394
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,070
Wet like peaches.

395
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,950
I have a list here...

396
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,070
It was written by a Herald reporter
who is now dead.

397
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,780
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

398
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,490
Well, almost everyone.

399
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,370
Frank, how many times have I told you?

400
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,630
You cannot trust the system!

401
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

402
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,760
Man, satellites, cell phones,

403
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

404
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,470
Marvin!

405
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,770
That list is the one we need help with.

406
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,310
Yeah, I got to check the files.

407
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,820
[FRANK] Of course you do. Thanks, man.

408
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,450
Wow.

409
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,490
[SARAH] This guy's insane.

410
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,750
[FRANK] Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

411
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,000
This'll take a minute.

412
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,460
Sure.

413
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,590
As it turns out,

414
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,010
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

415
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,350
- Well, in that case, he looks great. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

416
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,390
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

417
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,900
Five of the guys on this list
were there, not including us.

418
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,650
Uh, San Benito. Just outside.

419
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,150
Injun territory.

420
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,280
Yeah. It was a little village.
Uh, Everybody was killed civilians and ...

421
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,120
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up"...

422
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,990
"Make it look like it never happened."

423
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,750
You think everyone on this list was there?

424
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,500
Damn it.

425
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Damn it!

426
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,790
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

427
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,010
They're all trying to kill us?

428
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,550
Exactly!

429
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,550
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

430
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,640
Gabriel Singer.

431
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,010
Frank!

432
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,850
I never thought I'd say this again.

433
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,850
I am getting the pig!

434
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,360
Who's she talking to?

435
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,070
Just take it easy.

436
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,240
[MARVIN]
Frank, we got to get rid of this broad.

437
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,040
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

438
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,080
We're not getting rid of the broad.

439
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,040
I like her. Okay?

440
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,670
What's the angle?

441
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,960
No angle. I like her.

442
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,430
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

443
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,100
probably right now,

444
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,350
install the recognition software
and back trace it to Singer.

445
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,480
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

446
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
and we're fried with Y-rays.

447
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,270
How you doing?

448
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,280
Good, fine.

449

[Marvin Mumbles]
November niner 745.

451
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,000
Wow, Singer is going to be
in Mobile tomorrow.

452
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,790
But we can catch him at the 
airfreight terminal.

453
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,170
How about that?

454

[MAN ON PA.] The Sunset Limited

It's the final boarding call

Oh my God! Please don't...

No, please! No!

No, no. Who do you work for?

- What?
- Who do you work for?

464
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,750
Marvin! Whoa!

Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

There's a camera in her bag.
I'm going to kill her now.

Try not to kill anyone.

say to the Chinese

Yes, I thought it might be nice

Here at Browning-Orvis,

Well I was with MI6,

So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

Fuck you, Cynthia.

1316
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,570
Thanks.

1317
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:49,910
This going to be a problem?

1318
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:55,000
No.

1319
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,170
I got it...

1320
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,000
...Grandpa.

1322
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,430
Feel better now?

1323
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,770
Yeah.

1324
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,230
Want to get pancakes?

1325
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,980
Can you believe it? It all worked out.

1326
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:25,650
Something bad is going to happen very soon.

1327
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,490
Maybe not. Wait a second ...

1328
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,910
Nobody's chasing us.

1329
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,330
No one's trying to kill us.

1330
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,830
I think we just got our lives back.

1331
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:40,080
Almost.

1332
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,750
You still owe me a small favor.

1333
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,960
Oh, Ivan!

1334
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:47,630
His timing is terrible.

1335
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,220
You gave a favor to him?

1336
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:54,260
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

1337
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,310
Can we go?

1338
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,610
Yes. We can go.

1339
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:35,680
I told you something bad was
going to happen.

1340

Keep your skirt on Goldie locks.

1341
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:40,890
Moldova sucks.

1342

Moldova sucks!

your girlfriend can wear the dress.
