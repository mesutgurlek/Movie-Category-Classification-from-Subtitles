169

Give me that!

170

...to suck my dick,

00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,253
Oh, my elbow.

You got nothing. How's my
dick feel in your ass, huh?

173
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,257
Hey! Hey! How's it feel?
How's it feel now?

174
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,968
That's right. Schmidt!
Schmidt, we got one!

175
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,469
We got one!
I got him!

176
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,222
Yes! Yes!
(JENKO WHOOPING)

177
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,890
Yeah!
We got an arrest!

178
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,142
Yeah! We got him!

179
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,309
Yes!

Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
Fuck you! Yeah!

What's up?

182
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:48,487
Drop my nuts on your
motherfucking forehead!

183
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,572
That's right.

Fuck you, park!

00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,700
We arrest people now!
What up, park?

What's up?

Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,297
JENKO: Thank you, Cinnamon.
SCHMIDT: Are those new?

191
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,883
The department was forced
to drop the charges

192
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,677
because you forgot to
read him his Miranda rights.

193
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,057
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

194
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,309
you have to do when
arresting someone?

195
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,313
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

196
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,732
Do you even know
the Miranda rights?

197
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,025
Yes.

198
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,485
Let's hear them, then.

199
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,612
(LAUGHS) You got a
lot of stuff to do.

200
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,655
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

201
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,823
We got time.

202
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,409
I had a thing, but I can
probably push it back.

203
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,746
Go ahead. It's four declamatory
sentences, followed by a question,

204
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,414
for a total of 57 words.

205
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,334
Okay. Look,
it obviously starts with,

206
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,752
"You have the right
to remain silent."

207
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,838
I know you've heard
this before. And then,

208
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,425
I think it
sounds something like...

209
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,968
(MUMBLES SOFTLY) "You have
the right to an attorney."

210
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,804
Well, the thing...
Yeah, right.

211
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,473
"You have the right
to remain an attorney."

212
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,601
Did you say that you have
the right to be an attorney?

213
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,313
You do have the right to be
an attorney, if you want to.

214
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,523
Where were you?

215
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:09,110
(CLEARS THROAT)
I was chasing my perp, sir.

216
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,028
And how did that go for you?

217
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,697
Honestly, he did get away,

218
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,616
and he threw me
down pretty hard.

219
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,868
Actually fucked up
my elbow pretty bad.

220
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,078
Can I see that?

221
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,623
Yeah, actually, it hurts 'cause
the dirt gets mushed into it.

222
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:23,958
Cw!

223
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,167
Wow.

224
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,836
Fortunately for you two,

225
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,673
we're reviving a canceled undercover
police program from the '80s

226
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,424
and revamping it
for modern times.

227
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,801
You see, the guys in
charge of this stuff

228
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,096
lack creativity and are
completely out of ideas,

229
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,975
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

230
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,893
and expect us
all not to notice.

231
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:47,189
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

232
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,983
immature-seeming officers.

233
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,568
Sir, are you saying

234
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,653
that you're going to
send us into, like,

235
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,614
a child sex slavery
ring or something?

236
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:59,285
Sir, if I have to suck
somebody's dick, I will.

237
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,122
It's just...
I'd prefer not to.

I think you idiots are perfect.

239
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,834
You're officially transferred.

240
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,460
All right. Yeah.
That's great.

241
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,254
Where should we report to?

242
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,964

as high school students.

because you look young.

"Angry Black Captain."

261

a stupid stereotype.

Well, guess what,

I'm black.

264
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,226
And I worked my ass
off to be the captain!

265
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,897
And sometimes I get angry.

266
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,524
So suck a dick!

267
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,776

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,953
And then this guy.

272
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,081
He's short and insecure.

273
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,708
And he's probably
good with money.

on the first day of school,

you punch them
directly in the face.

Five, drive a kick-ass car.

Shit.

482

All right, but just don't be
driving it like teenagers,

and shit, okay?

484
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,904
We would never.

That was amazing.

Just stay with
the one-strap.

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,887
I can't. I can't.
I can't right now.

What are you doing? You're
supposed to use two straps.

One strap is peer pressure.

No. No. You're fucking
up right now.

because he's gay.

and then he happened to turn
out to be gay afterwards.

just because you were gay.
Right.

black kid in the face,

it's actually fucking called!

...In which I had to
play a young man...

00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,179
It's really sad about
that kid. He was talented.

603
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,266
So are you saying if he wasn't
talented, it would be less sad?

604
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,895
No. No, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

I remember, one time, doing cocaine
with Willie Nelson's horse,

610
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,370
and we were having so much fun.

611
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,665
And then I realized
that she was dead.

612

613

Even after what
happened to him?

Billiam had a heart murmur.

but it's not my thing.

It's not really
my thing, either,

really wants it.

Who would he call
if he wanted it?

621
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,981
Well, you can tell your friend

622
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,400
that if he really wanted it,

623
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,485
it's not so hard to find.

624
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,988
MR. GORDON: When to take it. He
shouldn't have been taking it at all.

Like, at seven or something?

You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

What the hell was that?
God damn it, son!

Don't ever raise your hand to
me like that again, all right?

saying that I'm Doug.

physically incapable rejects.

I'd be laughing my ass off

at how spastic they are,
but I am the coach,

Understand?

822
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:52,568
I need you to run anchor on the
4 X 400 at today's track meet.

01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,334
That means a lot
coming from you.

2037
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:54,544
What, you having a party now?

2038
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,462
Who are these
two motherfuckers?

2039
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:57,547
(QUIETLY) Fuck!

2040
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,175
Hey.
Hey. How's it going?

2041
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:04,011
ERIC: Nah, nah, it's cool,
man, they're my boys, so...

2042
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,471
Are they?
Yeah.

2043
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:06,973
I don't like strangers.

2044
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:08,599
How do you ever expect

2045
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:09,976
to make any new friends
with that attitude?

2046
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,436
It's, like,
everyone's a stranger

2047
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:12,895
till you give
them a chance, man.

2048
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,397
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2049
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
I don't even...

2050
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,150
Just fuckin' around.

2051
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:19,193
Do your thing, man. Proceed.

2052
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,488
Hey, kid, come here.

2053
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,657
You, you look familiar.

2054
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,659
Me?
Yeah.

2055
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:31,164
I was in a French fry
commercial when I was a kid,

2056
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,624
so people are like, you know, often
say, "Oh, I think I know you,"

2057
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,835
but I don't think
we've ever met before.

2058
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:38,129
Do I look like I
eat French fries?

2059
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:40,256
I don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,

2060
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:42,091
but maybe you have,
like, one cheat day,

2061
01:27:42,175 --> 01:27:44,635
like a carb blowout, you know?
I don't know.

2062
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:45,887
Nah.

2063
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,388
Yeah, the theme song
was, like...

2064
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:52,685
<i>♪ Come to Andrew's
French Fry Emporium</i>

2065
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:56,063
<i>♪ Where friendship
and French fries</i>

2066

<i>♪ Go hand in hand ♪</i>

(POUNDING ON DOOR)

2068
01:28:02,612 --> 01:28:04,030
That's my quesadilla!

2069
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:05,239
Who wants a piece? Huh?

2070
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,158
MOLLY: I know you're in there,
Doug, or whatever your name is!

2071
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,284
You lied to me!

2072
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,873
I'm gonna kill you,
you stupid fucking cop!

2073
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,291
Hey, you guys,
she just called me

2074
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:16,709
a stupid fucking cock.
That's rude.

2075
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,212
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

2076
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:22,215
Did she just say "nickhead
dark motherfucker"?

2077
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,633
That's just racist.

2078
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:25,176
I know these two.

2079
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:26,928
Your boys are cops!
They're cops!

2080
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:28,221
BOTH:
Police! Get on the ground!

2081
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,223
DOMINGO: You get on
the fuckin' ground!

2082
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,266
We asked you first!
I don't give a damn!

2083
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,018
You're fucking cops?

2084
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,937
But we partied together, man.

2085
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,564
You bought us Taco Bell.

2086
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,983
Eric, honestly,
that was a sincere gesture.

2087
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:42,568
You made me this
friendship bracelet.

2088
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:43,820
Well, he's not
really your friend.

2089
01:28:43,903 --> 01:28:45,488
He was pretending
the whole time.

2090
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:47,281
I'm gonna cut this the
fuck off later, all right?

2091
01:28:47,365 --> 01:28:48,366
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

2092
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:50,576
What the fuck is going on?

2093
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,286
Shut this kid up!

2094
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,456
Him, too.
No, no! Hey, wait!

2095
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:56,707
No, no, no.
Listen, I'm with you guys!

2096
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:57,917
I didn't know
these guys were cops!

2097
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,252
I'm getting out of here.

2098
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:00,753
I fucking hate you!

2099
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,088
Get that out of my face!

2100
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:04,090
Molly!
Oh, there you are!

2101
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:06,175
What the fuck!

2102
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,719
Drop your guns, or I'll spray
her brains all over the room!

2103
01:29:08,803 --> 01:29:11,180
Trying to take a hostage,
some goddamn TV show shit?

2104
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:12,849
WALTERS: I don't know! I'm
trying to help, all right?

2105
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:14,308
I've never done
this shit before.

2106
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,434
DOMINGO:
Well, you're fucking up.

2107
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:16,769
Drop the guns or she's dead!

2108
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,187
She looks dead already.

2109
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:19,814
What? No.

2110
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:21,524
Oh, Jesus.

2111
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:24,026
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

2112
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:26,320
She just passed out from the drugs.
We're good.

2113
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:27,488
Drop the guns or...

2114
01:29:27,572 --> 01:29:29,156
All right, all right,
just chill out.

2115
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,950
We're gonna drop our guns.

2116
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:34,203
You got to let the kids go,
and no one's gonna die, okay?

2117
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:36,372
Just drop the guns,
and kick them over here.

2118
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:40,084
D.B., shoot these
motherfuckers.

2119
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:42,545
Oh, come on, that's unfair! We
put our guns down in good faith.

2120
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:44,297
You're a liar, and you're mean!

2121
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:46,883
That's unfair.
We're all friends here.

2122
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,343
SCHMIDT: Let's just relax, and we
can all leave here as friends.

2123

JENKO: Yeah, let's do that.

Y'all boys are stupid.

We're gonna die.

Guns down, all of you!
Domingo, tell them!

2132
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,822
Put them down.

2133
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:11,449
Nice! Yes!

2134
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:13,534
Shut the fuck up!

2135
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:16,871
You little dweebs just ruined
a five-year investigation.

2136
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:18,080
We had no idea.

2137
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:19,540
You're, like,
an amazing actor, man.

2138
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,126
You played saxophone
at my sister's wedding, man!

2139
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,711
Tough titty.
I fucked her, too.

2140
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:25,212
What?

2141
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:26,589
You little turds.

2142
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,049
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

2143
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,467
to infiltrate a gang like this?

2144
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,221
Do you see this nose?

2145
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,890
That is a fake nose.

2146
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,934
Do you want to wear a fake
nose on your fuckin' head

2147
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,852
for, like, months on end?

We had to get fuckin' tattoos
on our dicks, man.

2150
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,567
Hey, actually, I just said that

2151
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,319
to mess with you.
What?

2152
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:49,779
Looks tough.

2153
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:52,531
Look, we know what
it's like being undercover.

2154
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:53,824
Metro Police,
Jump Street Division.

2155

Come on,
you guys are Jump Street?

2156
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:56,118
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

2157
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:58,162
That's funny, because
we were actually Jump Street.

2158
01:30:58,245 --> 01:30:59,705
What?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2159
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:01,290
(GUNSHOT) Oh, shit!

2160

Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.

Oh, my God, dude!

Fuck that.

2168

ZACK:
That was a gun.

2169
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:27,066
Somebody definitely got shot.

2170
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,071
All right.

2171
01:31:33,114 --> 01:31:35,574
Here, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

2172
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:46,210
Did I hit anything?

2173
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:47,920
You were shooting at
the fuckin' ceiling.

2174
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:49,964
Doug.

2175
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:53,968
I know sometimes I
was a jerk to you

2176
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:55,970
when we were undercover.

2177
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:04,270
It's just... I didn't
feel good about myself.

2178
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:10,109
All that stuff I wore, like the
bracelets, the rings, the tight pants,

2179
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:12,862
was just so

2180
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:15,364
that people
would think I'm cool.

2181
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,533
The only approval

2182
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:20,327
that I ever needed

2183
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,664
was my best friend.

2184
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:25,958
Thanks, man.

2185
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:46,562
The money's gone!

2186
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,022
Come on, let's roll.

2187
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:49,440
We gotta get out of here, man.

2188
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:50,775
Are you telling me it's on?

2189
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,985
Let's do this.
Let's make a baby.

2190
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,820
What? What are you talking about?
I don't know.

2191
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:56,489
I was trying to sound cool.
Sorry.

SCHMIDT: No, we're not
picking up your dick.

2352
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,696
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

2353
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:38,992
Oh, fuck!

He's my friend.

2356
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,511
Hey.

2357
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:00,472
Molly...

2358
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:02,891
I'm really sorry.

2359
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,894
I know you
wanted a guy to trust,

2360
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:07,813
and I wanted to be
that person so badly.

2361
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:10,983
And I let you down
in a lot of ways.

2362
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,818
And...

2363
01:41:15,195 --> 01:41:16,863
It's good that
you're mad at me.

2364
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:20,200
I think it's good. I think you
should be mad at more guys,

2365
01:41:20,284 --> 01:41:25,330
because you deserve a guy who's
good and who doesn't lie to you.

2366
01:41:25,664 --> 01:41:28,166
And you should never settle
for less than that.

2367
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,460
There are good guys out there

2368
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:34,006
who aren't assholes like me.

2369
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:38,594
Thanks for saving my life,

2370
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:40,429
asshole.

2371
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:45,017
Put her there, partner.

(LAUGHS GENTLY)

2373
01:41:58,363 --> 01:41:59,990
I'll come back later.

We're, like, in the end of Die Hard
right now, but it's our actual life.

(LAUGHS) It's crazy.

2376
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:10,459
Number one or two?

2377
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:11,710
Three.

2378
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:14,379
Sam Jackson one. Yeah!

Where is he?
There's my guy!

2382
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:28,018
There he is! That's him.
That's him.

2383
01:42:28,393 --> 01:42:29,394
Enough.
Too long on the hug.

You got your first arrest, huh?

2386
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:38,487
Look. Got something made for you.
SCHMIDT: You didn't!

2387
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,781

with low self-esteem,

2392
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:55,128
I'm gonna send you to a place
where all that shit is allowed.

2393
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:56,421
Oh, I love Disneyland!

are going to college!

No! Yes!
