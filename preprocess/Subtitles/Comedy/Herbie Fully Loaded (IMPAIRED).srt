1
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
I'd like another shot
at that prize money.

2
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,192
- Okay for next Sunday?
- No, Jim. It ain't okay.

3
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,153
- Now, look, Bice...
- No, you look.

4
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,396
All of my drivers
are 18, 19.

5
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,034
You're too old
for these kid snorts.

6
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,071
You're liable
to get hurt in there.

7
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,829
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?

8
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,316
I ran out of pride
when I ran out of cars.

9
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,590
Jim, you gotta look
at yourself.

10
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,678
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,
you think you're on your way.

11
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,519
But it didn't
work out, did it?

12
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,952
- Much obliged.
- You need any money?

13
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,317
Nope.

14
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,079
Hey.

15
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,555
What do you do
with this stuff?

16
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,148
It's for a friend.

17
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,396
Hey! How'd it go?

18
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,317
Okay.

19
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,034
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

20
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,390
Aw, the poor thing.

21
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,317
I'll find a good spot for it.

22
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,431
- You got hurt again.
- So?

23
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,028
One of these days you're
gonna get wiped out entirely.

24
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,077
Why you gotta be a driver?

25
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,714
Maybe that's not
your thing, racing.

26
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,718
How about all those car agencies
down on Van Ness?

27
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,593
I bet a top mechanic there
gets a lot of good bread laid on him.

28
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,517
What is the matter
with everybody?

29
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,437
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic, I'm a driver.

30
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,994
I know just how you feel, Jim.

31
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,032
Hey, I used to think I was
happy painting flower seeds.

32
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,994
Then one day, inside me,
this little voice says,

33
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,190
"Tennessee Steinmetz."

34
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,232
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy."

35
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,512
Tennessee, why is it the only thing
we have in this house is parrot food?

36
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,076
- I mean, we don't have a parrot.
- Eat that. That's good.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,158
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.

38
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,158
Then this voice inside
of me continued as follows:

39
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,829
"This is nowhere.
Ya gotta make a new scene.

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,235
Ya gotta change your bag."

41
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,430
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet,

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,269
to a mountaintop,
with swamis and monks.

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,915
I discovered my real self.

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,917
It was wonderful.

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,589
I don't have
to go to Tibet.

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,676
I know who I am.

47
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,992
I know what I want.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,556
There are dirt track races at a carnival
near Bakersfield this week.

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,911
If I can get over there
I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,510
Okay, but you're gonna have
a little trouble getting it started.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,434
Where's the beast?

52
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,869
You didn't
cut up the Edsel.

53
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,511
It came over me
all of a sudden.

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,473
It was the only
decent thing to do.

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,115
Believe me, Jim,
it'll be happier up there.

56
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,993
[Laughing]

57
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,393
[No Audio]

58
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,557
Are you all right?
Are you dizzy?

59
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,069
Oh, no. There's a slight
racking pain in my head here.

60
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,637
Oh, well, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.

61
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,876
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,037
Looks like you've been running
into all sorts of things lately.

63
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,436
Yeah. Oh, this
is just a little...

64
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,791
- Oh, lady.
- [Chuckling] Oh, really, sir.

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,388
Excuse me.

66
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,472
Over 400 cubes.

67
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,229
Dual quads, all synchro box,
zero to 60 under five.

68
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,999
All right, Miss Bennett.
I'll see to this gentleman myself.

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,759
May I be of service, sir?

70
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,156
I see that you're a person
who appreciates fine things.

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,078
You're no doubt aware that this
is the celebrated Thorndyke special.

72
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,475
Allow me to say, sir,

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,512
that I think this car
would suit you very well.

74
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,437
Yes.
Yes, it would.

75
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,269
- May I offer you a glass
of sherry and a biscuit?
- Go right ahead.

76
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,235
I take it the question of price
does not greatly concern
a gentleman like yourself.

77
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,191
Oh, I wouldn't haggle
if that's what you mean.

78
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,595
What price range
did you have in mind?

79
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,438
About $75.

80
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,519
$75.
[Laughs]

81
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,915
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of
cheap, honest transportation?

82
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,600
Cheap, honest transportation!

83
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,717
I will bid you good day, sir.

84
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,796
Good day.

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,115
Hey!

86
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,276
Havershaw!

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,995
Now, where did
this come from?

88
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,795
- Mr Thorndyke, yes, sir?
- What is this thing
doing in my showroom?

89
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,036
I believe Miss Bennett
may know something about this.

90
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,119
Yes. You remember when Mrs van Luit
purchased her new Bentley?

91
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,391
She also requested us to buy
a small used car for her upstairs maid.

92
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,990
Then why isn't her upstairs maid
in her blasted vehicle?

93
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,917
The car was returned
this morning, Mr Thorndyke.

94
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,315
She was having some kind
of difficulty with it.

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,237
- Get it out of here!
- Yes, sir.

96
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,671
What's that for?

97
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,952
- I beg your pardon?
- Why don't you let the little car alone?

98
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,789
Are you presuming to tell me
what to do in my own establishment?

99
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,150
Okay, I'm out of line.

100
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,510
It just bugs me to see somebody
abusing a decent piece of machinery.

101
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,996
[Laughing] How fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the
benefit of your point of view,

102
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,270
shall we regard our relationship
as terminated?

103
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,710
Havershaw!
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.

104
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,637
And if ever I find it here again,

105
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,399
someone is going to find himself
in a great deal of trouble!

106
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,875
Yes, sir. Of course.
Boys, here we go.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,719
Here we go.
[Grunting]

108
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,678
- Sorry. None of my business, is it?
- Perfectly all right.

109
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,679
- Goodbye.
- Oh. Goodbye.

110
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,593
[Bell Ringing]

111
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,273
[Ringing Continues]

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,477
[Buzzing]

113
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,950
- Good morning.
- Good morning. What do you want?

114
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,993
- Police.
- Right. What do you want?

115
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,590
Forgive me for pointing,
but have you ever seen that car before?

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,316
- No. No, I haven't.
- Hey, he's a cute little fella.

117
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,112
Hey, wait a minute.

118
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,916
Wait a minute. I think I saw
that car at an agency yesterday.

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, permit to inform
you of the following:

120
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,953
First, say nothing that would
jeopardize your constitutional rights.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,594
Second, the minute
you get downtown,

122
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,632
I would advise
you get a good lawyer.

123
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,276
- Shall we go?
- Go? What for?

124
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,950
On suspicion of grand theft.

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,437
Now, wait a minute.
There's something cockeyed about this.

126
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,357
How did that little
car get here?

127
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,270
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,153
[Laughing]

129
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,110
I'll do it.
Okay, I'll do it.

130
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,518
But I want to go on record. I have seen
some crummy stunts used to sell cars,

131
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,710
but this beats everything.

132
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,308
To plant this Bug
in the possession of an innocent man
and accuse me of stealing it!

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,237
How dare you, sir!

134
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,237
Are you suggesting I would
stoop to such tactics?

135
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,396
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting!

136
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,557
In the first place, it might
interest you to know that
under normal circumstances,

137
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,910
I would never sell a car
to someone with whom I'm not,

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,554
shall we say,
socially compatible.

139
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,636
- You'd sell a car...
- Please! Let's not
go through that again.

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,591
I think we've worked
it out very well.

141
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,109
Mr Douglas needs a car,
and for a very low amount down...

142
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,233
and the usual monthly payments,
the car will become his.

143
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,955
Very well, even though my inclination
is to have Mr Douglas clapped into jail,

144
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,230
and this four-wheeled contrivance
dropped into the bay!

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,990
- I think Mr Thorndyke
is being very fair.
- Fair? It's not fair!

146
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,918
I'm being muscled! I want you to know
that I know it and I don't like it!

147
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,553
[Miss Bennett]
I'll draw up the papers.

148
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,797
Would you come
with me, please?

149
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,195
Then get Mr Douglas
and his acquisition out of here...

150
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,390
before I lose my temper!

151
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,557
- [Liquid Squirting]
- What in...

152
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,592
What's the matter?
You from L.A. Or something?

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,031
The machine starts
to think it is somebody.

304
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,596
I'm not saying a mechanical thing
can't be a friend.

305
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,676
Like, when I was
broke one summer,

306
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,078
there was this giant claw machine
in the Sutro Amusement Park.

307
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,909
It would grab cameras and watches
and drop them down a hole to me.

308
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,554
- And I would hock 'em and buy lunch.
You follow me?
- Yeah.

309
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,752
I think you were up
on that mountaintop too long.

310
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,238
Contrariwise, the traffic light
down the street hates my guts.

311
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,794
I don't know why.
But in the last six weeks...

312
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,070
I haven't caught anything
but a stop signal.

313
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,476
It makes me wait six seconds longer
than anybody else! I timed it!

314
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,912
[Chuckles] Things like that happen
to lots of other people too.

315
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,837
But the other people
don't tell no other people,

316
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,953
because the other people
would say, "Hey-ey-ey-ey."

317
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,710
Tennessee, that traffic light
is a lot of nuts and bolts.

318
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,876
This little car,
a lot of nuts and bolts.

319
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,390
Everything explains itself,
one way or the other.

320
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,432
- You're not listenin' to me.
- Don't lose your grip, old buddy.

321
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,551
This little car didn't do one thing
tonight that can't be explained...

322
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,309
in terms of short circuits, sprung
doors, grabbing steering, worn knuckles,

323
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,556
maybe some advertising gimmick.

324
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,796
I'll fix it.

325
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,798
- I don't think you got the picture.
- I got a beautiful picture.

326
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,354
This baby happens to have
an extra turn of speed,

327
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,948
which is the only thing
I care about.

328
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,957
You don't understand
what happens, do you?

329
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,311
They make 10,000 cars.
They make 'em exactly the same way.

330
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,432
One or two of 'em turn out
to be something special.

331
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,234
Nobody knows why.

332
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,157
I know why.

333
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,396
I may be kiddin' myself,

334
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,114
but I think I can make somethin'
out of that sad little bucket of bolts.

335
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,516
Save these.
They'll be famous someday.

Named after my Uncle Herb.

He used to box middleweight.
Preliminary, mostly.

Gradually, his nose got
shaped more and more...

- Congratulations.
- Good race, Jim.

- Thanks, Ray.
- Boy, was Herbie ever great today.

388
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,149
I was out there too. Wouldn't you say
that was a fair piece of driving?

389
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,157
Hey, I'm not trying to take
anything away from you,

390
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,840
but you gotta admit that this little guy
backed you all the way.

391
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,030
Yeah.
It's a nice little car.

392
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,957
You know somethin' else?

393
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,993
For the first time in a long while,
I felt my real self out there.

394
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,078
A sense of authority like
the top drivers have, you know?

395
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,350
I kinda felt you felt that.

to anybody else, but...

handle this car. Congratulations.

- What have you done to this thing?

Oh, an adjustment here,
an adjustment there.

405
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,196
You want to sell it back?
I own most of it anyway, you know.

406
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,436
Still 23 payments to go.

407
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,357
- Well, uh...
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

408
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,517
I'll take the car and give you
$1,000 clear. What do you say?

409
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,551
No. You don't wanna do that.

410
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,194
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.

411
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,437
I think Mr Thorndyke
is a little mixed up
as to who or what won that race.

412
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,790
- And what does that mean?
- Someday, I'll teach you...

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,150
not to confuse the car
with the driver.

414
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,157
I should welcome the opportunity.

415
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,033
Mr Thorndyke, I think
that's a very good idea of yours.

416
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,549
- What is?
- You're racing in the Libra Open...

417
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,830
- at Riverside
at the end of the month, right?
- Yes.

418
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,757
Well, I'm sure that
Mr Douglas would like to get...

419
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,950
- the remainder
of his payments off his back.
- No doubt.

420
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,752
But why should I think
that's a good idea?

421
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,075
Well, if Mr Douglas
entered the race,

422
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,397
he could bet his share of the little car
against the remaining payments.

423
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,476
[Thorndyke]
What do you say, Douglas?

424
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,593
The winner to become
the sole owner of the car.

425
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,754
A moment ago, you mentioned
teaching me a lesson.

426
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,269
Do I now detect
a note of timidity?

427
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,758
Racing. That's the name
of the game, isn't it?

428
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,189
Win or lose.
Put up or shut up.

429
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,153
- You got yourself a deal, Thorndyke.
- Splendid.

430
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,793
The drivers' meeting is over.
Now, the third race of the afternoon...

431
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,831
will get under way
here at Riverside.

432
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,270
You keep your eye on your friend
in the Bug, my dear.

433
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,197

If anything goes wrong,
we'll lose Herbie altogether.

with all the faith in this car.
- Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

437
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,675
[Announcer] And now the starter
has his flag in the air.

All the cars looking
very smart on the grid.

Drivers in the first row
signifying that they're ready to race.

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,598
Their hands extended in the air.
The flag is up, and there they go!

443

the starting grid and through turn one.

Through the S's now.

445
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,631
Down the back straight, well by himself
now, is the #14 car of Thorndyke...

446
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,320
going into the sweeper turn.

447
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,796
The rest of the field well stretched out
as they charge down the back straight.

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,434
Not yet, Herbie!
Not yet!

449

The standings in lap 23: Thorndyke,
still leading; Lesser, running second;

450
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,956
and Erwin in third place.

[Tyres Screeching,
Engine Accelerating]

453
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,435
Now, car #53... Douglas...
starts to make a move,

454
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,790
picking up cars
as he goes by car #20.

455
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,469
Into the sweeper,
very hard and fast.

456
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,592
Going through traffic,
passing #23 now...

457
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,951
is car #53... Douglas.

458
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,517
He has just come alive
and is making a challenge in this race.

459
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,552
Passing cars as he goes down
the back straight,

460
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,275
car #53... Douglas...
making his bid.

461
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,190
Into the straight now
is Thorndyke, car #14.

462
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,599
Now the pressure's on. Douglas in #53
is starting to close on Thorndyke, #14.

463
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,717
Douglas has just come alive...

464
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,035
and is pressing the leader now.

465
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,672
Now making his bid to pass,
but he can't get by.

466
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,952
He's being shut off
by Thorndyke in the #14 car.

[Giggling]

468
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,711
Douglas goes slightly off course,
takes out some markers...

469
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,719
and apparently is out of control,

470
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,515
- He crashes into the #4 shutoff marker.
- [Giggles]

471

Thorndyke continuing on
as the #53 car lets this one...

472
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,277
Now he's making
his reentry!

473
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,911
Look out!

474
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,830
- Hey, nice scoring, champ.
- Thank you very much.

Hey, what a champ.
Way to drive.

476
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,357
Just a moment, Mr Thorndyke.
You don't have...

477
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,835
I demand that this thing
is impounded and checked!

on here than meets the eye!

How could I look well?
I haven't been able to sleep.

488
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,597
That rotten car
is driving me piffy!

489
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,076
Has it occurred to you
it may not be the rotten car?

490
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,998
- Perhaps it's the way Mr Douglas drives.
- Balderdash!

491
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,590
There isn't a driver in the world
who can get that speed
out of a car like that.

492
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,597
No, he's done something to it,

493
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,631
and I've got to find out what!

494
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,557
You've become obsessed
by this whole thing.

495
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,355
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?

496

My dear child,
how little you know me.

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,875
- Yes, Mr Thorndyke.
- Carole?

498
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,675
- How long have you been with us?
- A year and a half, almost two. Why?

499
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,836
I'm afraid I've been
a little remiss...

500
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,635
in not telling you before now how very
well you've proved in all your duties.

501
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,557
Well, thank you.

502
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,639
And, Carole, as I realize
you have the best interests
of this organization at heart,

503
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,479
I want you to accede
to a somewhat unusual request.

Yes, good afternoon.

Oh, I think that
should be quite all right.

Uh, 7:30 will be fine.

- I'd like you to see this Douglas,
get to know him.

514
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,193
Who knows? If he has the talents
of which I believe him capable,

515
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,117
perhaps we can give him
the opportunity...

516
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,071
of joining our organization,
racing under our colours.

517

- But first, we must know
something about him.
- How about tonight?

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,751
- Very good.
- At 7:30?

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,678
Very good!
Why waste time?

Oh, and Carole,
another thing.

521
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,111
Leave your car. Take the Special.
He likes that one.

Uh, thank you.
[Laughs]

523

that was Mr Douglas who just called.

Excellent.

In all honesty,
I should like to point out...

526
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,913
that I agreed to have dinner with him
before you suggested it.

to be despised.

after what Herbie did for you.

Don't let it get ya, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.

Don't forget: He isn't the first guy
ever to lose his head...

over a bucket seat
and a paint job.

- [Buzzer Buzzing]

- Sorry. The other rats
are out for the evening!

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,068
No, no! Please.
I didn't come by to see Mr Douglas.

543
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,398
- I came by to pay my respects
to that gallant little car.
- Huh?

544
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,114
There it is.

545
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,391
- What a marvel it is, indeed.
- I don't get you, fella.

546
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,876
Oh, come, come, sir. I know
a rare bit of machinery when I see one.

547
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,195
And after all,
who should know it better than I?

548
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,676
I, who have been trounced
time and again by this... this paragon.

549
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,597
You'll forgive me
for saying so, sir,

550
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,996
but it does take class to know
when it has been defeated by class.

551
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,113
You know somethin', Mr Thorndyke?
I may have misjudged you.

552
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,119
- Well, thank you.
- I've been misjudging
a lot of people lately.

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,515
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?

554

Specialty of the house.
My own mother's recipe.

555

I'd love it. Thank you.
- I'll be back in a jiffy!

556
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,519
That's most kind.
Thank you so much.

557
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,509
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think
that this innocent-seeming object...

558
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,872
is, is capable
of such great deeds.

to have asbestos gloves...

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,237
Fascinating. Yes.

563
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,430
Yes. Quite...
Quite fascinating.

Oh, thank you.

567
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,153
- Up the Irish.
- To the little car, a gallant adversary.

568
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,989
- And may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.

569
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,917
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.

570
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,072
- Like it?
- What do you think?

571
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,630
I can't stand that hungry look
any longer.

572
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,716
[Chuckles]
Take over.

573
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,434
You know what I said to myself
the first time I saw you?

574
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,314
- What?
- I said to myself,
"Now, there's a real lady."

575
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,593
This is how it ought to be...
me and these kind of wheels.

576
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,315
Excuse me asking, but aren't you
doing all right with the little car?

577
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,116
Sure, but can you imagine how
I'd make it with equipment like this?

578
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,676
Is it so important to you?

579
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,156
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.

580
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,798
What part of Ireland did you say
your mother came from?

581
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,111
Coney Ireland.

- [Laughs]
- Oh, uh, would you like a spot of this?

586
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,517
- I like a spot of anything.
- I'm so sorry.

587
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,676
- Now, we're gonna drink to Herbie,
- [Laughs]

588
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,473
- The greatest little car
in the whole world.
- Yes. Quite right.

589
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,478
- Mm-hmm.
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear. [Sniffs]

590
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,433
- To Herbie.
- To Herbie. So sorry about your hand.

591
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,028
I do apologize.
To Herbie.

592
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,275
What do you know?
The engine stalled.

593
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,030
How about that?
The door's stuck.

594
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,869
- Mmm.
- That's how it is with cars sometimes.

595
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,356
- Yes.
- I guess we'll have to wait
and see what happens next.

596
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,438
Well, as someone
very wisely once said,

597
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,472
"That's how it is
with cars sometimes."

598
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,876
- I just said that.
- Oh.

599
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,479
I wonder if your reputation
is altogether true.

600
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,670
What's my reputation?

601
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,713
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only
interested in fast cars and easy money.

602
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,637
Not true.

603
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,591
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,870
- You know something else?
- What?

605
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,719
When the light
hits you just right,

606
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,832
you're as beautiful
as General Grant on a $50 bill.

607

Oh, dear me.

of the little car?

00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,788
I do, indeed.

611
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,515
- I'll tell ya
the secret of the little car.
- No, no, no. Just a minute.

612
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,949
All right. Tell me.

613
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,435
It's heart.

614
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,994
That's what it is: Heart.

615
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,356
Heart. Yes.

616
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,870
Well, I'm certainly going
to make a note of that.

- Headache gone?
- All gone.

619
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,829
Anticipation of victory
is the purest form of aspirin.

620
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,954
- This is my day.
- [Announcer] Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.

621
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,153
- You seem very confident.
- You know, I believe I am.

622
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,675
[Announcer] They leave the
starting grid, going into turn one.

623
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,597
The field's stretching out now.

624
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,191
Everybody getting through
turn one very nicely.

625
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,073
Very fine field of cars here.

626
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,432
And coming through traffic now, making a
move, is Peter Thorndyke in the #14 car.

627
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,357
Picking up a few cars
in that turn.

628
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,916
Now he comes by and picks up three
more cars, going into the lead now.

629
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,238
Thorndyke leading this race
in car #14.

630
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,430
Now making a move
is car #53, Douglas,

631
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,269
who also picks up about three cars
as he goes charging through traffic...

632
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,598
and is in hot pursuit
of Thorndyke in the #14 car.

633
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,951
As they go down the back straight,
comin' on pretty hard and fast...

634
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,550
is car #53 making the pass.

635

Go, Jimmy!
[Laughing]

637
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,710
So far, Jim Douglas seems to have
everything pretty much to himself.

638
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,593
He comes through the S's
into turn six well in control...

[Burping Continues]

642
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,798
As they come down the back straight,
Douglas is slowing down...

643
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,151
and Thorndyke goes rocketing by
into the sweeper turn.

644
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,070
It looks as though the Douglas car
is having trouble.

645
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,192
Yes, #53 is fading fast.

of some kind.

if you threw me out.

On account of what Thorndyke did?

How can I blame anyone? Thorndyke ruined
the little car right under my nose.

his self-respect back.

Oh, you can imagine
how I must feel.

I've been drinking. You know how it is.

you purchased a new Lamborghini today.

a great deal of money on it.

Now, myself, for sentimental reasons,
I like the little car,

to increase my previous offer...

but I can use your money.

You got yourself a deal.
Come and get it.

out in the real world?

Well, I felt sorry
