following a verbal dispute
in Brooklyn Bridge Park,

6
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,462
Zachary Cowan, age 11,
and armed with a stick,

7
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,800
struck our son,
Ethan Longstreet, in the face.

In addition to the swelling
and bruising of Ethan's upper lip,

9
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,559
this act also resulted in
two broken incisors,

Well, apparently the nerve
is not completely exposed.

Only part of it is exposed.
There's a part that's exposed

that's still protected.

Oh, really?

184
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,572

the apples because they cook faster.

00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,387
Yeah, Walter.

771
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:28,516
<i>WALTER: Alan, CNN has invited
me for a panel discussion.</i>

772
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,186
ALAN: Well, as long as there
are no victims on the panel.

773
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,690
No victims. I don't want you
sitting down with victims.

774
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,316
Deny, deny, deny...

775
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,402
If we have to,
we'll sue the Journal.

776
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,531
Well, we'll e-mail you the draft
of the press release.

777
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,659
Walter, I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

778
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:49,370
Call me a snitch,
it gets a rise out of me.

779
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,080
Unless it's true.
ALAN: What?

780
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,332
You know, if the shoe fits.

781
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,210
You think my son is a snitch?
Come on. I'm joking around.

782
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,087
So is yours anyway.

783
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,881
What do you mean, so is ours?
He snitched on Zachary.

784
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,884
We coaxed it out of him.
We're getting completely off point.

785
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,345
Maybe you coaxed,
but he did snitch on him.

786
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,264
Nancy.
NANCY: "Nancy" what?

787
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:11,809
You think my son is a snitch?
I don't think anything.

788
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,520
Well, if you don't think anything,
don't say anything.

789
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,731
Don't make insinuations.
PENELOPE: Nancy,

790
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,899
there's no reason
to lose our cool here.

791
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,570
Michael and I have gone out of our way
to be fair-minded and conciliating.

792
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,780
Not so fair-minded.

793
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:27,742
Oh, really?
Superficially fair-minded.

794
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,410
Doodle, I have to go.

795
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:32,371
NANCY:
So go. Coward.

796
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,625
Nancy, right now I'm in danger of
losing my most important client.

797
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,962
This "caring parent" crap and the
bickering that goes along with it...

798
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,423
Yeah, well, my son lost
two teeth. Two incisors.

799
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,925
We got that, right.
One of them permanently.

800
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,763
He'll get new teeth. Better ones.
No one chewed his ear off.

801
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,433
It was a mistake not to consider
the source of the problem.

802
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,601
There is no source.

803
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,353
There's an 11-year-old kid
who hits people with a stick!

804
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,522
Armed with a stick.
We took that word out.

805
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,357
Took it out because
we asked you to.

806
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,068
We took it out
without argument.

807
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,403
A word which deliberately
establishes intent

808
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,572
without any hint
of a misunderstanding,

809
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,199
which excludes childhood.

810
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,534
I don't think I can
stand this tone any more.

811
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:14,330
We're not quite on the same page,
you and I, right from the start.

812
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,915
Mr. Cowan,

813
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:19,794
it is incredibly frustrating
to be continually upbraided

814
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,713
for something that we, ourselves,
admitted was a mistake.

815
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,299
The word "armed" wasn't right.
We took it out.

816
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,052
Though, strictly speaking,
it certainly applies.

817
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,554
Zachary was verbally abused
and he reacted.

818
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,765
Now, if I'm attacked,
I defend myself,

819
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,559
especially when I'm all alone
against a whole gang.

820
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:38,813
Well, you certainly perked up since
you tossed your cookies. Heh, heh.

821
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,606
Do you realise how crude that is?

822
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,317
Look, we're all decent people,
all four of us.

823
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,112
I don't know how we got
carried away, losing our tempers.

824
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,115
This is totally unnecessary.
Michael, stop it. Stop mitigating.

825
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,576
We're only superficially fair-minded.
Why should we be fair-minded at all?

826
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,787
No. No, I'm not gonna be led
down that path.

827
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:55,955
ALAN:
What path?

828
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,165
The path these two
little shits led us down.

829
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,543
Pen doesn't see things that way.
"Penelope."

830
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,504
Sorry.
So Ethan's a shit now.

831
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,631
That really takes the cake.

832
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,384
Look, that's it.
I really have to leave now.

833
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,177
Yeah. So do I.

834
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,972
Go. Go. I give up.

835
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,974
[PHONE RINGING]

836
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,019
<i>Hello.
MOTHER: It's me, Mikey.</i>

837
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,438
<i>Oh, hi, Ma.
Is this a bad time?</i>

838
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,275
No. No, we got some
friends over, but go ahead.

839
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,111
<i>The surgeon told me to stop taking
my medication before the operation.</i>

MICHAEL: Yes. Yes, you just do
whatever the doctors tell you to do.

841
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,616
Yes.

<i>The surgeon told me
to stop all of them,</i>

843
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,539
<i>but Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.</i>

844
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,541
<i>The what?
The Antril.</i>

845
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,877
<i>Should I stop taking the Antril too?</i>

846
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,964
MICHAEL: Antril? You're... You're...
You're... You're taking Antril?

847
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,342
Wait, hold on a second, Ma.
Antril?

848
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,344
That crap of yours is Antril?

849
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,806
My mother's taking it.
Thousands of people take it.

850
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,225
Mom. You gotta stop
taking that one right away.

851
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,227
You hear me? Right now.
<i>Why?</i>

852
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,523
You just do what I tell you. All right?
I'm gonna explain later.

853
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,568
<i>No. Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.</i>

854
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,780
Mom, you tell Dr. Perlstein
that I said you can't take it.

<i>I won't touch it, Michael</i>

856
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,534
MICHAEL:
Good.

857
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,829
<i>Why red?
So they can see me.</i>

858
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,206
So who can see you?

00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,041
<i>The cars. They all drive like crazy.</i>

860
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:26,503
Mom, that's ridiculous. Okay.
Mom. Mom. Bup-bup-bup.

861
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,548
Mom. I have to call you back.
I told you we have company.

00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay. I love you

Bye-bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

She got red crutches
in case she gets hit by a truck,

865
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,935
because she wanders out
in the street at night.

866
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,354
They're giving her Antril
for her blood pressure.

867
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,941
If she's taking it and she looks
normal, I'll take her deposition.

868
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,692
Didn't I have a scarf?

869
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:51,153
You know,
I don't like that attitude of yours.

870

If my mother shows
even the slightest symptom,

871
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,991

We'll have one anyway.
MICHAEL: Well, I should hope so.

873
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,956
PENELOPE: Doing the right thing is just futile.
Honesty is just stupidity.

874
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,333
It just weakens you.
You let your guard down.

875
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,711
Let's go, Nancy. That's enough
sermons and lectures for one day.

876
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,381
Yeah, go ahead.
But let me tell you this:

877
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:14,134
Now that I know you two,
I'm not surprised what's-his-name...

00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,137
Zachary may have
some behavioural issues.

[DOG BARKING]

880
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,474
When you killed that hamster...
MICHAEL: Killed?

881
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,351
Killed.
I killed the hamster?

882
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,312
Yes. You do everything you can
to make us feel guilty.

883
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,773
You stake out the moral
high ground as your own,

884
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,234
but you, yourself,
are a murderer.

885
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,444
MICHAEL: I definitely did
not kill that hamster.

886
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,654
Worse.
Worse!

887
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:37,783
You left it out there, trembling
with fear in a hostile environment.

888
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,120
That poor critter was probably
eaten by a dog or a rat.

889
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:43,622
PENELOPE: She's right.
What do you mean, "she's right"?

890
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,957
I mean, come on. Michael.

891
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,793
It's horrible what must have
happened to that poor animal.

892
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,628
MICHAEL: I thought the
hamster would be happy.

893
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,047
I thought he'd go running around
happy as a clam.

894
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,425
PENELOPE: Well, he didn't.
And you just left him there.

895
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,802
Because I can't touch
those things, okay?

896
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,763
I can't touch anything of that family.
Penny, you know that.

897
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,726
He's afraid of rodents.
Yes. I have a fear of rodents.

898
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:07,771
And a fear of reptiles. Anything down close
to the ground. That's it. All right?

899
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:11,317
What about you? How come you
didn't go downstairs and get it?

900
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,068
Because I didn't know.

901
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,612
Michael said this morning
that the hamster ran away.

902
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,449
So I went right out the door,
I went right down the block.

903
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,743
I mean, I went to the basement!

904
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,829
Penelope. It is completely
unfair that all of a sudden

905
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:27,416
I'm in the hot seat about this hamster
that you had to tell them about.

906
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,377
That is a family issue that
doesn't concern anybody but us.

907
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:32,504
It's got nothing to do
with this situation.

908
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,424
I can't believe I'm being called
a murderer in my own house.

909
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,218
What does your house
have to do with tea in China'?

910
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,137
It's my house. I opened the door.

911
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:43,057
The door is wide open
in a spirit of reconciliation

912
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,934
to a couple people who should
be a little more grateful.

913
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,729
Keep right on stroking
your own ego. It's beautiful.

914
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,399
So you have no remorse?
No. I have no remorse.

915
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,027
That animal was disgusting,
and I'm glad it's gone.

916
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:57,363
Michael, that's ridiculous.
What's ridiculous?

917

01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,730
But I do care. I really do care.

1518
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,525
Yes, Doodle,
we care in a hysterical way.

1519
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,862
Not like heroic figures
of a social movement.

1520
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:49,158
I saw your friend Jane Fonda
on TV the other day.

1521
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:52,703
Made me wanna run out
and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.

1522
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,414
Heh-heh-heh.
PENELOPE: My friend Jane Fonda?

1523
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:58,208
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1524
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:03,505
You're the same breed, the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

1525
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,257
Those are not
the women we like.

1526
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:09,344
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

1527
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,388
The gatekeepers of the world,

1528
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:14,725
the ones who wanna show off
how perceptive they are?

1529
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:16,685
Huge turnoff.

1530
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:20,731
Even poor Michael,
your own husband, is turned off.

1531
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:22,191
Don't you speak for me.

1532
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:25,819
We don't give a shit
what women you like.

1533
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,280
Where do you get off
just spouting these opinions?

1534
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,700
You are the one man whose opinion
we don't give a shit about!

1535
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:34,411
She's screaming.
Heh, heh.

1536
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,372
Quartermaster on a slave ship.

1537
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,333
She doesn't scream?

1538
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,127
She didn't just scream
that your little asshole

1539
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:44,296
was right to beat up ours?

1540
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,547
He was right.

1541
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:49,426
At least our kid
isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot.

1542
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:53,347
Yours is a fucking snitch!

1543
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:55,641
Let's go, Alan.

1544
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:58,227
Why are we still in this house?

1545
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,437
PENELOPE:
Exactly.

1546
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,898
Here.

1547
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:06,819
This is what I think
of your stupid tulips!

1548
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,780
Your hideous flowers.

1549
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,952
This is the worst day
of my life too.
