Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.

Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

I'm sorry.

you know, get a job here.

The sous chef. There.

351
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,000
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

352
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,700
Saucier, in charge of sauces.

Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

No, he's a <i>plongeur</i> or something.

He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

Anyone can cook.

Well, yeah, anyone can.

worthy of your talent, Linguini.

792
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,900
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread à la Gusteau.

793
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,700
- Colette will help you.
<i>- Oui,</i> chef.

794
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,600
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

795
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,500
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

796
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
Gusteau himself said so.

797
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,800
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

798
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,500
"Sweetbread à la Gusteau.

799
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,100
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

800

"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

"Anchovy licorice sauce."

803
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,100
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

804
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,800
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

805
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,900
LALO: Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

806
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,200
Veal stomach?

807
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,700
Oh!

808
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,900
Okay.

809
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,000
(SNIFFING)

810
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
I'll be right back. Where...

811
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,600
Hey, I got to... Hey!

812
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,000
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

813
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,300
Let's see, over here...

814
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,600
I'll be back.

815
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,900
Thank you.

816
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,200
Excuse me. I'm going to...

817
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,900
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

818
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,700
I'm going to pick that up.

819
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,000
I got some of that spice.

820
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,100
Okay.

821
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,500
What are you doing? You're supposed

822
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,900
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

823
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,300
(STUTTERING)
This is the recipe.

824
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

825
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,100
What else have you...
You are improvising?

826
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,700
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

827
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,000
You're right. I should listen to you!

828
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,300
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

829
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,000
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

830
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,100
- HORST: Where is the special order?
- Coming!

831
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,500
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

832
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,300
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

833
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,700
- The special?
- Come get it!

834
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,400
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

835
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,600
(EX CLAIMS)

836

(GASPING)

837
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

838
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,100
Sorry.

839
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,600
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

840
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,700
<i>Ja.</i> It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

841
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,400
- Did you taste it?
<i>- Ja,</i> of course, before he changed it.

842
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,300
Good. What? How could he change it?

843
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,500
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

844
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,600
Ow!

845
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,700
They love it!

846
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,500
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

847
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,400
I have seven more orders!

848
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,100
That's wonderful.

849
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,900
I'd like one of those.

850
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Special order!

851
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,800
What is that?

852
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,200
HORST: Special order! Special order!
Special order!

853
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,000
ALL: To Linguini.

854
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,700
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, <i>ja?</i>

855
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
LAROUSSE: Drink now, there's plenty.

856
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,900
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

857
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We really did it tonight.

858
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,200
Dah!

859
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,300

860
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,500
(CHUCKLES) Got your toque!

861
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,900
Oh, seriously now.

862
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,700
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

863
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,500
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

864
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,400
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

865
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,900
(CHUCKLING GRACIOUSLY)

866
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,500
The <i>plongeur</i> won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

867
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,300
He's gotten all he needs.

868
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,700
(SNICKERING)

869
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,000
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

870
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,000
Good for you.

871
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,100
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

872
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,300
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

873
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,600
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

874
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,700
not to appreciate
this '61 Château Latour.

875
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And you, <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini,
are no idiot.

876
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,800
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

(CLATTERING)

- Remy!
- Emile?

880
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,800
I can't believe it! You're alive!

881
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,400
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

882
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

883
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,700
And what are you eating?

884
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,400
I don't really know.

885
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,700
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

886
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,500
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

887
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,100
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

(GRUNTING)

890
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,000
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

891
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,300
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

892
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,600
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

893
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,500
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

894
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,200
So, where did you train, Linguini?

895
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,600
Train? All right.

896
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,300
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

897
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,700
- It's not.
- I knew it!

898
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,600
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

899
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,300
Monday was my first time.

900
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,200
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

901
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,500
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

902
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,900
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

903
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Do you like animals?

904
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,800
(CHUCKLING) What?
Animals? What kind?

905
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,500
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

rats.

907

I brought you something to...

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,500
No, no, no, no!

Spit that out right now!
