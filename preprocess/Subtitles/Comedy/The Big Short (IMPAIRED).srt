167
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,632
I met with this retail banker yesterday.

168
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,133
I'm supposed to be getting
him to invest in a fund,

169
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,536
but instead

170
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,504
I start grilling him
about overdraft penalties

171
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,574
and how his bank will let a
customer write 10-12 checks

172
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,243
before they tell them they're overdrawn.

173
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,945
And this creep is making billions
off screwing over people this way.

174
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,815
And I'm getting madder and madder.

175
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,285

him in the face and I say,

- (POPS)

272
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,863
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds

273
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,230
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

274
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,268
They made billions and
billions on their 2% fee

275
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,570
they got for selling each of these bonds.

276
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,440
But then they started
running out of mortgages

277
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,074
to put in them.

278
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,810
After all, there are only so many homes

279
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,646
and so many people with good enough jobs

280
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,680
to buy them, right?

281
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,849
So the banks started filling these bonds

282
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,084
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

283
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,587
Thank you, Benter.

284
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,959
That way they can keep that
profit machine churning, right?

285
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:26,430
By the way, these risky
mortgages are called subprime.

286
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,897
So whenever you hear "subprime", think

287
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,434
"shit".

288
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,070
Our friend Michael Burry found
out that these mortgage bonds

289
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,373
that were supposedly 65% AAA

290
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,709
were actually just mostly full of shit.

291
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:43,546
So now he's going to "short" the bonds.

292
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,550
Which means to "bet against".

A whole new way to make money, Doug.

478

Wait, wait. I didn't know
there were swaps on mortgages.

He's a foot soldier. I'm
sure it's a shit deal.

$200 mil in credit default swaps.

Randall made the sale. Can you believe it?

Somebody shorted $200
mil on mortgage bonds?

That was just with Deutsche.
Word is he hit half the town.

JARED: This is your basic mortgage bond.

636
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,902
All right? The originals were simple.

637
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:11,673
They were just thousands of
AAA mortgages bundled together,

638
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,507
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

639
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,410
The modern ones are different.

640
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:18,348
They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

641
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:26,087
The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

642
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,789
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,

643
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,357
taking on defaults first.

644
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,094
Now, obviously, if you're buying
B's, you could make more money.

645
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,362
But they're a little risky.

646
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,533
Sometimes they fail.

Somewhere along the
line, these B's and BB's

Because the banks are too
busy getting paid obscene fees

Throw all this unsold fish, which

He's playing us.

788
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:27,715
He's playing us. He's got
too much skin in the game

789
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,387
and he's dumping his position.

790
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,920
What if he's right?

791
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,521
You want him to be right.

MARK: Yes, I do.

793
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:38,392
The banks have given us 25%
interest rates on credit cards.

794
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,262
They have screwed us on student loans

795
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,030
that we can never get out from under.

796

Then this guy walks into my office and says

797
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:48,369
those same banks got greedy,
they lost track of the market,

798
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:50,472
and I can profit off of their stupidity?

799

801

He's everything you taught us not to trust.

802
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,713
I can't hate him. He is so transparent

803
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,148
in his self-interest that
I kind of respect him.

804

00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,021
No.

Look. It's two very simple questions.

00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,126
Is there a housing bubble?

811
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,796
And if there is, how exposed are the banks?

812
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:15,929

813

All right.

838
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,684
So, I... Ted had asked me
to do some meeting prep.

839
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,121
But I couldn't find any
marketing material on you guys.

840

Could we see some of
your offering documents?

843
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,197
Well, Brownfield is its own money.

- It's our money.
- Yeah.

Can you tell us how much you manage?

Of course. We're doing
$30 million right now.

Um, but we started

four years ago with $110,000.

849

CHRIS: Wow.

850
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,246
So, as you can see, that's
pretty phenomenal returns.

851
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:41,583
We want to get an ISDA
agreement with JPMorgan so we can

852
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,151

Thank you.

But you guys are under the
capital requirements for an ISDA.

00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:06,744
By how much?

Uh...

859
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,981

...a lot.

861
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,318
This makes us look bad, doesn't it,

862
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,588
that we didn't know what the
capital requirements were?

It's not great.

00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,996
keep up those returns and give us a call

Okay?

00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:40,474
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

1100
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,809
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy.

1101
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,681
"Let's just all calm down."

1102
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:50,416
I sold that house for
$350,000 the year it was built.

1103
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:52,686
Two years later, $480,000.

1104
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,990
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1105
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,025
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

1106
00:49:59,027 --> 00:50:00,961
He'd let it go for that.

1107
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,729
Hi, John.

1108
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:04,365
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.

1109
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,865
It will break his heart,
but he'll let it go.

1110
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,702
Why is he selling?

1111
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,537
MARLENE: Neither one's working right now.

1112
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,273
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

1113
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:16,342
As motivated as one can
be in this neighborhood.

1114
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:18,979
This house on the left, I would
say they're probably motivated.

1115
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,014
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.

1116
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,383
MARLENE: Oh, it's just the gully.

1117
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:24,217
That's all. Just...

1118
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,719
Just nerves.

1119
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,456
So where do we stand?

1120
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,191
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

1121
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:32,592
MAN: This market won't last.

1122
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,461
MARK: Actually, could I
talk to a mortgage broker?

1123
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,363
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.

1124
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:38,465
MARLENE: Yes, yes, I
have someone. Absolutely.

1125
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:39,800

So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

1129
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,610
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund,

1130
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,744
but we're not really part of it.

1131
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,313
We invest in financial service companies

1132
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,349
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1133
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,385
How many loans do you write each month?

1134
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,021
- (BLOWS AIR) About 60.
- Yeah.

1135

What was it four years ago?

1136
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,858
- Ten...
- (PORTER WHISTLES)

1137
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,193
Maybe 15.

1138

Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.

1139

(LAUGHING) You own a...

1140
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:11,932
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1141
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,700
- MAN IN BLACK: Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1142
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,735
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1143
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:18,940
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1145

I just leave the income
section blank if I want.

Corporate doesn't care.

1155
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,833
These people just want homes.
And they go with the flow.

1156

PORTER: Good for you.

If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,

They're not confessing.

Once they find out they're getting a home,

1170

they sign where you tell them to sign.

1171
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,717
Don't ask questions.
Don't understand the rates.

- Yeah.

VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why

1417
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,510
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1418
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,646
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1419
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:49,148
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

in these bonds are solid loans.

Just answer the question, Georgia.

01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,061
Can you name one time in the past year

1444
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,463
where you checked the tape

1445

and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

If we don't give them the ratings,

1447
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,005
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

To figure out if this

01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,882
The bonds aren't going down.

1718
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:45,217
They won't move. It's possible

1719
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:49,791
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

1720
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:53,895
Or... (STAMMERS) You're wrong.

1721
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:00,499
Sure.

1722
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,506
It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

1723
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:13,745
I guess when someone's wrong, they never...

1724
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,983
They never know how.

1725
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:21,454
LEWIS: See you in the morning.

1726
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,490
Yeah.

1727
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,892
Even Bear upped their prices.

1728
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:29,461
And they keep calling us Brownhole.

1729
01:19:29,463 --> 01:19:31,162
You just don't have the
money or the reputation.

1730
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,632
Don't take it personally.

1731
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,200
I don't think I have the
strip club in me tonight.

1732
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,769
I'm just gonna get some ginger
ale and watch some pay-per-view.

1733
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:40,141
I'll book us some flights
out for the morning.

1734
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:44,276
CHARLIE: (STAMMERS) A deal.
We need a deal, right? A deal.

1735
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:46,178
We need a deal we can afford.

1736
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,580
We need a deal that
they're not gonna refuse.

1737
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:51,920
So... What can we do? We can...

1738
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:56,187
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

1739
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:58,257
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1740
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:01,259
We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated,

1741
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:03,329
but in reality they're more like 25%.

1742
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,831
Some of them are 0%!

1743
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,567
We also know that if the
bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1744
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:09,802
the upper tranches are affected.

1745
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:11,269
They go to zero.

1746
01:20:11,271 --> 01:20:14,673
I'll bet you right now that
those AA's are actually like B's.

1747
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:17,779
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

1748
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:19,780
Look, Ben.

1749
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:22,850
The payoff

1750
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,851
is 200 to 1.

1751
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,018
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

1752
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,425
So they're charging pennies on
the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1753
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,960
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1754
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:37,530
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1755
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,532
The banks will think we're
either high or having a stroke.

1756
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:42,871
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1757
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:46,807
Kinda brilliant.

1758
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,742
This is what we did that
no one else thought of.

1759
01:20:50,744 --> 01:20:53,778
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1760
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,214
But we did.

1761
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:57,083
Little Brownhole Capital.

1762
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:02,088
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1763
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,990
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1764
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,392
Oh, got no angle. We're new
to this. We're just excited.

1765
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:10,562
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1766
01:21:10,564 --> 01:21:11,731
I don't understand.

1767
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,369
You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.

1768
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,771
$40 million against the AA.

1769
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,272
Brother, I will sell
you as much as you want.

1770
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:23,510
You understand perfectly,
Bob. You want the deal?

1771
01:21:24,578 --> 01:21:25,678
(MEN LAUGHING)

1772
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,682
That's cool. That's all right with me.

1773
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:31,086
Pleasure.

1774
01:21:35,922 --> 01:21:37,791
Oh! (VOCALIZING)

1775
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,229
- Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
- (CONTINUES VOCALIZING)

1776
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,131
- Stop that.
- Charlie.

1777
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:45,300
Stop it! Stop.

1778
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:48,836
What?

1779
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,037
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1780
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:53,772
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1781
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:55,040
We should celebrate.

1782
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,041
You just bet against the American economy.

1783
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:58,611
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1784
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,646
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1785
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:04,383
Which means if we're right...

1786
01:22:04,385 --> 01:22:07,820
If we're right, people lose
homes. People lose jobs.

1787
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:11,123
People lose retirement
savings. People lose pensions.

1788
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,391
You know what I hate about fucking banking?

1789
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:14,026
It reduces people to
numbers. Here's a number.

1790
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:16,928
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1791
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,531
- No.
- Did you know that?

1792
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,101
No, I didn't know that.

1793
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,238
We were just excited.

1794
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,307
Just don't fucking dance.

1795
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:30,145
- CHARLIE: All right.
- JAMIE: Where are you going?

1796
01:22:34,515 --> 01:22:36,685
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1797
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:40,251
First of all, great show today.

1798
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:41,786
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

1799
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:43,488
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1800
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,325
I appreciate that.

1801
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,159
You worried you and your
swaps are getting played?

1802
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:48,827
Well, this is an opportunity for you

1803
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:50,396
to meet who you're betting against.

1804
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,263
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1805
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,766
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1806
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,601
JAMIE: <i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

1807
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,803
I'm a CDO manager.

1808
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,936
A "CDO manager"?

1809
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,938
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1810
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,043
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1811
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,777
MR. CHAU: Oh.

1812
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:08,379
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1813
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:09,848
and monitor the assets.

1814
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,750
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1815
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,786
Do you represent the
investors or Merrill Lynch?

1816
01:23:14,788 --> 01:23:15,888
The investors.

1817
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,022
You do.

1818
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,557
- Yeah.
- But...

1819
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:20,526
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

1820
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:25,196
unless you put Merrill
Lynch's bonds in your CDO.

1821
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,534
Good question. Let's just
say Merrill and I have, um...

1822
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,768
We have a good relationship.

1823
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,037
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1824
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:34,807
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1825
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,376
And so the CDOs that you create

1826
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:41,379
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1827
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,382
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1828
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:46,921
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1829
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,060
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1830
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:55,896
Okay.

1831
01:23:57,497 --> 01:24:01,233
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1832
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,867
They give you the bonds they want to sell.

1833
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,268
They give you clients,

1834
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,738
they give you money to run your business.

1835
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,540
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1836
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:10,809
But you represent the investors?

1837
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,077
(CHUCKLES)

1838
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:13,245
Is that right?

1839
01:24:13,247 --> 01:24:14,379
Yeah.

1840
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:15,915
But we're not in the
Merrill Lynch building.

1841
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,583
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1842
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:19,750
You're 20 minutes away.

1843
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:21,688
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1844
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:24,824
That's funny, huh?

1845
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,090
That's hilarious.

1846
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:28,229
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1847
01:24:29,195 --> 01:24:30,594
Oh, boy.

1848
01:24:30,596 --> 01:24:32,897
Your boss is about to explode.

1849
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:34,599
No, he's too curious to explode.

1850
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,168
Hold on. Say that again.

1851
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,370
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1852
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:40,373
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1853
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,708
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".

1854
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,543
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1855
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:46,614
A CDO of a CDO.

1856
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:48,214
All right?

1857
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,249
And then there's CDOs made
up of the opposite side

1858
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,050
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1859
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:54,452
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1860
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:56,722
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1861
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,557
That is fucking crazy.

1862
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:01,626
It's not. It's awesome.

1863
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:05,132
His face is starting to boil. He looks
like the bad guy from <i>Dune.</i>

1864
01:25:08,034 --> 01:25:09,233
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1865
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:11,637
All right, let's say

1866
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:15,307
you have a pool of $50
million in subprime loans.

1867
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,977
How much money could be
out there betting on it,

1868
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,879
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps

1869
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,548
right now, tonight?

1870
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,153
Let's see, $50 million... Hmm...

1871
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:27,218
A billion dollars.

<i>were the match...</i>

1875
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,594
How much bigger is the market
for insuring mortgage bonds

1876
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:38,032
than actual mortgages?

1877

<i>"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?"</i>

1888
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,027
(CROWD CHEERING)

1889
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:12,763
<i>Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler,
father of behavioral economics</i>

1890
01:26:12,765 --> 01:26:15,700
<i>and Selena Gomez to explain.</i>

1891
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:18,970
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.

1892
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:21,940
Let's say I bet $10
million on a blackjack hand.

1893
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,809
$10 million because this
hand is meant to represent

1894
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:27,047
a single mortgage bond.

1895
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:33,552
Okay, Selena has a pretty
good hand here, showing 18.

1896
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:34,652
Dealer showing seven.

1897
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,787
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1898
01:26:36,789 --> 01:26:38,255
Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning

1899
01:26:38,257 --> 01:26:40,726
<i>this hand are 87%.</i>

1900
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:44,196
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1901
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:46,932
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1902
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,400
How could I lose, right?

1903
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,001
Now, this is a classic error.

1904
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:53,037
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1905
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,674
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.

1906
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:58,043
People are sure they're
gonna make the next one.

1907
01:26:58,045 --> 01:27:00,079
<i>People think that
whatever's happening now</i>

1908
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,915
<i>is gonna continue to
happen into the future.</i>

1909
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,352
<i>During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up</i>

1910
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,086
and people thought they
would never go down.

1911
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:10,722
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1912
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,258
will make a side bet.

1913
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,593
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1914
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:16,260
I love Selena Gomez.

1915
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:17,862
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1916
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:20,031
And I'll give
you 3-to-1 odds.

1917
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:23,936
3-to-1 odds? Okay,
I'll take that bet.

1918
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,371
RICHARD: Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

1919
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:28,639
on the outcome of their bet.

1920
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:29,875
Bet you 50 million she wins.

1921
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,910
That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.

1922
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:36,248
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1923
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,916
wins that bet.

1924
01:27:37,918 --> 01:27:41,152
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1925
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:42,388
How about
20-to-1?

1926
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,923
Deal.

1927
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:48,226
And this will go on and on with
more and more synthetic CDOs.

1928
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:52,429
And we can transform an
original $10 million investment

1929
01:27:52,431 --> 01:27:54,335
into billions of dollars.

1930

01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:12,623
Because word on the street

2183
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:15,462
is that he took some pretty heavy losses.

2184
01:42:16,796 --> 01:42:18,662
Kathy, come on. We know each other.

2185
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:21,299
- (SIGHS)
- What's going on?

2186
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:22,967
How bad is this?

2187
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:24,936
Okay.

2188
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,072
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager
in Morgan's bond department

2189
01:42:28,074 --> 01:42:31,675
also started shorting subprime
housing, $2 billion in BBBs.

2190
01:42:31,677 --> 01:42:33,009
Bennie is smarter than I thought.

2191
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:34,513
No, he's not smart at all.

2192
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,981
The premiums on the swap
ate into his desk's profit.

2193
01:42:36,983 --> 01:42:39,016
To cover his BBB shorts,

2194
01:42:39,018 --> 01:42:41,619
he sold a lot of A and
AA swaps as protection.

2195
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,321
A lot.

2196
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:47,090
He believed that there was no
way that they could be affected.

2197
01:42:47,092 --> 01:42:50,430
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't
hold the contracts on these swaps.

2198
01:42:53,766 --> 01:42:55,933
Holy shit.

2199
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:59,602
All this time I've been trying to
figure out who I'm betting against,

2200
01:42:59,604 --> 01:43:01,440
and it's Morgan Stanley.

2201
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,710
Which is me.

2202
01:43:05,444 --> 01:43:08,678
What's your exposure? $3 billion?

2203
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,682
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.

2204
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,384
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.

2205
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,652
Yes, you can answer that,
because I walk in here

2206
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:18,724
and people are crying in your hallway.

2207
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:20,791
Kathy,

2208
01:43:20,793 --> 01:43:22,893
you bring me in to tell
me everything's fine,

2209
01:43:22,895 --> 01:43:24,131
and everything's not fine.

2210
01:43:24,764 --> 01:43:26,667
What, what is happening?

2211
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:31,038
The long exposure is...

2212
01:43:32,971 --> 01:43:34,474
...$15 billion.

2213

over 8% were impossible.

2217
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:50,090
Yeah, but we have nothing
to do with Morgan Stanley.

2218

2220
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:59,699
Morgan fails, all our accounts
go on their balance sheet.

2221

DANNY: It's just crazy.

2222
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:03,567
Morgan makes the sucker's bet

2223
01:44:03,569 --> 01:44:06,403
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

2224
01:44:06,405 --> 01:44:08,908
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.

2225
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:14,847
Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.

2226
01:44:16,582 --> 01:44:19,718
We get our bonuses, our investors
get their profits, we get...

2227

What, 30 cents on the dollar? It's not bad.

2228

We're three times that.

2229
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:25,889
Not if there's no market
left to sell them in.

2230
