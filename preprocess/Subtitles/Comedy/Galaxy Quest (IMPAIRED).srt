1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,169
- Exiting the time knot now, sir.
- We're alive!

2
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,255
We made it, Commander.
We made it.

3
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,591
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,927
[Computerized Voice]
Systems registering functional.

5
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,054
All systems are
working, Commander.

6
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,641
I don't like it.
It was too easy.

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,062
- [Boy] Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!
- [Alarm Blaring]

8
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,815
- There are time knots opening everywhere!
- A trap!

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,359
We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,030
- Aah!
- Ooh!

11
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,324
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

12
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,202
Surrender may be
our only option.

13
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,496
No! Never give up!

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,498
Never surrender!

15
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,917
Your orders, sir?

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,172
Sir?
Group orders?

Activate the Omega 13.

- [Audience Applauding]
- [Man] Well?

19
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,394
Huh?
Well, there you are.

20
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,189
- Yeah! Huh?
- [Audience Cheering, Applauding]

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:51,069
Yeah! Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

22
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:55,741
You are the first people
to see the lost Galaxy Quest...

episode 92
two-parter...

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,371
since it was originally aired
in 1982!

25
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,167
- Huh? Yeah! All right.
- [Audience Applauding]

26
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,212
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for...

27
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,467
the intrepid crew
of the N.S.E.A. Protector!

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,469
- Yeah! Yeah!
- [Crowd Cheering]

29

[Man]
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

30
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:25,103
White scarf, black buttons,
white shoes.

31
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,900
Man, where in the hell is he?
An hour and a half late?

32
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,111
- An hour and a half.
- I mean, this is unreal.

33
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,531
They're gonna start
eating each other out there.

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,909
Oh, did you hear? He booked
another appearance without us.

35
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,953
You're kidding.

36
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,582
Oh. Uh...
Um...

37
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,421
- How did I come to this?
- Not again.

38
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,424
- I played Richard the Third.
- Five curtain calls.

39
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,678
There were five curtain calls. I was an actor once,
damn it! Now look at me. Look at me!

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,013
I cannot go out there,
and I won't say...

41
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,934
that stupid line one more time!

42
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,104
- I can't, I won't.
- Well, Alex, at least you had a part.

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,523
Okay? You had
a character people loved.

44
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,526
I mean, my TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs...

45
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,487
about my boobs and how they
fit into my suit.

46
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,782
No one even bothered to ask me
what I do on the show.

47
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,037
You had the... Wait.
Wait, I'll think of it.

48
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,457
- I repeated the computer, Fred.
- Whew!

49
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,878
Your commander is on deck!
Ha, ha!

50
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,797
Wow, that smog
is thick today, huh?

51
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,717
- Am I too late for Alexander's panic attack?
- [Objects Clattering]

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Apparently not. You know,
you should get that looked at.

53
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,723
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

54
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,434
[Emcee in Distance]
Let's take a look at a few more clips.

55
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,229
Okay.
What did I do? Hmm?

56
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,523
- [Audience Chanting] We want the crew!
- What?

57
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,319
- [Chanting] We want the crew! - For those four
seasons, we developed the same affection...

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,697
for the crew as the crew
had for each other.

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,783
These weren't just adventurers
exploring space.

60
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,827
- Friends.
- These were friends.

61
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,705
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it, man!

62
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,208
It's not a big deal! These guys
put a little set in their basement.

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,878
I'm there about an hour.
It's nothing, Gwen.

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,630
They wanted the Commander.

65
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,716
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait a minute. Grab him! Grab him!

66
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,886
- We want the crew! We want the crew!
- [Emcee] Okay!

67
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,764
Yeah!
Here we go!

68
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,475
Come on, old friend.
Old friend.

69
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,561
You stole all my best lines.
You cut me out of episode two entirely.

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,232
- Excuse me.
- [Emcee] Tawny Madison... my personal favorite...

71
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,734
- Gwen DeMarco!
- [Crowd Cheering]

72
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,611
Yeah!

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,783
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Let's hear a warm welcome...

74
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:47,538
for crack gunner Laredo...
Tommy Webber!

75
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,083
- You will go out there!
- I won't,

76
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,085
and nothing you say
will make me.

77
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,130
- The show must go on.
- [Emcee] Freddie Kwan!

78
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,218
- Damn you.
- [Emcee Continues, Indistinct]

79
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,639
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

Tev'Meck...
Alexander Dane!

81
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,478

All right!

[Crowd Cheering]

00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,861
By Grabthar's hammer,
you shall be avenged!

00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,322
Yeah!
All right!

85
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,576
That guy can act.
And finally,

86
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,370
my... my fellow
Questerians,

87
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,125
the brave Commander
of the N.S.E.A. Protector,

- Jason Nesmith! Yes!
- [Crowd Cheering]

91
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,518
[Woman]
We love you, Commander!

92
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,690
- Never give up, never...
- [Audience In Unison] Never surrender!

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,527
Damn the resonance cannons,
full speed ahead! Huh?

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,575
[Emcee] The Commander and his crew
will be signing autographs...

95
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,204
on Imperial decks "C" and "B"
near the Coke machines.

96
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:14,208
[Man]
Whoo! Quest forever, man!

97
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,793
Excuse me, pardon me.
Crew member coming through.

98
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,630
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Oh, hey, man.

99
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,882
I want to thank you for that
nice intro you gave us today.

100
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,510
- Um...
- Guy.

101
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,845
You probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses, right?

102
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,556
I was on the show in '82,
episode 81.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,852
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial. Aaah!

104
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,565
Listen, uh... Maybe I could sit in
and, uh, sign a couple autographs?

105
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,736
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

106
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,746
- By Grabthar's...
- Next.

107
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,542
Had I moved an inch to the left,
the beast would have killed me.

108
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,753
- On the other hand, my crew was in danger.
- How did you know what to do?

109
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:04,091
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

110
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,261
I think we all remember what happened
to that beast on Enok Seven, right?

111
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,680
[Crowd Laughing]

112
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,600
You've gotta admit,
they really do love him.

113
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,019
Yeah, almost as much
as he loves himself.

114
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,899
Excuse me, Commander.
Hey!

115
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:26,029
I was wondering if you could help settle a dispute
my crew and I seem to be having.

116
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,991
Um, if you remember, uh,
in "Quasar Dilemma..."

117
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,743
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

118
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,914
I hadn't even gotten
to the relevant conundrum.

119
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,084
In episode 15,
"Mist of Delos Five,"

120
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,297
I got the feeling that you and
the Commander kind of had a thing.

121
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,841
- Did you?
- No.

122
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,010
The Commander and I
never had a thing.

123
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,888
Well that's her story.

124
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,853
Excuse me.

125
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,607
Gwen. Gwen.

126
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,819
Gwen.

127
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,822
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

128
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,200
I must speak to you.
It is a matter of supreme importance.

129
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,869
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula...

130
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,996
and we... need your help.

131
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,123
Oh, oh, oh.

132
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,125
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

133
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,587
Just hammer out the details with my agent,
and make sure there's a limo at my house.

134
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,716
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.

135
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,552
Remember, mum's the word.

136
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,305
- Certainly, but um...
- Mum.

137
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,141
- Mum. Mum.
- Mum. - Mum.

138
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,937
Look here.
And... beautiful.

139
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,651
Crewman Madison.
The mist of this strange planet...

140
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,987
is filling my head
with such thoughts.

141
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,157
It was cute when I
didn't know you.

142
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,454
[Chuckles]
You...

143

[Men Chuckling]

147
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,897
What a freak show, man.
Oh, this is hilarious.

148
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,110
Bunch of losers! Beggin'
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

149
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,696
- [Toilet Flushes]
- These guys haven't had a real acting job for 20 years.

150
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,574
- This is all they've got.
- Did you check out Nesmith?

151
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,618
He actually gets off on those retards
thinking he's a space commander!

Whoo! Full speed ahead,

158
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,775
Hey, Commander,
uh, so, as I was saying,

159
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,361
in "The Quasar Dilemma," remember,
you used the auxiliary of deck B...

160
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,198
could you get this...
deck B for gamma override.

161
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,992
The thing is is that
online blueprints clearly indicate...

162
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,078
that deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

163
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,290
So, we were wondering
just where the error lies in that.

164
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,960
It's just a television show.
That's all, okay?

Right, but...

'Cause we were wondering if the quantum
flux... Now, just listen on this...

167
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,717
There is no quantum flux!

00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,222

My apologies.

310
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:52,085
Evidently, we had a little
miscommunication regarding...

Do you know what time it is? Why do
you even bother to show up at all?

N-N-N-Not now.
Guys, I was there.

317
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,275
I was up there.
Remember yesterday at the convention?

318
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,861
Those people dressed like aliens?
They were aliens.

319
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:21,698
They were Termites or Dalmatians.
I can't really remember 'cause I was hungover.

But what they built
was extraordinary.

00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,788
It was a huge spaceship.
I got to fight this guy named Sarris and I kicked his ass.

I know what you're thinkin'.
But I can prove it. They gave me this.

323
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:42,427
No, no, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

324
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,263
Protector,
this is the commander. Over.

- That's it. It's time to go!

- Begging your pardon, Commander?

We come with news.
Sarris lives.

- He was able upon your departure to make an escape.
- Listen. Tell them.

- However, he has contacted us...
- Sarris.

...and wishes to negotiate a surrender.

We humbly implore you to come
and negotiate the terms.

Huh? They want me back?
You want me back?

Is this amazing? They want me back, and
I want you guys to go with me. Please?

I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?

You know, it's one thing
to treat us this way.

342
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,312
It's another thing to do it
to your fans.

She's not a fan.
This is... This is a Termite!

You should've just
let me hit him.

Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

I think we should've
just taken the gig.

the next time he'll ask us?

after watching you.

455
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:04,573
- Take her out.
- [Clears Throat] Right, right.

456
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,742
Okay.

457
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,411
Right.

458
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:12,831
Right.
Take her out.

459
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,170

Okay.

464
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,355
Y-you gotta move
to the right.

465
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:21,567
- Hit parallel.
- Would you sit your ass down? Sit! You wanna drive?

[Jason]
Oh. Mmm.

470
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,164
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander?

471
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:21,043
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

472
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,795
Yes. We programmed
the food synthesizer...

473
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,798
for each of you based on
the regional menu of your birthplace.

474
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:30,010
[Jason] I don't care where
you did it. It tastes great!

475
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,888
Are you enjoying your
Kep-mok bloodticks, Dr. Lazarus?

476
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:35,265
Just like Mother used to make.

477
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,731
So, um... [Groans]
Tell me, Mathesar.

478
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,442
This Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

479
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,903
- what does he want, exactly?
- [Gagging]

480
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:51,573
He heard about the device...
the Omega 13.

481
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:54,493
Um, what is it?
What does it do?

482
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,912
We don't know.

483
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,706
We were hoping
you could enlighten us.

484
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,002
[Nervous Chuckle]

485
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,758
Oh.
The Omega 13 device.

486
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,970
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

487
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,181
- [Gasps]
- Why don't you just turn it on and see what it does?

488
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:18,392
- [Shrills]
- [Laughs]

489
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:22,521
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

490
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,065
If we were mistaken in our construction,
the device would...

491
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:28,110
act as a molecular explosive,
causing a chain reaction...

492
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,571
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

493
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:35,617
Has Sarris ever seen any
of the, uh, historical records?

494
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,703
No, thank God, he has not.

495
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:42,708
Oh. So how does he know about
the Omega 13 device?

496
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:51,341
Our former commander
was not... strong.

497
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,886
Former commander?

498
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,473
I am sorry.
You deserve to be shown.

499
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,144
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

Originally, one of our own
tried to lead.

501
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:09,026
Is that all?
After three days of this,

502
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,196
you still require...
incentive?

I have told you all I know.

505
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:20,162
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

506
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:24,041
[Sarris] When I grow weary
of the noises you make, you shall die.

[Electrical Buzzing]

508
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:41,433
Wait a minute, guys. Come on.
Hold on a minute. You just can't leave.

509
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,560
- Give me some time to think.
- He wants to think.

510
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,063
No, Jason, that's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about.

511
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,441
I'm not even supposed to be here. I'm
just crewman number six. I'm expendable.

512
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:53,445
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious. I gotta get out.

513
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:57,783
- Commander?
- We gotta prepare the pods for my crew's departure.

514
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,786
Begging your commander's pardon, sir.
We can't launch pods at the moment.

515
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,164
- Sarris will surely detonate any objects leaving the ship.
- Sarris?

516
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:08,085
Yes, sir. He's here now. Your presence
is required on the command deck.

[Stammers]

While my people are
talented scientists,

520
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,267
our attempt to operate
our own technologies...

521
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,602
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

522
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:29,606
- I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency.
- [Jason] Mathesar...

523
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,442
We meet again, Commander.

524
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,779
Hello, Sarris. How you doin'?

525
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:39,241
Better than my lieutenant.

526
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:44,246
He failed to activate the ship's
neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped...

527
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,373
on our last encounter.

528
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:50,085
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say I'm real sorry
about what happened before.

529
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,797
The whole thing was just...
just a misunderstanding.

530
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,966
Deliver the device to me,

531
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,261
or I will destroy your ship.

532
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,514
You know, um, we'd like do that,

533
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:06,185
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

534
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,896
You have ten seconds!

535
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,648
I don't... Ten seconds?
I don't... There...

536
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:15,861
You know... Okay. Gosh darn it,
I give up. It's yours. You can have it.

537
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,072
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay?

538
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,825
- Gwen. [Clicks Tongue]
- [Groans]

539
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:26,622
Don't panic. I've dealt with this guy before.
He's as stupid as he is ugly. Come here.

540
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:29,917
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

541
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,461
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right?

542
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,505
- [Gwen] Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

543
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,382
Push these red buttons and send
everything we have towards him, okay?

544
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,761
- Okay.
- All right, Gwen. [Clears Throat]

545
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:45,599
- Put me back on with him.
- Well, I'm trying to tell you, you are back with him.

546
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:50,521
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander.

547
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:58,195
I gave you the...
"kill" gesture.

548
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,447
No, you gave me
the "we're dead" signal.

549
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:03,283
I was agreeing with you.
Like I know where the hold button is.

550
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,619
[Guy]
Hey, guys.

551
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,414
- [Beeping On Monitor]
- There's a red, uh, thingy...

552
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:11,500
movin' toward the green thingy.

553
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,128
- What?
- Red thingy movin' toward the green thingy.

554
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,633
I think... I think
we're the green thingy.

555
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:23,095
A little present
for you, Commander.

556
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,430
We gotta get out of here. Move
this ship. Turn it. Move! Let's go!

- I'm going as fast as I can!
- She's still behind us!

569
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:25,616
Well, uh, uh, press turbo. I'm always
saying, "Press the turbo," right?

570
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,493

[Computerized Voice]
The enemy is matching velocity.

574

Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

Hi, guys. Listen.
They're tellin' me...

the, uh... the generators
won't take it.

- We stop and we die. Tommy, just hold that down.

581
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:05,906
- You don't hold the turbo down. It's for quick boosts!

That's a bad sound.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. We might be able
to lose them in this cloud here.

Oh, I don't...
I don't think that's a cloud.

Mathesar, what is this?

588
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,844
This is the Tothian minefield
left standing from the Great War of 12185.

Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one?

Sorry, man. They're driftin'
towards us! I think they're magnetic!

- [Screaming] Oh, man!
- Tommy! You all right?

No, my arm is broke...
No, don't touch it. Don't touch it.

- Thanks, Mathesar.

[Screaming]

605
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,401
Alex, where are you going?

606
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,738
To see if there's a pub.

607
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,376
[Computer] Forward thruster shaft:
87 percent damage.

608
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:26,421
Aft vector guards:
96 percent damage.

609
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:31,051
Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 34, 40...

610
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:34,763
- What about the engines?
- Forward thruster shaft:

611
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,433
- 87 percent damage.
- Computer, what about the engines?

612
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:43,772
- Why don't we have power?
- The beryllium sphere has fractured under stress.

613
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:47,943
- It's fractured.
- Can it be repaired?

614
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:53,073
- Computer, can it be repaired?
- Damage to beryllium sphere: irreparable.

615
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:57,786
- New source of beryllium must be secured.
- We need another one.

616
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,455
You broke the ship.
You broke the bloody ship.

617
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,457
Eh, ah...
[Clears Throat]

618
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,420
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

619
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:10,883
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

620
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:15,554
Negative. No reserve
beryllium sphere exists on board.

621
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:19,099
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

622
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:21,727
You know, that is
really getting annoying.

623
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,897
Look, I have one job
on this lousy ship.

624
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,275
It's stupid,
but I'm gonna do it, okay?

625
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,986
Sure, no problem.

626
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:40,162
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

627
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,623
[Chuckles]
How have you failed us?

628
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:47,836
We have seen you victorious in
much more desperate situations.

629
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,715
The fault must lie with us,
with the ship.

630
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:55,385
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

631
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,429
It's-It's-It's-It's
my fault.

632
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:02,267
- We-We screwed...
- We are not the people you think we are.

633
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,478
I don't understand.

634
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:15,197
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theater, films?

635
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,491
The historical documents
of your culture.

636
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:21,995
Yes, in fact, we have begun to document
our history from your example.

637
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,917
No, not historical documents. They're
not all historical documents. I mean,

638
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:30,712
surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

639
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,340
- [All Moaning]
- Those poor people.

640
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:37,010
[Tommy]
Oh, brother.

641
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:40,305
We're screwed.

642
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,601
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way...

643
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,479
that's contrary to reality?

644
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:51,024
[Gasping]
You are speaking of...

645
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,068
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

646
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,574
We have only recently become aware of this concept
in our dealings with Sarris.

647
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:02,077
Often, Sarris will say one thing
and do another.

648
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,830
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.

649
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:08,333
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great costs.

650
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:14,298
But if you are saying that
any of you could have traits in common with Sarris...

651
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,217
- [Laughing]
- [All Laughing]

[Laughing]

653
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:28,770
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

654
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:31,315
We might be able to get there...

655
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:35,527
if we reconfigure
the solar matrix...

656
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:38,739
in parallel
for endothermic propulsion.

657
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,283
What do you think?

658
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:47,039
- We'll do that!
- All right!

659
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,374
That's-That's-That's
right again.

660
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:52,044
That's... C-C-Come on.
Group hug.

661
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,672
- Come on.
- [All Murmuring]

662
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:09,019
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

663
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:13,190
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

664
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,734
I have studied your missions
extensively.

665
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:19,112
Though I am Thermian, I have lived
my life by your philosophy,

666
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:21,490
by the code of the Mak'tar.

667
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:26,328
- Oh, good, that's very nice.
- By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus.

668
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:30,040
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was just...

669
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,084
Just don't.

670
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:35,212
Yes, sir.

671
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:47,349
Never give up, never surrender.

672
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,440
Dr. Lazarus?

673
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:59,444
Here is your surface mapper. I have
programmed it to the coordinates...

674
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,531
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density.

675
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:07,828
- Good luck on your mission, sir.
- Thanks.

676
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,589
You're doing good, Tommy.

677
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,722
I changed my mind.
I wanna go back.

678
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:30,184
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

679
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,269
Yeah, but that's when I thought
I was the crewman...

680
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:35,898
that stays on the ship, and something
is up there, and it kills me.

681
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,983
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster...

682
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,985
five minutes after we land
on the planet.

683
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,987
You're not gonna die
on the planet, Guy.

684
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,698
I'm not?
Then what's my last name?

685
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:48,035
It's, uh, uh...
I don't know.

686
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,829
Nobody knows!
Do you know why?

687
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,707
Because my character isn't
important enough for a last name,

688
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,044
because I'm gonna die
five minutes in.

689
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,254
Guy, you have a last name.

690
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,466
- Do I? Do I?
- Yes!

691
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:05,928
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

692
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,058
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

693
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,809
Are we there yet?

694
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:15,312
- Mommy!
- [Jason] Tommy!

695
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:18,815
- Look out! Oh, no!
- [Alexander] Pull out!

696
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,901
[Fred Moaning]
Oh, yeah!

697
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,445
[Moaning Continues]

698
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:41,922
- [Beeping]
- [Guy] Don't open that! It's an alien planet!

699
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:45,300
Is there air?
You don't know!

700
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:52,808
[Sniffing, Breathing]
Seems okay.

701
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,325
Here we go.

702
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:16,707
[Jason]
Which way, Alexander?

703
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,295
[Beeping]

704
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:24,798
This way!

705
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,468
Wait. No.

706
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,225
- That way.
- You were holding it upside down.

707
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,519
- Shut up.
- You know, with all that makeup and stuff,

708
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:39,521
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.

709
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:41,773
You think you could
do better, Laredo?

710
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,818
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- [Guy] Oh, we're so screwed.

711
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,488
Come on, come on, come on, if we wanna finish
this mission, we have to use self-control.

712
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,325
[Gwen] "Self-control"?
That's funny, coming from a guy...

713
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:55,204
who slept with every Turekian slave
girl and moon princess on the show.

714
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,748
[Jason] Ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive, you might've been...

715
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,505
[Alexander] Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

716
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:08,842
- Where are the miners?
- Something bad happened here.

717
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:12,221
- Will you relax?
- [Beeping]

718
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:19,186
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,084
- [Gasping]
- [Chattering]

720
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,880
Look at that.

721
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:52,135
Would you look at that?
They look like little children.

722
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:56,598
Could they be the miners?

723
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,601
Sure, they're like
three years old.

724
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:04,773
Miners, not minors.

725
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,276
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

726
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:10,612
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

727
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:14,783
Sure, they're cute now.
In a second, they're gonna get mean.

728
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:18,495
They're gonna get ugly somehow, then
there's gonna be a million more of them.

729
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:22,583
[Gasping] Look.
There's a little hurt one.

730
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,460
[Whimpering]

731
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:27,045
Oh.

732
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:30,632
[Whimpering Continues]

733
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,010
Hi.
Hi there.

734
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:36,180
- Ah!
- Shh!

735
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:40,225
- Did you guys ever watch the show?
- [Chattering]

736
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,519
See?

737
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,646
They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

738
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:49,776
[Whispering]

739
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:52,154
[Snarling]

740
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,741
I'm so sick of being right.

741
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:59,119
Let's get out of here before
one of those things kills Guy.

742
00:51:59,161 --> 00:51:59,786
Wait a minute.

743
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,955
We're not going anywhere
without a beryllium sphere.

744
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:02,831
We need a plan.

745
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,292
Fred, I need a diversion
to clear the compound of those things.

746
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:07,836
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.

747
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,964
Tommy, get up on that ridge, and if you see
them come back, give me a signal, all right?

748
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,841
Why does this sound so familiar?

749
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:15,636
"Assault on Voltareck 3,"
episode 81.

750
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:19,348
- We're doing episode 81?
- Whatever. The one with the hologram, the wall of fire.

751
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,476
Well, how the hell is Fred
supposed to project a hologram?

752
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,479
- What did we do in episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan.

753
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:29,900
- What difference does it make if it's episode 81 or not?
- 'Cause I died in episode 81!

754
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:33,362
- Shh! Episode 51, right?
- This is ludicrous.

755
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,364
Why are you listening to this fellow?
May I remind you:

756
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,075
He's wearing a costume,
not a uniform.

757
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:42,079
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.

758
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,916
Look, they're gone.

759
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,835
- Where'd they go, back inside?
- I don't know.

760
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,754
- Nobody was watching.
- All right, all right!

761
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:53,757
Listen up. Here's the plan.
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I, we'll go down and get a sphere.

762
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,926
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter,
and Tommy, you're lookout.

763
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,429
- You see anything at all, you give us a signal.
- What kind of a signal?

764
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:04,268
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands like this, and caw, caw!

765
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,937
What are you, an infant?
Look, we have these.

766
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:13,402
- That... Sorry.
- All right, let's go.

767
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:15,404
[Grunting]

768
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,996
- Does rolling help?
- Uh-huh, it helps.

769
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,624
- Where's your gun?
- It helps. - Shoot!

770
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,259
- Oh.
- What?

771
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,138
[Jason Chuckling]
Never give up, never surrender.

772
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,140
[Together]
Oh, shut up.

773
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:47,769
Caw, caw, I said!
[Yelling]

774
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:51,315
[Screaming]
Run! Run! Run!

775
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:55,736
- They're everywhere, they're everywhere.
- Everywhere!

776
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:58,447
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

777
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:02,117
- [Yelling]
- [Jason] Hurry!

778
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,996
They're everywhere.
Come on!

779
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,957
[Jason]
Don't look back. Don't look back.

780
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,293
- We're not gonna make it.
- [Snarling]

781
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,837
- [Screams]
- Oh, God!

782
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:17,090
[Guy] I knew it, I knew it.
I knew this was gonna kill me.

783
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:18,300
Hurry! Go, go, go!

784
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:21,345
[Jason]
Come on. Push. Let's go. Go!

785
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,514
I got it, but it's gonna
take a few seconds.

786
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,349
I got it, I got it!

787
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,060
- Go ahead.
- There's no time. Get in, get in.

788
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:30,771
Of course, I forgot, you've got
to be the hero. Haven't you?

789
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:33,857
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight! Oh, no, Jason Nesmith...

790
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,486
- Oh! Jason! Jason, come on!
- [Screeching]

791
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:41,114
- Hurry!
- Tommy, go! Go! I mean it!

792
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:45,827
Help! No, no, no! Jason, please!
Tommy, stop the pod, stop it!

793
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,831
- I can't stop it. It's on autopilot.
- Go! Leave him!

794
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:51,834
[Gwen]
No!

795
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,632
[Screeching]

796
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,845
Oh, right!

797
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:05,848
Of course, it's always
about you, isn't it?

798
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,936
[Panting]

799
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,980
[Chattering]

800
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:20,195
[Screeching]

801
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,166
[Groaning]

802
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:38,422
[Screaming] Oh, hey!
[Grunting]

803
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,799
- [Growling]
- [Groaning]

804
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,801
[Chanting]
Gorignack, Gorignack.

805
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:46,847
- [Groaning Continues]
- Gorignak, Gorignak, Gorignak, Gorignak.

806
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,643
Jason? Jason,
can you hear me?

807
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:55,189
- Yeah, Gwen, you got me.
- Thank God. Are you okay?

808
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:59,443
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
I've got Gorignak staring me in the face right now.

809
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:02,988
But you know what?
I think I can take him.

810
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,032
[All Groaning]

811
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,826
Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.

812
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,204
- The digital conveyor?
- Yeah.

813
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:14,416
You gonna have me diced into cubes
and sent up there in a million pieces?

814
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:17,252
- Right.
- Well, you know what?

815
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:20,297
I think I'll take my chances
with Gorignak.

816
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:25,010
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?

817
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,679
It has never been
successfully tested.

818
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:30,974
- What did he say?
- Hold, please.

819
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,519
Theoretically, the mechanism
is fully operational.

820
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,189
However, it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.

821
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,067
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.

822
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:43,904
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.

823
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:46,740
I-I-I mean, I can't.
[Stammering]

824
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:49,201
- I-l can supervise.
- Jason, we're gonna test it.

825
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:52,454
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

826
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:56,959
- Hey, I'm doing all right with the pig lizard.
- Please, Fred. And hurry.

827
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:00,087
[High-Pitched Squeal]

828
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,590
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.

829
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:06,927
The operation of the conveyor is
much more... hmm-mmm... art than science.

830
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,013
Stand back, Jason.

831
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,768
Gorignak, Gorignak, Gorignak.

832
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,479
[Growling]

833
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:30,033
[All Screaming, Groaning]

834
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:37,291
- What? What was that?
- Uh... - Nothing.

835
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:40,419
- I heard some squealing or something.
- Oh, no, everything's fine.

836
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:42,379
But the animal is inside out.

837
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:45,549
I heard that.
It turned inside out?

838
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,969
[Screaming]

839
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,013
And it exploded.

840
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:55,392
Did I just hear that the animal
turned inside out and exploded?

841
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,394
Hello?

842
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,523
Hold, please.

843
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,525
Hey, wait a minute.
Guys, guys.

844
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:06,445
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak."

845
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:10,073
Teb, hit
the translation circuit.

846
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,160
[Chanting Continues]
Gorignak, Gorignak. Rock.

847
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,538
Rock, rock, rock.

848
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:19,750
- [Chattering]
- Jason,

849
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,920
I don't think the pig lizard
was Gorignak.

850
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:25,422
What the hell you talkin' about?

851
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:36,850
Oh, darn.

852
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,852
[Sighs]

853
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,821
Digitize me!

854
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,823
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys, digitize me!

855
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,910
- Not me.
- Come on, they based it on your hand movements.

856
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,912
- Am I the only one who saw that thing inside out?
- No, no, no, no.

857
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,914
I-I-I'm not the guy.

858
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:02,084
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen.
Kwan's not even my real name.

859
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,211
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.

860
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:08,257
Kill it? Well,
I'm open to any suggestions.

861
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:10,467
Go for the eyes,
like in episode 22!

862
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,637
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

863
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,681
Go for the mouth or throat,
its vulnerable spots!

864
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,767
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!

865
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:22,104
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.

866
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:25,607
- Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?
- A lathe!

867
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:29,278
Get off the line, Guy! Alexander,
you're my advisor. Advise me.

868
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:32,281
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.

869
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:34,283
What is its motivation?

870
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:37,953
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

871
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:40,497
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.

872
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,626
[Screaming]
Oh! Fred, can you hear me?

873
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,171
Fred, are you there?
[Screaming]

874
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:50,174
- Kinda.
- You can do it, Fred. It's up to you.

875
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:53,260
Oh, no, no, no. Jason,
I'll just... I'll just mess it up.

876
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:55,679
You did it for four years
on the show. Do it now.

877
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:58,473
That was the show.
I'm not that guy.

878
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,351
You never forgot a line.
You never missed a mark.

879
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:02,853
[Grunting]

880
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,688
That's not me anymore, man.

881
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:10,152
It is you, Fred.
You just stopped trying.

882
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:15,240
You could do this, Fred. I know
in my heart, you're gonna save my life.

883
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:18,160
- I am?
- No doubt about it, Fred.

884
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:20,495
Fred!

885
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:23,999
Fred, can you hear me?

886
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:27,336
Fred!

887
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:31,340
Fred?
I don't wanna die down here.

888
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:34,843
Digitize me, Fred!

889
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:39,806
- Oh, wow.
- Oh!

890
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,517
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

891
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:49,233
Oh!

892
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,735
I see you managed
to get your shirt off.

893
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:58,575
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

894
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:02,246
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?

895
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:06,208
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Great. Engines and pods?

896
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:09,503
- Fully operational.
- Perfect! We'll crank this sucker up.

897
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:12,965
You can drop us off, and you guys can be
back to your home planet before supper.

898
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,384
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.

899
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,803
Sure you do.
Family, friends. Come on.

900
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:20,430
We are all that is left.

901
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:30,274
- I didn't know that.
- Sir, I have raised the command deck.

902

Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

1057
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:29,892
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble,
and we need your help.

1058
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:35,439
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown: overridden.

1059
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,775
Core implosion estimated
in six minutes.

1060
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:42,070
- [Gasping]
- [Screaming]

1061
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,698
Sir, it's you.
Thank Ipthar.

1062
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:49,369
Quellek?
What are you doing up there?

1063
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,834
I avoided capture by using
your Mak'tar stealth face.

1064
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,837
- Where is everyone?
- Come with me.

1065
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,340
I'll explain on the way.

1066
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,303
All right, we're at level "C,"
hallway five. Now what?

1067
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:11,141
Um, go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1068
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:14,311
And that leads to a system of utility corridors
through the bowels of the ship.

1069
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:17,147
- Open.
- You know, I'm gonna get Kyle.

1070
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:20,025
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1071
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,112
...38, 39, 40.

1072
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,785
All we have to do is
turn off the valve to the barracks.

1073
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:38,252
- Hi, Brandon.
- No time for pleasantries, Kyle.

1074
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:42,256
We have a level five emergency.
You still got the utility systems walk-through, right?

1075
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:46,009
Yeah, I've got sectors one through twenty-eight.
Hollister has the upper levels.

1076
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:48,053
Great.
We'll get everybody on-line.

1077
01:13:55,978 --> 01:14:01,275
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

1078
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:05,237
General!
I have just received word...

1079
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,948
that the commander of the Protector
and his command crew...

1080
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,200
have escaped custody.

1081
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,202
What?

1082
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:19,793
- Find them!
- But sir! My men... The core implosion...

1083
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:22,129
Find them!

1084
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:27,050
All right, Brandon, I see five ducts
in this room. Which way do we go?

1085
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:29,136
Enter the passage
second to your left...

1086
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,306
and just continue straight
for 50 meters.

1087
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,642
Ducts?
Why is it always ducts?

1088
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,728
- Ah, there will be a slight drop.
- [Screaming]

1089
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:48,864
Thanks for the heads-up,
Brandon! You okay?

1090
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,580
They're dying.

1091
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:59,166
- Wait a minute. We gotta go across this thing?
- Yes.

1092
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:03,212
- Don't look down.
- What I'd give to see what you're seeing.

1093
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,216
- What are you talking about?
- You're deep in the underbelly of the Omega 13!

1094
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:10,219
Oh, it must be spectacular.

1095
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,096
It-It doesn't look
like much to me.

1096
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:18,977
There's just these few walls and this dumb
spinning fan that we have in every single...

1097
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:36,161
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

1098
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:39,456
Uh, many have believed
that it is a matter collapser.

1099
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,752
A bomb capable of destroying pretty much
everything in about 13 seconds.

1100
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:47,172
- But myself and others are convinced that what it is...
- I'm gonna go. Go.

1101
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:49,591
Is a matter rearranger,

1102
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:52,344
affecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1103
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:57,182
Why 13 seconds? That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1104
01:15:57,266 --> 01:16:00,978
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1105
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:05,607
- [Lasers Blasting]
- Go, go, go, go!

1106
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:08,944
We-We gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1107
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,114
Listen.
I'll go in.

1108
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,867
I'll create a distraction.
I've got this. I'm okay.

1109
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,786
I'm gonna be able to hold him back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1110
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,331
- That's suicide.
- I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.

1111
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:25,294
I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1112
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:29,464
Guy, Guy, maybe you're
the plucky comic relief.

1113
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:31,466
You ever think about that?

1114
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,636
- Plucky?
- Oh, besides,

1115
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,182
I just had this
really interesting idea.

1116
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,309
Are you stoned?

1117
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:43,478
Gotta get her up
and give them some time.

1118
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:46,481
- [Grunting]
- Sir, perhaps together...

1119
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:49,860
the Mak'tar chant of strength:
Larak tarath.

1120
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:52,988
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1121
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:57,409
[Together] Larak tarath, larak tarath,
larak tarath, larack tarath.

1122
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,504
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

1123
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:12,633
You wanna take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1124
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:14,510
"The chompers"?

1125
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:23,185
- Well, screw that.
- How are we supposed to get through this?

1126
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:25,354
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

1127
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,689
Okay, the sequence is...

1128
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,526
two-two-four-two...

1129
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:33,695
What is this thing?
I mean, it serves no useful purpose...

1130
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,199
for there to be a bunch of chompy, crushy things
in the middle of a hallway!

1131
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:41,245
We shouldn't have to do this.
It makes no sense! Why is it here?

1132
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:44,039
- 'Cause it's on the television show.
- Well, forget it!

1133
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,543
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1134
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,878
Okay, Commander, now, as soon
as the first crusher hits you...

1135
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,922
- [Screaming]
- It just did!

1136
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,216
- Okay, go now.
- Go! - [Screaming]

1137
01:17:54,299 --> 01:17:57,261
Go! Stop!

1138
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,347
Go!
Wait a minute.

1139
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,225
Come on, come on, come on.

1140
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:07,437
Go! Go!

1141
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:09,439
Go! Go!

1142
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:12,442
- Go!
- Stop, stop. Go!

1143
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:14,444
- Stop!
- [Screaming]

1144
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,905
Jump, Commander, jump!

1145
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:20,659
Whoever wrote this episode
should die!

1146
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:24,371
This should be interesting.

1147
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,457
[Beeping]

1148
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:31,336

It's the simple things in life
you treasure.

1152
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,814
That's great.

1153
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,486
Now, we better get...

1154
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,868
Get a room, guys.

1155
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:07,164
Whoa!

1156
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,377
Hey, Fred.

1157
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:17,007
Hey, Fred, uh...

1158
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:23,472
Oh, that's not right.
Oh!

1159
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,753
Sir, the pressure...
it's normalizing.

1160
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:58,423
All right!

1161
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:02,803
We are saved.

1162
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:04,847
He has saved us.

1163
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:08,642
Commander Taggart has saved us!

1164
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:10,644
[All Cheering]

1165
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:15,691
It's just not fair.

1166
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,613
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the commander.

1167
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,907
[Laser Blast]

[Groaning]

01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:46,680
- Quellek?
- [Panting]

1171
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:52,978
That's not too bad.

1172
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:56,398
We'll get you to the medical quarters,
and you'll be fine.

1173
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,484
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.

1174
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:03,447
I have been blessed, sir.
I-l...

1175
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,616
Don't speak, Quellek.

1176
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:12,497
You'll forgive
my impertinence, sir,

1177
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:14,958
but even though
we had never before met,

1178
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,962
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1179
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:24,510
Quellek.

1180
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:28,305
By Grabthar's hammer,

1181
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:31,683
by the sons of Warvan,

1182
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:37,022
you shall be avenged.

17, 18, 19!

1185
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:21,733
- All right, Brandon, how do we shut this thing down?
- Okay, just push the blue button.

1186
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:24,319
- The blue button... is that it?
- Yeah, why? What's wrong?

1187
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:27,406
Nothing. I just thought it'd be
more complicated than that.

1188
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:33,036
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.

1189
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:45,716
Brandon, it's not working.
Brandon!

1190
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:50,470
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity...

1191
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:54,057
- of the commander's predicament.
- Don't forget the recyclables!

1192
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:58,103
Core implosion estimated
in ten seconds.

1193
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:01,356
- Nine, eight,
- Gwen, I...

- seven, six,
- I've always...

- five, four,
- Jason, oh, Jason.

1196
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,239
Three, two, one.

1197
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:22,419
- It always stops at one on the show.
- [Laughing]

1198
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,671
Um, what were you saying?

1199
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,673
- Sir!
- What?

1200
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:29,009
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.

1201
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,303
Impossible!
Impossible!

1202
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:35,933
Lock a complement of implosion missiles
under the Protector.

1203
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:39,728
Tear her apart.

1204
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,730
[Lasers Blasting]

1205

listen to me. It's okay, it's okay.

1206
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:56,370
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.

1207
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:58,372
[Screaming]

1208
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:01,041
We need that armor back up!

1209
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:05,754
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armor: engaged.

1210
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,172
[Rumbling]

1211
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:09,383
All right, Tommy, see if you can
lose 'em in that mine field.

1212
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:12,177
- M-Mine field?
- Pedal to the medal, right now!

1213
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:14,346
- Pedal to the medal!
- All right, let's go!

1214
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,775
Good going, Tommy.
Great going.

1215
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,278
Thrust ahead... full!

1216
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:33,031
Into the field!
Go!

1217
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:42,791
- Tommy, can you get us closer to these mines?
- Closer?

1218
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:48,881
I could try.

1219
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:57,472
General, I've lost them.

1220
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:01,935
The magnetism of the mine field
is disrupting our instruments.

1221
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:05,189
Wait!
I see something.

1222
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:08,567
Yes. Yes!
There they are.

1223
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:11,320
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1224
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:15,199
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1225
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:17,576
Fire at will.

1226
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:26,168
Whoo! We're getting hammered,
Jason! Return fire?

1227
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:29,046
No! Divert all energy
to the armor!

1228
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,423
How adorable...

1229
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:34,384
the actors are going
to play war with me.

1230
01:25:34,468 --> 01:25:39,264
- Sarris' ship, accelerating toward us at mark 2.
- Accelerate to mark 4.

1231
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:47,189
Let me remind you, sonny:

1232
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,691
I am a general.

1233
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:52,778
If you are counting on me
to blink,

1234
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:56,615
then you are making
a deadly mistake.

1235
01:25:56,698 --> 01:26:00,202
Well, let me tell you
something, Sarris.

1236
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:05,165
It doesn't take a great actor to
recognize a bad one. You're sweating.

1237
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:07,584
Armor almost gone, Jason!

1238
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:12,798
You fool! You failed to realize
that with your armor gone,

1239
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:17,427
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1240
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:22,599
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.

1241
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:27,771
Oh, no!
Turn, turn!

1242
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:45,831
- We did it!
- [Cheering]

1243
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:49,501
Yes! Yes!

1244

- Yes! [Laughing]
- [Cheering Continues]

1245
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:55,132
Yes! Yes!

1246

- [Mumbling]
- Mathesar!

1247
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:06,810
- Oh, my God, you're alive.
- [Groaning]

1248
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:11,732
- Come here.
- The ship was a model as big as this.

1249
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:14,359
A very clever deception indeed.

1250

[Cheering]

1252
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:25,871
Set a course
for home, Commander?

1253
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,957
- Can you do that?
- Oh, yeah, just point and click.

1254
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:32,002
- But we're gonna have to go through the black hole.
- Any objections?

1255
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:34,004
[All Scoffing]

1256
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:37,007
All right, set her up.

1257
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:42,221
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1258
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:47,142
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1259
01:27:47,226 --> 01:27:51,188
M-My people
have no commander.

1260
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:54,191
[Sighing]
Mathesar, I think your people...

1261
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:57,152
have a great commander.

1262
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:04,201
[Whimpering]

1263
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:09,540
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.

1264
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:27,891
- We're out!
- We're going home.

1265
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:32,104
- Systems register functional.
- All systems are working, Commander.

1266
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:36,608
Jason, before the black hole, there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1267
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:40,779
Let's not worry about that right now, Alexander.
Fred, what are you doing up here?

1268
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:45,617
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we Dec...
Hey, you can put an eye out with that thing.

1269
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:50,414

Mathesar! Activate
the Omega 13!

1273
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:03,946
- We're out!
- We're going home!

All systems are working,
Commander.

1276
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:13,872
Jason, before the black hole, there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1277
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:19,878
[Gwen] Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1278
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,882
Let go of me. Let...
It's not Fred.

1279
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:27,886
That's Sarris. Listen to me.
I'm telling you, that's not Fred, that's Sarris.

1280
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,389
He's gonna try to kill
all of us.

Jason. Jason!
I can't slow it down!

1284
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:48,949
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.

1285
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:51,702
We need to separate,
or we'll die.

1286
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,917
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar.

1287
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:00,961
Thank you.

1288

Good-bye, my friends.

1291
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:21,815
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

On, Teb, on!

1293
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,770
This is the third day
of the Galaxy Con,

1294
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:04,107
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,

1295
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:07,194
much to the disappointment
of all these fans, knows as Questoids.

1296
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:10,781
- Bye. Be back soon.
- Wait a minute. Where you going with those fireworks?

1297
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:14,868
Well, the Protector got super accelerated
coming out of the black hole,

1298
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:17,287
and it nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

1299
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:20,207
which, you guys know,
is pretty unstable obviously,

1300
01:32:20,249 --> 01:32:23,544
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it
on the vox ultra-frequency carrier...

1301
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:26,046
and use Roman candles
for visual confirmation.

1302
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:28,841
A-All right,
dinner's at 7:00.
