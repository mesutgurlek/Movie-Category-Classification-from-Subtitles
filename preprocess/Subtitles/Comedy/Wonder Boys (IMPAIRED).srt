Well, that's--
That's very surprising.

156
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:39,416
Does Walter know that, uh--

157
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,924
I think Walter would find this
a little more than surprising.

158
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:55,727
Emily left me this morning.

159
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,897
She's left before.

160
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:01,409
She's left the room before,
but she's always come back.

161
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,148
So.

162
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:11,780
I guess we just divorce
our spouses, marry each other...

163
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:14,448
and have this baby, right?

164
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,457
Simple.

165
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,857
Yeah, right. Simple.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,498
Is that Cristalle?

167
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,037
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, God.

168
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,632
I wear the same scent
as a transvestite.

169
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,643
She is a transvestite,
isn't she?

170
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:38,373
If she's not now,
Terry'll make sure she is...

171
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,438
by the end of the evening.

172
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,144
Has he asked you
about the book yet?

173
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,243
Yes.

174
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,254
And?

175
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,457
Are you gonna tell him?

176
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:56,726
No. Maybe. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

177
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,495
Me either.

178

- [ Sniffing ]
- [Man ]DiMaggio 's record...

179
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,537
for hits in consecutive games...

180
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,835
is probably the most impressive
feat in all of sports...

181
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:07,933
and in my opinion,
will never be broken.

182
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,808
- Come here, big guy.
- His condition's so sad.

183

Yes, but even blind,
he still gets around.

184
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,810
[Narrating]
I don't drink normally...

185
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,480
but this was turning out to be
one fucked-up day.

186
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,788
And now I found myself in close
proximity to Sara 's husband...

187
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,385
and his dog, Poe.

188
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,023
-Walter, I see you've met my friend.
-Oh, yes. She's charming.

189
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,499
Despite his much-vaunted
Harvard education...

190
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,299
Dr. Walter Gaskell didn't have
a clue about his wife and me.

191
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,169
Simply put, Di Maggio represented--
metaphorically speaking, of course--

192
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,175
the husband as slugger.

193
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,711
[Narrating]Poe had been
on to me since day one.

194
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,339
- [ Poe Growling ]
- In fact, I personally believe...

195
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:50,909
that every woman in some way
desires to be Marilyn Monroe.

196
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,420
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

197

[Man ] I've had a lot
of successes over the years.

[Narrating]
Q. Q was rich.

199
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,230
Q was famous.

200
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,061
Q completed a novel
every 18 months.

201
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,102

...finest work vanished
in less than five.

203
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:12,269
So I find myself conflicted.

204
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:15,868
Ask him if he's conflicted
about his house in the Hamptons.

00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,913
- Grady.
- Well, Professor.

Q. for your information...

207
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,214
Hannah already has
two stories published...

208
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,687
in The Paris Review, so you
better dust off your "A " material.

209
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,986
You didn't tell me
you were a writer.

210
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,548
You didn't ask.

211

[Man ]How did you feel
about the adaptation?

212
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,654
I thought it was more literary
than cinematic.

on my graduate-studies syllabus
three years running.

217
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,572
No wonder it's still in print.

[ Woman ]Long time since
Arsonist's Daughter.

[ Walter]
There you are.

220
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:15,626
I could have sworn I had a bottle
of 1975 Lafite Rothschild for Q.

221
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:17,695
Given that he's going to be
addressing 500 people...

226
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,006
It's fake.
It was my mother's.

227
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:55,009
She won it in a penny arcade
in Baltimore...

228
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,136
when she went
to Catholic school.

229
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:01,009
Well, that's very convincing.

230
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,847
I used to shoot
these little paper caps...

231

but they don't make them anymore,
the caps.

232
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:10,118
It's just for good luck, you know?
Some people carry rabbit's feet.

233
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,683
You carry firearms.

234
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,556
No, thank you. I don't like
to lose control of my emotions.

235

I'm not supposed to be here,
in case you're wondering.

But the other night I was out
with Hannah at the movies...

237
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:30,670
and she asked me since she was
coming, so I ended up coming too.

238
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,907
You and, uh, Hannah,
you're seeing each other?

I just rent her a room.

that's all.

- What's the movie you guys saw?
- Son of Fury...

00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,693
with Tyrone Power
and Frances Farmer.

244

She went crazy,

So did Gene Tierney.
She's in it too.

I thought I'd come outside and take
a look at it. It looks like heaven.

Sara, you don 't understand.

Probably not, but I have
something to say.

929
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:04,304
And I want you
to listen carefully, Grady.

Yes.

01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:10,137
I can't wait for you
because if I do...

932
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:13,238
I could end up
waiting forever, so...

933
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:17,149
I'm going to make
this decision on my own.

Hello. Hi.

01:01:38,307 --> 01:01:41,276
-Ow.
-It's infected. I can clean it up.

942
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:43,277
But then you need to see someone
who knows what he's doing.

943
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:46,371
Ho w would you like
some hot chocolate...

944
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:48,882
and fresh cookies to go with it?

[James] I'm working in a steel
mill while I finish my first novel.

953
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:15,476
So where's Emily, Hank?

954
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:19,742
I don't know if I should
tell you that, Grady.

955
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:22,306
I don't wanna stalk her.
I just wanna--

956
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:24,614
I wanna tell her
that I'm sorry.

957
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,678
I'm not trying
to get her back.

958
01:02:26,755 --> 01:02:29,451
Things haven't been
right with us for a while.

959
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:33,461
Well, all I know is Emily felt
you weren't there for her...

960
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:36,987
and she's felt that
for a long time, Grady.

961
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:39,034
Right now, she's, uh--

962
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:42,036
She's in Philadelphia
visiting Linda Ashby.

963
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,570
For Christ's sakes,
they went to Wellesley together.

964
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:49,941
Linda spent a week
at your house--

965
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:52,947
- Oh, Linda! Oh, oh.
- Yes.

966
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:56,617
I haven't been sleeping
a whole lot lately...

967
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,778
and I got my editor in town.

968
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:00,981
- I'm trying to finish my book.
- Ah, right.

969
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:03,286
The book.

970
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:08,960
I hope it's really good, Grady.

971
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:18,829
I'm having a really good time,
Prof. Tripp.

I'm really happy for you,
James.

973
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:29,309
Do me a favor.
Lay off my dope.

That stuff's
not for amateurs.

975
01:03:33,222 --> 01:03:35,747
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

976
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:39,157
You're mad because
I shot your girlfriend's dog.

977
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:41,696
It wasn't her dog.
It was her husband's.

978
01:03:41,764 --> 01:03:44,324
Who said anything
about a girlfriend?

979
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:49,765
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't
shot my girlfriend's dog...

980
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:52,864
Even though Poe and I were not
exactly what you call simpatico...

981
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:55,535
that's no reason he should've
taken two in the chest.

982
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:58,444
I don't know.

983
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:03,349
You just keep acting like
a goddamn spook all the time, James.

984
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:07,014
Well, I guess that explains why
all the kids in workshop hate me.

985
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:10,684
All the kids in workshop
hate you because right now...

986
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:13,626
you're ten times the writer
any one of them will ever be.

987
01:04:13,695 --> 01:04:15,595
My stuff stinks.

988
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:19,532
You said so yourself last night
to your friend Crabtree.

989
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:22,126
I didn't mean it like that.

990
01:04:22,204 --> 01:04:24,138
And what does it matter
what I think?

991
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:26,572
I mean, what does it matter
what anybody thinks?

992
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:29,042
Most people don't think,
James.

993
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:31,545
And if they do,
it's not about writing.

994
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:35,942
Books.
They don't mean anything.

995
01:04:36,018 --> 01:04:38,213
Not to anybody.

996
01:04:39,855 --> 01:04:41,789
Not anymore.

997
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:45,088
Arsonist's Daughter
meant something.

998
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:48,062
It meant something to me.

999
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:51,531
It 's the reason
I came to school here.

1000
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,569
To be taught by you.

1001
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:59,596
It's one of the reasons
I wanted to become a writer.

1002
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:06,412
Well, for that, James,
if nothing else...

1003
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:09,280
I'm really sorry.

1004
01:05:17,092 --> 01:05:20,186
- What are we doing?
- I'm gonna get you a nice meal...

1005
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:23,459
a couple of cups of coffee,
then I'm taking you home.

1006
01:05:23,532 --> 01:05:25,932
- Take me now.
- What?

1007
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:28,435
- I'm not hungry.
-James, you gotta eat.

1008
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:30,836
I'll get something
out of the vending machine.

1009
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:32,806
Vending machine?
What are you talking about?

1010
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:36,367
At the bus station,
they have these cheese sandwiches.

1011
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:38,606
They're pretty good.
It's better if you take me now.

1012
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,623
That way,
Carl won't get my spot.

1013
01:05:40,757 --> 01:05:44,625
Carl?

1014
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:48,528
-Never mind.
-James, go get us a table, will ya?

1015
01:05:48,598 --> 01:05:51,590
I'm not letting the most
talented writer in my class...

1016
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,158
eat some week-old
cheese sandwich, okay?

1017
01:05:55,738 --> 01:05:58,332
I'm not letting him sleep
on some bench in a bus station.

1018
01:05:58,407 --> 01:06:01,433
So go on inside. I'll--
I'll be there in a minute.

It's outside of Scranton.

Okay, well--

1023
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:21,928
Lady, as we speak, I am looking at
a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania.

1024
01:06:21,998 --> 01:06:23,932
I'm sure he'd be
pretty interested to learn...

1025
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,991
that the good people
at Bell Atlantic...

1026
01:06:26,068 --> 01:06:28,366
have misplaced
his entire hometown.

1027
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,735
It's not like
I'm making this up as we go--

1028
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:36,343
Never mind.
It's my mistake.

- You want a bite?
- No, thanks.

1031
01:07:03,105 --> 01:07:06,563
That's why you're having them,
your spells.

1032
01:07:06,642 --> 01:07:09,167
Spells? Jesus, James...

1033
01:07:09,245 --> 01:07:11,577
you make it sound like we're in
a Tennessee Williams play.

1034
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:14,172
I don't get spells.

1035
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,184
What would you
call them then?

1036
01:07:16,252 --> 01:07:19,688
I don't know. Um--
Episodes.

1037
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:23,316
Uh-huh. I just worry about you,
that's all.

1038
01:07:29,232 --> 01:07:31,700
You just worry
about yourself, okay?

1039
01:07:33,102 --> 01:07:35,002
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

1040
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:38,734
You just stay here and eat.
I'll be right back.

1041
01:07:44,914 --> 01:07:46,848
Good evening.

- Grady.

Fred Leer.
This is my wife Amanda.

1044
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:54,615
Well, looks like I dashed
a wonderful evening here.

1045
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,488
We were on our way to a benefit,
but as luck would have it...

1046
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,290
the club was on the way, so we
were able to put in an appearance.

1047
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:03,161
I just thought it would be
good for James...

1048
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:05,427
to be with his family
this weekend.

1049
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:09,733
Oh, well--
Of course we can understand that.

1050
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:16,611
Right. Okay, I guess, uh,
I'll go get James.

1051
01:08:18,814 --> 01:08:21,408
Um--

1052
01:08:21,484 --> 01:08:25,443
I hope you don't find this forward ,
Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask.

1053
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:28,285
Did you ever go
to Catholic school?

1054
01:08:30,426 --> 01:08:32,917
Excuse me?

1055
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:34,724
I'm not going with them.

1056
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:36,788
Things are a little weird
for me right now, James.

1057
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,834
Things are a little weird
for me right now too.

1058
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:41,426
I know, but I got my editor
in town, I gotta finish my book...

1059
01:08:41,504 --> 01:08:43,165
and there's some
extenuating circumstances--

1060
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:44,900
I won't bother you.
I won't even talk to you.

1061
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:46,942
Like it or not, those people
out there are your parents.

1062
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:50,968
- They're not my parents.
- What?

1063
01:08:51,047 --> 01:08:53,413
They're my grandparents.
My parents are dead.

1064
01:08:56,552 --> 01:09:00,010
James, the man is obviously
your father. You look just like him.

1065
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,854
There's a reason for that.

1066
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:07,657
- Oh, get out of here.
- No. That's why she hates me.

1067
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,994
That's why she makes me
sleep in the basement.

1068
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:13,467
Crawl space. With the rats and
the cask of amontillado, right?

1069
01:09:13,536 --> 01:09:15,265
It's true!
They treat me like a freak!

1070
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:18,102
Well, you are a freak, James.
All right? Welcome to the club.

1071
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:20,699
You don't understand.
You don't know what it's like.

1072
01:09:20,776 --> 01:09:21,936
You're right, I don't.
