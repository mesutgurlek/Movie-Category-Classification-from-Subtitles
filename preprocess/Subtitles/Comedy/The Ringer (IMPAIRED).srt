Um, and, um,
did I tell you I got a watch?

My aunt sent it to me.
Not my aunt Helen, my aunt Ruth.

this huge wave comes
and sweeps the boy out to sea.

- So he's out there thrashing-
- Honey.

590
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,187
That's not really appropriate.

<i>Right?</i>
<i>Hey, I have one.</i>

It's really funny,
and it's appropriate for everyone.

00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,429
All righty.
And for you?

604
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,232
- Um, I'll have the ribs.
<i>- [David] Ribs?</i>

605

Uh, hold on there, cowboy.
That could get kind of messy.

606

Do you have anything else
that's a little cleaner?

607

some really good chicken fingers.

No, no, no.
He can handle the ribs. Have the ribs.

609
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,544

Ribs.

611
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,786
So, I was workin'
in this Baskin-Robbins one summer.

612
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,385
Jeffy found a $20 bill in the john.

613
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:15,398
<i>And I was happy.</i>
<i>You know, really happy.</i>

614
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,394
'Cause this is the first time
that Jeffy ever caught a break.

615
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:21,897
[Grunts]
Here, fishies.

616
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,741
But then I came to find out
I had a hole in my pocket.

617

I was actually talking about Yolie.
But thanks, Jeffy.

So how is everything?
Looks like you did a number on those ribs there.

Jeffy drank Coke wrong and spill on David.

<i>What happened was that...</i>

675
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,816
I work with this guy named Stavi...

00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,357
and I was sent to fire him,
and I couldn't.

677
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,328
And that's how I got here.

00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,861
- What?
- Do you know what he's talking about?

679
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:13,360
- I'm baffled, Jeffy.
- It's not Jeffy. It's Steve.

I thought you said
your name was Stavi.

683
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,847
No.
I'm Steve, not Stavi.

684
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,851
- Just get your story straight.
- Stavi lost his fingers.

685
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:32,878
<i>Does he have insurance?</i>
<i>Medicare, Medicaid or...</i>

686
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,992
No, he doesn't have
Medicare, Medicaid or "Aflac."

687
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:36,726
That's why I'm in this position.

Stavi worked for me, all right?
And he lost his fingers.

691
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:49,271
So, in summation-

692
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,274
Hey, Rudy, come on.
Stick with me here.

693

Okay, okay.
Wrap it up.

694
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,516
Stavi is the guy
who lost his fingers...

695
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:06,682
and I needed money
so I could get 'em sewn back on.

696
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:07,668

apologize to David now.

<i>Come on, Billy.</i>
<i>You're phoning it in.</i>

1373
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:15,305
Look, I told you-Jackie Gleason
didn't rehearse, and neither do I.

1374
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:16,909
You scratched my CD, you know.

1375
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,979
You picked it up in clear daylight
and you scratched it.

1376
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,848
Yeah, I know. But I thought
we put that behind us.

1377
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,683
Now, come on, Billy.
Let's do it. From the top.

1378
01:25:24,485 --> 01:25:26,510
Keep your pants on, Spielberg.

1379
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,454
Thanks for springin' for lunch.

1380
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:31,986
Next time we'll go Danish
and split it 60-60.

1381
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:33,794
Don't you mean 50-50?

1382
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,989
- What, you don't tip?
- [Laughs]

1383
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:41,167
I'm so glad you called. I missed you.
It's great to catch up.

1384
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:45,938
Yeah. Good times.

1385
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:51,141
Listen, you wanna come in
and meet some of the fellas I work with?

1386
01:25:50,777 --> 01:25:51,176
- They're a hoot.
- Sure.

1387
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:54,474
Come on, Billy.
From the top.

1388
01:25:54,509 --> 01:25:55,815
Okay.

1389
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:59,051
But soft! What light-

1390
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:02,145
Could you fix the lighting, please?

1391
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:06,118
What?

1392
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:09,729
<i>[Billy]</i>

<i>My throat is parched.</i>

Evian or tap water?

<i>- Oh!</i>
- You okay, Mr. Stevie?

1402
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:34,687
How many fingers do you see?

1403
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,123
Do you need a medic?

1404
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,888
He probably needs
mouth-to-mouth, Lynn.

1405
01:26:39,923 --> 01:26:40,293
I'll do it!

1406
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,023
I'm good!
I'm fine!

1407
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:44,359
- Come on, baby.
- Mr. Clumsy.

1408
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,894
- Are you sure you're okay?
<i>- I- I'm fine.</i>

1409
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,565
Broke the fall with my forehead.

<i>Steve gave us all jobs.</i>

1411
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:55,275
Isn't that wonderfully nice, Lynn?

1412
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,201
One could almost say Christ-like.

1413
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,144
Yeah.

1414
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:04,581
I'm starting to feel like
you guys are playing me.

1415
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,913

<i>- It's true, Lynn.</i>

01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,891
He's totally ignorant.

1417
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:14,292
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Winston.

1418
01:27:15,696 --> 01:27:18,597
Guys, can we be alone
for a few moments?

1419
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,539
<i>- [Glen] No problem.</i>
- Sure.

1420
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,741
[Thomas]
Eye contact.

1421
01:27:35,776 --> 01:27:37,079
Come on.

1422
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,556
Lynn, you have no idea
how sorry I am.

1423
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:45,049
It's okay.
I forgive you.

1424
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:48,443
- You do?
- I didn't, at first, but I forgive you.

1425
01:27:48,478 --> 01:27:51,328
Oh, you saw the thing
on <i>20/20,</i> and you-

- I tell.
- Stavi?

1428
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,340
I told her everything-

1429
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:06,103
how you got me the job, how you scammed
the system so I could get my fingers back.

1430
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,488
And how you secretly
want to marry her.

Yeah. I'd like that.

than the box office. You save some money.

But soft!

1441
01:29:08,175 --> 01:29:11,201
What light through
yonder window breaks?

1442
01:29:11,236 --> 01:29:12,502
It is the east...

1443

and Juliet is the sun.
