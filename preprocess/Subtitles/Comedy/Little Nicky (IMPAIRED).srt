LOOK IN MY FACE,
STARE IN MY SOUL

2430
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,919
LOOK IN MY FACE,
STARE IN MY SOUL

2431
01:26:15,919 --> 01:26:17,922
LOOK IN MY FACE

2432
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,923
LOOK IN MY FACE

2433
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:22,927
LOOK IN MY FACE

2434
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,427
I BEGIN TO STUPIFY

2435
01:26:24,427 --> 01:26:24,427
I BEGIN TO STUPIFY

2436
01:26:40,443 --> 01:26:44,947
I'VE WATCHED YOU CHANGE

2437
01:26:44,947 --> 01:26:44,947
I'VE WATCHED YOU CHANGE

2438
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:52,455
INTO A FLY

2439
01:26:52,455 --> 01:26:52,455
INTO A FLY

2440
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:58,463
I LOOKED AWAY

2441
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:58,963
I LOOKED AWAY

2442
01:26:59,963 --> 01:27:03,967
YOU WERE ON FIRE

2443
01:27:03,967 --> 01:27:03,967
YOU WERE ON FIRE

2444
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:09,974
I WATCHED A CHANGE

2445
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:12,475
IN YOU

2446
01:27:12,975 --> 01:27:19,983
IT'S LIKE
YOU NEVER HAD WINGS

2447
01:27:19,983 --> 01:27:23,487
NOW YOU FEEL

2448
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:26,491
SO ALIVE

2449
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:31,495
I'VE WATCHED YOU CHANGE

2450
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:31,495
I'VE WATCHED YOU CHANGE

2451
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:38,503
IT'S LIKE
YOU NEVER HAD WINGS

2452
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,507
AH--AH--AH

I TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO STAND

2460
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:00,584
I TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO STAND

2461
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:05,088
WHEN THE WORMS
ARE TALKING LOUD

2462
01:29:05,588 --> 01:29:05,588
WHEN THE WORMS
ARE TALKING LOUD

2463
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:10,092
SOBBING BULLS
LAY DOWN AND SCREAM

2464
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:10,595
SOBBING BULLS
LAY DOWN AND SCREAM

2465
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,599
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M BREAKING MY VOWS

2466
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:14,599
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M BREAKING MY VOWS

2467
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,604
OH, NO

2468
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,604
ALWAYS IGNORED

2469
01:29:22,104 --> 01:29:22,104
ALWAYS IGNORED

2470
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,112
THOUGHT AFTER ALL
THAT I'D BE RICH

2471
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,112
THOUGHT AFTER ALL
THAT I'D BE RICH

2472
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:36,120
I MUST SAY I'VE NEVER
BEEN TO MEDITATE

2473
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,624
THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT I WON'T NEED

2474
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:39,624
THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT I WON'T NEED

2475
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:44,128
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I HESITATE

2476
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:44,128
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I HESITATE

2477
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:49,133
WHAT FOR?

2478
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,136
BEING BORED

2479
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,020
OH, NO
