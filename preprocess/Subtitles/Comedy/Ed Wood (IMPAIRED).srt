1
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,788
Greetings, my friend.

2
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,997
You are interested
in the unknown...

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,550
the mysterious,
the unexplainable.

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,393
That is why you are here.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,630
And now,
for the first time...

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,076
we are bringing you the full story
of what happened.

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
We are giving you
all the evidence...

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,997
based only on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls...

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,516
who survived this
terrifying ordeal.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,398
The incidents, places...

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,916
My friend, we cannot keep this
a secret any longer.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,878
Can your heart stand
the shocking facts...

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,791
of the true story...

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,917
of Edward D. Wood,Jr.?

15
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,196
It's 8:1 5. We can't hold
the curtain any longer.

16
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,317
Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?
It's press night and there's no press!

17
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,877
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nah, Tommy.

18
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,791
That's just kiddie
spook stories.

19
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,714
Once you're dead,
you stay dead.

20
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,631
I don't know, Bill.

21
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,395
Out on that battlefield today,
I saw this woman dressed in white...

22
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,948
floating above the dunes.

23
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,272
Maybe it was just fatigue or maybe
it's the indignities of war.

24
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,351
Or maybe it's
somethin'else.

25
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,238
Hey, I think
I see somethin'.

26
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,629
[pulley Squeaking]

27
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,914
I offer you mortals
the bird of peace...

28
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,468
so that you may change
your ways...

29
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,869
and end this destruction.

30
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,388
[Squeaking Resumes]

31
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,511
What a show!
Everyone was terrifiic.

32
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,398
Paul, your second act monologue
actually gave me the chills.

33
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,392
- Oh, thanks, Eddie.
- I got the early edition,
hot off the presses!

34
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,311
This is the big moment.

35
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,158
- [Exhales]
- Oh, what does that old queen know?

36
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,071
She didn't even show.

37
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,028
Sent her copy boy
to do the dirty work.

38
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,638
- Sc-rew you, Miss Crowley.
- Do I really have a face like a horse?

39
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,790
What does "ostentatious" mean?

40
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,269
Hey, it's not that bad. You can't
concentrate on the negative.

41
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,430
Look, he's got some
nice things to say here.

42
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,159
"The soldiers' costumes
are very realistic." That's positive!

43
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,516
- Rave of the century.
- Well, I've seen a lot worse reviews.

44
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,558
I've seen reviews where they didn't
even mention the costumes.

45
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,438
Like that last Francis the Mule picture.
It got terrible notices.

46
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,351
- Huge hit!
- Lines around the block.

47
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,035
That's right. Don't take it too
seriously. We're all doing great work.

48
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,315
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

49
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,109
- [Thunderclap]
- Honey, what if I'm wrong?

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,273
- What if I just don't got it?
- Ed, it was only one review.

51
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,955
Orson Welles was only 26
when he made Citizen Kane.

52
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,871
I'm already 30.

53
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,389
Ed, you're still young.

54
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,153
This is the time in your life when
you're supposed to be struggling.

55
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,233
I know. But I'm scared it's not going
to get any better than this.

56
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,835
Oh, I hate having
to wake up this early.

57
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,155
Gosh, where's
my pink sweater?

58
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,114
I can never seem to find
my clothes any more.

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,873
Hey, big shot! Get off your ass and get
this over to the executive building.

60
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,033
- Sure thing, Mr Kravitz.
- Hey, Charlie, come here.

61
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,237
What did I tell ya about watering these
plants, eh? I want some water on 'em!

62
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,959
Don't sprinkle the damn things!
Soak 'em!

63
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,996
Hi.

64
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,958
[Man] All right, people, settle.
And... action!

65
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
Wow!
Look at these camels!

66
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,791
These are real camels!

67
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,277
- Gosh, where'd they get real camels?
- Hey, you!

68
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,828
Move it outta here, huh?

69
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,870
Hey, Eddie! Come in here.
I got some great new stuff to show you.

70
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,669
This is fantastic.
What are you gonna do with it?

71
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,548
- Probably file it away
and never see it again.
- Ah, it's such a waste.

72
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,311
Why, if I had half the chance,
I could make an entire movie
using this stock footage.

73
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,796
The story opens on these
mysterious explosions.

74
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,838
Nobody knows what's causing them,
but it's upsetting all the buffalo.

75
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,718
So the military are called in
to solve the mystery.

76
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,554
- You forgot the octopus.
- No, no. I'm saving that
for my big underwater climax.

78
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,473
- [Ringing]
- Hello.

79
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,358
[Woman] They say he was a girl
trapped in a man's body.

80
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,035
- I bet it hurt when
they cut his thing off.
- Ugh!

What are you ladies
gabbin' about?

You know that Christine Jorgensen freak?
He... She... It's in Variety.

83
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,634
Some producer's
makin' a biopic.

84
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,154
Really? I didn't
read that story.

85
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,477
Yes, I've got
Mr Edward Wood on the line.

86
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,391
Could you please hold?

87
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,517
Mr Weiss?
Ed Wood here.

88
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,673
Listen, I heard about your
new project and I was curious
if you'd signed a director yet.

89
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,591
Oh, you haven't!

90
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,989
Well, if we could get together,
I could explain to you...

91
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,834
why I'm more qualified to direct
this than anyone else in town.

92
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,629
Well, I'd rather not
go into that over the phone.

93
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,790
All right.
Great!

94
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,553
I'll see you then.
Bye!

95
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,676
Eddie, I don't understand.

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,991
Why are you the most qualified director
for the Christine Jorgensen story?

97
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,594
Oh, it's just hogwash, hon.
I had to get into the door somehow.

No, no, no. No, no, no.
That's a fialsehood!

Come in!

104
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,959
Look, when I said you could
have the western territories,
I didn't mean all 1 1 states!

105
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,669
I meant California, Oregon,
and what's that one on top?

106
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,591
Washington, yeah, yeah!

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,757
Well, screw you!

109
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,513
Hi. Can I help you?

110
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,512
Yes. I'm Ed Wood.
I'm here about directing the
Christine Jorgensen picture.

111
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
[Chuckling]
Well, a couple of things have changed.

112
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,595
It ain't gonna be the
Christine Jorgensen story no more.

113
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,752
Goddam Variety had to print
the story before I got the rights.

114
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,274
- Now that bitch is asking for the sky.
- Ah, you're not gonna make the movie.

115
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,388
No, of course I'm gonna make
the picture. I already presold
Alabama and Oklahoma.

116
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,552
Those repressed Okies, they go for
that twisted, perverted stuff.

117
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,438
We'll just do it without the she-male.
We'll fictionalize it.

118
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,638
- Is there a script?
- Fuck no. But, there's a poster.

119
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,953
It opens in nine weeks
in Tulsa.

120
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,315
Well, Mr Weiss, look no further.
I'm your man.

121
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,154
I work fast and I'm a deal.
I write and direct. And I'm good.

122
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,869
I just did a play in Hollywood
and Victor Crowley himself
praised its realism.

123
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,713
There's about 500 guys in this town
that can say the same thing.

124
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,076
On the phone you said you had
some special qualifications?

125
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,111
Mr Weiss...

126
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,390
I have never told anyone...

127
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,550
what I'm about to tell you.

128
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,949
But I really want
this job.

129
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,229
I like to dress
in women's clothing.

130
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,510
You're a fruit?

131
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,752
No, not at all. I love women.
Wearing their clothes makes me
feel closer to them.

132
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,515
- You're not a fruit.
- No, I'm all man.
I even fought in W.W. Two.

133
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,592
Of course, I was wearing women's
undergarments under my uniform.

134
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,148
Ya got to be kidding me.

135
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,993
Confidentially, I even paratrooped
wearing a brassiere and panties.

136
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,878
I tell ya, I wasn't scared
of being killed, but I was
terrified of getting wounded...

137
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,599
and having the medics
discover my secret.

138
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,355
- So you think this qualifies you
to make my movie?
- Yes!

139
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,318
I know what it's like
to live with a secret...

140
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,676
and worry about what people
are gonna think of ya.

141
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,752
My girlfriend still doesn't know why
her sweaters are always stretched out.

142
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,710
Ed, you seem like a nice kid.
Look around you.

143
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,270
I don't hire directors with burning
desires to tell their stories.

144
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,271
I make movies
like Chained Girls.

145
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,955
I need someone with experience
who can shoot a film in four
days and make me a profit.

146
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,508
I'm sorry.
That's all that matters.

147
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,229
Can I get you
anything else, kid?

148
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,670
Too constrictive!
I can't even fold my arms.

149
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,955
Gee, Mr Lugosi,
I've never had any complaints.

150
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,157
This is the most uncomfortable coffin
I've ever been in.

151
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,789
Your selection is quite shoddy.
You're wasting my time!

152
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,638
- Mr Lugosi?
- I told you I don't want any
of your goddam coffins!

153
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,029
No, no!
I don't work here.

154
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,078
- Then who are you? What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

155
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,915
- I'm just a really big, big fan.
I've seen all your movies.
- [Scoffs]

156
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,435
-Mr Lugosi, why are you buying a coffin?
-I'm planning on dying soon.

157
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,115
- No!
- Yes! I'm embarking on another
bus and truck tour of Dracula.

158
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,998
Twelve cities in ten days,
if that's conceivable.

159
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,516
Do you know that I saw you perform
Dracula in Poughkeepsie in 1 938?

160
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,832
- That was a terrible production.
Renfield was a drunk!
- I thought it was great.

161
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,196
You know, you're much scarier
in real life than you are in the movie.

162
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,111
Thank you.

163
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,668
I even waited outside to get your
autograph, but you never came out.

164
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,718
Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.

165
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,109
It takes me much time
to reemerge.

166
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,716
Oh, there's my bus.
Shit, where is my transfer?

167
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,598
- Say, don't you have a car?
- I refuse to drive in this country.

168
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,511
Too many madmen.

169
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,675
I've got a car.

170
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,069
[Engine Knocking]

171
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,037
Boy, Mr Lugosi, you must lead
such an exciting life.

172
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,352
- When is your next picture coming out?
- I have no next picture.

173
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,513
You gotta be jokin'.
A great star like you, you must
have dozens of'em lined up.

174
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,909
Back in the old days, yes.

175
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833
But now, no one gives
two fucks for Bela.

176
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,992
- But you're a big star.
- No more.

177
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,071
I haven't worked
in four years.

178
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,593
This business, this town,
it chews you up, then spits you out.

179
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,958
I'm just an ex-bogeyman.
Make a right.

180
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,030
[Radiator Hissing,
Engine Knocking, Wheezing]

181
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,918
They don't want the classic
horror films any more.

182
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,237
Today, it's all giant bugs.

183
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,914
Giant spiders,
giant grasshoppers.

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,831
Who would believe
such nonsense?

185
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,038
The old ones were much spookier;,
they had castles and full moons.

186
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,951
They were mythic.

187
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,349
- They had a poetry to them.
- Yes.

188
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,238
And you know what else?
The women...

189
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,233
The women prefer
the traditional monsters.

190
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,151
The women. Huh.

191
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,233
The pure horror, it both repels
and attracts them.

192
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,959
Because in their
collective unconsciousness...

193
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,270
they have the agony
of childbirth.

194
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,955
The blood...
The blood is horror.

195
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,231
You know,
I never thought of that.

196
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,071
Take my word for it.

197
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,720
If you want to make out
with a young lady...

198
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,430
you take her to see Dracula.
[Chuckling]

[Dogs Whining,

200
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,791
Eh, what a mess.

201
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,678
My wife of 20 years
left me last month.

202
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,069
- I'm not much of a housekeeper.
- [Dogs Barking]

203
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,039
- All right, I'm coming.
I'll feed you, my darlings.
- I'd better get going.

204
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,590
But perhaps we could get together
again some time, Mr Lugosi.

205
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,471
Certainly.

206
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,997
But now, the children of the night
are calling me. [Chuckling]

Uh...
[Nervous Chuckle]

208
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,711
- Good day.
- Good day.

209
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,992
Sweetie, you won't believe it.
I've got incredible news.

210
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,719
- You got the job!
- No, I didn't get the job.

211
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,190
- But something better happened.
- Better than not getting the job.

212
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,953
Yes!
I met a movie star.

213
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,635
- Somebody really big.
- Who? Robert Taylor?

214
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,712
No. A horror movie star.

215
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,030
- Boris Karloff?
- Close.

216
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,588
The other one.

217
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,478
You met...
Basil Rathbone!

218
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,677
Oh, to heck with you.
I met Bela Lugosi.

219
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,992
- Why, I thought he was dead.
- No, he's very much alive.

220
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,433
Well...

221
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,511
sort of.

222
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,718
He's old and frail, but he's still
Bela Lugosi and he's really nice.

223
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,270
- I can't even remember the last
time I saw him in a picture.
- It's a shame.

224
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,669
He's such a great actor
and no one uses him any more.

225
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,479
-So, did you get his autograph?
-No, it wasn't like that at all.

226
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,712
It was just the two of us and we were
talking. He treated me like a friend.

227
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,109
- Yeah, well, he's a bum.
- No, he's not.

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,634
Do you have any idea how much money
he made for this studio?

229
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,551
Dracula, The Black Cat,
The Raven.

230
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,756
Yeah? Well, now he's a junkie.
He don't deserve to work.

231
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,594
- That is not true!
- He's so great, you hire him.
[Chuckles]

232
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,990
Yeah, well,
I would if I could.

- [Children] Trick or treat!
- [Girl] The house looks like
they have lots ofi kids.

234
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,716
Ooh, those eyes.
He gives me the willies.

235
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,598
Uh, I hate it when
she interrupts the picture.

236
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,478
She doesn't show 'em
the proper respect.

237
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,391
I think she's a honey.

238
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,831
Look at those jugs.

239
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,229
But he stood me up
at the restaurant.

240
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,390
I guess I shouldn't have
picked a steak house.

241
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,193
And then I went out with the Wolfi Man.
Ugh! What an evening.

242
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,592
- I didn't know whether
to kiss him good night...
- Vampira...

243
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,071
you will come under
my spell.

244
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,630
You will be
my slave of love.

My gosh, Bela!
How do you do that?

246
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,432
You must be double-jointed.

247
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,829
And you must be Hungarian.

248
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,797
Vampira, look at me.

249
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,031

- No.

So, what was the important news you
couldn't tell me on the phone, again?

273
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,555
I started thinking about what
you were saying about how your
movies need to make a profit.

274
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,349
What is the one thing, if you put it
in a movie, it'll be successful?

275
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,954
- Tits.
- No, better than that. A star.

Kid, you must have me
confused with David Selznick.

277
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,549
I don't make major motion pictures;
I make crap.

278
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,155
Yes! But if you take that crap and put
a star in it, then you've got something.

279
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,038
- Yeah. Crap with a star.
- No, something better!

280
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,951
Something impressive.

Fine, all right.

You may be right,
but it doesn't frickin' matter.

284
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,869
I can't afford a star,
so what are we even talkin' about?

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,396
All right. What if I told you
you could have a star for $ 1,000?

- No, he's not dead.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.

I met him recently and he really wants
to be in our movie.

Why would Lugosi want
to do a sex change flick?

Because he's my friend!

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,948
No, I don't care if they're not actors.
I want realism!

299
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,634
- I want this film to tell the truth.
- [Knocking On Door]

300
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,551
Coming!

301
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,110
I've waited all my life for this shot,
and I'm not gonna blow it.

302
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,715
- Eddie, you got a new movie for me, eh?
- Yes!

303
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,110
It's gonna be a great picture and you'll
love your character. Have a seat.

304
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,953
Listen, Bunny?
Bela's here. I gotta go.

305
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,237
Listen, hit the bars, work some parties,
and get me transvestites!

306
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,596
I need transvestites!
All right. Bye.

307
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,511
[Sighs]

308
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,592
Eddie, what kind
of a movie is this?

309
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,559
Well, it's about how people
have two personalities:

310
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,916
the side they show to the world, and
then the secret person they hide inside.

311
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,232
Like Jekyll and Hyde. I've always
wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde.

312
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,993
I'm looking forward to this production.
[Chuckling]

313
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,196
Well, your part's
a little different.

314
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,716
You're like the god that looks over all
the characters and oversees everything.

315
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,109
I don't understand.

316
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
You control everyone's fate.
You're like the puppetmaster.

317
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,071
- Ah, so I pull the strings!
- Yes, you pull the strings.

318
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,755
"Pull the strings."
I like that!

319
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,392
Honey!

320
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,789
I got a little surprise
for you.

321
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,871
Wipe off your hands.

322
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,592
- I finished my script.
- [Gasps] Oh!

323
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,989
Ed, I'm so proud of you!

324
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,390
I'll read it as soon
as I get home.

325
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,119
Well, I'd really like
to know what you think.

326
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,317
Why don't you go in the bedroom
and take a look? I'll wait.

327
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,190
Go ahead.

328
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,111
Take your time.

329
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,189
So that's where
my sweater's been.

330
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,149
How long have you
been doing this?

331
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,631
Since I was a kid.

332
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,429
My mom wanted a girl, so she
used to dress me in girlie clothing.

333
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,351
Just became a habit.

334
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,750
Jesus Christ!
And you never told me?

335
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,796
Well, this is my way
of telling you.

336
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,509
What, by putting it in a fucking script
for everyone to see?

337
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,909
What kind of sick mind
operates like that?

338
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,639
And what about this, this
so-called Barbara character...

339
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,551
that's obviously me?

340
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,596
I mean, this is our life.
It's so embarrassing!

341
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,990
- Of course it is. That's why
you should play the part.
- Oh, you got nerve, buddy.

342
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,356
- It's a darn good role.
- That's not the issue!

343
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,035
God, how can you act so casual
when you're dressed like that?

344
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,591
It makes me feel comfortable.

345
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,831
Oh, just like in the script.

346
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,751
Exactly.

347
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,799
So, what do you say?

348
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,711
Do we break up?

349
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,872
Or do you want to make
the movie with me?

350
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,911
They make you tall, and you're flashy.
They want that.

351
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,912
Okay. But they want professionalism,
so nix on the Nelly...

352
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,389
without losing naivete,
okay?

353
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,075
Now, the good news is you're
probably going to get hired
because you look like peggy Lee.

354
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,436
But I don't want anybody else
to resent that, okay? Please?

355
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,670
'Cause there's enough
for everybody, exotics too.

356
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,797
All right, because if you're not
going to smile, please don't bother.
You'll embarrass me.

357
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,395
This is George Weiss. He's done
some very important things;
he's a nice person to know.

358
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,789
- An important person to know.
- I thought you were gonna
make a sex change film!

359
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,633
- It's still a sex change film.
- Yeah! Five pages before it ends!

360
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,793
- The rest is about some schmuck
who likes angora sweaters!
- I don't think he's a schmuck.

361
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,270
What about this title? My poster says,
I Changed My Sex.

362
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,273
So change the poster.
Trust me, you'll be better off.
This story's gonna grab people.

363
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,796
It's about this guy, he's crazy about
this girl, but he likes to wear dresses.

364
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,316
Should he tell her? Should he not
tell her? He's torn. This is drama!

365
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,073
Fine! Shoot whatever
baloney you want.

366
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,230
Just make sure
it's seven reels long.

367
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,431
Testing.

368
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,318
Excuse me. Can I get
everyone's attention, please?

369
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,231
Could you gather around?

370
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,919
I've got something to say.

371
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,515
Everybody, we're about to embark on
quite a journey: four days of hard work.

372
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,195
But when it's over, we'll have a picture
that'll entertain, enlighten...

373
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,953
and maybe even move
millions ofi people.

374
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,191
Excuse me, Eddie. I don't mean to
interrupt. I'm worried about the light.

375
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,840
Good thinking. All right, we'll talk
about days three and four later.

376
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,038
Let's get that first shot off. Scene 1 7,
Glenda looking in the window.

377
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,510
- [Camera Whirring]
- [Ed] And... action!

378
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,871
[Sighs]

379
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,951
[Ed]
And... cut!

380
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,874
- Print that! Let's move on!
- Don't you want a second take
for protection?

381
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,951
What's to protect?
It was perfect! Come on!

382
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,911
Hey! Cops!

383
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,275
We don't have a permit.
Run!

384
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,191
[Groaning]

385
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,998
Come on.
Let's go.

386
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,831
[Hammering]

387
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,799
- [Weiss] What's going on
with these revised pages?
- [Man] Mr Lugosi's here.

388
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,269
Oh, my God!
Mr Lugosi's here!

389
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,828
Everyone!
Everyone!

390
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,718
Everyone, come on.
Come in here.

391
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,191
Listen.

392
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,078
When he walks onto the stage,
treat him normal.

393
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,199
I know Bela Lugosi's a world-famous star
and you're all very excited...

394
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,748
but look,
we are professionals.

395
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,310
So, just treat him with respect.
Everything will be all right.

396
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,517
Bela!

397
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,952
Great to see ya! 8:00 on the dot.
Right on time.

398
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,349
- I'm always on time.
- Ofi course you are.

399
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,590
[Ed] We've got a big day
planned fior you.

400
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,353
But fiirst we're gonna
start out kinda easy with you
in that armchair over there.

401
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,432
Then once you're up to speed
and cookin', we'll reset and
bring in the lab equipment.

402
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,351
- Eddie?
- Huh?

403
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,638
- What about my money?
- Huh? Oh.

404
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,829
What are you people doing?
Get back to work!

405
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,755
All right, people.
Let's get ready.

406
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,158
Mr Lugosi,
I know you're very busy...

407
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,549
but, um, can I have
your autograph?

408
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,591
Certainly.

409
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,955
You know which movie of yours I love,
Mr Lugosi? The Invisible Ray.

410
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,917
You were great
as Karloff's sidekick.

411
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,031
Karloff?

412
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,149
Sidekick?

413
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,151
Fuck you!

414
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,835
Karloff does not deserve
to smell my shit!

415
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,798
That limey cocksucker
can rot in hell fior all I care!

416
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,475
-What happened?
-How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?

417
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,915
You think it takes talent
to play Frankenstein?

418
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,231
It's all make-up and, and, grunting.
[Grunts]

419
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,880
I agree.
Bela, I agree 1 00%.

420
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,838
Now, Dracula, that's a role
that requires talent.

421
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,878
Of course!
Dracula requires presence.

422
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,349
It's all in the eyes
and the voice...

423
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,476
- and the hand.
- That's right. That's right.

424
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,757
You seem a little agitated. You wanna
go outside and get some air?

425
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,752
Bullshit! I'm ready now.
Roll the camera!

426
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,591
We're rolling.

427
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,399
- Sound. Speed.
- Scene 9 7, take one. Mark.

428
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,869
[Quietly]
Action.

429
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,551
Beware.

430
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,591
Beware.

431
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,873
Beware of the big,
green dragon...

432
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,269
that sits on your doorstep.

433
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,598
He eats little boys...

434
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,671
puppy dog tails...

435
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,514
and big, fat snails.

436
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,391
Beware.

437
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,311
Take care.

438
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,951
Beware.

439
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,515
Wait!

440
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,999
Pull the string!
Pull the string!

441
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,715
Cut.

442
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,631
[Whispering]
Perfect.

443
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,235
But Georgie, I'm proud. I wrote,
directed and starred in it...

444
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,834
just like Orson Welles did
in Citizen Kane.

445
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,957
Yeah, well, Orson Welles didn't
wear angora sweaters, did he?

446
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,633
How can you just walk around like that
in firont ofi all these people?

447
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,156
Well, hon, nobody's bothered but you.
Look around.

448
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,835
Ed, this isn't the real world!
You've surrounded yourself
with a bunch of weirdos.

449
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,229
Oh, say it a little louder.
I don't think Bela heard you.

450
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,671
[Sighs]
Dolores.

451
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,513
I need your help.

452
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,752
[Ed] My mind's in a muddle,
like in a thick fiog.

453
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,994
I thought I could stop
wearing these things.

454
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,389
I tried.
Honestly, I tried.

455
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,871
Glen.

456
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,918
I don't fully understand...

457
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,309
but maybe together
we can work this out.

458
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,838
Music swells.
Cut and print!

459
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,751
- [Squeals]
- It's a wrap.

460
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,909
How do you do?
I'm here to see Mr Feldman.

461
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,911
What's your name?

462
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,513
Edward D. Wood,Jr.

463
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,391
He's in the
executive building.

464
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,789
- You can park in the reserved section.
- Thanks very much.

465
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,678
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.

466
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,594
So, what are you bringing me?
Looks like you got some fiilm cans.

467
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,070
Well, some people bring their resumes.
I've brought my own movie.

468
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,469
Really.
Well, good for you.

469
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,439
I just shot this baby for
Screen Classics. It opens next week.

470
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,751
Screen Classics?
No, I don't know them.

471
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,671
There's something
you should know.

472
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,311
Nobody in town has seen this
picture, so I'm giving you
first crack at my talents.

473
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,391
Thank you.

474
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,392
And I'm anxious to see it.
[Sighs]

475
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,311
So, what's up next
for you?

476
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,393
I don't believe in thinking
small, so I've got a whole slate
of pictures for you.

477
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,357
You ready?
Okay.

478
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,430
"The Vampire's Tomb."

479
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,592
"The Ghoul Goes West."

480
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,071
And...

481
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,071
"Doctor Acula."

482
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,710
Doctor Acula?
I don't get it.

483
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,638
"Doctor...

484
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,711
Racula."

485
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,756
Oh, I get it.

486
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,671
I don't like it.

487
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,672
But it'll star Bela Lugosi.

488
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,390
[Chuckles] Bela Lugosi? Lugosi's
all washed-up. What else you got?

489
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,077
Well, l-I do have...
another project.

490
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,469
I wasn't going to
tell you about it.

491
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,869
Lugosi's in it,
but it's a small part.

492
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,110
The lead is an ingenue.

493
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,476
A sterling, young actress...
Dolores Fuller.

494
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,155
The title of the film:

495
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,073
"Bride Of The Atom"!

496
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,991
Ah.

497
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,514
Atomic age stuff, huh?

498
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,278
I like it.
I like it.

499
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,033
I tell you what, Mr Ward. Why don't
you leave your film cans with me.

500
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,554
And my associates and I will
take a look at your little opus...

501
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,029
and maybe we can do
some business together.

502
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,636
Take care.
Beware.

503
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,755
Pull the string!
Pull the string!

504
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,671
What the hell is this?

505
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,228
- Is this an actual movie?
- It can't be!

506
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,552
[Narrator] Give this man satin undies,
a dress, sweater and skirt...

507
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,596
or even the lounging outfiit
he has on...

508
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,990
- and he's the happiest
human being in the world.
- Wait a minute.

509
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,469
- [Narrator Continues]
- Wait a minute. That guy in the dress.

510
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,790
That's the guy I met today.

511
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,758
Oh, this has got to be
a put-on.

512
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,354
[Narrator]
These things are his comfiort.

513
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,671
[Chuckling] This is probably another
one of Billy Wellman's practical jokes.

514
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,514
Hejust entered the street dressed in
the clothes he so much desires to wear.

515
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,114
But, only ifi he
really appears fiemale.

516
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,192
- long hair, make-up, clothing,
the actual contours ofi a girl.
- Oh, God!

517
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,272
Most transvestites do not want
to change their lifie, their bodies.

518
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,590
This is funny.
This is funny.

519
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,557
Thank you.

520
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,436
Georgie, I thought Glen Or Glenda?
was opening this week. Where's the ads?

521
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,910
Where's the ads? The ads are in Alabama,
Indiana, Missouri, you schmuck!

522
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,831
It ain't gonna play in L.A.!

523
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,753
-Why not?
-Nobody wants to see this piece of shit!

524
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,311
- Hey, you can't talk
that way about my movie!
- I wish it was your movie!

525
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,995
I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever
made into making this stink bomb!

526
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,753
And if I ever see ya again,
I'll kill ya!

527
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,111
Hello?

528
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,792
Georgie?

529
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,195
[Crowd Cheering]

530
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,677
- Guess where I'm going next week?
- I don't know. Where?

531
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,910
Mexico.

532
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,436
- Guess what I'm doing when I get there.
- I don't know. Lie on a beach.

533
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,433
Wrong. I'm getting my first series
of hormone injections.

534
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,590
When those girls kick in...

535
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,514
they're gonna take out my organs
and make me a woman.

536
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,151
- Are you serious?
- It's something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

537
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,153
But it wasn't until I saw your movie
that I realized I have to take action!

538
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,357
- Goodbye, penis!
- Would you please keep it down.

539
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,750
The "Super Swedish Angel,"
Tor Johnson!

540
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,149
[Cheering, Whistling]

541
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,594
My gosh, look at that guy.
He's a mountain!

542
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,309
[Bell Rings]

543
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,118
And after I'm a woman,Jean-Claude
and I are going to be married.

544
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,998
- I'm going to be a June bride.
- He's a monster.

545
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,311
Can you imagine what that guy
would look like in a movie?

546
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,958
[Grunting]

547
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,354
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!

548
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,876
Mmm. More neck.

549
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,997
- Mr Johnson, congratulations
on your victory.
- Thank you.

550
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,878
- Did you bring my water?
- No, I'm not the water boy.

551
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,791
I'm a movie director.

552
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,440
- Movies? Like the Mickey Mouse?
- Sure.

553
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,399
- I'll get you next week!
- Yeah, right. In your dreams!

554
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,790
Tor...
Uh, Mr Johnson.

555
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,590
- You ever fancy the notion
of becoming an actor?
- Not good-looking enough.

556
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,672
Well, I think
you're quite handsome.

557
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,591
Do my toes.

558
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,516
So, anyway, I've got this new script,
Bride Ofi The Atom.

559
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,672
And there's a part
I believe you're ideal for.

560
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,558
Lobo. He's tough,
he's a brute.

561
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,677
But he's got a good heart. At the end
of the picture, he saves the girl.

562
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,354
[Chuckles]
I like! When do movie shoot?

563
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,271
Hopefully, very soon.

564
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,715
I'm just waiting for the final okay from
my good pal at Warners, Mr Feldman.

565

- Eddie, help me.

- Bela?
- Eddie, please come over.

568
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,671
Bela?

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,471
Bela?

570
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,511
Bela!

[Dogs Whimpering]

572
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,996
Bela!

573
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,752
Bela?
What happened?

574
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,400
[Weakly]
Eddie.

575
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,710
I didn't feel well.

576
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,475
- Come on, let me get you
to the hospital.
- No hospital.

577
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,835
Just take me
to the couch.

578
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,518
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.

579
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,398
This happens all the time.

580
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,076
Is there anything I can get for you?
Water or a blanket?

581
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,071
Goulash.

582
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,678
I don't know how to make goulash.

583
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,240
Bela, what's in
the needle?

584
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,880
Morphine.

585
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,916
With a Demerol chaser.

586
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,991
Oh, Eddie.
Eddie, I'm so broke.

587
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,234
I don't know what I'm going to do.
[Sobbing]

588
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,191
Don't worry, Bela.

589
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,269
I won't let you down.

590

Mr Feldman?
Ed Wood.

591
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,358
Yeah, listen, I haven't been able
to get through, so I just showed up.

592
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,351
Yeah!
Right out front.

593
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,749
So, we gonna be
working together?

594
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,636
Really?
Worst film you ever saw.

595
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,837
Well, my next one
will be better.

596

Hello. Hello.

[Sighs]
I'm no good.

598
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,118
Oh, Ed, it was just
one man's opinion.

599
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,636
Bela needs a job.
I can't even get a film going.

600
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,359
Of course I can't.
I made the worst movie of all time.

00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,271
Oh, that's ridiculous.

602
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,233
All I wanna do
is tell stories.

603
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,993
The things that I find interesting.

604
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,197
Well, maybe you're not
studio kind of material.

605
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,078
Maybe you just need
to raise the money yourself.

606
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,269
The movie is called
Bride Ofi The Atom.

607
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,238
It will star Bela Lugosi.

608
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,914
There are quarter shares
available at $ 1 5,000 each.

609
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,839
Yes, that's right.
The Bela Lugosi.

610
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,030
He's still alive.

611
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,669
Huh? Is he available
Friday night?

612
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,274
Well, gee, I suppose so.
Why?

613
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,114

- "'Oh, tract housing, huh?' Laugh.

- You need a new real estate agent."

00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,071
No, Bela,
that's "incorporates."

621
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,958
Look, why don't you just say,
"This casket has..."

622
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,112
How do they expect a Hungarian
to pronounce this dialogue?

623
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,998
This... This live television
is madness!

00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,310
Furthermore, I predict...

625
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,597
by April 1 9, 1 9 70...

626
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,434
I predict... men will
have colonized Mars.

627
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,590
Millions of people
will live there.

628
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,673
Wow!
Ain't that somethin'?

629
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,790
And now we take you
to a castle in Transylvania.

630
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,635
Watch out. The landlord's
a real pain in the neck.

- Hey, what a kooky place to sleep.

635
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,229
Kind of reminds me of my house.
What a dump!

636
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,073
Some places got a Murphy bed;
this place got a Murphy shower.

637
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,628
I still don't know where
to hang the towels.

A bum is what he is. I told you
we should've got Karloff!

645
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,071
- Ah, don't worry about it, Bela.
You're better than all this.
- I never said I could ad-lib.

646

- Forget it! We'll make our own movie
and you'll be a big star again.
- Aha!

647
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,072
Mr Lugosi, it is an unparalleled
privilege to meet you, sir.

00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,470
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Criswell.

It's a pleasure.

Ahh, cheer up. Don't lose heart
over what happened tonight.

I predict... your next project will
be an outstanding success!

And who may you be?

00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,198
- Edward D. Wood,Jr.
- Ahh!

00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,590
- The director of Glen Or Glenda?
- How'd you know?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.

660
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,471
Ed, uh, another whisky.

661
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,391
Dagmar, a rum and coke?

662
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,471
Moustapha and King are Chablis.

663
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,472
Bela, would you like a wine?

664
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,597
No.
I never drink... wine.

Say, Cris, how'd you know we'd be
living on Mars by 1 9 70?

667
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,718
- I guessed.
- Really?

668
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,631
I made it up.

669
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,551
It's horse shit.

670
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,558
Eddie, there's no such thing
as a psychic.

671
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,394
People believe my folderol
because I wear a black tuxedo.

672
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,313
- It's that easy?
- Eddie, we're in show biz.

673
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,756
It's all about razzle-dazzle,
appearances.

674
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,389
If you look good and you talk well,
people will swallow anything.

675
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,513
We are going to have the most terrifying
monster ever seen on film.

676
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,752
A ghastly creature created
from an atomic mutation!

677
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,671
I don't like
scary movies.

678
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,591
I like the ones
with love stories.

679
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,478
That's just what this movie is:
a heartbreaking romance.

680
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,391
You're quite a specimen.

681
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,153
- And you're going to be in the picture?
- Yeah. I play Lobo.

682
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,631
I predict Bride Ofi The Atom will be
the biggest moneymaker of all time.

683
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,474
And this is lovely starlet Dolores
Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton.

684
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,791
My pleasure, ma'am. Now,
how much will this picture cost?

685
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,077
Well, in a normal studio it'd be
about a million bucks...

686
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,958
with all their wasteful overhead
and fancy offices.

687
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,635
But we're more efficient, so we could
bring it in at about 70 grand.

688
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
Oh. Well, I shall
certainly consider it.

689
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,557
- [Ed] Well, goodbye.
- [Man] Good night, Ed. Keep in touch.

690
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,471
Goodbye.

691
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,991
Well, Eddie, how'd we do?

692
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,753
We didn't make a nickel.

693
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,638
[Woman]
I cannot believe I'm in Hollywood.

694
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,508
- You know, Daddy didn't
want me to move out here.
- [Bartender] Uh-huh.

695
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,797
Ma'am, your bill
comes to $ 2.20.

696
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,678
Oh. Uh, okay.
I hope you don't mind...

697
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,797
but all I have is a fiifty;
I just came firom my banker's.

698
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,711
- That's all right.
- Thank you.

699
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,869
Excuse me.
You just moved here?

700
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,952
Yes. Hollywood is,
oh, so exciting.

701
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,871
- Isn't it?
- [Giggles]

702
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,474
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm Loretta King.

704
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,996
- [Bartender] Hi.
Would you like some water?
- No!

705
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,435
No water.
No liquids.

706
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,556
I'm terribly
allergic to them.

707
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,193
You know, I work in Hollywood.
I'm a producer.

708
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,111
Really? Wow!

709
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,760
I would love to be
involved in that.

710
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,638
Is that right?
Well, maybe I can help you out.

711
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,871
Have you ever thought about
investing in a motion picture?

712
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,919
Perhaps a small amount of money.
How much do your motion pictures cost?

713
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,629
Well, my new one, I think,
would be about $60,000.

714
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,554
That's all? That seems very reasonable
for an entire picture.

715
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,471
[Chuckles]

716
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,358
Would you...
Would you like to, uh...

717
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,716
- have a look at the... at the photoplay?
- Oh, sure.

718
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,591
Oh, my.

719
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,035
This is very interesting.

720
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,114
Say, do you think it would be possible
for me to maybe play one of these parts?

721
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,998
Oh, you want to be an actress too.
Well, of course.

722
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,834
There's a couple of parts I can think of
right now that you might be perfect for.

723
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,436
There's, uh, the secretary in the
newspaper office, the file clerk, um...

724
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,034
Hmm. Those sound kind of small.

725
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,833
Here's one that looks good...
Janet Lawton.

726
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,158
I'd sure like to play her.

727
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,196
-Janet Lawton.
- Yes.

728
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,078
Janet Lawton is clearly
the part to play.

729
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,034
Can't you just see me
in the part?

730
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,471
Yes!

731
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,391
You'd be perfect.

732
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,431
You bastard!

733
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,513
You two-timing,
dress-wearing son of a bitch!

734
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,398
Honey, it was the only way
I could get the movie made!

735
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,311
Who do you think's
been paying the rent?

736
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,154
Who's been helping you type your scripts
and do all your grunt work?

737
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,994
- I am sorry!
What did you want me to say?
- You were supposed to say...

738
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,073
"No. I wrote that part for
my girlfriend Dolores!"

739
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,590
Snowball, there are
plenty of other parts.

740
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,035
Like what?

741
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,160
- The secretary, the file clerk.
- Aaaaah!

742
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,038
You... asshole!

743
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,476
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory,
so it should be real impressive...

744
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,869
just like one of those
"Mad Scientist" movies.

745
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,952
I want test tubes, beakers and one
of those electrical things that buzzes.

746
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,838
- You mean a Tesla coil?
- Fine. Whatever. Hop to it!

747
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,751
Right! Right.

748
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,231
- Eddie?
- Yes?

749
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,949
- Which dress do you like better?
- Hmm. I don't know.

750
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,272
Say, Bill, which dress works better
for you, the red one or the green one?

751
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,238
- Which one is the red one?
- What do you mean?

752
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,596
I mean, I can't see the difference;
I'm colour blind.

753
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,750
But I kinda like
the dark grey one.

754
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,152
At Universal, we used to shoot one
or two scenes a day.

755
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,118
But Eddie can knock off
twenty, thirty.

756
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,839
- He's incredible!
- [Ed] And... action!

757
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,196
Okay, you're Dr Eric Vornoff...

758
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,111
and you're upset.

759
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,239
You've worked very hard
on this experiment and you
don't want to see it fail.

760
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,151
N-No, you're not
that upset.

761
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,516
You wanna keep moving.
You wanna go through that door.

762
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,991
And... cut!
Beautiful.

763
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,674
Print it. Let's move immediately
to scene 52.

764
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,591
- Tor, you in place?
- [Tor] Yeah.

765
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,910
- Great. Roll camera!
- Rolling. Slate.

766
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,798
- Cue rainstorm.
- [Water Dripping]

767
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,711
And... action, Tor.

768
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,712
Okay.
You're Lobo.

769
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,631
You're upset.

770
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,474
You've worked very hard helping
Dr Vornoff with this experiment.

771
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,358
You don't wanna
see it fail.

772
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,271
No, no.
You're not that upset.

773
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,193
You wanna keep moving.
You've got to get through that door.

774
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,871
And cut!
Perfect!

775
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,236
- Print it. Let's move on.
- Don't you wanna do another take, Ed?

776
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,118
Looks like big baldy had a little
trouble gettin' through the door.

777
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,031
No, it's fine.
It's real.

778
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,159
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.

779
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,994
All right, people, let's get ready.
Actors! I must have my actors!

780
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,312
There you are. Loretta, Tor,
I wanna explain this scene;
it's a little complicated, but...

781
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,198
- Bela, you'll be sitting there. Okay?
- [Electricity Buzzing]

782
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,078
I'm not getting near
that goddam thing.

783
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,436
- One of them burned me
on The Return Ofi Chandu.
- All right.

784
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,988
- Then you'll be sitting there.
- Good.

785
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,310
Great. All right, gang,
here's the scene.

786
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,676
Loretta, you're in a trance; you glide
in and get on the operating table.

787
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,036
Now, Tor, you're supposed to tie her
down, but you have an angora fetish...

788
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,396
and when you rub that swatch
of angora, it makes you refuse.

789
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,234
So then Bela has to discipline you.
All right? Great! Let's do it!

790
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,351
Action!

791
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,949
Strap her to the table.

792
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,749
Do as I command you!

793
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,796
- I'll teach you to disobey me!
- Aaaargh!

794
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,711
- You will obey!
- Uhhhh!

795
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,268
- Strap her in!
- Uhhhh!

796
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,238
Strap her in!
I command you!

797
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,118
- Wood! Your cheque bounced.
- I'll get you the money later.

798
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,794
- No, I need it now.
- [Bela] I'll teach you to disobey me!

799
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,711
Cut!

800
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,156
I am terribly sorry to bother you
while you're shooting...

801
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,038
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.

802
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,396
Well, then, you should
pay him, shouldn't you?

803
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,789
Yes. Exactly.

804
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,031
I kind of need it now.

805
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,390
W-What are you looking at me
like that for?

806
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,552
I already gave you
my three hundred.

807
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,471
Right.

808
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,154
And now I need
the other sixty thousand.

809
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,834
What other sixty thousand?

810
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,474
The other sixty thousand
you said you'd give to me.

811
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,710
You misunderstood, Eddie.

812
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,190
I gave you everything I have in
the world... three hundred dollars.

813
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,073
Well, here we go again.

814
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,469
[Ed] Let me tell ya,
ya can't lose.

815
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,632
It's scary. And if you don't like that,
it's romantic.

816
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,518
Bela Lugosi will portray
Dr Eric Vornoff.

817
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,915
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingenue Loretta King...

818
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,468
is reporter Janet Lawton.

819
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,358
- I don't know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?

820
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,836
Which role
does Vampira play?

821
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,480
Vampira?
Why do you ask?

822
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,790
She's standing
right over there.

823
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,829
Well, she plays...

824
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,031
Excuse me one minute.

825
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,476
- [Woman Laughing]
- Pardon me. Miss Vampira?

826
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,358
-Yes?
- You don't know me, but I'm Ed Wood.

827
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,716
I'm a film producer and I'm currently in
production on a science fiction piece...

828
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,950
with Bela Lugosi and Swedish
wrestler Tor Johnson.

829
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,032
I don't understand.
Do you want my autograph?

830
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,111
No.

831
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,998
No, l... I think my film
is perfect for you.

832
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,834
Want me to show it on my TV programme.
I have nothing to do with that.

833
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,718
- You should call the station
manager at Channel 7.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

834
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,713
I don't want you to show the movie,
I want you to be in it. Let me explain.

835
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,519
We started shooting, but after
three days we got shut down.

836
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,592
Now we're having a backers party
to raise some more money.

837
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,592
So I thought perhaps you'd like
to come over just to say "howdy"
to some of the backers.

838
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,399
Look, I'm with some friends
and we're about to eat.

839
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,311
Please! It would
just take one second.

840
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,029
Come over and meet the backers. There
is a really nice dentist firom Oxnard.

841
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,918
Look, buddy, I've got real offers
from real studios.

842
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,198
I don't need to blow some dentist
for a part. Forget it.

843
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,350
Miss Vampira!

844
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,829
- Please.
- Ohh! Let's go.

845
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,636
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Let's get out of here.

846
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,756
Yeah, I think
you're right.

847
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,072
Thank you, folks, for comin' tonight,
but we better go.

848
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,436
And then Dr Vornoff
falls into the pit...

849
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,671
and his own octopus
attacks and eats him.

850
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,558
- The end.
- Whew!

851
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,154
- Well, that's quite a story.
- Yes.

852
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,874
So, uh, you made the movie...

853
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,349
and now you wanna
make it again?

854
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,192
No.

855
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,034
We shot ten minutes of the movie, and
now we're looking for completion funds.

856
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,076
Oh, son, you're too vague.

857
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,958
- [Machine Starting, Whirring]
- Billy Bob!

858
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,873
You're cuttin' 'em
too lean.

859
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,076
Mr McCoy.

860
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,193
- How can I make you happy?
- [Spits]

861
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,953
Okay.

862
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,871
Two things.

863
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,988
Number one: I want the movie
to end with a big explosion.

864
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,711
Sky full of smoke.

865
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,151
Yes.

866
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,198
But it ends with Dr Vornoff
falling into the pit.

867
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,555
Not any more.

868
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,756
Number two.

869
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,956
I got a son.

870
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,431
He's a little slow,
but a good boy.

871
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,399
And somethin' tells me
he'd make a helluva leadin' man.

872
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,671
Sounds perfect.

873
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,592
This is unbelievable.

874
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,478
I woulda bet a million bucks that
Ed wouldn't finish this picture.

875
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,358
Yeah, well, it ain't finished yet, kid;
anything can happen.

876
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,231
Stay out of
scratching distance.

877
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,074
- Poodle, you made it. I wasn't
sure you got my message.
- Well, of course I made it.

878
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,958
- Today's the file clerk's big scene.
- That's right.

879
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,838
I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.

880
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,559
- [Man] Janet, I want you...
- Say, who's the lug?

881
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,509
Str... I want you staying away
from the old Willows place.

882
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,398
Why, that's Tony McCoy. He will be
portraying Lieutenant Dick Craig.

883
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,311
- [Tony Continues Fumbling Lines]
- Really.

884
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,154
- How much money did he put up?
- None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.

885
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,549
Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.

886
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,837
Listen, the movie's getting made;
that's all that matters.

887
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,711
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.

888
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,109
Oh!
You're Dolores.

889
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,475
I've heard so much about you.

890
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,358
I'm Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.

891
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,237
Oh, don't be silly.
Let Harry finish.

892
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,436
You still need
some more work.

893
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,351
No. I'm finished.

894
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,716
- All I needed was a touch-up.
- Hmm. That mole still shows.

895
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,758
Uh, ladies!
You both look fine.

896
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,638
Why don't we talk
about the scene?

897
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,756
Okay,Janet Lawton
has just discovered...

898
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,149
that Dr Vornoff bought
the old Willows estate...

899
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,038
so now she wants to prove that
all the monster stories are true.

900
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,156
Well, Eddie,
what's my motivation?

901
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,994
You're the file clerk. You're running
into the next room and bump into Janet.

902
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:57,790
What is our relationship?
Are we good friends, or is she
just a casual acquaintance?

903
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,236
Dolores, I have five days
to complete this picture.

904
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,151
Don't get goofy on me.

905
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,111
Action!

906
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,119
- Hi,Janet.
- Oh, hi, Marge.

907
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,998
-Janet, still on the monster hunt?
- What do you think?

908
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,356
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

909
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,238
Something about the police wanting
those monster stories 86'd.

910
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,278
- You've got the whole town in a panic.
- I can't hear you.

911
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,114
- I said, you've got the who...
- I know what you said,
but I can't hear you.

912
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,469
I get it.
See ya later.

913
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,157
And... cut!
That was perfect.

914
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,879
Of course it was.

915
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,679
Bra-vo!
Bravo!

916
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,558
- Magnifiico.
- Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.

917
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,438
Naturally. Always happy to help
with a little larceny.

918
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,829
All right, everybody,
that's it for today.

919
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,071
The prop crew has a little errand
to run. Paul. Connie.

920
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,558
Darn. I thought they kept this open.

921
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,596
[Tor]
Lobo will fiix.

922
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,080
Good boy.

923
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,152
- [Connie] Wow!
- [paul] This place
gives me the creeps.

924
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,233
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Not so fast. Not 'til we get it down.

925
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,788
There it is.
paul, go unhook it.

926
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,711
Right.

927
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,551
Fantastic.

928
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,915
It's beautifiul.

929
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,468
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.

930
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,393
- [Creaking]
- You sure?

931
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,232
[Ed]
Yes, hurry. Do it.

932
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,388
[Criswell]
My God!

933
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,231
We killed him.

934
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,911
Tor?

935
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,391
Better than wrestling.

936
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,311
Lights!

937
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,676
[Tony, Reading]
"Now, Janet, I want you stayin'away...

938
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,274
"firom that old Willows place.
I want...

939
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,669
"Now,Janet, I w...

940
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,716
- Great.
- "I want you...

941
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,631
- Connie!
- I want you staying away..."

942
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,996
- The octopus has to live in the lake.
- This is kind of a stream.

943
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,957
No!
It has to be underwater.

944
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,349
Let me look at this.
Okay.

945
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,189
Go set up
by the lake.

946
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,272
Eddie.
I'm so tired.

947
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,158
I don't know if I can handle
a night shoot.

948
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,073
- Nonsense. You look great.
- [Sighs]

949
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,111
All right, look.

950
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,556
Why don't you have a nice nap and
we'll shoot around you a little while.

951
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,074
- Thanks, buddy.
- You're welcome.

952
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,991
All right, you kids.

953
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,396
Hey, this is looking
fantastic!

954
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,311
Paul, where's
the octopus motor?

955
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,277
- What octopus motor?
- To make his legs move.

956
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,636
Don't blame me! You didn't say anything
about a motor when I was on the ceiling!

957
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,791
What's he talking...

958
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,948
Paul lost
the octopus motor.

959
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,709
All right,
let's shoot this fucker.

960
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,950
Great.

961
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,110
Where do I go?

962
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,237
- You'll be fighting with the octopus.
- Out there?

963
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,278
- Yes.
- What happened to the stream?

964
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,158
Well, this is gonna
look a lot better.

965
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,516
We have to match it to the stock footage
of the octopus underwater.

966
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,710
Aw, for Christ's sake.

967
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,231
Ehh.

968
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,915
- Goddam, it's cold!
- It'll warm up once you're in it.

969
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,752
Fuck you!
You come out here!

970
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,877
Hey!
Throw me that whisky!

971
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,278
Ahh. How do you
turn this on?

972
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,354
Well... somebody misplaced
the octopus motor...

973
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,716
so when you get in there and fight
with him, shake his legs around.

974
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,189
Looks like he's killin' ya.
Okay.

975
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,111
[Sighs]

976
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,430
You know I turned down
Frankenstein?

977
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,399
- What?
- After I did Dracula...

978
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,189
the studio offered me Frankenstein,
but I turned it down.

979
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,038
part wasn't sexy enough.

980
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,476
Too degrading
for a big star like me.

981
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,435
Bela... I have 25 scenes
to shoot tonight.

982
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,318
Oh. Sorry.
Don't let me slow you down.

983
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,676
Okay. All right.

984
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,591
[Ed]
All right.

985
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,868
All right,
let's put it on film!

986
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,190
- [Ed] Camera!
- [Bill] We're rolling!

987
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,191
- Sound!
- Ed, we don't have sound.

988
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,111
Oh.

989
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,031
And... action!

990
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,396
[Screaming]

991
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,349
[Screaming Continues]

992
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,671
And... cut!

993
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,151
That was perfect!

994
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,510
[Ed] Come on!
Come on, troops!

995
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,358
Have a nice cup o' joe,
you'll feel much better.

996
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,271
All right.
All right, Harry.

997
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,158
Mr Wood? I only got one hour
of sleep last night.

998
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,438
Yeah, well, I got no sleep, and I feel
great. Go get' em, kid, go get 'em.

999
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,750
- I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Great work, Bill.

1000
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,876
Go ahead.
Go get 'em.

1001
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,791
Be careful.
Don't hurt him.

1002
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,672
Don't scratch
the tentacles.

1003
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,911
Bela...

1004
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,798
I wanna thank you again
for last night.

1005
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,678
That's fine, Eddie.
All in the line of duty.

1006
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,550
No, no, I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you've done for me.

1007
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,952
A great man like yourself
shouldn't have to be wandering
through the muck at 4:00 a.m.

1008
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,715
Well, there are not a lot of fellas
I'd do it for. [Chuckles]

1009
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,588
Say, I wrote something
special for ya.

1010
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,753
I got to thinkin' about all
the sacrifices you've made and l...

1011
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,149
Well, I wrote you a...

1012
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,031
a new final speech.

1013
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,118
Well, this is
quite a scene, Eddie.

1014
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,510
I know it's a lot to give you
at the last minute, Bela, but...

1015
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,636
These lines...

1016
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,029
I'll have no problem
remembering.

1017
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,791
Great.

1018
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,634
All right, kids,
let's knock 'em dead.

1019
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,150
My dear
Professor Strowski...

1020
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,950
twenty years ago I was banned
from my homeland.

1021
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,952
I was classed as a madman, a charlatan.

1022
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,918
Outlawed in the world
ofi science...

01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,390
which previously
honoured me as a genius.

1024
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,551
Now here...

1025
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,428
in this forsaken
jungle hell...

1026
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,318
I have proven
that I am all right!

1027
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,231
Yes!

1028
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,278
The authorities have learned
how correct your findings were.

1029
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,238
So I am here...

1030
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,151
to bring you home.

1031
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,391
Home?

1032
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,036
I have no home.

1033
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,071
Hunted.

1034
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,628
Despised.

1035
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,029
Living like an animal.

1036
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,396
The jungle is my home.

1037
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,438
But I shall
show the world...

1038
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,478
that I can be its master!

1039
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,712
I shall perfect
my own race of people...

1040
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,109
a race
of atomic supermen...

1041
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,919
that will conquer
the world!

1042
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,758
[Sinister Laughter]

1043
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,551
Cut.

1044
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,631
That's a wrap.

1045

1046
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,911
Glen Or Glenda?
Now, that was
a hell of a picture.

1047
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,798
Yeah, but this new one is gonna be
a million times better.

1048
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,314
Is that possible?

1049

¢Ü¢Ü ["Que Sera Sera"]

1050
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,831
Mr Bunny, what's wrong?

1051
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,718
I heard you were
becoming a lady.

1052
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,231
Oh, that.

1053

everybody knows everybody;

1211
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,958
my dad worked for the post office;
I was a Boy Scout.

1212
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,838
- Did you find it boring?
- No, not at all.

1213
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,229
I had my comic books
and pulp magazines.

1214
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,118
- Used to listen
to radio dramas constantly.
- I love those shows.

1215
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,031
- The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.
- Yes.

1216
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,918
- And the Mercury Theater
with Orson Welles.
- Mmm.

1217
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,798
Boy, you know, every Saturday
afternoon me and my dad...

1218
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,678
marched down the street in our uniform
to the little movie theatre.

1219
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,751
[Gasps]
Oh, the spook house!

- [Hisses]
- Aah!

1223
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,717
- [Knocking]
- Aaaarrr!

1224
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,878
You're not gonna believe
the first picture I ever saw.

1225
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,837
It was your friend's...
Dracula.

1226
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,674
- That's incredible; that's
the first picture I ever saw.
- That is incredible.

1227
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,469
- You know, I had to sleep
with the lights on for a week.
- I had to for a month.

1228
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,028
But I never missed a Lugosi picture
after that one.

1229
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,756
A few years ago I actually saw him
do Dracula live.

1230
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,149
It was much scarier
in person.

1231
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,233
- [High-pitched Scream,
Tape Winds Down]
- [Ed] Oh. We're stuck.

Kathy...

1233
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,512
I'm about to tell you something that
I never told any girl on a first date.

1234
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,198
But I think it's important
that you know...

1235
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,431
I like to wear
women's clothes.

1236
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,117
- Huh?
- I like to wear women's clothes.

1237
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,158
Panties, brassieres,
sweaters, pumps.

1238
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,549
It's just
something I do.

1239
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,394
Yes, I can't believe I'm telling
you this, but I really like you...

1240
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,995
and I don't want it getting
in the way down the road.

1241
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,993
Does this mean...
you don't like sex with girls?

1242
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,640
No, I love sex
with girls.

1243
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,591
Okay.

1244
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,191
Okay?

1245
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,596
Okay.

- [Electricity Buzzes]
- [Screaming Continues]

1247
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,272
You see, we thought that Mr Lugosi
was insured through his union.

1248
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,399
- Isn't he?
- No, they say his eligibility
ran out years ago.

1249
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,551
Look, Doctor...

1250
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,949
he doesn't have
any money.

1251
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,316
But I'll give you everything I've got;
a few hundred dollars.

1252
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,916
That won't even begin to cover it.
He's gonna have to leave.

1253
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,912
Bela?
Bela, wake up.

1254
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,310
I've got some great news.
The doctor says you're all
better;, you can go home now.

1255
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,190
Really?

1256
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,157
I don't feel so great.

1257
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,789
No? Well, you look
just peachy.

1258
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,553
And, uh, the tests
came back fiine.

1259
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,438
Come on, let's get up.

1260
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,596
Here we go.

1261
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,752
Atta boy. Good.

1262
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,716
Eddie...

1263
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,792
I want to make
another picture.

1264
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,678
When are we going to
make another picture?

1265
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,036
Oh... soon, Bela.
Very soon.

1266
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,353
This is so exciting.
[Chuckles]

1267
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,351
Another production.

1268
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,317
Isn't it?

1269
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,279
So, Eddie, shouldn't we
have a sound crew?

1270
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,636
Uh, no, no, because this
is just second unit stuff.

1271
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,678
We're gonna do the main
footage later. All right?

1272
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,478
So, what's
this scene about?

1273
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,596
Um...

1274
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,910
You're a very important
and respected man.

1275
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,594
And you're leaving your house;
you're in a hurry.

1276
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,478
You're on your way to
a big social brouhaha. Okay?

1277
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,314
Eddie. What if I'm not
in so big a hurry?

1278
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,198
What if I take a moment
to slow down;

1279
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,635
to savour the beauty of life;

1280
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,474
to, to smell
a budding flower?

1281
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,358
That's great.
That is great.

1282
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,510
Let's do a take.
Okay?

1283
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,232
- [Men Arguing]
- Ed, I'm really busy.

1284
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,551
- What do you want now?
- I was calling to see
if you'd like to attend...

1285
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,995
the world premiere of my new movie,
Bride Ofi The Monster.

1286
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,356
- Didn't you just make one
called Bride Ofi The Atom?
- Yes, it's the same film.

1287
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,749
But the distributor
wanted a punchier title.

1288
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,674
Come on, it's gonna be
a big event; Bela, Tor and Cris
are coming. You'll have fun!

1289
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,396

Uhh! I can't see.

are hurting.

are killin' me.

Hell, I envied you too.

A girlfriend who would jump
in front of a car like that.

Yes, she is
quite something.

No problem.

I know it by heart.

1338
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,798
Home.

show the world...

that I can be its master!

1346
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:56,349
I shall perfect my own race

of atomic supermen...

your autograph, please?

- Certainly.
- Why, that was... That was incredible.

as great as you ever were.
- Better.

I am 7 4,

Well, you know

You produce a film in

Yes. The script contains numerous
references to grave robbing.

digging up consecrated ground
