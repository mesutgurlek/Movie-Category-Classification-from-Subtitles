00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,561
- Yeah. He's at my house.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,127
Crazy.

157
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,800
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.

158
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,471
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

159
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,614
Did I just say that?

160
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,786
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

161
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,191
And you're already in. That's so cool.

162
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,124
Except she won't stop talking
about it. It's embarrassing.

163
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,431
Come on. She's proud of you.

164
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,937
I'm proud of you.

165
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,210
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

166
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,269
...fifty-three miles from here.

167
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,680
I know.

168
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,649
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

169
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,626
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

Troy? You have guests.

Don't make me come up there

We'll be right down, Mom.

She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

Oh, OK.

What are you? I mean, who are you?

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,791
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.

235
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,851
I transferred
to East High from London

236
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,228
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

237
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

238
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,363
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

239
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,931
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

240
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,742
- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

241
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

242
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,041
since those are
first lessons of the day.

243
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,984
How do you know my schedule?

244
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,182
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

245
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,489
I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

246
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,860
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

247
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,135
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

248
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,674
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,012
By the way, like the accent.

250

It's... sweet.

00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,291
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

252
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,759
- What?
- Like starting next week.

253
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:41,094
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

254
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,693
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

All right, everyone. Settle down.

260
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,314
We are all excited about our Wildcats'

261
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:06,414
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back."

262
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,086
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!

263
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,563
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,567
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

265
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,662
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

266
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,367
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

267
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,969
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz."

268
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,979
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

269
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,983
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

270
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,646
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

271
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,189
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

272
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,824
New York deli. Anyone else?

273
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:49,424
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,

spring musicale report.

275
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,602
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

276
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,699
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

277
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,074
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

278
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,283
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

279
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,445
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

280
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,990
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

281

[Sharpay groans]

282
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
How inspiring!

283
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,967
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

284
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,162
and to make a very special announcement.

[chattering]

287
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,122
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

288
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,022
I'm working on my truck every day.

289
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,584
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

290
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,630
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

291
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,793
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

292
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,201
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

293
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

294
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,640
This is our last chance
to do something together.

295
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,306
All of us. Something really fun.

296
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,849
Oh, yippee.

297
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,716
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

298
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,812
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

299
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,222
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

300
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,989
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

301
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,589
I'm in.

302
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,363
What?

303
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,199
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

304
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,240
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

305
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,674
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

306
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,370
You, Mr. Danforth.

307
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,036
Me?

308
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,279
The spring musicale is all about you.

309
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,289
Hold up. If it's about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?

00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,261
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

311
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,130
And all of you will create it.

312
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:08,639
A show about your final days at
East High. We'll call it <i>Senior Year.</i>

313
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,572
Genius.

314
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,634
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,

315
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,476
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

316
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,038
Miss Darbus, exactly...

317
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,812
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

318
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,376
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:28,119
Now, I have
some very important news from...

320
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,995
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

321
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:36,795
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

322
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,395
And for the first time
in East High history,

323
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,805
Juilliard is considering four of you

324
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,605
for one available scholarship.

325
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,704
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

326
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,807
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

327
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,115
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

328
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,711
They certainly did.

329
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,226
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

330
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,420
What?

331
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,433
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

332
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,370
So good luck to our four applicants.

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,706
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

334
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,607
So... who's the big comedian?

335
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,779
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

336
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:33,381
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,258
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

338
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,094
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

339
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,569
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

340
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,400
Line up, downstage, please.

341
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,638
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,609
Your future.

343
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,810
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

344
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:04,685
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

345
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,657
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

346
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
Oh.

347
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,318
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

348
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,327
Martha Cox, you're late.

349
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,732
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

350
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,139
[group gasps, chuckles]

351
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,110
I feel a show coming on already!

352
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Bolton.

353
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,182
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

354
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,318
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

355
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,798
You know... uh...

356
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,392
I've been thinking about...

357
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,067
Uh...

358
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,601
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

359
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,445
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

360
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,418
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

361
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,613
But I know where it ends.

362
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,281
Center stage.

363
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,454
A single spotlight.

364
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,390
A huge marquee that reads...

365
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,910
New York deli platter, please.

366
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

367
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,213
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

368
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,780
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

369
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,885
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

370
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,956
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

371
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,559
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

372
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,231
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

373
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,334
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

374
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,209
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

375
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,207
- Hmm.

Because?

487

Because you're going to have
a pretty dress, so I want to look right.

00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:22,912
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

Because I have no idea how to do that.

All I know is what my dad
taught me when I was a little girl.

I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.

Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.

762
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,888
The difference being I can carry a tune.

763
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,656
Listen, I wouldn't sing with you
if my hair was on fire

764
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,199
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.

765
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,462
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving

766
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,437
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.

767
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,268
Want to go to lunch sometime?

768
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,208
Gentlemen, start your engines.

769
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:35,217
That's what I'm talking about, bro.
Yo, come check out these guitars.

770
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,743
[humming]

771
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,389
What is this?

772
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,723
[gasps]

773
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:48,056
"Stanford's Honors Program cordially..."

774
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,826
- [screams]
- Oh, my gosh.

775
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:53,835
Oh, my goodness! "You and 29 students
are invited for early orientation."

776
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,673
Oh, my gosh, that's huge.
Your mom must be so proud.

777
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,937
Taylor, you're the only one that knows.

778
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,002
But you've already accepted, right?

779
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,639
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!

780
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:09,048
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.

781
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,677
- Back to work.
- OK.

782
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,417
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.

783
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,604
This better be good.
