1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,673
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>
<i>It's graduation.</i>

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,271
<i>Mr. Carroll ridicules me all</i>
<i>year. Then he writes in my yearbook:</i>

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,119
<i>"You're a live wire.</i>
<i>Love, Mr. Carroll. "</i>

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,156
<i>He wants to go on good terms.</i>

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,272
When he uses "love,"
I look for a new word.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,040
Lloyd, she's being difficult.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,913
- I'm taking out Diane Court.
- Not likely.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,954
- Is the movies a good second date?
- You never had a first.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,277
I sat across from her in a mall.
We ate.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,598
- Sharing an important physical event.
- That's not even a scam.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,836
- A scam?
- Going out as friends.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,271
- No, scam is lusting.
- Then what's a date?

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,632
A date is prearrangement
with a possibility for love.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,035
Then what's love?

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,639
I'm gonna call her.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,991
She doesn't date guys like you.
She's a brain.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,873
With the body of a game-show hostess.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,230
She doesn't know she's pretty.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,433
- That's what's cool about her.
- Brains stay with brains.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,315
If a bomb goes off,
their genes form the same cliques.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,273
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.
- I'm sorry.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,632
You're a really nice guy.
We don't wanna see you get hurt.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,436
I wanna get hurt!

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,035
"It's almost over. We've gone
to school together for three years."

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,639
- I might cut that part.
- Why? That's fine. It's nice.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,675
"Having taken courses at the
university, I've glimpsed our future.

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,030
And all I can say is:

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,831
'Go back.'"

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,830
"Go back"? What a great line.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,679
- You like it?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,635
- I didn't think anyone would get it.
- No, it's wonderful. It's...

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,037
No, don't worry about it.
You're very funny.

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,429
- "Go back." That's great.
- No more. I'm gonna save it.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,190
<i>I decided long ago</i>

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,756
<i>Never to walk in anyone's shadow</i>

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,349
<i>If I fail</i>
<i>If I succeed</i>

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,239
<i>At least I live as I believe</i>

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,477
<i>No matter what they take from me</i>

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,076
<i>They can't take away my dignity</i>

40
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,875
<i>Because the greatest love of all</i>

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,193
<i>Is happening to me</i>

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,837
<i>I found the greatest</i>

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,072
<i>Love of all inside of me</i>

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,232
I love you guys!

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,233
Thanks, pal.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,274
Party at Vahlere's.
Gonna be eight kegs. Be there.

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,038
Thank you, Joe.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,309
Thank you.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,396
And now it's time.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,674
I just can't introduce this person
without saying, "History...

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,190
...oceanography, creative writing...

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,752
...biochemistry. " I think
you know who I'm talking about.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,634
We'll remember this student who said:

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,991
"Hey, worid. Check me out!"

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,471
Giving a speech entitled
"Soaring Ahead"...

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,238
...Miss Diane Court.

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,638
Thank you.

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,799
The real worid.

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,473
Look at those eyes.

60
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,229
We're all about to enter
the real worid.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,830
That's what everybody says.

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,439
But most of us have been
in the real worid a long time.

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,039
But I've something to tell everybody.

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,113
I've glimpsed our future
and all I can say is:

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,389
"Go back."

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,433
Well...

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,636
...it's almost over.

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,751
We've gone to school together
for three years...

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,070
...and we've been through a lot.

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,035
But with that training net
of high school gone...

71
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,438
...what's gonna happen to us?
We all know what the answers are.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,634
We wanna be happy, go to college,
work hard, maybe raise a family.

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,799
But what if that doesn't happen?
I have to be honest, though.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,028
I have all the hope
and ambition in the worid.

75
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,632
But when I think about the future...

76
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,831
...the truth is...

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,272
...I am...

78
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,832
...really...

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,793
...scared.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,072
All right. Get up on it.
Yay! All right.

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,032
- See you at home.
- Okay.

82
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,630
Do yourself and everyone
who loves you a favor.

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,269
- Don't talk to Joe.
- Mom...

84
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,431
Stop, okay?

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,029
- Bye.
- See you later, Mrs. Flood.

86
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,475
- Look at those eyes.
- Give it up.

87
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,109
- Take a picture of me with her.
- Lloyd.

88
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,073
- That's just embarrassing.
- Please?

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,037
- All right, okay.
- Do it.

90
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,114
- Wait till I get around to her.
- All right, man. I got it.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,949
Your graduation present
is parked right over there.

92
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,231
Are you kidding? That?!

93
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,035
- Lloyd?
- Hey, sis!

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,676
I'm sorry. I had a new crown,
three root canals...

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,874
...and Jason has a sore throat.
Your graduation and no one was there.

96
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,715
I called Mom and Dad,
and it's like they were there.

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,071
- I hope you understand.
- Hey. Bad throat, huh, J-man?

98
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,269
Yeah.

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,631
He's not at full "Yeah!" strength.

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,231
Poor little man.

101
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,353
Why do you eat that stuff?
There's no food in your food.

102
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,275
- Too loud. The red line has a purpose.
- How do you know how to draw it?

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,109
It's loud enough,
and the neighbors don't complain.

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,995
Good thing there's not
a red line on you. Yeah!

105
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,758
- Yeah!
- He's back!

106
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,316
My brother, can I borrow
your <i>Hey, Soul Classics</i>?

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,239
My brother, you gotta go buy your own.

108
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,831
- Hook it off the jab.
- Can't you be an uncle, not a playmate?

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,872
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

110
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,792
Get in a good mood. How hard is it
to decide to be in a good mood...

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,073
...and then be in a good mood?
- Gee, it's easy.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,072
I'm sorry Mom and Dad
made you take me in.

113
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,829
If it's a big deal, I'll go.
But you used to be fun.

114
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,873
You were warped, twisted
and hilarious.

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,435
I mean it as a compliment.

116
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,437
I mean, I'm sorry...

117
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,839
...that T-l-M left you.

118
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,832
But I am not T-l-M.

119
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,834
- I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,838
I still am.

121
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,478
- You gotta teach me stick shift.
Promise.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,037
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,479
What are you doing?

124
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,638
Since I'm both your father
and your friend...

125
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,719
...I had to get you two presents.
- God, this is ridiculous.

126
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,515
Here's the only thing
your mom gave me that I kept.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,233
Now it's yours.

128
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,631
Go ahead. Open it now.

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,630
I don't need all these presents.
I don't know any kid who got a car.

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,637
Oh, God.

131
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,233
Wow, it's beautiful.

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,232
They really applauded
for you today, honey.

133
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,236
Looking at all the people,
I felt like they didn't know me.

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,039
Maybe I shouldn't have taken
all those courses off school...

135
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,636
...because everybody thinks I...

136
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,671
- Forget it.
- Wait a minute.

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,271
- Everybody thinks you're what?
- Everybody thinks I'm a priss.

138
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,476
Diane, in a million years,
you could never be a priss.

139
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,716
It's all working out for you, honey.
Do you see?

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,559
It's working out just like we planned.

141
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,230
All the summer schools,
the vacations you gave up...

142
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,635
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,039
Sorry.

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,638
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, honey.

145
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,835
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,788
Yah! Yah!

147
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,994
Diane Court!

148
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,439
Suck it.

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,631
Come on. Get the bag.

150
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,555
An exciting kick.
My brother. Let's go.

151
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,548
Yah! Yah! Yah!

152
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,633
You're headed for daycare, buddy.

153
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,630
- Be tough, J-man.
- He's a mess!

154
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,436
I'll be in my office.

155
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,632
- I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
- Yeah!

156
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,436
Please, not in my ear. Not in my ear.

157
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,436
<i>Jim Court.</i>
- Hello. May I please speak with Diane?

158
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,871
- Sorry, Diane isn't in at the moment.
- Oh, okay.

159
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,640
<i>- This the guy with the Mustang?</i>
- No.

160
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,753
- Guy with the Datsun?
- No.

161
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,470
- The truck?
- No, not really.

162
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,837
You don't know me.
I'm a friend of Diane's.

163
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,591
I sat with her yesterday at a mall.
I drive a blue Chevy Malibu.

164
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,509
I'm pretty bad at this,
but what I want to do is, can I...?

165
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,235
<i>Give me your number.</i>
<i>That's usually how it works.</i>

166
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,635
Okay. Lloyd Dobler. 555-1342.

167
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,196
It's 555-1342.

168
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,437
<i>- 555- 1342.</i>
- Okay, I'll get her the message.

169
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,200
- She's pretty great, isn't she?
<i>- What?</i>

170
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,871
- She's really pretty great, isn't she?
- She is. Good luck, kid.

171
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,038
Good afternoon. Okay, bye.

172
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,832
Jim Court.

173
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,237
No, this is her father. Can I take...?

174
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,239
What?

175
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,235
No, I didn't get the letter.

176
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,510
Yes!

177
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,035
Yes, right away.

178
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,631
Yeah, thank you. Goodbye.

179
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,353
<i>Ricky, don't lose that number</i>

180
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,034
<i>Don't call nobody else</i>

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,838
<i>Send it off in a letter</i>
<i>To yourself</i>

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,234
<i>Ricky, don't lose that number</i>

183
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,077
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
You're a vision in green.

184
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,115
I'll mail this for you. You can trust
a man who writes a letter daily.

185
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,835
- Diane here? I gotta talk to her.
- She's upstairs.

186
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,150
I gotta tell you this carefully.
Would you mind?

187
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,316
- Just a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,239
Great. It won't be long. Thanks.

189
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,038
What?

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,990
- I had a phone call.
- Tell me.

191
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,156
- Is it bad news?
- Just listen.

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,830
You won the Reed Fellowship.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,877
Are you kidding?

194
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,350
You're not kidding?
You're not kidding!

195
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,717
You'll study at
the finest institute in England.

196
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,639
- The toughest fellowship in England.
- I won?

197
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,879
You're gonna take a big step.
I want one thing from you.

198
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,436
You stand up straight.
Admit you're special.

199
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,671
- God. I'll have to go on a plane.
- Worry about that later.

200
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,316
Now, come on.
Tell me that you're special.

201
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,114
You're too good at making me nervous.

202
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,518
Listen! You're the best
in the country, don't you understand?

203
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,757
It's like a pyramid.
It starts with everyone...

204
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,474
...and it narrows through your life.

205
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,514
The competition narrows it down
to one brilliant person...

206
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,236
...who is so special they celebrate
you on two continents. It's you.

207
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,428
So tell me something.
Where's the flaw in that?

208
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,036
There is no flaw.

209
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,469
Hello?

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,230
Yeah, just a second, Corey.

211
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,112
Oh, sorry.

212
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,958
Diane Court.

213
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,632
- Don't go in there.
- Forget it. It's mine!

214
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,831
It's too bad.

215
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,432
No noise, no sound,
no movement, nothing.

216
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,513
Hello. Diane?

217
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,756
Hi. You called me?

218
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,238
I read about your fellowship,
and I'm glad you called me back.

219
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
I just wanted to congratulate you...

220
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,954
...and tell you I thought
your speech was incredible.

221
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,708
- Thank you very much.
- Whoa, what a day, huh?

222
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,639
<i>Yeah. What a day.</i>

223
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,671
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

224
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,068
- Do you know who I am?
<i>- We sat together at Bell Square.</i>

225
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,829
- You remember.
- No, I read it on the message.

226
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,637
Okay, so it's Lloyd and let's go out.

227
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,718
<i>- You wanna go out?</i>
- Thanks, but I'm busy.

228
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,830
- Busy.
<i>- Things are pretty hectic, but thanks.</i>

229
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,635
- You busy on Friday?
- Yeah, I have to help my father.

230
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,039
- How about Saturday?
- I have things to do around the house.

231
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,837
So you're too monumentally busy?

232
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,390
Well, not monumentally.

233
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,239
What about tonight then?
You going to Vahlere's party?

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,514
You can't leave the country
without going to Vahlere's.

235
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,350
The gentleman is 22 and comes out
of hiding once a year for this...

236
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,588
...dressed as the Lakeside Rooster.
He makes Purple Passion drinks...

237
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,872
- I think that...
- You're not in England yet.

238
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,548
I lived in England for three months.

239
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,959
My parents are in the Army,
so we lived in England and Germany.

240
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,628
I could give you many English tips.

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,595
- Well...
- I won't give any tips of any kind.

242
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,392
- I'll go.
- Pardon me?

243
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,034
- I'll go.
- You will?

244
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,029
Excellent. This is great.

245
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,390
- You will, really?
- I'll go.

246
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,674
We're going out. It's a date.
It's a scam. Whatever. All right.

247
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,348
- I'll pick you up at what, 8:00?
- Eight.

248
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,759
Eight o'clock.

249
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,039
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

250
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,430
Lloyd Dobler...

251
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,438
Thank you, little man.

252
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,515
Now work that bag, J-man.
Hook off the jab. Straight left hand.

253
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,314
- What do we love?
- Pain!

254
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,638
Work that jab! Work that hook!
Okay, take a break.

255
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,236
Be right there!

256
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,311
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir.

257
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,272
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

258
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,029
Heard about the graduation gift.
Really quite a car.

259
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,437
I know you're busy
so no need to entertain me.

260
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,599
You can trust me. I'm 19.
Was overseas for a few semesters.

261
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,032
I rarely drink, as I kickbox.
It's the sport of the future.

262
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,949
Don Wilson? Benny Urquidez?
Your face says no.

263
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,234
Your daughter will be safe with me
for the next seven to eight hours.

264
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,392
Fine, Lloyd.

265
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,830
- Come in.
- Thank you.

266
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,513
- How you doing?
- I'm...

267
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,234
- Is she around?
- Honey?

268
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,789
Whoa.

269
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,636
Hi.

270
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,031
- Would you hold this for me?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,030
- What are these?
- Bavarian Dutch-style pretzels.

272
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,473
Um... Would it be terrible
if I wanted to go home early?

273
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,630
No.

274
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,750
You're not gonna believe this.

275
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,632
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

276
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,833
Hi, Lloyd.

277
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,992
You okay? Want a drink?

278
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,031
What's up, Lloyd?

279
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,034
- What's happening?
- What's up, man?

280
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,076
Hey, Dobler!
We are out of control!

281
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,470
That's not happening.

282
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,638
Now I gotta go to summer school.

283
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,234
How you doing?

284
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,115
- It's gotta stay purple all night.
- How you doing?

285
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,232
- You know Diane Court?
- Diane! Well...

286
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,512
- I need you to be the Keymaster.
- I was just...

287
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,871
He's very responsible. Thanks a lot.

288
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,511
- I was gonna move around. Thanks.
- "Keymaster"?

289
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,111
I gotta judge who can drive
and who can't, and keep their keys.

290
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,231
- So it's an honor.
- No.

291
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,152
- We finally graduated, big-dude guy!
- All right!

292
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,476
I'm so glad you came to this.

293
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,309
I've always wanted you
to come to one of these.

294
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,239
I wish you'd done that
without the keys!

295
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,910
- Come on. There are so many cute guys.
Let go of me!

296
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,237
- I love you, man!
- I love you too.

297
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,590
- Homeboy! Mike Cameron. How you doing?
- Hey.

298
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,237
- What?
- Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam.

299
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,474
I don't know you very well,
but I wanted to ask you...

300
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,917
...how you got Diane Court
to go out with you.

301
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,634
- I called her.
- But how come it worked?

302
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,071
- I mean, like, what are you?
- I'm Lloyd Dobler.

303
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,792
- Great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
- All right.

304
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,989
Key?

305
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,514
I wrote 63 songs
about Joe this year...

306
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,871
...and I'm gonna play
every one tonight.

307
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,436
I just saw Joe. He's here.

308
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,196
Don't be so dramatic about it.

309
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,836
You did try and kill yourself
because of the guy.

310
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,188
What was it like afterwards?
I've always wanted to know.

311
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,198
She explained it
in "Wake up, Seattle."

312
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,631
Stop. I am fine now. I am all right.

313
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,435
All everybody does is ask me
about this. I am fine.

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,235
Did Joe come with Mimi tonight?

315
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,233
Keys.

316
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,838
Keys, everybody.

317
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,429
- All right, Keymaster.
- Right.

318
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,358
- How you doing?
- Good.

319
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,994
I got you!
- How are you, Mrs. Evans?

320
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,078
You missed every
career counseling session.

321
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,635
Call me obsessive-compulsive,
but we must do this now.

322
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,233
- No way!
- Lloyd.

323
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,509
- What?
- You must...

324
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,392
- Get away!
- What did I do?

325
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,114
- Don't even follow me!
- Don't do this.

326
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,880
Don't make me sound like a counselor.

327
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,435
I've got statistics and graphs.

328
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,712
I got all this stuff
that say the same thing:

329
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,032
"You have to decide on a career."

330
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,710
My dad's an Army colonel.
He wants me to join.

331
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,036
There's no possible way.

332
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,437
Take a look at Seattle Junior College.

333
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,633
- You the Keymaster?
- I'm not gonna go there.

334
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,993
I'm looking for something bigger...

335
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,033
...a dare-to-be-great situation.

336
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,711
- Only your record is blank.
- Do people really know what they want?

337
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,708
Many think they have to know.
But inside, they don't.

338
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,878
I don't know.
But I know that I don't know.

339
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,638
Hang tough, Lloyd.

340
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,309
We were "ultra-competitive"...

341
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,399
...but I just want to say
if it wasn't for "Diane Court"...

342
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,799
...I wouldn't have gotten in Cornell.
You made me study twice as hard.

343
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,996
So thanks.

344
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,998
- You did the same for me.
- I did?

345
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,952
Did you really come here
with Lloyd Dobler?

346
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,432
- How did that "happen"?
- He made me laugh.

347
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,594
Yes.

348
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,036
He's okay, Dad.

349
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,430
You're welcome.
I always call you. You know that.

350
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,919
Stop being so grateful. All right.
I'll be home before dawn, okay?

351
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,231
- Bye.
- Dawn?

352
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,234
- Would you guys sign my annual?
- Sure.

353
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,035
- Would you sign mine?
- Did you have to call your dad?

354
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,357
- God, how nightmarish!
- I promised.

355
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,516
- Will he wait up?
- Say nothing.

356
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,393
I come in crying. He leaves me alone.

357
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,797
I loved your speech,
about being scared.

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,036
Lloyd Dobler. All right.

359
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,117
<i>He...</i>

360
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,314
<i>... likes giris...</i>

361
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,079
<i>... with names...</i>

362
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,755
<i>... like Ashley...</i>

363
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,670
<i>... and Tamerlane</i>

364
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,831
I'll be in the kitchen, Joe.

365
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,118
<i>That'll never be me</i>
<i>That'll never be me</i>

366
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,914
<i>That'll never be</i>
<i>Never be me, no!</i>

367
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,112
<i>That'll never be me</i>
<i>That'll never be me</i>

368
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,838
Joe. Joe.

369
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,278
<i>Sex, love...</i>

370
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,600
She's written 65 songs.
Sixty-five. They're all about you.

371
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,315
- They're all about pain.
- So, what's up?

372
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,671
So stop playing
with her mind, you know?

373
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,396
She's a human being.
She's very talented.

374
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,310
Why do you think I keep her tapes?
They're gonna be valuable someday.

375
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,509
<i>No</i>

376
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,273
<i>Never</i>

377
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,155
<i>No, never, ever, ever</i>
<i>Don't you ever think it</i>

378
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,631
Oh, my God.

379
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,879
Joe was my first love, my first sex,
and the whole time he was dating Mimi.

380
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,959
He'll never break up with her.
But if I see him, it's:

381
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,038
"Hi, Joe. How are you?"
And that is it.

382
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,037
I'll be okay.

383
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,916
Don't worry.
He's at the other end of the house.

384
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,032
It's too bad more guys
can't be like Lloyd.

385
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,229
He checks up on me. Look.

386
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,278
I got some more songs.

387
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,038
<i>Joe lies</i>

388
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,435
<i>Joe lies</i>

389
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,994
<i>Joe lies</i>

390
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,197
<i>When he cries</i>

391
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,831
<i>When he cries</i>

392
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,236
- So we can finally talk.
- Yeah.

393
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,476
Well... What?

394
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,113
<i>Lakewood, Lakewood, have no fear!</i>

395
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,437
<i>How about another year?</i>

396
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,430
- He does this every year?
- The worst job since Keymaster.

397
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,234
Hi, Joe. How are you?

398
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,638
I love you.

399
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,831
I love you too.

400
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,430
You invade my soul.

401
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,435
I wanna get back together.

402
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,510
Mimi's gonna go to college,
and I'm gonna be alone.

403
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,235
But I'm gonna break up with her
before she leaves.

404
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,438
Have sex with me.

405
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,674
Goodbye, Joe.

406
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,196
Every year I throw this party.
Every year nobody helps me clean up.

407
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,470
- Why am I yelling?
- I don't know.

408
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,432
- We're out of here.
- Thanks.

409
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,714
- Maybe we'll help you clean tomorrow.
- Diane, everyone loved that you came.

410
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,831
- You're a great rooster.
- Well...

411
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,632
- Sign this?
- Okay.

412
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,909
Hey, Corey.

413
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,193
So I'm single now.
Everything's changed. I hate it.

414
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,032
- Give me my Firebird keys!
- You must chill!

415
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,231
You must chill!

416
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,273
I have hidden your keys! Chill!

417
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,358
- I love you!
- Love you too. Go to sleep.

418
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,279
- We're full-on buds.
- Yeah, all right.

419
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,712
You're a great person.

420
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,071
I'm a good person,
but you're a great person.

421
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,114
- We're out of there. See you tomorrow.
- See you. Bye.

422
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,276
- Bye, Diane.
- Bye.

423
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,672
Hey, drive safe.

424
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,749
Thank you.

425
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,111
I surrender my duties
as Keymaster. A beer.

426
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,078
Certainly.

427
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,949
I'm happy to say that this sack
is officially empty.

428
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,270
The back bathroom. Let's go.

429
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,235
- Look at this gentleman here.
I gotta get home.

430
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,678
I gotta get home.

431
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,112
Excuse me.

432
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,872
How you doing, brother?

433
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,555
I don't even know where we are.

434
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,075
<i>I'm gonna play three hours</i>
<i>of commercial-free rock...</i>

435
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,670
- Oh, I love this album.
- This is a good one.

436
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,679
Like it?

437
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,674
Do you recognize anything yet?
Anything?

438
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,997
<i>Lord, have mercy.</i>

439
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,476
<i>Three hours of</i>
<i>commercial-free rock...</i>

440
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,069
That's my house! I live there.

441
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,919
Have a good sleep.

442
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,479
Bye.

443
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,873
Thanks a lot.

444
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,074
Hey, you guys are the best.
Give me a call or...

445
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,076
- Look at this one.
- Did you...?

446
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,276
So, what did they write
to Diane Court?

447
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,557
Listen to some of the things
they wrote me.

448
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,878
"Glad I finally met you.
You always seemed nice."

449
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,232
"Wish I'd known you more."

450
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,873
Mine says stuff like,
"Lloyd, see you around, maybe."

451
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,278
- Nobody knew me before.
- They knew of you. Now they know you.

452
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,955
I feel like I fit in for
the first time, you know?

453
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,870
Like I just held them far away
from me, so they did the same to me.

454
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,918
That's cool then.

455
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,030
Yeah.

456
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,876
I'm so glad we did this.

457
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,278
We can walk from here.

458
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,913
- It's just you and your dad?
- Long story.

459
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,680
- You don't wanna hear it.
- Sure, I do.

460
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,679
Well, my parents split up
when I was 13 and...

461
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,675
God, I actually had to go to court
and choose between the two of them.

462
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,874
So I chose my dad. Just felt
safer that way, you know?

463
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,877
Watch out for that glass.

464
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,668
Thanks.

465
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,476
- But either way it's still...
- Twisted.

466
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,679
You know what? You're a great date.

467
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,552
I've never gone out
with someone so basic.

468
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,875
Basic?

469
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,914
- What's your job this summer?
- Being a great date.

470
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,190
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

471
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,358
I wanna see you as much as I can.
I said it!

472
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,473
- I only have something like 16 weeks.
- That's a long time.

473
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,754
- Then call me tomorrow.
- Today is tomorrow.

474
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,078
- Then call me later.
- Okay.

475
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,515
Thanks.

476
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,711
I'll call you later.

477
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,478
Morning, honey.

478
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,270
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Good night.

479
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,671
Wait. Wait a minute.

480
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,078
How was Lloyd?

481
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,873
Lloyd was a gentleman.
He was funny, nervous and strange.

482
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,074
I met people I'd never met before.
Then I blew it. I called him "basic."

483
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,670
- Can you believe I did that?
- Well...

484
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,469
I don't think he's reeling
in embarrassment.

485
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,275
Good night.

486
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,276
Good night.

487
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,996
Lloyd is doomed.
- Meaning?

488
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,796
She made this date a family audition,
the kiss of death for Lloyd.

489
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,594
- Why?
- Too much pressure. Not his crowd.

490
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,672
What's wrong with her?

491
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,278
- I told him to be himself.
- He has that nervous talking thing.

492
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,357
I told him not to speak.

493
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,111
This is a strange thing to say,
but maybe Diane really likes Lloyd.

494
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,835
If you were her,
would you honestly fall for Lloyd?

495
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

496
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,789
Yeah.

497
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,637
Should I wear this dress?
- Yeah.

498
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,669
- Or I could always wear this one.
- That's nice.

499
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,316
I forgot to tell you
who'll be at dinner tonight.

500
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,957
My dad's accountant and two women
that work in his nursing home.

501
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,072
I know you don't know them,
but it'll be fun.

502
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,991
- Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
- I know. I've had it forever.

503
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,476
I used to mark the words
that I looked up.

504
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,872
Or I have this one.

505
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,719
- Nice one.
- Yeah?

506
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,515
- Yeah, you should wear that.
- Think so?

507
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,071
- Better get downstairs, huh?
- I'll change.

508
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,477
Great meal, you two.

509
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,273
- You look beautiful, Diane.
- Thank you.

510
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,677
Same features. See what
a few millimeters can do?

511
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,555
What airline are you flying?
- A charter.

512
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,876
She's not the greatest flyer.

513
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,559
- When she was 8...
- Dad.

514
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,389
- Now, why can't I tell the story?
- What story?

515
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,479
- If you're gonna tell it, let me.
- Well, let me start.

516
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,710
I decide to take her
on her first airplane.

517
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,753
I knew how planes flew
but I was nervous.

518
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,872
Crash paranoia.

519
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,358
I had a list. If babies were on
the plane, it couldn't crash.

520
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,552
But their crying meant
they knew something.

521
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,709
They closed the doors and she screams,
like nobody I'd ever heard.

522
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,428
- You said, "Turn around."
- They did.

523
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,153
- Let me finish.
- Okay.

524
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,158
So two federal marshals
meet the plane.

525
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,480
They take our address and ask us
never to fly the friendly skies again.

526
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,071
- You never flew?
- No.

527
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,158
But there's more!

528
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,920
There was somebody on the plane...

529
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,237
...who worked in a recording studio.

530
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,355
He's making a sound effects record,
and he wants to record her scream.

531
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,996
Which they did. And once
in a while on a commercial...

532
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,671
...you can hear me scream.

533
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,879
You two are amazing. You know?

534
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,874
The way you... The way you talk.

535
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,676
I'm just like that...
I'm not like that with anybody.

536
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,596
- Stellar jukebox, sir.
- Thanks.

537
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,000
- How do you obtain one of those?
- What did we pay for the Wurlitzer?

538
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,273
The guy didn't want to part with it.
A matter of $9000?

539
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,631
- So you graduated Lakewood, right?
- Yes, sir.

540
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,718
- What are you gonna do now?
- Yeah, Lloyd.

541
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,873
What are your plans for the future?

542
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,558
Spend as much time as possible
with Diane before she leaves.

543
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,829
Seriously.

544
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,476
- I'm totally and completely serious.
- No, really.

545
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,078
You mean a career?

546
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,511
I don't know. I've...

547
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,072
I've thought about this quite a bit,
and I would have to say...

548
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,388
...I don't wanna sell, buy,
or process anything as a career.

549
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,828
Or sell anything bought or processed
or buy anything sold or processed...

550
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,634
...or process anything
sold or bought...

551
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,628
...or repair anything sold,
bought or processed.

552
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,717
My father's in the Army.

553
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,072
He wants me to join, but I can't
work for that corporation.

554
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,078
So lately I've been kickboxing.

555
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,270
Which is a new sport,
but I think it's got a good future.

556
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,635
As far as career longevity,
you can't really tell.

557
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,752
Eight and six as a fighter is no good.

558
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,873
But I can't tell if I'm great
until I've had pro fights.

559
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,391
I haven't been knocked down.

560
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,118
I can't figure it all out,
so I'm gonna hang with Diane.

561
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,076
Hello.

562
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,669
- Mr. James Court?
- Can I help you?

563
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,474
I'm Mr. Sims. This is Mr. Talbot.

564
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,194
We're special agents of the IRS.

565
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,757
We'd like to inform you that you're
under criminal investigation...

566
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,475
...for the tax years
1982 through 1986.

567
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,195
Jesus. What, I live in
a palace, right?

568
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,073
I have guests here.

569
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,796
- Understand the following...
- Speak with my lawyer.

570
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,911
You won't answer questions?

571
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,557
Just come down to my office.
I have guests.

572
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,992
We will be contacting a number
of your business associates...

573
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,476
- This evening is over.
...and your former wife.

574
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,838
Mom, please.

575
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,795
I do have a history with this man,
and it's not the greatest.

576
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,756
I see you so seldom.
I'd rather hear about you.

577
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,349
This is me telling you about me.

578
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,314
I don't know if you have a boyfriend.

579
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,278
What could be more important
than what's going on with Dad?

580
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,277
If we could talk about boys,
everything would be so much easier.

581
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,671
Your room is always ready.
You can always come home if you want.

582
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,274
All right. What do you want me to do?

583
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,833
If they ask you questions...

584
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,749
...would you please say
something nice about him, Mom?

585
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,473
Help him?

586
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,517
- All right.
- You will?

587
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,676
Okay. Oh, here's Ray.

588
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,313
Talk to him. When you don't,
your mouth turns down. Hi!

589
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,476
Hello, pretty ladies.

590
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,315
Hi, Diane.

591
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,073
Hi, Ray.

592
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,757
What are you doing after work?

593
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,669
<i>I have a break after dinner,</i>
<i>if you wanna stop by.</i>

594
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,677
- Wanna do something later?
- I know you think my job's strange.

595
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,031
- You don't like old people, do you?
- Sure I do.

596
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,434
<i>Come on.</i>

597
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,234
I used to work at a smorgasbord.

598
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,512
Old people came, and they love to eat.

599
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,874
They jammed their mouths, ate with
their mouths open and it was too much.

600
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,913
You think about how short life is...

601
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,153
...and how maybe life has no meaning.
You're frying burgers.

602
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,148
<i>Then you're like 60, you die</i>
<i>and what are you doing?</i>

603
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,275
I don't need to think about it.
That's the reason I was...

604
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,030
But I'm not sure I'm right.

605
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,836
That's ageism, being prejudiced
against people because they're old.

606
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,669
- Maybe their mouths don't work well.
- Really?

607
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,750
Well, you're really
turning me around here.

608
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,918
<i>I was looking at it</i>
<i>the wrong way, I think.</i>

609
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,513
- Should I still come by?
- Stop by later.

610
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,399
<i>- Okay. I will.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

611
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,269
I'll see you later. Bye.

612
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,712
You have to meet Bess.

613
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,236
She's amazing. She's 93.
She's a writer.

614
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,876
- And I told her about you.
- You told her about me?

615
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,478
What did you say?

616
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,072
Just meet her.

617
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,272
This is Bess. Lloyd, Bess.

619
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,674
- Hello.
- Hello.

620
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,271
You're too tall.

621
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,074
She likes you.

622
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,878
Okay, how you doing?

623
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,273
I'm Lloyd.

624
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,756
We're gonna watch <i>Cocoon.</i> I haven't
seen it but I hear it's good.

625
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,272
I hear it makes you happy,
so I figure that's a good film to see.

626
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,155
Some older people go to space...
Hope I didn't spoil it.

627
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,920
It hasn't started yet, Mr. Taylor.

628
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,678
- Thank you.
Good!

629
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,313
You gonna stay?
Sure.

630
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,513
Why can't I eat popcorn?
I'll get you something.

631
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,039
Okay. So here we go with <i>Cocoon.</i>

632
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,269
- So they're cool.
- That was good.

633
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,080
I feel so bad being with you.

634
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,478
I feel like I should be spending
more time with my dad.

635
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,278
Half the time I'm with you,
I'm thinking of other things.

636
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,192
Everybody does that.

637
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,030
I just don't want it to get too heavy.
I feel really overloaded.

638
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,551
I have a theory that good things
always happen with bad things.

639
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,311
I know you have to deal with them
at the same time but I just...

640
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,229
I don't know why they have
to happen at the same time.

641
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,514
I wish I could work out a schedule.
Am I babbling? Know what I mean?

642
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,073
No.

643
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,953
I just can't have a social life now.

644
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,078
Don't worry, we're just
having coffee. We'll be anti-social.

645
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,999
- Be friends?
- Yeah. With potential.

646
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,955
Friends with potential.

647
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,039
Keep going in first.
Feel the clutch. Put it in a little.

648
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,869
It'll come out. Then you'll feel...
A little more.

649
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,868
That's right. Go around, in first.
Keep it in first.

650
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,758
It's kind of all right.

651
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,159
When you feel you're confident,
if you'll just ease into second...

652
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,070
All right. Well, put it...

653
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,311
- Am I wrecking my car?
- You are a little bit.

654
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,278
But listen...

655
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,950
...when you feel it start to give,
put the clutch in.

656
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,676
- I was putting the gas on when...
- Because... Little more gas.

657
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,668
Ease it out. All right.
Don't worry. Minor setback.

658
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,317
You feel confident? You feel better.

659
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,273
Now go into second. Little more gas.

660
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,515
Yeah.

661
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,274
You'll get this. No problem.

662
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,475
Now, maybe, you downshift. First.

663
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,478
- Does this sound normal?
- As you get better, you'll hear less.

664
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,273
Brake.

665
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,678
Let's switch. Wanna switch?
I'll drive?

666
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,673
I'm sorry.

667
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,876
- Let's go. You want to?
- Yeah.

668
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,471
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

669
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,478
Are you shaking?

670
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,075
No.

671
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,278
You're shaking.

672
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,678
- I don't think so.
- You're cold.

673
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,075
- I don't think I am.
- Then why are you shaking?

674
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,032
I don't know.

675
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,478
I think I'm happy.

676
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,271
Here's some blanket.

677
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,472
Listen to this song.
It's a really good song.

678
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,878
Good morning.

679
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,190
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- You should be.

680
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,075
- I should have called.
- You bet you should have!

681
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,432
Don't make me call the police.
Don't make me call hospitals.

682
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,950
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I know this is a bad time.

683
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,072
I'm not asking what you did.
I wanna know...

684
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,754
...if you're okay.
- I'm fine.

685
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,669
You wanna make things easier?
Tell me where you were.

686
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,677
This is bullshit!

687
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,876
- You can say anything to me, you know.
- I know that.

688
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,876
I spent the night with him.

689
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,672
- Lloyd?
- Dad, yes.

690
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,671
And I'm scared to death of what
you must think of me right now.

691
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,668
Sit down.

692
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,474
Dad, do you know what he did
the first night I went out with him?

693
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,520
We were walking across by the 7-11...

694
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,355
...and he pointed out some glass
for me to walk around.

695
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,870
I think of that when people say,
"What are you doing with Lloyd?"

696
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,879
And I never get nervous around him.

697
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,878
So we started spending all
this time together, as friends.

698
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,076
But I could feel him getting anxious.

699
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,913
And then...

700
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,075
...I knew that there would be
a confrontation over getting physical.

701
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,629
He started to get that look
at the end of the night.

702
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,671
Do you know that look?

703
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,235
You know it will be an issue.

704
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,275
So I went through all the feelings
and arguments you go through...

705
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,916
- Did he ever get rough with you?
- Dad, no.

706
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,468
But I didn't want any problems,
so I decided not to sleep with him.

707
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,280
But then I attacked him anyway.

708
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,956
It always feels good
to tell you the truth.

709
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,673
Because...

710
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,476
...if I can't share it with you,
it's almost like it didn't happen.

711
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,072
Did you sleep with her?

712
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,948
- I admit nothing.
- It's us.

713
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,359
- Look at his face. He did the deed.
- You're an inspiration, Lloyd.

714
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,152
All right, calm down.
Nothing's different.

715
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,354
Lloyd, listen to me. Everything
has changed. You've had sex.

716
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,553
Nothing will ever be the same
between you two.

717
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,038
You might be 60, you'll see her,
talk to her, whatever...

718
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,755
But what you'll really
be thinking is, "We had sex."

719
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,355
- Your point?
- Do something special.

720
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,915
- You gotta make a statement.
- Wait...

721
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,556
Show her respect.
Show her you're not like Joe.

722
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,239
- Wait...
- Above all...

723
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,637
...just because this happened
gives you no right...

724
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,116
- You never let me talk.
- What? I'm sorry. Talk.

725
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,835
Forgot what I was gonna say.

726
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,951
Okay, I remember.

727
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,479
- Let him do what he wants.
- All right.

728
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,877
Send her flowers
or write her a letter.

729
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,829
I already did.

730
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,516
- What's it say?
- Just read it.

731
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,278
I can read it?

732
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,152
Oh, man.

733
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,278
"Dear Diane:

734
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,389
I'll always be there for you.
All the love in my heart...

735
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,874
...LIoyd."

736
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,031
I've never gotten a letter
like this. Have you?

737
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,038
- I dream about it.
- So, what do you think?

738
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,472
- You think I'm...?
- Get ready for greatness, Lloyd.

739
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,675
The Cynthia Bramson estate
was worth how much?

740
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,077
- Her family...
- Family? Never heard from them.

741
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,078
I sold her house for her.
Made her money.

742
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,359
Your income, Mr. Court...

743
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,870
...hasn't changed substantially
in 17 years.

744
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,195
That's right.

745
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,752
Why would you stay so long
with an operation...

746
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,032
...that is clearly not
a growth enterprise?

747
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,232
Caring for people
isn't a growth enterprise.

748
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,671
Write that down.
I'd like your boss to read it.

749
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,238
Diane!

750
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,470
Ticket to England came today.

751
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,116
Maybe I shouldn't go
with all that's happening.

752
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,309
You're going.

753
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,672
If a friend were in the same position,
I'd tell her to stay.

754
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,348
- You're going.
- It doesn't feel right.

755
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,075
- I don't even have the right luggage.
<i>- Bon voyage.</i>

756
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,394
- You're not listening to me.
- Let's stop this right now.

757
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,275
Let's not put our energy
into something ridiculous.

758
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,317
This isn't smart thinking.

759
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,832
Why are you acting this way?
Is it because of the other morning?

760
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,075
You love him?

761
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,277
- I like him a lot.
- Now, I know you like him.

762
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,358
He's not like those
frat kids you dislike.

763
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,949
But when the excitement wears off...

764
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,720
...what are you gonna talk about?

765
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,032
You'll be in an
international think tank...

766
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,869
...and he's gonna be
kicking punching bags.

767
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,119
I think you should break up with him.

768
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,914
Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.

769
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,596
It'd be best to get on
that plane with no strings...

770
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,678
...because once you leave,
things will change.

771
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,952
I've talked about this
with you and with him.

772
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,151
It's well-covered territory.

773
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,911
I'm not asking you to sever
all relations with the boy.

774
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,515
Give him a present. Here.

775
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,349
Let him know you still care.
Give him this pen.

776
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,629
A pen?

777
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,072
Dad, in a million years,
I would never give him a pen.

778
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,829
Why can't I have fun? I like him.

779
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,953
"I like him"? I'm talking
about being honest and decent...

780
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,071
Dad, I love him.

781
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,874
Great.

782
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,478
No, that's great.

783
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,558
It's great to hear
you say that because...

784
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,672
I don't know.
What, am I being selfish?

785
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,876
Why am I so fixated?

786
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,232
Maybe because I've got
a lot of troubles with...

787
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,079
Is that it? Am I being selfish?

788
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,871
I want you to have everything.
Is that wrong?

789
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,991
I owe you an apology.

790
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,476
I've just got a few weeks
left with you and we...

791
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,879
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

792
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,076
They think I'm guilty.

793
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,671
Some computer spits out your name
and another honest man...

794
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,676
What's the goddamn point?

795
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,078
Live your life.

796
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,710
- I love you.
- Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.

797
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,197
All right now, power left!

798
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,668
Power right!

799
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,071
- Who's worid champ?
- Don "The Dragon" Wilson!

800
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,038
Lloyd! Telephone!

801
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,759
Keep kicking.

802
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,669
Hello?

803
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,029
Hi.

804
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,753
How you doing?

805
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,960
Yeah, they actually pay me for this.

806
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,550
I'll pick you up in an hour.

807
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,558
See you later.

808
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,151
Check your mail tomorrow.

809
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,477
I sent you a letter. A blue letter.

810
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,597
- It came yesterday.
- It did?

811
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,394
- It was wonderful.
- You didn't tell me?

812
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,036
- It was wonderful.
- I never sent a letter like that.

813
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,708
I sent it... Well, I don't know...

814
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,032
I wanted to say something
but I didn't.

815
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,198
But I think I want to now.
But I'm not sure.

816
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,631
Many say it and don't mean it,
but I think I do.

817
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,832
- So I wanted to say...
- We don't have to say it.

818
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,429
- How do you know what it is?
- I don't...

819
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,756
...but thank you.
- I love you.

820
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,358
- I said it.
- I know.

821
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,869
- Let's not put things on this level.
- What? This is a good level.

822
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,158
Isn't it?

823
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,150
- How can I look at you and say this?
- Say what?

824
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,957
I think we should spend
some time apart.

825
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,953
- What's wrong?
- Well...

826
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,830
...I need to study...
- You need to study?

827
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,156
How much time do you need?

828
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,397
You'll be leaving soon,
so I'm just asking.

829
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,158
We'll see.

830
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,949
Okay.

831
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,752
- It's good knowing this.
- Yeah.

832
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,353
Wait a minute.

833
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,751
What did we just decide?

834
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,158
- We decided...
- Did you break up with me?

835
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,477
- It sounded like it.
- We decided to be friends.

836
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,238
It sounds terrible but...

837
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,159
If we're friends,
can't we see each other?

838
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,949
I think that we should stop
going out on dates.

839
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,989
Oh.

840
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,551
I feel like a dick.

841
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,636
- You must think I'm a dick.
- No.

842
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,114
- I don't.
- You do.

843
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,198
We shared the most intimate thing.

844
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,551
- You shared it with a dick.
- No, I didn't.

845
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,355
- Is this because of your dad?
- No.

846
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,198
Did you talk to Corey?

847
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,358
- Why? Did you tell her?
- She figured it out.

848
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,950
No, she'll tell everybody,
but that's fine.

849
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,349
- Did you tell anybody?
- Just my dad.

850
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,788
You told your dad?

851
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,512
You have Corey and D.C.
I have my dad.

852
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,759
I'm sorry I said that.
I said what I thought I meant...

853
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,552
...but forget it.
- Lloyd.

854
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,634
- "I love you." Okay?
- What are you doing with your hands?

855
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,553
You're talking like that girl Sheila.

856
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,758
Don't be mean!
This is hard for me too.

857
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,952
Then don't do it.

858
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,358
Shit.

859
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,955
Would you just take this pen,
please, and write me?

860
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,155
I don't believe this.
You just broke up with me.

861
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,551
Hello, Constance? It's me, Lloyd.

862
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,549
Nothing. I'm just driving around.

863
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,951
She broke up with me.

864
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,755
What do I do? How can I get her back?

865
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,155
I can't get her to talk to me.

866
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,555
It's all so fucked up.

867
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,556
I feel like crying.

868
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,757
She gave me a pen.

869
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,233
I gave her my heart.
She gave me a pen.

870
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,632
Just come home, okay?

871
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,352
I'll be home soon.

872
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,357
<i>Most don't know what</i>
<i>to do after graduation.</i>

873
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,314
<i>But I've got guaranteed</i>
<i>skill training. In the Army.</i>

874
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,195
<i>Reserve the Army's sought-after</i>
<i>technical training...</i>

875
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,992
<i>... 12 months in advance.</i>

876
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,197
It's me. Cruising around.
I know I haven't called you lately.

877
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,039
I didn't wanna be reminded of Diane.

878
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,439
I've wiped her from my mind. I don't
remember when or where I knew her.

879
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,470
Here's the site of our
controversial first date.

880
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,113
I met her in a mall.

881
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,357
I should've known
our relationship was doomed.

882
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,837
To our left, we have...

883
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,749
...the street where we broke up!
Here's the path we took.

884
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,313
Corey, I guess I blamed you
for letting me send the letter.

885
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,877
But I thought it was right too.
I think I know too many giris.

886
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,275
I should hang with more guys.

887
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,634
I should be like those guys who hang
at the AM-PM or the Gas 'n' Sip.

888
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,752
But do guys like that
know the answers?

889
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,870
No babe is worth it, you know?

890
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,509
We'll teach you bibles of truths.

891
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,393
You can't trust them. Know what it is?

892
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,752
They spend your money and tell
their friends. It's economics.

893
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,077
You gotta find a girl
who looks just like her...

894
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,317
...nail her and dump her.
Get her off your mind.

895
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,389
Diane Court is a show pony.
You need a stallion, my friend.

896
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,319
- Walk with us and walk tall.
Walk tall.

897
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,034
- Bitches, man!
Give him a complex.

898
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,549
- Dude, I better bail.
Okay, man.

899
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,598
- Later, Luke.
- Be cool, man.

900
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,558
I got a question.

901
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,955
If you know so much about women...

902
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:05,280
...why are you at a Gas 'n' Sip alone
on a Saturday, with no women anywhere?

903
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,195
- By choice, man.
- It's a conscious choice.

904
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,470
We're choosing to be here.

905
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,355
- I'm choosing it.
- Dude, where'd she dump you, man?

906
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,278
- My car.
- Your car?

907
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,756
- Dissed in the Malibu?
- Oh, heinous!

908
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,158
- That's your castle, man.
- No chance with a girl like that.

909
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,794
Hey, man. I was in love once, man.

910
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,950
I got hurt really bad.

911
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,718
I never wanna go through that again.

912
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,359
- You're bringing me down!
- Shut up, man!

913
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,996
We're going to a kegger.
We'd like you to come.

914
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,668
We're gonna find you a babe, man.

915
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,759
We're gonna find you one hot babe.
Instantly! Promise!

916
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,198
One hot babe for you!

917
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,392
I won't meet a girl
like Diane at a kegger.

918
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,754
She was different. We didn't even have
to go out to go out. We'd just hang.

919
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,199
The girl made me trust myself, man.

920
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,119
I was walking around,
feeling satisfied.

921
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,995
Can you imagine that?
And then she cuts me loose.

922
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,954
I don't know why. She won't say.
Who knows the reason?

923
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,597
Maybe it's her father. She won't
talk to me. Won't look at me.

924
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,869
Come on!

925
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,390
- Christ, what's up with you?
- You're freaking out!

926
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,591
- Chill, man!
- You're wigging.

927
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,836
<i>He's wigging, man</i>
<i>He's wigging</i>

928
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,793
I don't even feel that way
about my car.

929
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,991
<i>He's wigging every day</i>

930
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,194
Dude, name a babe, okay?
Any babe in Seattle. I'll set you up.

931
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,839
Diane Court!

932
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,355
Dude, I can't do it, buddy.

933
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,235
<i>Lloyd, Lloyd</i>
<i>All null and void</i>

934
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,955
<i>Listen to the truth</i>
<i>You're trying to avoid, Lloyd</i>

935
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,755
That was a mistake.

936
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,278
The rain on my car is a baptism.

937
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,357
I'm the new me.

938
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,954
Ice-man.

939
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,159
Power-Lloyd. My assault
on the worid begins now.

940
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,478
I believe in myself. Answer to no one.

941
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,636
You got it all figured out.

942
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:24,755
If you start out depressed,
everything's a pleasant surprise.

943
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,157
Look, why don't you
just call Diane again?

944
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,509
I stop at seven unreturned calls.

945
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,235
Understand that her family
is being ripped apart.

946
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,000
Like you and she were ripped apart.

947
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,794
Like Joe and I were ripped apart.

948
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,077
- Visit her at the home.
- I'm not going back there.

949
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,352
- I don't even know her.
- Why are you like this?

950
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,348
- Because I'm a guy. I have pride.
- You're not a guy.

951
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,914
I am.

952
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,953
The worid is full of guys. Be a man.

953
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,355
Don't be a guy.

954
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,553
If she wants me, she can come to me.

955
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,194
<i>Hi. Lloyd.</i>

956
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,393
<i>- This is my eighth and final call.</i>
- Pick it up if you want.

957
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,754
<i>I've thought about it all, and I've</i>
<i>decided to give you another chance.</i>

958
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,152
<i>Maybe only your father is listening.</i>
<i>Hey, Mr. Court. Hello.</i>

959
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,638
- If I get it, we'll get back together.
- Then don't.

960
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,231
<i>Maybe I didn't know you.</i>
<i>Maybe the worid is a mirage...</i>

961
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,432
<i>... and everyone's hurtling</i>
<i>toward necropolis.</i>

962
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,553
<i>Maybe there's good in this.</i>
<i>You're probably screening.</i>

963
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:43,311
<i>Just one other thing. The letter</i>
<i>I wrote you. Could you rip it up?</i>

964
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,308
<i>Nuke it. Destroy it.</i>
<i>It hurts me to know it's out there.</i>

965
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,431
<i>Could you do that for me?</i>

966
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,278
<i>All right. Later.</i>

967
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,629
Hello?

968
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,436
Hi.

969
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,033
- Is it for your wife?
- I'm unmarried. It's for my daughter.

970
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,437
- Going to school?
- She won a fellowship.

971
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,750
Good for her.

972
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,356
- I'll take the whole set.
- Excellent.

973
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,550
You got the best smile
I've seen all week.

974
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,558
Thanks. I like yours too.

975
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,878
I don't know your name,
but what are you doing for lunch?

976
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,595
I'm sorry, but they
turned down your card.

977
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,949
Oh! Well, here.
Let me give you another card.

978
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,229
Thanks.

979
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,879
I'm afraid I can't accept this either.

980
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,631
There's a decline code.
I'm supposed to confiscate it...

981
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,035
...but why don't you keep it?

982
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,356
- Keep it.
- Are you sure?

983
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,352
Yeah, I don't want it.

984
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,797
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

985
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,950
Dad, are you okay in there?

986
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,555
I'm just finishing up in here!

987
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,550
Regarding James Court?

988
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,351
Room 14.

989
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,432
I'm supposed to be leaving
on a fellowship...

990
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,350
...that I worked for my entire life,
and I don't even care.

991
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,191
I met this boy over the summer...

992
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,678
...and we can't talk because of this.
I can't talk to my dad.

993
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,075
I wore these clothes. I thought...

994
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,431
...if I looked right,
someone would talk to me.

995
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,952
But I look and feel awful.
Could you please talk to me?

996
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,230
Be a little decent.

997
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,310
We believe your father
has a large pool of cash...

998
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,193
...from phony billing, phony patients.

999
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,315
We've been investigating him.
When they die, he takes their money.

1000
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,669
Pardon me?

1001
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,311
Check it out for yourself.
See if your father fits the profile.

1002
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,911
- What's the profile?
- Take a look around the house.

1003
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,033
Are there a lot of rugs,
pieces of art, stereo equipment?

1004
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,789
Things bought with cash?
Does he give lots of gifts?

1005
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,915
- Do the major items in your house...?
- You want me to say something.

1006
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,998
Don't let his business
infect your life.

1007
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,953
- How can you say that?
- He's guilty.

1008
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,388
No. He's not.

1009
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,509
We have the records.
We have the proof.

1010
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,720
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

1011
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,956
...but it's going to get worse.

1012
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,436
If I were you,
I would take that fellowship.

1013
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,553
Dad?

1014
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,556
Anybody home?

1015
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,235
They made me doubt you.

1016
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,758
What happened to you?

1017
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,436
Did you do it?
Did you take that money?

1018
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,473
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.

1019
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,559
- Swear to God. I need the truth.
- Honey!

1020
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,031
- Swear to God.
- I swear to God.

1021
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,996
I found the money.

1022
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,638
It's not what you think.

1023
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,116
- What am I supposed to think?
- About what?

1024
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,593
You stole from them! You lied to me!

1025
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,469
- How do you think I feel?
- You know what this money is?

1026
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,910
No, you don't! It's not for me!

1027
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,873
It's for when you
get back from England...

1028
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,719
...so you don't have to
depend on anybody.

1029
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,629
I take better care of those people
than their families!

1030
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,231
I care for them, give them flowers,
feed them, wipe their mouths!

1031
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,035
- But you stole from them!
- I make their lives better!

1032
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,112
You let me defend you.

1033
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,394
You knew you were guilty, and you
let me become a part of it! How...?

1034
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,230
Go ahead. When I'm old, give me
someone like me, but go ahead.

1035
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,956
I trusted you. I stood up in court
five years ago and picked you!

1036
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,597
Why are you being so hateful to me?
Because of Lloyd?

1037
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,952
No. I told you everything,
and you lied to me.

1038
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,669
- I would've done anything for you.
- Work it out.

1039
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,757
No! I will.

1040
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,638
I won't leave anything out
because I can say anything to you.

1041
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,391
- You're a liar and a thief.
- Easy. I'm the only dad you got.

1042
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,313
I'm so ashamed.

1043
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,273
Don't say that. It's not good for you.

1044
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,799
You're right.

1045
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,556
No, talk... Diane!
Wait a minute! Talk...

1046
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,359
Someone's here to see you.

1047
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,390
Lloyd?

1048
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,753
God.

1049
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,351
Lloyd, I'm sorry.

1050
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,758
What do you want?

1051
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,151
I'm sorry.

1052
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,358
What do you want?

1053
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,873
My father's guilty. He lied to me.
He lied to everybody.

1054
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,150
I just left home.

1055
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,077
I need you.

1056
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,508
You do?

1057
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,952
Everything else means nothing to me.

1058
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,391
If I hurt you again, I'll die.

1059
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,154
Hurt me again? Not a chance.

1060
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,999
- Don't worry about it.
- I love you.

1061
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,032
- What?
- I love you.

1062
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,959
How many more times
do I have to say it?

1063
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,316
One more time would be nice.

1064
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,831
I love you.

1065
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,597
Please.

1066
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,552
I love you.

1067
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,639
One question.

1068
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,271
Are you here because you need someone,
or because you need me?

1069
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,718
Forget it. I don't care.

1070
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,952
I need you.

1071
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,431
I love you.

1072
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,717
- $ 75,000 fine and no jail.
- I can't do that.

1073
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,630
This guy has been ripping off Grandma
and Grandpa for 17 years.

1074
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,549
- I'd love to hear his story.
- $ 100,000 and three months?

1075
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,149
125,000 and nine months.

1076
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,674
I can accept that.

1077
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,395
- The state takes the home.
- He can serve immediately.

1078
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,196
- I can put that together.
- I'll confirm this with my client.

1079
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,233
- I'll push it past my boss.
- All right.

1080
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,638
Just sleep.

1081
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,278
I brought her here,
but she won't get out of the car.

1082
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,119
I wanted her to see you.
If you go away...

1083
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,676
...and not deal with
your family stuff, you just...

1084
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,475
- You going to England with her?
- Let's discuss that.

1085
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,914
Are you?

1086
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,631
Am I going?

1087
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,318
Am I going to England?

1088
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:45,116
I realize what I should do
is carve out a goal for my future...

1089
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,551
...and find out what I want
to do with my life.

1090
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,638
Diane and I can wait
for each other, right?

1091
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,389
She's gonna run off
with some English guy? No way.

1092
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,160
I admire you for not hitching a ride.

1093
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,430
- She's not like you.
- I know.

1094
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,235
- She's very successful. Very talented.
- I know.

1095
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:09,036
But then I reconsidered. Because
what I want to do with my life...

1096
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:14,189
...what I want to do for a living,
is be with your daughter.

1097
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,231
I'm good at it.

1098
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,154
You're a distraction,
not a permanent part of her life.

1099
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,157
I'm the distraction
going with her to England.

1100
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,430
- Are you all right, sir? You okay?
- I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!

1101
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,431
I don't deserve to lose
my daughter over this.

1102
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,639
I don't deserve you as my go-between.

1103
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,037
I can't fathom how she could
choose mediocrity...

1104
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:03,437
...the way she has with you!

1105
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,839
I have a letter from your daughter.
Do you want it?

1106
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,274
- Thank you, Lloyd.
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

1107
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,832
<i>All visitors must check out</i>
<i>at the main office.</i>

1108
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,234
I don't know which version she sent.

1109
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,678
- "The disappointment I feel..."
- I know this part. Keep reading.

1110
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,952
She can't still be angry at this.

1111
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:02,472
- It's gotta get better.
- It does, if it's signed "I love you."

1112
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,032
Just her name.

1113
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,076
Just knowing that version exists,
that she did write "I love you"...

1114
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:28,637
...that's a good thing, right?
It's gotta be a good thing.

1115
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,233
Hello.

1116
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,479
Hi.

1117
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,712
I don't know what to say,
except goodbye.

1118
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,629
You could have told me the truth.

1119
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,635
I'm so sorry.

1120
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,231
I love you, Dad.

1121
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,039
Write me.

1122
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,832
Wing adjustments.

1123
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,030
It's like a roller coaster.
Everybody likes them.

1124
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,515
- Blink if you're fine.
- I'm fine.

1125
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,836
Good, it's all very normal.

1126
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,634
- Very standard for a 747.
- Okay.

1127
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,111
If anything happens, it usually
happens in the first five minutes.

1128
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,915
So when the smoking sign
goes "ding," all is okay.

1129
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,633
Good to know.

1130
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:16,238
I'll keep talking until that
"ding" happens, which is soon.

1131
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,714
Personalized flight kit from Corey.
Books, cassettes, magazines?

1132
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,231
Not right now, thanks.

1133
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,438
How's it going?

1134
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,835
Nobody thought we'd do this.

1135
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:41,432
Nobody really thinks
it will work, do they?

1136
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,470
No.

1137
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,437
You just described
every great success story.

1138
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,236
It's all right.

1139
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,233
I know.

1140
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,229
- Where's the "ding"?
- It's coming.

1141
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,232
Any second now.

1142
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,231
Any second now.

1143
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,989
