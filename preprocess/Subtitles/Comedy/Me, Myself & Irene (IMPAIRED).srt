helpful dad, upstanding citizen...

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,230
and an 18-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land.

-  [ Whistling ]
- the Rhode lsland State Police.

That's Charlie's home--
modest, like the man.

22
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,650
Even though he lived
on the water,

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,150
Charlie wasn't
much of a swimmer...

24
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,410
which will come into play
a little later in our story.

But I'm getting way ahead
of myself.

You know, maybe it's best if we just
go back and begin at the beginning.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,130
As a young man, Charlie had the world
by its bootstraps.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,690
He was the best young trooper
on the force...

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,200
and was dating the prettiest
and smartest gal in town.

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,610
Her name was Layla,
just like the melody.

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,940
Mmm, Charlie.

You have no idea
how much I love you.

- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,120
- Well, will you stay with me
no matter what ?
- Of course, Charlie.

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,720
Well, what if l had to move to the
Arctic, and you could never come home,

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,060
and you had to eat whale blubber
for the rest of your life ?

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,970
- Would you still stay with me ?
- Yeah, I'd stay.

38
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,540
- But I hope that never happens.

slide over the lump in this throat,

and he locked it all away.

Just let me think for a second, okay ?

Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch !

What are you doing to my car?

1038
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,160
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna get you!

1039

I can't find
the time to tell you

I can't find
the time to tell you

I look at your pretty face

What's that on your shirt ?
Whoa.

I'm sorry.

That was good.

Charlie,
what the hell is that ?

1049
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,710
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna fall for that.

1050
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,510
- No, Ch-Charlie.
- Uh-uh, not me.

1051

- No--
- Nice try, though.

1052
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,020
How dumb do I look ?

[ Grunting ]

1054
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,540
Hey, they only had
two rooms, 19 and 20.

1055
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,550
So you guys will
have to bunk up.

1056
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,890
So, Whitey.

1057
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,900
What happened
to your family ?

1058
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,900
I killed them.

1059
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:09,060
Uh-Uh, come again ?

1060
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:13,730
When I was 15, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping--

1061
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:17,740
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

1062
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,680
She was awake, my sis,

1063
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,520
which I regret.

1064
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,860
Yeah, well.

1065
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:35,860
We all have family stuff.

1066
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:39,370
That's what makes
the holidays so hard.

1067
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:43,200
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

1068
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,870
To tell you the truth,
I really wasn't ready to leave,

1069
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,380
but they said I had to.

1070
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,710
That's a fucked-up law, huh ?

1071
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:59,390
Well, I guess they need
the extra room...

1072
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,890
for the real psychos.

1073
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,720
I'm gonna go next door and tryu
to make out with what's her face.

1074
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,780
- Go for it.
- All right.

1075
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,330
- What ?
- Yeah.

1076
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,060
He just told me that
he brutally murdered...

1077
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:14,620
his entire family
in their sleep.

1078
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,190
- Oh, my God.
- He was a juvenile.
They just let him out.

1079
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:24,470
So, I was gonna ask you...

1080
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:28,040
if l could stay here,

1081
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,480
but l can sleep in the car.

1082
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,690
That's me and my whipper snappers.

- I'm Dorothy.

Look at you.

1085
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,030
When did you take this,
at Halloween ?

1086
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,700
No,just messing
around the house.

1087
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,370
You seem like a really
good dad, Charlie.

1088

I tryu to be.

1089

They're incredible kids.
Oh, God.

So happy and funny.

They never give me any grief.

1092

They're the top three students
in their class, out of21 1 .

1093
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,070
- Golly.
- I don't know where they get it from.

1094
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,230
Well, that's just good genes.

Youknow, l don't think l--

No, I don't think I carryu
even one picture anymore.

- Why not ?
- Idon'tknow.

1098
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,010
I used to, you know,
when I was younger.

1099
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,680
Pictures of friends
and stuff like that.

1100
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,350
I guess they just
got old and fell apart.

1101
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,120
Kind of like the friend ships.

1102
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,250
That's too bad.

1103

Look at you.

1104
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,900
I'll tell you what.
Why don'tyou keep that one ?

1105
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:00,200
- No, Charlie, that's yours.
- Areyou kidding ?

1106
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,210
- I have tons of them at home.
- No.

- No, I got a bunch. Come on.
- You do ?

Yeah.

01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,880
Okay. Thanks.

I'm gonna go get a soda.

1113

- Do you want a soda ?
- Sure. Okay.

1114
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,490
- Okay ?

[Laughing]

1117
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,670
I caught that, bozo.
Not once, but twice it burned you.

1118
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,470
[Laughing]

1119
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,140
Give it another kick. I don't think
you're gonna get it this time.

1120
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,020
- I think I just had an epiphany.
- What ?

1121
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,460
That I might be able to control
this little problem ofmine.

1122
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,790
Oh, how did you learn that ?

1123
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,390
Well, first the Coke machine
robbedme, right ?

1124
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:34,840
And I'm fine with that. But then,
some guy came up and laughed in my face.

1125
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,640
- Oh, no.
- No, no. But that's just it, see ?

1126
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,800
Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

1127
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,480
I just took a deep breath,
counted backwards from ten
and I said to the guy,

1128
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:50,320
" Excuse me, sir, but your laughter is
not helping me right now."

1129
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:53,320
And he said, "l'm sorry,
I didn't mean to make fun."

1130
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:56,260
And that was it.
I helped him with his luggage.

1131
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,520
- Really ? Well, that's great.
- Yes.

- And you got the Cokes.

Hey. Just a little rap on the side
ofthe machine and presto.

1134
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,660
Maybe that's it though,
you know ?

1135
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,730

Oh, no. Oh, boy.

Doyou ?

Well, under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few. Okay.

Why am I peeing like I was
up all night having sex ?

Why am I peeing like I was
up all night having sex ?

1153
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,480
[Narrator] Well, seems old Hank
had pulled a fast one.

1154
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,810
And if that
wasn't bad enough,

1155
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:04,650
there was more trouble
right around the corner.

I want everybody to stay put
and wait for my orders.

You mean to tell me you couldn't tell
the difference between us ?

Are you serious ?

A sober person, for one.

1161
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,640
So we had some drinks.

1162
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,680
Well, look who joined the party.

1163

Oh, yes I did !
Oh, yes I did !

01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:43,160
So I guess old Hanky-panky
wasn't enough for you, huh ?

1166
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,590

- Now, you're sure this is the woman ?
- Absolutely.

1169
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,640
When my boyfriend Scooter
brought in the morning paper,

This is the plan, look.

Why don'tyou let us talk to our dad so
this ain't gotta be no big thing, man ?

the end of the line foryou.

drive you back to the chopper.

down here for us to leave now ?

Man, yeah. That don't make
no motherfuckin' sense.

Well, you guys have
done all you can do.

This is strictly a police
matter from here on in.

Wait.
It maybe a police matter to you,

1181

but the police don't matter shit
to me when it's my daddy in there.
