It is an extremely
common mistake.

13
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,207
People think
the writer's imagination

14
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,608
is always at work,

15
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,009
that he's constantly inventing

16
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,812
an endless supply
of incidents and episodes.

17
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:58,550
That he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

18
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,120
In point of fact, the
opposite is true.

19
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,255
Once the public knows
you're a writer,

20
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,791
they bring the characters
and events to you,

21
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:09,027
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

22
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,663
(door creaks open)
and to carefully listen,

23
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,967
these stories
will continue to...

24
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:15,934
Stop it! Stop it!

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,870
Don't! Don't do it!

26
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,472
(clattering in distance)

27

00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,612
uh, over your lifetime.

29
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,516
To him who has often told
the tales of others,

30
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,451
many tales will be told.

It's all right.

<i>among the intelligentsia</i>
<i>of that time,</i>

39
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,113

<i>Sudetenwaltz,</i>

42
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:09,188

<i>in the Grand Budapest--</i>

43
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,756
<i>a picturesque, elaborate</i>

YOUNG WRITER:
<i>It was off season,</i>

47
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,033
<i>and by that time,</i>
<i>decidedly out of fashion,</i>

48
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,703
<i>and it had already begun</i>
<i>its descent into shabbiness</i>

49
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,539
<i>and eventual demolition.</i>

50
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,308
<i>What few guests we were</i>

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,778
<i>had quickly come to recognize</i>
<i>one another by sight,</i>

52
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,879
<i>as the only living souls</i>

53
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,682
<i>residing</i>
<i>in the vast establishment.</i>

54
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,350
<i>Although I do not believe</i>
<i>any acquaintance</i>

55
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,952
<i>among our number</i> <i>had proceeded</i>

56
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,120
<i>beyond the polite nods</i>
<i>we exchanged</i>

57
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,122
<i>as we passed</i>
<i>in the Palm Court</i>

58
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,658
<i>and the Arabian Baths</i>
<i>and onboard</i>

59
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,527
<i>the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

60
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,030
<i>We were a very reserved</i>
<i>group, it seemed,</i>

61
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,499
<i>and without exception...</i>

62
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,901
<i>solitary.</i>

63
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,637
(the clinking of
dishes and utensils echoing)

64
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,540
<i>Perhaps as a result</i>
<i>of this general silence,</i>

65
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,307
<i>I'd established a casual</i>

66
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,143
<i>and bantering familiarity</i>
<i>with the hotel's concierge,</i>

67
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,747
<i>a West-continental known</i>
<i>only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

68
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,017
<i>who struck one as being</i>
<i>at once both lazy and...</i>

69
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,553
<i>really quite accommodating.</i>

70
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,955
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

71
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,190
<i>In any case, one evening,</i>

72
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,192
<i>as I stood conferring</i>
<i>elbow to elbow</i>

73
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,060
<i>with Monsieur Jean,</i>
<i>as had become my habit,</i>

74
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,364
<i>I noticed a new presence</i>
<i>in our company.</i>

75
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,866
<i>A small, elderly man,</i>
<i>smartly dressed,</i>

76
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:31,036
<i>with an exceptionally lively,</i>
<i>intelligent face</i>

77
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,740
<i>and an immediately</i>
<i>perceptible air of sadness.</i>

78
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,175
<i>He was,</i>
<i>like the rest of us, alone,</i>

79
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:37,976
<i>but also, I must say,</i>

80
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,712
<i>he was the first</i>
<i>that struck one as being</i>

81
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,614
<i>deeply and truly lonely,</i>

82
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,717
<i>a symptom of my own</i>
<i>medical condition as well.</i>

83
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,753
Who's this interesting
old fellow?

84
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,288
<i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

85
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,224
<i>To my surprise, he was</i>
<i>distinctly taken aback.</i>

86
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,126
Don't you know?
<i>He asked.</i>

87
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,661
Don't you recognize him?

88
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,696
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

89
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,698
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,100
He arrived early this morning.

91
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,235
<i>This name will, no doubt,</i>

92
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:07,039
<i>be familiar to the more</i>
<i>seasoned persons among you.</i>

93
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,643
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa</i>
<i>was, at one time,</i>

94
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,012
<i>the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

95
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:19,184
<i>and was still indeed the</i>
<i>owner of the Grand Budapest.</i>

96
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,620
He often comes
and stays a week or more.

97
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,256
Three times a year, at least,
but never in the season.

98
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,857
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me,</i>

99
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,825
<i>and I leaned closer.</i>

100
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,993
I'll tell you a secret.

101
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,394
He takes only
a single bed sleeping room

102
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,064
without a bath in a rear corner
of the top floor,

103
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,733
and it's smaller
than the service elevator.

104
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,767
<i>It was well-known</i>

105
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,970
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased</i>
<i>and famously inhabited</i>

106
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,205
<i>some of the most lavish</i>
<i>castles</i>

107
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,907
<i>and palazzos</i>
<i>on the continent.</i>

108
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,277
<i>Yet here, in his own</i>
<i>nearly empty hotel,</i>

109
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,213
<i>he occupied</i>
<i>a servant's quarters?</i>

110
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,981
(choking)
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>the curtain rose</i>

111
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,617
<i>on a parenthetical</i>
<i>domestic drama...</i>

112
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,051
Shit.

113
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,653
<i>...which required</i>
<i>the immediate</i>

114
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,355
<i>and complete attention</i>
<i>of Monsieur Jean...</i>

115
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,824
(choking)
(dog barking)

116
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,160
<i>...but frankly,</i>
<i>did not hold mine for long.</i>

117
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,397
(elevator bell dings,
dog barks)

118
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,970
<i>However,</i>
<i>this premature intermission</i>

119
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,672
<i>in the story</i>
<i>of the curious old man</i>

120
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,074
<i>had left me,</i>
<i>as the expression goes,</i>

121
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,477
"gespannt
wie ein Flitzebogen."

122
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
<i>That is,</i>
<i>"on the edge of my seat,"</i>

123
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,915
<i>where I remained throughout</i>
<i>the next morning until--</i>

124
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,017
<i>in what I found to be</i>
<i>its mysterious</i>

125
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,053
<i>and utterly reliable</i>
<i>fashion--</i>

126
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,891
<i>fate, once again,</i>
<i>intervened on my behalf.</i>

127
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,997
MR. MOUSTAFA:
I admire your work.

128
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,769
I beg your pardon?

129
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,406
I said, I know and admire

130
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,541
your wonderful work.

131
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,143
Thank you most kindly, sir.

132
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,879
Did Monsieur Jean have a word
or two to share with you

133
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,883
about the... aged proprietor
of this establishment?

134
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,986
I must confess, I did myself...

135
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,154
inquire about you.

136
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:05,056
He's perfectly capable,
of course, Monsieur Jean,

137
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,058
but we can't claim
he's a first-,

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,462
or in earnest,
even a second-rate concierge,

139
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,897
but there it is.

140
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,966
Times have changed.

141
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,871
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

142
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,807
They were, in their
first condition.

143
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,942
It couldn't be maintained,
of course.

144
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,977
Too decadent
for current tastes,

145
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,346
but I love it all just the same,

146
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,283
this enchanting old ruin.

147
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,553
How did you come to buy it,
if I may ask?

148
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,055
The Grand Budapest.

149
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,523
(grunts)

150
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,494
(clunking, water sloshing)

151
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,866
I didn't.

152
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,334
(water spraying)

153
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,303
(indistinct, distant shouting)

154
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,238
(man shouting)

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,974
(shouts echoing from distance)

156
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,243
If you're not merely
being polite--

157
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,513
and you must tell me
if that's the case--

158
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,716
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

159
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,853
may I invite you to dine
with me tonight?

160
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:08,887
And it will be my pleasure

161
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,057
and indeed, my privilege,
to tell you

162
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,361
my story, such as it is.

163
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,264
(Mr. Moustafa speaking
indistinctly)

164
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,836
Two ducks roasted
with olives, rabbit,

165
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,137
salad?
(grunts)

166
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,572
Pouilly-Jouvet '52.

167
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,341
Plus a split of the brute.

168
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,075
(snaps)

169
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,278
That should provide us
ample time,

170
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
if I commence promptly.

171
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,381
By all means.

172
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,583
(cork pops)

173
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,862
♪

174
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,633
(chuckles)

175
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,235
Well, it begins, as it must,

176
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,472
with our mutual friend's
predecessor,

177
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:05,677
the beloved original concierge
of the Grand Budapest.

178
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,513
It begins, of course, with...

179
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,587
(wind blowing gently)

180
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,461
(knocking on door)

181
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,303
Bring the table to the window.

182
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,405
Yes, Monsieur Gustave.
Bring the tray to the table.

183
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,106
Right away,
Monsieur Gustave.

184
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,241
Right there.

185
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,242
Have those been brushed
and blocked?

186
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,444
Of course,
Monsieur Gustave.
Pack them in the hatboxes.

187
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,412
Is that
from Oberstdorf & Company?

188
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,013
I believe so,
Monsieur Gustave.
Second trunk.

189
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,149
Who has the tickets?
I do, Monsieur Gustave.

190
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,518
Give them to me.

191
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,019
These are in order.

192
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,989
Wait in the corner.

193
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,897
I'm not leaving.

194
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,965
I beg your pardon?

195
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,967
I'm not leaving.
Why not?

196
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,301
I'm frightened.

197
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:03,868
Of what?

198
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,471
I fear this may be the last time
we ever see each other.

199
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,672
Why on earth would
that be the case?

200
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,442
Well, I can't put it into words,
but I feel it.

201
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,476
Well, for goodness sake,

202
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,211
there's no reason for you
to leave us.

203
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,946
If you'd rather...
Come with me.

204
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,915
To fucking Lutz?

205
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,649
Please?

206
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,619
Give me your hand.

207
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,653
You've nothing to fear.

208
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,455
You're always anxious
before you travel.

209
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,124
I admit you appear to be
suffering a more acute attack

210
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,592
on this occasion, but
truly and honestly...

211
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,961
Oh, dear God, what have you
done to your fingernails?

212
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,563
I beg your pardon?
This diabolical varnish.

213
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,564
The color is
completely wrong.

214
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,999
Oh, really?
Don't you like it?

215
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,400
It's not that
I don't like it.

216
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,702
I-I am physically repulsed.

217
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,070
Perhaps this
will soothe you.

218
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,372
What?
"While questing
once in..."

219
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,140
Don't recite.
Just listen to the words.

220
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,642
Please, not now.
Hush.

221
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,612
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

222
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,482
"I came upon a tomb,
rain-slick'd,

yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

226
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,125
MADAME D.:
Will you light a candle
for me, please?

227
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,293
In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

228
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,363
I'll see to it myself,
immediately.

229
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:09,501
Remember... I'm always with you.

230
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,935
I love you.

231
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,538
I love you. <i>Abfahren!</i>

232
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,608
(engine revving)

233
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,649
It's quite a thing,

234
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,618
winning the loyalty
of a woman like that

235
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,920
for 19 consecutive seasons.

236
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,422
Um, yes, sir.

237
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,657
She's very fond
of me, you know.

238
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,391
Yes, sir.

239
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,094
I've never seen her
like that before.

240
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:36,528
No, sir.

241
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,298
She was shaking
like a shitting dog.

242
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,167
Truly.

243
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,602
Run to the cathedral of
Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz.

244
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,504
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

245
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,839
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

246
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,607
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary,

247
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,277
then go to Mendl's and get
me a <i>courtesan au chocolat.</i>

248
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,378
If there's any money left,

249
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,580
give it to the crippled
shoe-shine boy.

250
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,282
(spits)

251
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,583
Right away, sir.

252
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,252
Hold it.

253
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,687
Who are you?

254
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,023
I'm Zero, sir,
the new lobby boy.

255
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:05,657
Zero, you say?

256
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,258
Yes, sir.
Well, I've never
heard of you,

257
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,394
never laid eyes on you.
Who hired you?

258
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,562
Mr. Mosher, sir.

259
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,664
Mr. Mosher!

260
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,032
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?

261
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:14,632
Am I to understand

262
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,568
you've surreptitiously
hired this young man

263
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,103
in the position
of a lobby boy?

264
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,171
He's been engaged
for a trial period,

265
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,307
pending your approval,
of course.

266
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,509
Uh, perhaps, yes.

267
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,543
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

268
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,379
You're most welcome,
Monsieur Gustave.

269
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,548
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

270
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,718
Uh, should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

271
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,386
What? No.
The candle.

272
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,188
(door squeaks)

273
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:39,758
Experience?

274
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,559
Hotel Kinski,
kitchen boy, six months.

275
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,295
Hotel Berlitz, mop and
broom boy, three months.

276
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,264
Before that I was
a skillet scrubber...

277
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,132
Experience: zero.

278
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,266
Thank you again,
Monsieur Gustave.

279
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,334
Straighten that cap, Anatole.

280
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,668
The pleasure's mine,
Herr Schneider.

281
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,704
The strap's busted.
These are not acceptable.

282
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,772
I fully agree.

283
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,606
Education?

284
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,107
I studied reading
and spelling.

285
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,809
I-I started my
primary school.

286
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,844
I almost...
Education: zero.

287
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,113
Now it's exploded.
Good morning, Cicero.

288
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,181
Call the goddamn plumber.

289
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,382
This afternoon,
Monsieur Gustave.

290
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,152
Without fail, Frau Liebling.
What in the hell
is this?

291
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,253
Not now.

292
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,388
Family?

293
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,592
Zero.

294
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,327
Six, Igor.

295
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,771
Why do you want to be
a lobby boy?

296
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,707
Well, who wouldn't

297
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,310
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

298
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,712
It's an institution.

299
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,184
Very good.

300
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,153
(laughs quietly)

301
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,200
A thousand Klubecks.

302
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,068
My goodness.

303
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,871
Were you ever
a lobby boy, sir?

304
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,105
What do you think?

305
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,307
Well, I suppose you'd
have to start somewhere.

306
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,843
I mean, you couldn't...
Oh, go light
the goddamn candle.

307
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,344
Yes, sir.

308
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,314
(door creaks open)

309
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,585
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>And so my life began.</i>

310
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,855
<i>Junior lobby boy</i>
<i>in training,</i>

311
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,922
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

312
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,359
<i>under the strict command</i>
<i>of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

313
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,393
<i>I became his pupil,</i>

314
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,230
<i>and he was to be</i>
<i>my counselor and guardian.</i>

315
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,798
GUSTAVE:
<i>What is a lobby boy?</i>

316
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,867
<i>A lobby boy</i>
<i>is completely invisible,</i>

317
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,335
<i>yet always in sight.</i>

318
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,503
<i>A lobby boy remembers</i>
<i>what people hate.</i>

319
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,873
<i>A lobby boy anticipates</i>

322

some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly--

324
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,984
will go with us

MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>I began to realize</i>

329
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,461
<i>that many of the hotel's</i>
<i>most valued</i>

330
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,962
<i>and distinguished guests</i>

331
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,796
<i>came for him.</i>

332
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,299
<i>It seemed to be an essential</i>
<i>part of his duties,</i>

333
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:05,570
(Gustave laughs)
<i>but I believe</i>
<i>it was also his pleasure.</i>

334
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,307
<i>The requirements</i>
<i>were always the same.</i>

335
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,411
<i>They had to be rich, old,</i>

336
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,415
<i>insecure, vain, superficial,</i>

337
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,685
<i>blond, needy.</i>

338
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,488
Why blond?

339
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,791
Because they all were.

340
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,859
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

341
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,829
<i>the most liberally perfumed</i>
<i>man I had ever encountered.</i>

342
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,531
<i>The scent announced</i>
<i>his approach</i>

343
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,667
<i>from a great distance</i>

344
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,404
<i>and lingered for many minutes</i>
<i>after he was gone.</i>

345
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,105
(sniffing)

346
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,674
<i>I worked six days each week,</i>

347
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,708
<i>plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

348

350
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,515
<i>but frequent for stamina.</i>

351
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,317
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches,</i>

352
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,518
<i>and a late supper.</i>

353
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,355
<i>Monsieur Gustave also</i>
<i>delivered a nightly sermon.</i>

354
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,325
Rudeness is merely
the expression of fear.

355
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,760
People fear they won't get
what they want.

356
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,330
The most dreadful

"The painter's brush touched

may be very difficult

476

It's temporary,

477

478

480
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,997

Send my love.

481
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,765
I will.

482
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,934
Your companion
was very kind to me

483
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,570
when I was a lonely little boy.

484
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,106
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

485
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:26,177
I beg your pardon, sir.

(train engine chugging)

488
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,094
You see, there are
still faint glimmers

489
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,130
of civilization left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse

490
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,965
that was once known
as humanity.

491
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,034
Indeed, that's what
we provide,

492
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,739
in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...

493
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,941
Oh, fuck it.

They've done a marvelous job.

00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,544
All right then.

517
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,880
I shan't be long, darling.

518
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,082
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>We were escorted</i>

519
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,317
<i>through a green baize door,</i>

520
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,152
<i>down a narrow</i>
<i>service corridor,</i>

521
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,821
<i>and into</i>
<i>the butler's pantry.</i>

522
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,492
<i>A moment later, the</i>
<i>kitchen passage swung open,</i>

523
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,861
<i>and a small servant</i>
<i>dressed in white</i>

524
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,596
<i>jolted into the room.</i>

525
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,533
<i>I've never forgotten</i>
<i>the look on that man's face.</i>

526
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,236
What the devil is going on?

527
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:06,437
<i>I myself had never set foot</i>

528
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:09,907
<i>inside a house of this kind</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

529
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,975
<i>I understood very little</i>

530
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,510
<i>about the events</i>
<i>that were to follow,</i>

531
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,679
<i>but eventually,</i>
<i>I came to recognize</i>

532
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,717
<i>when the destiny of a</i>
<i>great fortune is at stake,</i>

533
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,118
<i>men's greed spreads</i>

534
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,455
<i>like a poison</i>
<i>in the bloodstream.</i>

535
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,826
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

536
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,228
<i>in-laws of increasingly</i>
<i>tenuous connection.</i>

537
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,497
<i>The old woman's</i>
<i>most distant relations</i>

538
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,600
<i>had come foraging</i>
<i>out of the woodwork.</i>

539
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,103
<i>At the head</i>
<i>of this congregation--</i>

540
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,305
<i>it was</i>
<i>a disorienting coincidence--</i>

541
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,174
<i>we discovered</i>
<i>our own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

542
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,144
<i>himself an important</i>
<i>attorney, of course.</i>

543
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:51,849
<i>He was the executor</i>
<i>of the dead widow's estate.</i>

544
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,320
(murmuring quiets)

545
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,559
This is Madame D.'s
last will and testament.

546
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,661
It consists of a general tontine

547
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:07,197
drawn up before the event
of her husband's death

548
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,299
46 years ago.

549
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,602
In combination
with 635 amendments,

550
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,505
notations, corrections
and letters of wishes

551
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:18,409
executed during
these subsequent decades.

552
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,246
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

553
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,347
requires further analysis,

554
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,982
but in the opinion
of this office,

555
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,350
it was Madame D.'s intention

556
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,953
that control of the vast bulk
of her estate

557
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,588
should be transferred,
forthwith,

558
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,855
to her son Dmitri,

559
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,325
with special allowances
for his sisters

560
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,927
Marguerite,
Laetizia and Carolina,

561
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,196
and minor gifts
for various members

562
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,264
of the extended family,

563
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,066
as shown in the list
of recipients,

564
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,368
which I will elucidate
in due course.

565
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,503
(murmuring)

566
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,172
However...

567
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,109
...an additional codicil,

568
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,144
delivered into
my possession by post

569
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,214
only this morning,
and by all indications,

570
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,215
sent by Madame D.

571
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,450
during the last
hours of her life,

572
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,920
contains an amendment to
the original certificate,

573
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,089
which, as prescribed by law,

574
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,457
I will read to you now.

575
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,591
The authenticity
of this document

576
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,127
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

577
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,696
so I ask that all parties
be patient

578
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,231
and refrain from comment

579
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,467
until such time
as our investigations

580
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,969
can be completed.

581
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,908
(knuckles cracking)

582
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,278
"To my esteemed friend,

583
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,047

584
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,516
"and brought sunshine

585

590
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,400
(quietly): Wow.
"...by Johannes van Hoytl..."

591
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:50,367
I can't believe it

592
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,468
"...the younger..."
What?

593
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,437
"...which gave us both
so much pleasure..."

594
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,306
The van Hoytl?
Tax-free?
Can she do that?

595
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,375
Who's Gustave H.?

596
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,712
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

597
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,083
DMITRI:
That fucking faggot!

598
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,685
He's a concierge!

599
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:08,585
What are you doing here?

600
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,154
I've come to pay my respects

601
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,488
to a great woman whom I loved.

602
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,557
This man is an intruder
in my home.

603
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,658
It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

604
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,261
Only when probate is granted
and the Deed of Entitlement...

605
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,029
You're not getting
<i>Boy with Apple,</i>

606
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,330
you goddamn little fruit.

607
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,198
(stammers quietly)

608
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,534
How is that supposed
to make me feel?

609
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,602
Call the police!
We're pressing charges.

610
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,939
This criminal has plagued
my family for nearly 20 years.

611
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,141
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con artist

612
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,378
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies,

613
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,113
and he probably fucks them, too.

614
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,649
I go to bed with all my friends.

615
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,752
(crowd gasping)

616
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,455
(grunts, gasping continues)

617
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,127
Where's Céline?

618
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,361
What?

619
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,396
She's dead.

620
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,597
We're reading her will.

621
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,332
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

622
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:59,103
If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

623
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,637
living or dead,
I swear to God,

624
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,539
I'll cut your throat.
You hear me?!

625
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,809
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

626
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,511
You are, but you're bisexual.

627
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,113
Let's change the subject.

628
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:10,614
I'm leaving.

629
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,188
(speaking French)

630
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,824
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>

631
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,067
M. Gustave?

632
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:22,368
is priceless, understand?

633
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,761
Congratulations,
Monsieur Gustave.

634
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,130
They're gonna fight me
for the son of a bitch.

635
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,164
Is it very beautiful?

636
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,165
Beyond description.

637
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,334
"E'en the most gifted
bard's rhyme can only sing

638
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,736
"but to the lack of her
and all she isn't.

639
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,204

you will be my sole heir.

Yes, on one occasion.

In the small hours

an individual well-known

777
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:16,967
a Monsieur Gustave H.,

778
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,169
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence

779
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:23,573
in Lutz and entered
by the rear service alley,

780
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,008
alerting no one to his presence,

781
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,109
and did then proceed by way

782
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,712
of back stairs
and servants' passage,

783
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,880
to deliver himself
into the private chambers

784
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:31,815
of Madame D.

785
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,849
There is no evidence

786

to indicate whether this visit

787
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,253
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

788
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:40,657
The next morning,
Madame D. was found dead

789

by strychnine poisoning.

790
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,160
Monsieur Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

791
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:47,931
until, of course,
24 hours later.

792

The identity of his accusers

793
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,802
is made clear
in this notarized deposition.

794
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,937
They include, essentially,

795
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,905
all members
of the extended family,

796
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:59,809
but the key witness
who actually, ostensibly,

797
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,111
saw the alleged events,

798
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,913
appears to have fled
the jurisdiction.

799
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,348
His whereabouts
are currently unknown,

800
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,050
but he's being sought
and pursued

801
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:09,753

802
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,755
Who is he?

803
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,293
Serge?

804
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,627
I'm afraid so.

805
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,529
That little prick.

806
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:20,764
No, I don't believe it.

807
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:21,765
They put him up to it.

808
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,334
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

809
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,201
You have an alibi?

810
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,369
Of course, but she's married

811
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,238
to the Duke of Westfalia.
I can't allow her name

812
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,939
to get mixed up in all
this monkey business.

813
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,175
Monsieur Gustave,
your life may be at stake.

814
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,511
I know, but the bitch legged it.

815
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,646
She's already onboard
the <i>Queen Nasstasja</i>

816
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,650
halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

817
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,254
Don't give up.

818
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,994
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

819
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,762
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

820
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:57,334
<i>were, at that time, impossible</i>
<i>for us to apprehend.</i>

821
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,251
I'm looking for Serge X.,

822
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,355
a young man
in the service of my employer,

823
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:23,159
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

824
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:24,761
Yes, sir?

825
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,296
You're his sister?

826
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,664
Yes, sir.

827
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,998
Seen him lately?

828
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,433
No, sir.

829
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,168
No... sir?

830
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,170
N-No, sir.

831
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,408
I need to find him right away,

832
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,845
for his own safety and
everybody else's.

833
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,380
If he shows up...

834
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,181
Yes, sir?

835
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:49,085
Tell him Jopling
says, "Come home."

836
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,225
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>But one thing was certain.</i>

837
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:00,930
<i>The Desgoffe und Taxis</i>
<i>were a very powerful family...</i>

838
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,303
<i>...and time</i>
<i>was not on our side.</i>

839
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,973
(indistinct conversations)

840
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,410
(knocking on podium)

841
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,479
A letter from Monsieur Gustave.

842
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:17,313
Zero.

843
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,083
Uh, you want me to...
Read it.

844
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,788
(clears throat)

845
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,791
"My dear
and trusted colleagues..."

846
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,926
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

847
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,896
of my regrettable
and preposterous incarceration.

848
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,331
Until I walk amongst you again
as a free man,

849
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,067
the Grand Budapest remains
in your hands,

850
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,737
as does
its impeccable reputation.

851
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,238
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

852
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,275
Take extra special care
of every little-bitty bit of it

853
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,910
as if I were watching over you

854
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,846
like a hawk with a horse-whip
in its talons,

855
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,014
because I am.

856
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:54,250
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

857
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,053
I promise swift
and merciless justice

858
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:57,987
will descend upon you.

859
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:02,425
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

860
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:05,762
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

861
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,163
"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."

862
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,365
Then there's a poem,
but we might want to go ahead

863
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,001
and start on the soup,
since it's 46 stanzas.

864
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,002
(dinnerware clinking)

865
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,971
"A moist, black ash dampens
the filth

866
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,440
"of a dung-dark rat's nest
and mingles

867
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,075
"with the thick scent
of wood rot

868
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,110
while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

869
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,246
JOPLING:
I never trusted that butler.

870
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,948
(knuckles crack)
He's too honest.

871
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,116
DMITRI (over phone):
Too honest, you say?
Mm-hmm.

872
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,019
Uh-huh. Right, well,
be that as it may,

873
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,422
find him quick
and make it snappy.

874
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,457
(door clanks shut)

875
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,960
(cart rattling)

876
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,541
May I offer any of you inmates
a plate of mush?

877
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,544
No? Anyone?

878
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:58,214
You, with the very large scar
on your face?

879
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,324
Oh, come now. Try it.
It's actually quite warm

880
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,893
and nourishing this morning.

881
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,494
It needs a dash of salt.

882
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,005
Good day.

883
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,310
Mush, gents?

884
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,913
Any takers?

885
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,417
Suit yourselves.

886
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,591
Rise and shine. Chop-chop.

887
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,394
Good morning, Pinky.

888
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,100
Mendl's again?

889
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,135
Precisely.

890
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,938
Who's got the throat slitter?

891
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,210
Out of this world.

892
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,513
GUSTAVE:
Mendl's is the best. Well...

893
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:06,316
back to work.
Monsieur Gustave?

894
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,486
Yes?

895
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:11,888
(door creaks shut)

896
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,856
(clears throat)

897
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,125
Me and the boys
talked it over.

898
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,195
We think you're
a really straight fellow.

899
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,431
Well, I've never been accused
of that before,

900
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,600
but I appreciate the sentiment.

901
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,935
You're one of us now.

902
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,571
What a lovely thing to say.

903
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,539
Thank you, dear Pinky.

904
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,940
Thank you, Gunther.

905
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,442
Thank you, Wolf.

906
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,911
Anything else?

907
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,947
Tell him, Ludwig.

908
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,751
Checkpoint 19
ain't no two-bit hoosegow.

909
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:45,355
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

910
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:49,993
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

911
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,628
You got a 325-foot drop

912
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,596
into a moat full of crocodiles.

913
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,132
But, like the best of 'em,
it's got a soft spot,

914
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,501
which, in this case,
happens to take the form

915
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,003
of a storm-drain sewer system

916
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:02,672
dating from the time of
the original rock fortification,

917
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,208
way back in the Middle Ages.

918
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,677
Now, nobody's saying
it's a stroll

919
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,711
down a tree-lined promenade

920
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,213
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

921
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:14,283
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

922
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:18,354
and that's our bread and butter.

923
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,790
Take a look.

924
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,659
Who drew this?

925
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,727
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

926
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,463
Very good; you've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

927
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:28,598
This shows
great artistic promise.

928
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,335
Question: how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

929
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,705
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

930
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:37,974
Digging with the throat-slitter,

931
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:38,675
I expect this would take

932
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,243
three to six months
of continual effort,

933
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,544
during which time
several of our members

934
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,979
will have been
violently executed.

935
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:45,948
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

936
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,751
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

937
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,988
a rope ladder made
of sticks and bunk-linens,

938
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,356
but we need digging tools,

939
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,627
which are proving hard
to come by in this flophouse.

940
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,276
YOUNG WRITER:
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

941
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,410
<i>the old man fell silent</i>

942
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:16,746
<i>and pushed away</i>
<i>his saddle of lamb.</i>

943
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:19,549
<i>His eyes went blank</i>
<i>as two stones.</i>

944
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,218
<i>I could see</i>
<i>he was in distress.</i>

945
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,153
Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa?

946
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,388
<i>I finally asked.</i>

947
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,522
Oh, dear me, no.

948
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,156
<i>He said.</i>

949
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:31,160
It's only that I don't know
how to proceed.

950
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,429
<i>He was crying.</i>

951
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:35,131
You see,
I never speak of Agatha,

952
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,568
because even at the thought
of her name

953
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,472
I'm unable to control
my emotions.

954
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:48,544
Well, I suppose there's no way
around it.

955
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,580
You see, she saved us.

956
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,248
<i>On our third</i>
<i>formal rendezvous,</i>

957
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,252
<i>I had asked for her hand in</i>
<i>marriage and she had agreed.</i>

958
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,721
Will you marry me?
Yes.

959
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,690
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks</i>

960
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:01,824
<i>between the two of us.</i>

961
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:05,928
<i>No one knew, of course, but</i>

A crucial document,

either misplaced or,

Now, I don't want to alarm you,

vis-à-vis your own inheritance;

1019
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,880
the circumstances of the death

1020
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:40,650
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

1021
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:42,618
in the murder case,
Serge X.,

1022
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,720
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

1023
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,356
to the attention
of the municipal inspector

1024

absolutely no question

of impropriety
at any future date.

Yeah, a provision for my fees
was included in the...

Just wrap it up
and don't make waves.

1041
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,331
Agreed?

1042
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,366
I'm an attorney, Dmitri.

1043
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:35,271
I'm obligated to proceed
according to the rule of law.

1044

out the window?

1048
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,055
I don't think so.

1049
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,991
No. Did he?
Jopling?

1058
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,134
Okay.
We stole a painting.

1059
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:40,469
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

1060
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,438
I don't know if anyone's even
noticed it's missing yet,

1061
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,974
but if something should happen
to me and Monsieur Gustave...

1062
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,109
You steal art?

1063
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:47,977
One picture.

1064
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:50,446
Anyway, we need to make
a plan for your survival.

1065

It's in code and you might need
a magnifying glass to read it,

1067
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,917
but it tells you
exactly where and how

1068
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:55,951
to find <i>Boy with Apple.</i>

1069
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:57,586
Don't take less than half
the retail asking price.

1070
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,588
Also...
Zero, I'm a baker.

1071
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,756
You're a pastry chef.
I'm not a middleman.

1072
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,391
One of the best
in the region.
I'm not a fence

1073
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:02,992
if that's the term.

1074
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,095

Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig,
this is the divine Zero.

Gunther was slain

Well, boys, who knows

No time to gab.

1158
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:34,436
Take care of yourself,
Mr. Gustave.

1159

Good luck, kid.

1161
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,410
Which way to the safe house?

1162
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,145
I-I couldn't find one.

1163
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:43,979
No safe house?

1164
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:46,348
Really? We're completely
on our own out here?

1165
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,282
I'm afraid so.

1166
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,618
I-I asked around, but,
uh... (muttering)

1167
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,919
I understand.
Too risky.

1168
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,854
We'll just have to
wing it, I suppose.

1169
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:55,390
Let's put on our disguises.

1170
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,358
We're wearing them.

1171
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,326
No-no, we're not.

1172
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,462
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

1173
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:01,563
You didn't bring any?

1174
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,098
I-I thought you
were growing one.

1175
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,966
And it wouldn't...

1176
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:05,167
it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

1177
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:08,370
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

1178
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:09,905
But I-I take your point.
So be it.

1179

GUSTAVE:
Give-give me a few squirts
of L'air de Panache,

1180
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,542
please, will you?
(man yells)

1181
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:14,343
(distant clank)

1182
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:16,478
Well, can I...
can I not get a squirt, even?

1183
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,046
I forgot the
L'air de Panache.

1184
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,316
Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?

1185
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,218
I don't believe it.

1186
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,419
I mean, how could you?

1187
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,387
I've been in jail, Zero.

1188
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,723
Do you understand how
humiliating this is?

1189
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,992
I smell.
(sniffs)

1190
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,395
(wry laugh) That's just
marvelous, isn't it?

1191
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,664
I suppose this is
to be expected back in...

1192
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,466
Where do you come from again?

1193
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,533
Aq Salim al-Jabat.
Precisely.

1194
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:41,336
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat,

1195
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,272
where one's prized possessions
are a stack of filthy carpets

1196
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:45,874
and a starving goat,
and one sleeps

1197
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:49,244
behind a tent flap and survives
on wild dates and scarabs,

1198
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,680
but it's not
how I trained you.

1199
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,548
What on God's earth possessed
you to leave the homeland,

1200
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:57,185
where you very obviously belong,
and travel unspeakable distances

1201
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,186
to become a penniless immigrant

1202
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,222
in a refined,
highly-cultivated society that,

1203
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:05,060
quite frankly, could've gotten
along very well without you?

1204
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,695
The war.

1205
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,063
Say again?

1206
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:10,232
Well, you see,
my father was murdered

1207
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,335
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

1208
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,636
Our village was burned
to the ground,

1209
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:18,607
and those who managed to survive
were forced to flee.

1210
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,876
I left because of the war.

1211
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,444
I see.
So you're-you're, actually,

1212
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:26,782
really more of a-a refugee,
in that sense?

1213
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:27,315
Truly.

1214
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:30,052
Well, I suppose
I better take back

1215
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,287
everything I just said.

1216
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,690
What a bloody idiot I am.

1217
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:35,724
Pathetic fool.

1218
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,626
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

1219
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:38,593
This is disgraceful,

1220
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:41,697
and it's beneath the standards
of the Grand Budapest.

Monsieur Gustave.

You were just upset
I forgot the perfume.

1225
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,005
Don't make excuses for me.

1226
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:51,707
I owe you my life.

1227

<i>Guten Abend. Monsieur</i>
<i>Ivan, bitte. Danke.</i>

1284
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:27,462
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

1285
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:29,598
for a first night
at the Opera Toscana

1286
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
with one day's notice?

1287
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,434
How does one arrange
a private viewing

1288
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:35,503
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

1289
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,639
How does one secure
a corner table

1290
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,708
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

1291
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,377
Ivan, darling,
it's Gustave. Hello.

1292
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,312
Well, I was until
about five minutes ago.

1293
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:45,513
We've taken it
upon ourselves

1294
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:47,883
to clear out in a hurry,
if you see what I mean.

1295
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,151
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens.

1296
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:50,785
Exactly. Listen, Ivan,

1297
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:53,688
I'm sorry to cut you off,
but we're in a bit of a bind.

1298
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,023
This is an official request.

1299
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:59,227
I'm formally calling
upon the special services of...

IVAN:
<i>I'll call you back, Gustave.</i>

01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,335
Right. Stand by.

1302
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:08,904
I beg your pardon.

1303
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,739
Do you prefer to walk?

1304
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,307
We're right here.

1305
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,208
It's very simple.

1306

Straight down the corniche,
then left.

1307

01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,969
Documents, please.

1764
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:37,771
With pleasure.

1765
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,039
As always.

1766
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,808
(heavy footsteps approaching)

1767
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,211
You're the first
of the official death squads

1768
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:47,247
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

1769
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:49,716
How do you do?

1770
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,053
<i>"Plus ça change,"</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

1771
01:29:56,257 --> 01:29:57,958
Uh... That's a Migratory Visa

1772
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,660
with Stage Three
Worker Status, darling.

1773
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:02,429
Read this.

1774
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:12,172
SOLDIER:
Come outside.

1775
01:30:12,174 --> 01:30:14,241
GUSTAVE:
Now, stay there.

1776
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:17,778
I give you my word,
if you lay a finger on this man,

1777
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:20,247
I'll see you dishonorably
discharged, locked up

1778
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:23,984
in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1779
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:26,353
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>There are still</i>
<i>faint glimmers</i>

1780
01:30:26,355 --> 01:30:29,055
<i>of civilization left in this</i>
<i>barbaric slaughterhouse</i>

1781
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:32,192
<i>that was once known</i>
<i>as humanity.</i>

1782
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:33,827
(gasps)

1783
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:35,061
(screams)
You filthy, goddamn,

1784
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:38,865
pockmarked, fascist assholes!
(train whistle blows)

1785
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,201
MR. MOUSTAFA:
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1786
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,005
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1787
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,448
What happened
in the end?

1788
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,184
In the end,
they shot him.

1789
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:01,087
So it all went to me.

1790

YOUNG WRITER:
<i>After dinner,</i>

1791
01:31:09,832 --> 01:31:12,199
<i>we went to collect</i>
<i>the keys to our rooms,</i>

1792
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:14,468

<i>had abandoned his post.</i>

1793

I expect he's forgotten

1801

1803

<i>unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1804
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,361
<i>Why?</i>

1805
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:43,730
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1806
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:47,701

<i>but I felt I must know.</i>

1808
01:31:50,038 --> 01:31:52,239
<i>For my health, I suppose.</i>

1809
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,075
Forgive me for asking.

1810
01:31:55,077 --> 01:31:57,110
I hope
I haven't upset you.

1811
01:31:57,112 --> 01:31:59,513
No, of course not.

1812
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,314
Is it simply
your last connection

1813
01:32:01,316 --> 01:32:03,083
to that vanished world--

1814
01:32:03,085 --> 01:32:05,652
his world, if you will?

1815
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:07,254
His world?

1816
01:32:07,256 --> 01:32:09,956
No, I don't think so.

1817
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,959
You see, we shared
a vocation.

1818
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:15,195
It wouldn't have
been necessary.

1819
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:16,863
No.

1820
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:20,267
The hotel I keep for Agatha.

1821
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:22,836
We were happy here.

1822
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,838
For a little while.

1823
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:26,907
(elevator bell dings)

1824
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:32,412
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

1825
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,447
long before
he ever entered it.

1826
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:35,916
But I will say...

1827
01:32:35,918 --> 01:32:38,051
he certainly
sustained the illusion

1828
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:40,587
with a marvelous grace.

1829
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:41,521
Are you going up?

1830
01:32:41,523 --> 01:32:43,990
No, I'll sit
for a little while.

1831
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:46,192
Good night.

1832
