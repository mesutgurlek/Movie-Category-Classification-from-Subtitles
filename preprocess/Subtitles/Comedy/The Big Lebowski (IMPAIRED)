00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,982
See them
Tumbling down

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,988
Pledging their love
To the ground

4
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,819
Narrator: A way out west
There was this fella,

5
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,121
Fella I want
To tell you about,

6
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,163
Fella by the name
Of jeff lebowskl,

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,599
At least that
Was the handle

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,532
That his loving parents
Gave him.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,571
But he never had
Much use for it himself.

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,741
This lebowskl,
He called himself the dude.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,745
Now dude, That's a name
No one would self-Apply

12
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,848
Where I come from.

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,281
But then, There was
A lot about the dude

14
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,183
That didn't make a whole
Lot of sense to me,

15
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,154
And a lot about
Where he lived, Likewise.

16
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,520
Along with the
Tumbling tumbleweed

17
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,490
Narrator: But then again,

18
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,529
Maybe that's why I found the
Place so dern interesting.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,737
They call los angeles
The city of angels.

20
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,975
I didn't find it
To be that exactly.

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,178
But I'll allow there
Are some nice folks there.

22
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,049
'Course I can't
Say I seen london,

23
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,048
And I never
Been to france,

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,087
And I ain't never seen no
Queen in her damned undies

25
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,591
As the fella says.

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,590
But I'll tell you what,

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,228
After seeing los angeles

28
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,263
And this a-Here story
I'm about to unfold,

29
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,566
Well, I guess
I seen somethin'

30
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:43,834
Every bit as stupefyin'

31
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,870
As you'd see in any
Of those other places,

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,069
And in english, Too.

33
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,040
So I can die
With a smile on my face

34
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,079
Without feeling like
The good lord gypped me.

35
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,345
Now this here story
I'm about to unfold

36
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,782
Took place back
In the early nineties,

37
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,821
Just about the time of
Our conflict with saddam

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,618
And the iraqis.

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,659
I only mention it 'cause
Sometimes there's a man,

40
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,930
I won't say a hero,

41
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,793
'Cause what's a hero?

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,958
But sometimes
There's a man,

43
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,003
And I'm talking
About the dude here,

44
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,539
Sometimes there's a man,

45
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,605
Well,

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,643
He's the man
For his time and place.

47
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,741
He fits right in there,

48
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,146
And that's the dude,

49
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,876
In los angeles.

50
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,817
And even if
He's a lazy man,

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,220
And the dude was
Most certainly that,

52
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,259
Quite possibly the laziest
In los angeles county,

53
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,359
Which would place him
High in the running

54
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,399
For laziest worldwide.

55
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,162
But sometimes
There's a man,

56
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,204
Sometimes...
There's a man.

57
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,708
Wow, Lost my train
Of thought here.

58
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,070
But... Ah, Hell.

59
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,773
I done introduced
Him enough.

60
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,680
George bush: All for
A collective action.

61
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,411
This will not stand.

62
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,520
This will not stand,

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,987
This aggression
Against kuwait.

64
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,025
Here on the range
I belong

65
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,831
Drifting along
With the tumbling

66
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,770
Tumbleweed

67
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,048
Aah!

68
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,020
Where's the money,
Lebowskl?

69
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,818
I want that money,
Lebowskl.

70
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,325
Bunny says you're
Good for it.

71
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,861
Where's the money,
Lebowskl?

72
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,465
Where's the money,
Lebowskl?

73
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,125
Where's the fucking
Money, Shithead?!

74
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,066
Well, It's, Uh, Ohh,

75
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,404
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

76
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,709
Don't fuck with us!

77
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,171
Your wife owes money
To jackie treehorn,

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,216
That means you own
Money to jackie treehorn.

79
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,385
Ever thus to
Deadbeats, Lebowskl.

80
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,917
No, No, Don't do that...

81
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,185
Not on the rug, Man.

82
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:21,952
See?

83
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,595
See what happens,
Lebowskl?

84
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,162
You see what happens?

85
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,798
Nobody calls me
Lebowskl.

86
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,833
You got the wrong guy.
I'm the dude, Man.

87
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,433
Your name's
Lebowskl, Lebowskl.

88
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,402
Your wife is bunny.

89
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,441
My... My wife...
My wife bunny?

90
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,935
Do you see a wedding
Ring on my finger?

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,411
Does this place look
Like I'm fucking married?

92
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,449
The toilet seat's up,
Man.

93
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,550
What the fuck
Is this?

94
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,594
Obviously,
You're not a golfer.

95
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,160
Woo?

96
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:01,561
Yeah?

97
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,601
Isn't this guy supposed
To be a millionaire?

98
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,572
Woo: Fuck!

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,368
Yeah, What do you think?

100
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,135
He looks like
A fucking loser.

101
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,179
Hey, At least
I'm housebroken.

102
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,210
Fucking time wasted.

103
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,250
Thanks a lot,
Asshole.

104
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,059
La la la la
La la la la la

105
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,023
La la la la
La la la la la

106
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,065
La la la la
La la la la la

107
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,635
La la la la

108
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,404
La la la

109
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,442
La la la la
La la la la la

110
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,382
The man in me will do

111
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,852
Nearly any task

112
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,984
And as for compensation

113
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,956
There's a little
He would ask

114
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,128
Take a woman like you

115
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,423
To get through

116
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,468
To the man in me

117
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,440
The storm clouds
Are raging

118
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,177
All around my door

119
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,781
I think to myself

120
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,816
I might not
Take it anymore

121
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,453
Take a woman
Like your kind

122
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,956
To find the man in me

123
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,595
But, Oh

124
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,633
What a wonderful feeling

125
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,070
Just to know
That you are near

126
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,644
That sets
My heart a-Reelin'

127
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,816
From my toes

128
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,784
Up to my ears

129
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,590
The man in me
Will hide sometimes

130
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,959
To keep from being seen

131
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,926
But that's just because

132
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,965
He doesn't want to
Turn into some machine

133
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,870
Take a woman like you

134
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,800
To get through

135
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,874
To the man in me

136
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,577
Whoo!

137
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,306
I'm throwing
Rocks tonight.

138
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,677
Mark it, Dude.

139
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,217
This was a valued rug.

140
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,285
Ahem. This was a...

141
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,117
Yeah, Man, It really
Tied the room together.

142
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,986
So this was
A valued, Uh...

143
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,922
What tied the room
Together, Dude?

144
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:42,321
My rug.

145
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,520
Were you listening to
The dude's story, Donny?

146
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:44,924
What?

147
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,894
Were you listening
To the dude's story?

148
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,430
I was bowling.

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,433
So you have no frame
Of reference here, Donny.

150
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,535
You're like a child

151
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,194
Who wanders in
In the middle of a movie...

152
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,339
Walter, What's
The point, Man?

153
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,668
There's no reason...
Here's my point, Dude...

154
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,673
There's no fucking reason...

155
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,709
Yeah, Walter,
What's your point?

156
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,140
Huh?

157
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,405
Walter, What
Is the point...

158
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,481
Look, We all know
Who is at fault here.

159
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,344
What the fuck are
You talking about?

160
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,782
Huh? No, What
The fuck are you...

161
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,046
I'm not...

162
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,816
We're talking about unchecked
Aggression here, Dude.

163
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,754
What the fuck is
He talking about?

164
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,153
My rug.

165
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,885
Forget it, Donny.
You're out of your element.

166
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,121
Walter, The chinaman
Who peed on my rug,

167
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,924
I can't go
Give him a bill.

168
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,794
So what the fuck
Are you talking about?

169
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,196
What the fuck
Are you talking about?

170
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,064
The chinaman is not
The issue here, Dude.

171
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,570
I'm talking about drawing
A line in the sand, Dude.

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,640
Across this line,
You do not...

173
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,676
Also, Dude, Chinaman is not
The preferred nomenclature.

174
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,177
Asian-American,
Please.

175
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,215
Walter, This isn't a guy
Who built the railroads here,

176
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:39,881
This is a guy...

177
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,485
What the fuck
Are you talking...

178
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,985
Walter,
He peed on my rug.

179
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,645
He peed on
The dude's rug.

180
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,553
Donny, You're
Out of your element.

181
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,490
Dude, The chinaman
Is not the issue here.

182
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,788
So,
Who... Who...

183
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:51,554
Jeff lebowskl.

184
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,562
The other
Jeffrey lebowskl,

185
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,325
The millionaire.

186
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,399
That's fucking
Interesting, Man.

187
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,934
That's fucking
Interesting.

188
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,629
Plus, He has
The wealth, Obviously,

189
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,932
And the resources,

190
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,541
Uh, So that
There's no reason...

191
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,869
There's no
Fucking reason

192
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,341
Why his wife
Should go out

193
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,570
And owe money
All over town,

194
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,236
And then they come

195
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,541
And they pee on
Your fucking rug!

196
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,774
Am I wrong?
No.

197
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,849
Am I wrong?

198
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,781
Yeah, But...

199
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,352
Ok, Then. Ahem.

200
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,853
That rug really tied
The room together,

201
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,582
Did it not?

202
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,282
Fuckin' a!

203
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,017
And this guy
Peed on it.

204
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:22,626
Donny, Please.

205
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,023
You know, This
Is the fucking guy...

206
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,027
I could find this
Fucking lebowskl guy.

207
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,631
His name is lebowskl?

208
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,131
That's your name, Dude.

209
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,098
This is the guy

210
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,760
Who should compensate me
For the fucking rug.

211
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,963
His wife goes out

212
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,129
And owes money
All over town,

213
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,798
And they pee on my rug?

214
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,671
They pee on
Your fucking rug.

215
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,175
They pee on
My fucking rug.

216
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,906
Walter:
That's right, Dude.

217
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,949
They peed on
Your fucking rug.

218
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,118
This is the study.

219
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,585
As you can see,
The various commendations...

220
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,383
"Jeffrey lebowskl."

221
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,083
Honorary degrees,
Etcetera.

222
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,285
Hmm, Very impressive.

223
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,828
Oh, Please feel free
To inspect them.

224
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,125
Hmm? Oh, No, I'm
Not really that...

225
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,732
Oh, Please, Please.

226
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,801
That is the key to
The city of pasadena,

227
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,904
Which mr. Lebowskl
Received 2 years ago

228
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,939
In recognition of
His various civic, Uh...

229
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,133
Oh, That's
The los angeles

230
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,676
Chamber of commerce
Business achiever award,

231
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,574
Which is given...

232
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,146
Oh, Not necessarily
Given every year.

233
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,182
Hey, Is this, Uh,
Is this him with nancy?

234
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,578
Yes, Indeed,
That is mr. Lebowski

235
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,745
With the first lady, Yes.
It was taken when...

236
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,790
That's, Uh, Lebowskl
On the left there?

237
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,324
Yeah, Of course.
Mr. Lebowskl on the left...

238
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,462
So he's a cripple...

239
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,825
Uh, You know,
A... A handicapped guy?

240
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,092
Mr. Lebowskl
Is disabled, Yes.

241
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,256
Uh, This picture
Was taken

242
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,926
When mrs. Reagan was
First lady of the nation,

243
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,630
Yes, Yes.
Not of california.

244
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,068
Pope john.

245
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,471
Uh, In fact, He met
Privately with the president,

246
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,133
Though unfortunately,

247
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,609
There wasn't enough time
For a photo opportunity.

248
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,838
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.

249
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,074
Oh, Wonderful woman.
We're very happy...

250
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,614
These are, Uh...

251
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,582
Oh, Those are mr. Lebowskl's
Children, So to speak.

252
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,654
Different mothers, Huh?

253
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,346
Racially, Pretty cool.

254
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,354
Ha ha ha ha.

255
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,049
They're not literally
His children.

256
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,923
They're the little
Lebowskl urban achievers,

257
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,290
Inner-City children
Of promise

258
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,795
But without
The necessary means for...

259
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,093
Necessary means for
A higher education.

260
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,735
So mr. Lebowskl
Is committed

261
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,201
To sending all
Of them to college.

262
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,202
Excuse me.

263
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,238
Thank you. Thank you.

264
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:16,932
Far out.

265
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,202
Think he's got room
For one more?

266
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,208
One, Uh...

267
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,074
Oh. Ha ha ha.

268
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,579
You never
Went to college.

269
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,011
Please,
Don't touch that.

270
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,549
Yeah, No, I did,
But, You know,

271
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,084
I spent most
Of my time, Um,

272
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,313
Occupying various
Administration buildings,

273
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,855
Uh, Smoking a lot
Of thal stick,

274
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,686
Breaking into
The r.O.T.C.,

275
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,827
And bowling.

276
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,519
To tell you
The truth, Brandt,

277
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,324
I don't remember
Most of it.

278
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,331
Oh.

279
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,525
Hmm.

280
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,570
Ok, Sir, You're a lebowskl,
I'm a lebowskl,

281
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:48,764
That's terrific.

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,242
But I'm very busy,
As I imagine you are.

283
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,875
What can I
Do for you, Sir?

284
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,039
Uh, Well, Sir,
It's, Uh,

285
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,149
This rug I have.

286
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,479
It really tied
The room together. Uh...

287
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,088
You told brandt on
The phone, He told me.

288
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,349
Where do I fit in?

289
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,492
Well, Uh, They were...

290
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,026
They were looking
For you, These 2 guys.

291
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:10,855
Uh...

292
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,496
I'll say it again.

293
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,531
You told brandt on
The phone, He told me.

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,064
I know what happened.
Yes? Yes?

295
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,225
Oh, So you know that

296
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,531
They were trying
To piss on your rug?

297
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,037
Did I urinate
On your rug?

298
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,369
You mean, Did you
Personally come

299
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,532
And pee on my rug?

300
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,338
Hello! Do you
Speak english, Son?

301
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,779
Parla usted ingles?

302
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,815
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

303
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,351
No, Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

304
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,386
I just want to
Understand this, Sir.

305
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,581
Every time a rug
Is micturated upon

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,626
In this fair city, I have
To compensate the person...

307
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,795
Come on, Man,

308
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,591
I'm not trying
To scam anybody here.

309
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,597
Uh, You know,

310
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,895
You were just
Looking for a handout

311
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,833
Like every other...

312
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,838
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowskl?

313
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,032
Uh, Wait, Let me...

314
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,870
Let me explain
Something to you.

315
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,842
I am not mr. Lebowskl.
You're mr. Lebowskl.

316
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,746
I'm the dude. So that's
What you call me,

317
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,784
You know, Uh, That
Or, Uh, His dudeness,

318
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,221
Or, Uh, Duder, Or, You
Know, Uh, El duderino,

319
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,791
If you're not into
The whole brevity thing.

320
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,823
Are you employed, Sir?

321
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,396
Employed?

322
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,395
Ha ha.

323
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,794
You don't go out
Looking for a job

324
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,561
Dressed like that,
Do you, On a weekday?

325
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,604
Is this a...
What day is this?

326
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,771
Well, I do work, Sir.

327
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,375
So if you don't mind...

328
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,772
No, I do mind.

329
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,071
Uh, The dude minds.

330
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,713
This will not stand,
You know.

331
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,179
This aggression
Will not stand, Man.

332
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,181
I mean, Your wife owes...

333
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,980
My wife is not
The issue here!

334
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,089
I hope that
Someday my wife

335
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,849
Will learn to live
On her allowance,

336
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,960
Which is ample,
But if she does not,

337
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,925
That is her problem,
Not mine,

338
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,586
Just as the rug
Is your problem,

339
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,029
Just as every bum's
Lot in life

340
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,600
Is his own
Responsibility,

341
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,135
Regardless of who
He chooses to blame.

342
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,103
I didn't blame anyone
For the loss of my legs.

343
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,069
Some chinaman took them
From me in korea.

344
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,042
But I went out
And achieved anyway.

345
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,078
Ha ha ha.

346
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,478
I cannot solve
Your problems, Sir,

347
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,517
Only you can.

348
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,218
Oh, Fuck it.

349
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,150
Oh, Fuck it.

350
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,449
Yes, That's your answer.

351
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,989
That's your answer
To everything.

352
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,353
Tattoo it
On your forehead.

353
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,394
Your revolution is
Over, Mr. Lebowskl!

354
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,327
Condolences!

355
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,294
The bums lost!

356
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,333
My advice to you is to do
What your parents did!

357
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,333
Get a job, Sir!

358
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,439
The bums will always lose!

359
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,439
Do you hear me,
Lebowskl?!

360
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,272
The bums
Will always lose!

361
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,074
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowskl?

362
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,116
Ok. The old man told me to
Take any rug in the house.

363
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,282
Well, Enjoy,

364
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,288
And perhaps we'll see you
Again sometime, Dude.

365
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,983
Yeah, Sure, Uh, If I'm
In the neighborhood,

366
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,027
You know, And, Uh...

367
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,362
I need to use the john.

368
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,743
Blow on them.

369
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,640
Huh?

370
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,679
Go ahead, Blow.

371
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,116
You want me to blow
On your, Uh, Toes?

372
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,980
Uh-Huh. Ha ha ha.

373
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,022
I can't blow that far.

374
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,658
Are you sure
He won't mind?

375
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,095
He really doesn't
Care about anything.

376
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,598
He's a nihilist.

377
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,067
Oh, And that
Must be exhausting.

378
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:39,966
You're not blowing.

379
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,006
Our guest has to be getting
Along, Mrs. Lebowskl.

380
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,609
Oh, You're bunny.

381
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,613
I'll suck your cock
For $1,000.

382
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,650
Ha ha ha ha ha.

383
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,984
Wonderful woman.

384
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,850
We're all... We're all
Very fond of her.

385
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,853
Very free-Spirited.

386
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,321
Brandt can't watch,
Though,

387
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,686
Or he has
To pay 100.

388
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,727
Ha ha ha.
That's marvelous.

389
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,065
Uh, I'm just gonna
Go find a cash machine.

390
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:14,900
Whoo! Ha ha!

391
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,268
Slamming them
Tonight.

392
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,171
You guys are
Dead in the water.

393
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,211
Walter: All right!
Way to go, Donny!

394
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,581
If you will it,
It is no dream.

395
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,277
You're fucking
20 Minutes late, Man.

396
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,886
What the fuck is that?

397
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,078
Theodore herzel.

398
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:30,550
Huh?

399
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,556
The state of israel.
If you will it, Dude,

400
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,215
It is no dream.

401
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,655
What the fuck you
Talking about, Man?

402
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,853
The carrier. What's
In the fucking carrier?

403
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,292
Hmm?
Oh, Cynthia's dog.

404
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,592
I think
It's a pomeranian.

405
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,166
I can't leave him
Home alone

406
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,563
Or he eats
The furniture.

407
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,704
I'm watching it

408
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,065
While cynthia
And marty ackerman

409
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:47,603
Are in hawail.

410
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,967
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

411
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,904
What do you mean,
"Brought it bowling"?

412
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,168
I didn't rent it shoes,

413
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,572
I'm not buying it
A fucking beer,

414
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,805
He's not taking
Your fucking turn, Dude.

415
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,448
Man, If my
Fucking ex-Wife

416
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,844
Asked me to take care
Of her fucking dog

417
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,610
While she and her boyfriend
Went to honolulu,

418
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,276
I'd tell her to
Go fuck herself.

419
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,421
Why can't she board it?

420
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,523
First of all, Dude,
You don't have an ex.

421
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,716
Secondly, This is
A fucking show dog

422
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,552
With fucking papers.

423
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,285
You can't board it.
It gets upset.

424
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,554
Its hair falls out.

425
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,025
Walter...

426
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,960
The fucking dog
Has fucking papers.

427
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,124
Over the line!

428
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,466
I'm sorry, Smokey,
You were over the line.

429
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,228
That's a foul.

430
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,531
Bullshit.
Mark it 8, Dude.

431
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,573
Uh, Excuse me, Mark it
Zero. Next frame.

432
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,434
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

433
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,103
Smokey, This is not
'Nam, This is bowling.

434
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:29,747
There are rules.

435
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,042
Hey, Walter, Come on,
It's just...

436
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:32,876
Hey, Man, It's smokey.

437
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,383
So his toe slipped
Over a little.

438
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,043
You know, It's
Just a game, Man.

439
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,620
This is a league game.
This determines

440
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,553
Who enters
The next round-Robin.

441
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,191
Am I wrong?

442
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,553
Smokey: Yeah,
But I wasn't...

443
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,250
Am I wrong?

444
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,759
Yeah,
But I wasn't over.

445
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,157
Give me
The marker, Dude.

446
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,661
I'm marking an 8.

447
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,356
Smokey, My friend,

448
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,764
You're entering
A world of pain.

449
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,595
Walter, Man.

450
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,828
You mark
That frame an 8,

451
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,771
You're entering
A world of pain.

452
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,067
I'm not...

453
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,539
A world of pain.

454
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,644
Look, Dude,
This is your partner.

455
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,247
Has the whole world
Gone crazy?!

456
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,939
Am I the only one
Around here

457
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,675
Who gives a shit
About the rules?!

458
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,841
Mark it zero!

459
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,214
They're calling
The cops, Man.

460
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,355
Put the piece away.

461
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,045
Mark it zero!

462
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,248
Walter, Put
The piece away.

463
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:13,754
Walter...

464
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,655
You think I'm
Fucking around here?

465
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,695
Mark it zero!

466
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,594
All right,
It's fucking zero.

467
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,638
You happy,
You crazy fuck?

468
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,109
It's a league game,
Smoke.

469
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,171
You can't do that, Man.

470
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,975
These guys, You know,
They're like me.

471
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,912
They're pacifists.

472
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,075
Smokey was a
Conscientious objector.

473
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,481
You know, Dude,
I, Myself,

474
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,679
Dabbled in pacifism
At one point,

475
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,414
Not in 'nam,
Of course.

476
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,458
And you know he's got
Emotional problems, Man.

477
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,491
You mean,
Beyond pacifism?

478
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,530
He's fragile,
Very fragile.

479
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,600
Huh. I did not know that.

480
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,367
Well,

481
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,063
It's all water
Under the bridge,

482
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,766
And we do enter
The next round-Robin.

483
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,137
[Police siren]

Exactly what's really
Wrong with the cable.

1134
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,517
Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

1135
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,744
The tv's in here.

1136
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,787
You recognize her,
Of course.

1137
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,421
Bunny: Oh, That's
My friend sharl.

1138
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,620
She just came over
To use the shower.

1139
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,321
The story
Is ludicrous.

1140
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,733
Meine nommen is karl.
Ich bin expert.

1141
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,802
You must be here
To fix the cable.

1142
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,838
Maude: Lord, You can imagine
Where it goes from here.

1143
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,139
He fixes the cable?

1144
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,537
Don't be fatuous,
Jeffrey.

1145
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,906
Little matter to me
That this woman chose

1146
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,308
To pursue a career
In pornography

1147
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,177
Nor that she has been
"Banging" jackie treehorn,

1148
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,512
To use the parlance
Of our times,

1149
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:29,913
However,

1150
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,954
I am one of the 2 trustees
Of the lebowskl foundation,

1151
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:34,614
The other being my father.

1152
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,158
The foundation takes
Youngsters from watts and...

1153
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,453
Shit, Yeah,
The achievers.

1154
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,221
Little lebowskl
Urban achievers, Yes,

1155
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,921
And proud we are
Of all of them,

1156
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,966
I asked my father about
His withdrawal of $1 million

1157
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,098
From the foundation account,

1158
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,931
And he told me
About this abduction.

1159
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,834
But I tell you,
It is preposterous.

1160
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:50,837
This compulsive fornicator

1161
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,875
Is taking my father
For the proverbial ride.

1162
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:54,870
Yeah, But my...

1163
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:55,670
I'm getting to your rug.

1164
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,336
My father and I
Don't get along.

1165
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,776
He doesn't approve
Of my lifestyle,

1166
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,576
And, Needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

1167
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,618
However, I hardly wish to make
My father's embezzlement

1168
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:04,652
A police matter,

1169
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,689
So I'm proposing that you
Try to recover the money

1170
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,821
From the people
You delivered it to.

1171
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,689
Well, Uh,
I could do that.

1172
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,730
If you successfully do so,
I will compensate you

1173
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,033
To the tune of 10%
Of the recovered sum.

1174
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:21,696
A hundred...

1175
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,136
Thousand. Yes.
Bones or clams

1176
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,400
Or whatever you call them.

1177
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,942
Yeah, But... But, Uh...

1178
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:28,736
What about my, Uh...

1179
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,903
Your rug, Yes.
Well, With that money

1180
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,139
You can buy
Any number of rugs

1181
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,511
That don't have
Sentimental value for me.

1182
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,347
And I am sorry about
That crack on the jaw.

1183
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,183
Oh, Th-That's fine.
That doesn't even, Uh...

1184
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,722
Here's the name and number
Of a doctor

1185
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,519
Who will look at it
For you.

1186
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,524
You will receive no bill.

1187
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,094
He's a good man,
And thorough.

1188
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,424
Th-That's thoughtful,
But...

1189
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,463
Please see him, Jeffrey.

1190
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,658
He's a good man,
And thorough.

1191
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,824
Oh, Well...

1192
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,504
All right.
All right.

1193
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,605
So he says, "My wife's
A pain in the ass.

1194
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,708
"She's always bustin'
My friggin' agates.

1195
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,675
"My daughter's married
To a real loser bastard,

1196
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,214
"And I got a rash
So bad on my ass

1197
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,007
"I can't even sit down.

1198
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,051
But you know me, I can't
Complain." [Laughs]

1199
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,979
Ah, Fuckin' a, Man.
I got a rash, Man.

1200
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,488
Fuckin' a.

1201
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,889
I gotta tell you,
Tone, Man,

1202
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,928
Earlier in the day, I was
Really feeling shitty, Man.

1203
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,299
Really down
In the dumps.

1204
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,399
Lost a little money...

1205
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,435
Hey, You know what?
Forget about it, Huh?

1206
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,933
Forget about it.

1207
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:29,697
Yeah, Fuck it, Man.

1208
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,534
I can't be worried
About that shit.

1209
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,538
Life goes on, Man.

1210
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,576
Home, Sweet home,
Mr. L.

1211
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,308
Tony: Hey, Yo. Look.

1212
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,611
Who's your friend
In the volkswagen?

1213
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:43,844
Huh?

1214
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,717
Yeah, He followed us
Here.

1215
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,687
When did he start foll...
Aah!

1216
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,223
What the fuck?!

1217
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,021
In the limo, You son
Of a bitch. No arguing.

1218
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,062
Hey, Careful, Man.
There's a beverage here.

1219
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,561
Hey!

1220
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,757
Start talking

1221
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,924
And talk fast,
You lousy bum.

1222
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,093
We've been frantically
Trying to reach you, Dude.

1223
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,138
Where's my goddamn
Money, You bum?!

1224
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,066
W-Well, We...

1225
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,040
l... l... I...

1226
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:08,677
They did not

1227
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,369
Receive the money,
You nitwit!

1228
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,276
They did not receive
The money!

1229
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,417
Her life
Was in your hands!

1230
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,778
This is our concern,
Dude.

1231
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,649
No, Man,
Nothing is fucked here.

1232
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:19,914
Nothing
Is fucked?!

1233
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:20,784
No, Man.

1234
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,686
The goddamn plane

1235
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,088
Has crashed
Into the mountain!

1236
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:24,920
Look, Man, Come on.

1237
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,962
Who are you gonna believe,
Those guys or, Uh...

1238
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,894
We dropped off
The damn money.

1239
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,059
We?!

1240
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,203
I.

1241
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,895
The royal we.

1242
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:36,903
You know, The editorial.

1243
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,008
I dropped off the money
Exactly as per...

1244
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,043
Look. Man, I've got certain
Information, All right?

1245
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,808
Certain things have
Come to light, And...

1246
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,417
You know, Has it
Ever occurred to you

1247
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,452
That instead of, Uh,
You know, Running around,

1248
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,289
Uh, Blaming me, Given the
Nature of all this new shit,

1249
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,227
Th-Th-This could be
A lot more, Uh...

1250
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,031
Uh, Uh, Uh, Complex?

1251
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,066
I mean, It might not be
Just such a simple, Uh,

1252
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,159
You know?

1253
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,827
What in god's
Holy name

1254
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,973
Are you blathering
About?

1255
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,007
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

1256
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,277
I've got information, Man.

1257
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,208
New shit has come to light.

1258
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,248
And... And, Shit, Man...

1259
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,085
She kidnapped herself.

1260
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,145
Well, Sure, Man.

1261
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:30,191
Look at it. You know,
A young trophy wife...

1262
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,362
In the parlance
Of our times, You know...

1263
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,396
She, Uh, Uh, Uh, Owes
Money all over town,

1264
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,033
Including to known
Pornographers.

1265
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,465
And that's cool.
That-That's cool.

1266
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,506
I'm saying,
She needs money, Man.

1267
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,904
And... And, You know,

1268
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,603
Of course they're gonna say
They didn't get it,

1269
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,648
Uh, Uh, Because
She wants more, Man.

1270
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,551
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean, Uh...

1271
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,221
Hasn't that ever occurred
To you, Man?

1272
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,193
Sir?

1273
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,556
No, Mr. Lebowskl,

1274
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,255
It had not occurred
To me.

1275
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,924
That had not occurred
To us, Dude.

1276
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,069
Well, Ok, You know,

1277
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,103
You guys aren't privy
To all the new shit, So...

1278
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,540
Uh, You know. But...

1279
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,575
Hey, That's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

1280
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:23,938
[Slurping]

1281
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,981
Speaking of which,
Do you think that you could, Uh,

1282
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,285
Give me my 20,000 In cash?

1283
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,320
My concern is... And I gotta
Check with my accountant...

1284
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,756
But this might bump me
Into a higher tax, Uh...

1285
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,585
Brandt...

1286
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,954
Give him
The envelope.

1287
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,995
Oh, Well, If you've already
Got the check made out,

1288
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:42,860
Th-That's cool.

1289
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,900
We received this
This morning.

1290
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,937
Since you have
Failed to achieve,

1291
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,040
Even in the modest task
Which was your charge,

1292
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,644
Since you have
Stolen my money,

1293
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,279
Since you have unrepentantly
Betrayed my trust...

1294
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,379
I have no choice

1295
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,419
But to tell these bums to do
Whatever is necessary

1296
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,291
To recover their money
From you, Jeffrey lebowskl.

1297
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,929
And with brandt
As my witness,

1298
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,492
I will tell you this:

1299
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,533
Any further harm
Visited upon bunny

1300
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,270
Will be visited tenfold
Upon your head.

1301
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,910
By god, Sir, I will not
Abide another toe.

1302
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,949
I hear the cottonwoods
Whisperin' above

1303
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,921
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

1304
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,189
Whose toe was it,
Walter?

1305
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,258
How the fuck should I know?

1306
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,861
I do know that nothing
About it indicates...

1307
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,895
Man, The nail
Polish, Walter.

1308
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:49,429
Fine, Dude.

1309
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,033
As if it's impossible
To get some nail polish,

1310
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,863
Apply it
To someone else's toe.

1311
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:54,799
Someone else's...

1312
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,768
Where the fuck
Are they gonna get...

1313
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,965
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

1314
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,110
Believe me,
There are ways, Dude.

1315
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,973
You don't wanna know
About it, Believe me.

1316
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,740
Hell, I can get you a toe
By 3:00 this afternoon,

1317
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,644
With nail polish.

1318
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,750
These fuckin' amateurs.

1319
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:09,544
Walter...

1320
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,617
They send us a toe,

1321
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,448
We're supposed to shit
Ourselves with fear.

1322
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,554
Jesus christ.
Walter...

1323
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:14,314
Now, The point is...

1324
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,651
They're gonna kill her,
Walter,

1325
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,123
And then they're gonna
Kill me.

1326
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,058
Dude...

1327
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,390
That's...

1328
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,396
That's just the stress
Talking, Man.

1329
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,400
Now so far we have
What appears to me

1330
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,061
To be a series of
Victimless crimes.

1331
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:29,864
What about the toe?

1332
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,632
Forget about
The fucking toe!

1333

Excuse me, Sir,

1334

Could you please
Keep your voices down?

1335
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,840
This is a family restaurant.

1336

Oh, Please, Dear.

Walter, This is not
A first amendment thing.

1340
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,677
If you don't calm down,

1341
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,186
I'm gonna have to ask you
To leave.

1342
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,224
Lady, I got buddies who
Died face down in the muck

1343
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,693
So you and I could enjoy
This family restaurant!

1344
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,160
All right,
I'm outta here.

Don't go away, Man.
