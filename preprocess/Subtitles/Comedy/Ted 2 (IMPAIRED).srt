00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,537
We are often told

3
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:41,251
that happily-ever-afters
exist only in the pages of fairy tales

4
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,921
and in the naive minds
of sheltered innocents.

5
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:49,133
And yet, on this bright,
sunny, Boston afternoon,

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,263
a talking teddy bear
is about to marry his girlfriend,

7
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,223
proving two things.

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,476
Happy endings can
come true for anyone.

9
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:02,105
And America doesn't give
a shit about anything.

10
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,649
Do you,
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

11
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,945
take this teddy bear to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,530
I do.

13
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,156
And do you, Ted,

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,785
take this woman to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

15
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,620
Fuckin' A right, I do!

16
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,708
Then, by the power
vested in me,

17
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,669
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

18
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,920
You may kiss the bear.

19
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,696
Ladies and gentlemen,
your newlyweds!

20
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,415
Teddy, this is
the best day of my life!

21
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,417
I just love you so much.

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,127
I love you, too, baby.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm gonna go fifty shades of bear
on you tonight.

24
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,256
Let's go get shit-faced!

25
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,466
Okay!

26
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,844
Thank you.

27
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,392
Hey, congrats,
you mofos.

28
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,477
Oh, hey, Guy.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,145
Beautiful ceremony.

30
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,397
Oh, Thank you so much
for being a part of it.

31
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,232
Hey, this is my new boyfriend,
Rick.

32
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,442
How you doing?

33
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,568
Good, good.

34
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:34,656
He's a gourmet chef, So he knows how
to toss a salad.

35
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,579
Rick and I are actually about
to tie the knot.

36
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,665
Oh, you guys
are getting married?

37
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,667
No, we're just gonna
go home and tie our dicks together.

38
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,168
- Ha! Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

39
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,586
Deal.

40
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,262
Hey, buddy.
You okay, there?

41
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,722
You look a little down.

42
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,517
Are you still shaking off that hangover from
the bachelor party?

43
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,394
Oh!
That's nice.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,437
Oh, my god, She's fucking
begging for it!

45
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,482
She's totally begging,
get it, get in there.

46
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,609
Look at her.
She wants it bad!

47
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:12,860
Oh, yeah.
She wants more

48
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,196
than just a fucking pizza delivery, huh?

49
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,282
That's bigger than the average bear
right there, I tell you.

50
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,160
You know what's fucked up? Dude, that's
somebody's fucking daughter!

51
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,705
Oh, shit!
Jesus! Come on!

52
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm fine, I was thinking
about Lori.

53
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,753
Oh, Johnny,
come on, man.

54
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:33,339
It's been six months since you guys
got divorced.

55
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,299
I know, I know.
It's just that...

56
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,635
Being back in
that church again.

57
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,471
I mean, everything seemed like it was
gonna be so perfect.

58
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,223
Yeah, well, you're
not the first guy

59
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,474
to marry the wrong girl.

60
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,352
Hey, hey!
big day, huh, bud?

61
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:50,481
You guys wanna celebrate with a little
something else, hmm?

62
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,900
Oh, uh, no, thanks, Sam.
Tami-Lynn would kill me

63
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,569
if I did drugs
on our wedding day.

64
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,279
Ah, she won't notice.

65
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,656
I just did a line with a dude
in the men's room

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,159
and I bet you
can't even spot him.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,168
Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

68
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,922
I'm steppin' out
with my honey

69
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,175
Can't be bad to feel so good

70
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,635
Never felt quite so sunny

71
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,596
So I keep on knockin' wood

72
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,015
Yeah, steppin' out
with my baby

73
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,434
Can't go wrong
'cause I'm in right

74
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,145
Ask me when will the day be

75
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,607
The big day may be tonight

76
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,442
This is the best
day of my life!

77
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,031
I'm starving, What the hell are
you doing over there?

78
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,407
I'm curing cancer.

79
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,618
I'm cooking your fucking steak.
What do you think I'm doing?

80
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:31,911
What do I think
you're doing?

81
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,788
I think you're bleeding us dry,
is what I think you're doing.

82
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,541
Look at this, look at this.
$129 at Filene's Basement.

83
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,627
What are you buying over there, Tami?
Gold bars?

84
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,295
I need clothes for work.
All right, Teddy?

85
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,881
What do you mean?
You wear a smook, you're a fucking cashier.

86
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,007
Yeah? So are you!

87
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,843
Yeah, exactly! And I'm not going out
and buying designer shit!

88
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,053
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no!

89
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,263
You're just buying weed,
you're just buying drugs.

90
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,348
You should fucking talk!

91
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,518
I was talking, I was just talking, just now,
until you interrupted me.

92
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,811
Well, I have to
interrupt you or else

93
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,895
I never get to
fucking say anything!

94
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:58,980
Are you gonna let
me finish talking?

95
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,064
You're always
cutting me off!

96
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,273
Are you gonna let
me finish talking?

97
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,943
It's important to
look good at work.

98
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,112
I am trying to climb
the corporate fence, here!

99
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,571
Nobody's in there
to look at your ass!

100
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,823
You're acting like an asshole!

101
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,491
Oh, what am I
acting like, Tami?

102
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,993
You're acting like
a fucking asshole!

103
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,661
Like an asshole! That's what
you're acting like!

104
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,580
You don't got to dress like Elizabeth Taylor
to put a yam in a plastic bag!

105
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,958
I am the face
of the business! Okay?

106
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,793
The face of the business?
So get the fuck off my case!

107
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,254
Jesus Christ! Listen to you!
You're delusional!

108
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,673
I should've married Robert DiCicco.
I really should've.

109
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,174
Fine! Fine!
Go torture that asshole!

110
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,509
He treated
me good!

111
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,346
And he had a dick!
He had an awesome dick!

112
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,599
Oh, newsflash! Boston whore has
seen Italian penis.

113
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,852
What the fuck did you
just call me, fucker?

114
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,311
What did you
fucking say?

115
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,688
Jesus!
What the fuck?

116
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,773
You wanna call me
a whore?

117
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,025
You wanna throw shit?

118
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,317
Yeah, I wanna
fucking throw shit!

119
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,444
I'll fucking throw shit!

120
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,738
Oh, Wow, There, see!
How do you like that?

121
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,197
I'm scared, Teddy!

122
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,450
I'm really fucking scared of you,
you little fucking bear!

123
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,909
Shut the fuck up!

124
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,453
Oh, for Christ's sake!

125
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,329
Hey, you shut the fuck up!

126
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,789
Why don't you come down
and make me, tough guy?

127
00:08:58,873 --> 00:08:59,999
Yeah, why don't you
come up here

128
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,375
and make me come
down there, tough guy?

129
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,627
I am gonna come up there
and I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

130
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,087
Yeah, why don't you
try it, asshole?

131
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,964
Get your ass up here
and kick my ass!

132
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,550
Shut the fuck up,
you stupid bitch!

133
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,593
Hey, shut up,
lady!

134
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,636
Run the fuck back
to Russia, you whore!

135
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,055
Get the fuck
out of here!

136
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,389
People are
trying to sleep!

137
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,474
God damn it!

138
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,641
Shut the fuck up!

139
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,102
- Hey, I'm really sorry!
- Yeah, me, too.

140
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,520
She's worse than us.

141
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,980
Yeah, she's
our enemy now.

142
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,573
Have you guys at least tried
marriage therapy?

143
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,992
Oh, God, yeah.
it was a frigging disaster.

144
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,578
$250 and we didn't
learn a goddamn thing.

145
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,497
$250? Dude,
that's ridiculous!

146
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,165
I mean, doesn't your insurance cover
that or something?

147
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,085
Nah, Tami-Lynn tried to sign up for
Obamacare on the Internet,

148
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,419
but I came back
five minutes later,

149
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,837
she was looking
at black cocks.

150
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,506
It seems like every
time you go online,

151
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,091
you're two clicks away
from black cocks.

152
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,383
Look.

153
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,178
See, I'll Google
"Grand Canyon.

154
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,889
Here. Look, it says,
"Did you mean black cocks?

155
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,974
I don't know, man.
I got to do something

156
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,643
or my marriage is
gonna collapse,

157
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,311
Here you go, guys.

158
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,021
We're gonna be
closing in a few,

159
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,648
but I'm going to
this after-hours thing

160
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,441
at my friend's apartment,
if you wanna join.

161
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,736
Oh, thanks, Allison, But l got an
early day tomorrow.

162
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh, okay.

163
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,158
Well, if you change your mind,
here's the address.

164
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,745
I put my cell number
on there, too.

165
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,959
Oh, my God!
Are you fucking kidding me?

166
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,085
What?

167
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,336
What do you mean, What?
After hours?

168
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,255
Jesus, Johnny, she totally wants
to sleep with you.

169
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,048
I'm not into it.

170
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,967
John, you've been saying that for over
a year-and-a-half

171
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,927
about every chick that
throws herself at you.

172
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,345
You got to get back
in the game, man!

173
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,680
No, don't start
this shit, all right?

174
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,265
Look, I wasted
six years of my life

175
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,766
with the wrong girl
and I got burned.

176
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,601
I'm not gonna make that same
mistake again.

177
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,645
Jesus, Johnny, you don't got
to marry Allison.

178
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,897
You just got to bang her and maybe
pee on her a little.

179
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,190
What?

180
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,318
It's always good to find new
ways to surprise your lover.

181
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,028
Yeah, I got
to take a leak.

182
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,074
Sorry, Allison, I tried.

183
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,536
It's okay, I just wish he wasn't
so goddamn cute.

184
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,413
Yeah, Hey, can I get
a Jack Daniel's

185
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,165
with just a splash
of Grey Goose?

186
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,250
Wish I could help you,
but we're closing.

187
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,544
Come on, one drink and I promise
I won't tell anybody

188
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,088
that Jay Leno comes in here
for gay bathroom sex.

189
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,674
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
Get off of me!

190
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,593
Sorry, my mistake.

191
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,477
There we go.
Thanks a lot, come again.

192
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,444
Hey.

193
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,695
Hello.

194
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:38,908
I'd, uh, like to ask a few questions about
this breakfast cereal.

195
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,452
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Box of Trix.

196
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,745
That's right.

197
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,957
I've been led to understand that Trix are
exclusively for children.

198
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,292
Is that correct?

199
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,379
I... I mean, they say, uh, Trix are for kids
in the commercials.

200
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,839
Uh-huh,
Uh-huh.

201
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,425
And is that
enforced by law?

202
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,094
Uh, not to my knowledge, no.

203
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,474
So if I purchase these Trix,
there'll be no trouble?

204
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,976
No, No, you...
You should be fine.

205
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,355
You do understand that I myself
am not a child?

206
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,982
Uh, I was able to
sniff that out, yeah.

207
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,153
Okay, I'm going to bring these back
to my apartment.

208
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,656
Uh, yeah, yeah.
You'll... You'll be okay.

209
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,659
And, uh,
I won't be followed?

210
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,204
Uh, no, that's...
That's not in our budget here.

211
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,667
Hey.

212
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,544
I won't forget what you've done
for me here today.

213
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,505
I would prefer that you do.

214
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,845
Jesus Christ.

215
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,275
You two still not talking?

216
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,484
No.

217
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,695
Honest to God, Joy, I don't know
how to fix this.

218
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,779
I mean, how the hell
do you take

219
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,531
a broken marriage
and make it work again?

220
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,993
Well, I'll tell you one way.
You have yourselves a baby.

221
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,160
A baby?

222
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,162
Uh-huh,
Look at that.

223
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,789
You see them two
white niggas over there?

224
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,833
Yeah, What?

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,626
Look at them.
They're so happy.

226
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,421
Because they got that little baby
keeping them together.

227
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,131
If they didn't have that baby,

228
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,300
they'd just be two
sad-ass white niggas

229
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,010
waiting for
Downtown Abbey to come on.

230
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,804
Why, you said it twice.
Is that an actual phrase?

231
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,972
I'm telling you, Ted,

232
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,183
y'all better have a baby
or your marriage is over, Trust.

233
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:40,029
Uh, hey.

234
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,114
Go away, Teddy.

235
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,366
Tami, listen, I just
wanna talk to you, Okay?

236
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,993
Will you just listen
to me for one second?

237
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,828
Why? So you can give me shit
about my clothes?

238
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,914
No! Look, I'm sorry about that,
okay? I'm sorry.

239
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,833
I was an asshole
and I didn't mean it.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,335
You know, whatever, Teddy.

241
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,087
Tami, listen.
I love you.

242
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,006
Okay? And...
And I don't want us

243
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,216
to fight like we've been doing
the past few months.

244
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,094
I don't know, Teddy.
Something's got to change, you know?

245
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,723
Because I can't do this no more.
It's too much.

246
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,517
I know, I know, I know.
And... And that's why...

247
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,771
I wanna have a baby.

248
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,398
You do?

249
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,691
Yeah.

250
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,110
A baby? Like really?

251
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,236
Yeah.

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,572
See, I think,
if we got a kid to love,

253
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,866
it'll teach us how to
love each other again.

254
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,951
Oh, my God, Teddy.

255
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,995
You better not be
messing with me.

256
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,538
I swear to God,
not messing with you.

257
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,207
I think you'd make
an awesome mom.

258
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,792
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

259
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,919
I would, like,
kick so much ass at mommin'!

260
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,337
So what do you say?
We all good?

261
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,922
Yes! Oh, I love you!

262
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,131
I love you so much!

263
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,133
Oh, baby, I love you, too!

264
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,636
- Let's make a baby!
- Let's make a baby!

265
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,147
- Okay, you ready?
- Oh, shit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,774
- Here it comes,
- Okay, okay, I'm ready.

267
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,152
Let's all go to court

268
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,907
Let's go make some law now

269
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,992
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

270
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,203
Some law now

271
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,329
I say we go to court!

272
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,580
Yes, let's go to court!

273
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,332
We're a bunch of
assholes who take up

274
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,459
a whole hallway
with our conversation.

275
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,088
Hey, you lawyer guys

276
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:25,175
You don't know me and
Johnny are watching you

277
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,511
While we're high

278
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,139
That was fucking magic.

279
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,391
That felt smooth.
That felt really smooth, Oh!

280
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,684
So in the pocket.

281
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,186
Hey, so, uh, listen,
l got, uh...

282
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,938
I got some big news
to tell ya.

283
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,356
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

284
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,860
Tami-Lynn and I are
gonna have a baby!

285
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,530
Holy shit! You?

286
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,198
Yeah, yeah,
we talked about it today.

287
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,908
Dude, that's fucking awesome!
Congratulations!

288
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:50,993
Thank you!

289
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,911
Wait, wait, wait, How... How...
How do you guys...

290
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,707
yeah, that's the thing, We... We, uh...
We got to find a sperm donor.

291
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,877
And, um, I'm wondering,
what do you think

292
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,795
Sam Jones would say
if I asked him?

293
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,256
You want Flash Gordon
to father your child?

294
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,632
Yeah, I mean,
do you think...

295
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,384
Would that be weird?
Would he be freaked out if I...

296
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,635
No, I think
he'd be flattered!

297
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,430
And plus, your baby
will be a fucking superhero!

298
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,515
Well, that was the logic
I arrived at as well.

299
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,808
Yeah, I say do it!

300
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,560
All right, I'll shoot
him an e-mail right now,

301
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,020
and see if I can
stop by tonight.

302
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,396
- You come with me?
- Sure.

303
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,689
All right, great.

304
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:23,984
Shit.

305
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,987
I can never get a signal in your apartment, Hey,
can I use your laptop?

306
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,989
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

307
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,828
What the fuck?

308
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,289
Holy shit! Dude, what's the matter?
What happened?

309
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,415
What's going on?

310
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,417
There's so much porn!

311
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,377
Well, what the hell are you doing looking
at my private shit?

312
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,297
What are you talking about, private shit?
Johnny, it was wide open!

313
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,174
There are literally
thousands of files here!

314
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,051
Well, I've been meaning
to clear some of that out.

315
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,303
Jesus Christ, Look at
the organization here!

316
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,097
Clockwise rim job.
Counterclockwise rim job!

317
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah, well, sometimes you like seeing
the tongue go the other way!

318
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,603
You sick bastard! Look at this!
Chicks with dicks?

319
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,482
Oh, my God!
I have a disease, all right? I need help!

320
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,068
There are no chicks with dicks, Johnny!
Only guys with tits!

321
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,486
Oh, this is such a relief!

322
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm so glad I'm finally caught.
I wanted to be caught!

323
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,533
Johnny, now you listen to me.
This is a wake-up call, all right?

324
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,701
You got to get back out there
and meet somebody

325
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,620
because you are spiraling
out of control here.

326
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,206
All right, fine, I will, Just stop looking
at that shit, please!

327
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,541
Johnny, I mean it, All right?

328
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,501
The next chick you meet,
you are getting back in the game.

329
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,835
Fine, I got it, Done.

330
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,671
All right, Now, let's get rid
of this.

331
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,673
What do you mean?
We'll just delete the files!

332
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,341
No, no, no, That shit can
always be recovered.

333
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,426
We got to smash your
laptop with a hammer.

334
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,059
All right, there, you happy?

335
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,645
No, the circuits could still be reconstructed
if somebody worked at it.

336
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,980
We got to bury it
in the harbor.

337
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:01,456
So, uh, basically that's it.
We need a sperm donor.

338
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,958
So what do
ya say?

339
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,710
You'd really be
helping me and Tami out.

340
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,461
No can do, my brother.

341
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,171
Well...
Well, why not?

342
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,674
Oh, look, I did a lot
of blow in the '80s

343
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,177
and my sperm count's
a little low.

344
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,721
Oh, How low?

345
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,347
One.

346
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,432
One?

347
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,352
Yeah, little fella's having his own
I Am Legend in my nut sack.

348
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,021
Oh, Can we have that one?

349
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,608
No! Gonna need it for protein
if I ever get lost at sea.

350
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,860
Come on, guys, I mean,
are we done here? I got to go.

351
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,322
That Sister, Sister marathon
ain't gonna watch itself.

352
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,450
Can't believe it.
That son of a bitch!

353
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,826
That was really
selfish of him.

354
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,286
I know, And after
I watched his

355
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,121
piece-of-shit movie,
like, a hundred times.

356
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,748
God damn it!

357
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,000
Ah!
Oh, shit!

358
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,883
Johnny, please, just help me
do this, Okay?

359
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,551
He's the only guy in the world
whose sperm

360
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,886
is even close to
Flash Gordon's.

361
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,138
Ted, it's insane, We could get in
a lot of trouble.

362
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,681
But not if nobody
finds out.

363
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,807
Look, look, John, John.

364
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,226
We sneak into his house,
jerk him off in his sleep

365
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,936
and sneak out with the sperm.
It'll be easy!

366
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,189
And think how awesome
the baby will be.

367
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,775
Would be
a sweet-ass fucking baby.

368
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,612
All right, I'll help you.
But we got to have a game plan.

369
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,292
Just calm down.

370
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,462
Yeah, can I help you?

371
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,675
Hey! Um, are you,
uh, Tom Brady?

372
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,093
Yeah.

373
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,344
Um, hey. Um...

374
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,553
Your neighbors called,

375
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,138
and your air conditioner's
making a loud noise

376
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,848
so I'm supposed to
check out the unit.

377
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,350
Uh, okay.
Yeah, it's around back.

378
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,811
Okay, Um, I just may need
a signature in case

379
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,479
I got to get some parts,
for the billing.

380
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,608
You could just, uh, write that to
John and Ted, Put number 12.

381
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,028
And you're not a cheater.
I mean, I think your balls are perfect.

382
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,947
It's around back.
All right, Yeah.

383
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,139
Stupid idiot.

384
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,188
Okay, Go, go, go!

385
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,582
Take the damn raincoat off.
It's making too much noise.

386
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,834
Piss off! I don't wanna get
any jizz on me!

387
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,056
Two League MVPs,
four Super Bowl rings,

388
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,893
guaranteed first
ballot Hall of Famer.

389
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,729
Now let's give him a handjob
into this red Solo cup.

390
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,314
All right, Go ahead.

391
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,274
Wait, what do you mean,
Go ahead? You got to do it.

392
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,110
What are you talking about?
You're the one who needs the sperm.

393
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,570
Yeah, but it's got
to be a human hand.

394
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,447
It's got to be skin on skin,
otherwise it doesn't work.

395
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,907
No, it doesn't.
It's just friction.

396
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,784
- Look, I've never done this before.
- Neither have I.

397
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,702
- You do it to yourself.
- Yeah, but that's different.

398
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,413
You're an adult with a poster of this guy
in your fucking room.

399
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,623
You're telling me
you don't want this?

400
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,793
Yeah, I want it! You know I want it,
but I'm nervous.

401
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,003
What if he doesn't like the way I'm doing it?
He deserves the best!

402
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,213
Pull yourself together,
for God's sakes.

403
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,547
He's gonna love it.
Go, go, go!

404
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,883
All right.

405
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,597
Sweet God and baby Jesus.

406
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,725
And that's at rest.

407
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,727
What the hell?

408
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,229
Mr. Brady, we just need
a moment of your time.

409
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,730
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

410
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,815
Get out of my house!

411
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,818
Oh, God! Ahhh!

412
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,570
Wait, Mr. Brady!

413
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,489
Take your goddamn
teddy bear with you!

414
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,493
Holy shit!
Perfect spiral!

415
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,036
Come on,
let's get out of here!

416
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,088
Shit!

417
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,589
What the hell do we do now?

418
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,051
Hey, Ted, let me
ask you something.

419
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,427
What's that?

420
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,304
Why didn't you
just come to me?

421
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,056
What are you talking about?

422
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,474
For the sperm.

423
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:34,563
Oh. Johnny, you kidding me, man?
You were the first person I wanted to go to.

424
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,690
But you've just
been so bummed out

425
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,899
over your divorce lately

426
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,528
that I just... You know, I didn't want to put you
in an awkward position.

427
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,196
And plus,
after seeing your laptop,

428
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,781
I didn't think
you had any left.

429
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,617
Just so you know,
I'm totally willing to do it.

430
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,496
Really? You'd...
You'd do that for me?

431
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,040
Ted, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.

432
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,295
Besides, we just broke into Tom Brady's house
and tried to jerk him off...

433
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,005
You're ready to be a parent.

434
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,215
God...

435
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,092
I don't know what to say.

436
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,429
Johnny, thank you!
Thank you so much!

437
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,390
Hey, thunder buddies
for life, remember?

438
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,601
Thunder buddies for life.

439
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,478
Come on, We got to get out of here
before the cops show up.

440
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,608
All units, we have a 3-17
on Maple Drive, Area units, please respond.

441
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,276
What's a 3-17?

442
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:24,321
Someone's trying to steal
Tom Brady's jizz again.

443
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,002
- What is that?
- What?

444
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,670
What are you doing?
I'm getting ready, dude.

445
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,755
What do you mean
you're getting ready?

446
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,089
What are you doing
to your hand?

447
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,759
I'm doing this for you, I'm getting ready.
I got to go in and perform.

448
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,427
You got your hand on your dick.
What are you doing?

449
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,762
I'm trying
to get it half hard,

450
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,347
so when I get in there
I could just bust it out.

451
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,223
Sitting out here in public,
jerking off?

452
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,059
Where do you think you are? Red Lobster?
What are you doing?

453
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,435
What do you think
I got to do in there?

454
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,895
Forget it.
Now, look, you haven't

455
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,730
smoked pot for two
whole days, right?

456
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,399
Yes, I told you, I'm clean, all right?
Your baby's gonna be fine.

457
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm sorry, l just don't
want something

458
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,862
I got to feed with
a pitchfork when he's 16.

459
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,364
"John Bennett.

460
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,448
Hi.

461
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,201
Right this way, I'll show you where to
deposit your specimen.

462
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,536
Hey, Johnny, Johnny.

463
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,965
I'm John Bennett.

464
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,133
I know,
I just said your name.

465
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,803
Oh, right, yeah, sorry,
I'm just a little nervous.

466
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,013
I've been out of
the game for a while.

467
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,264
The game?

468
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:37,435
I don't talk to pretty girls that often.
Pretty women, ladies.

469
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,187
I see.

470
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,731
Hey, when I'm done here,
how about a drink?

471
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,403
Oh, I don't
mean this, I meant, like, a regular drink.

472
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,071
I have a boyfriend.

473
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,325
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, too bad,
You're missing out on a great guy.

474
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,495
Um, do I just spit in
my hand or do I get

475
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,706
a lube or something?
A magazine?

476
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,624
Video? I like Asian
teen stuff preferably.

477
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:00,667
There's lube
right there.

478
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,502
All right,
yeah, thanks.

479
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,677
Uh, excuse me. Where's your
non-jerk-off bathroom?

480
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,137
Down that hallway,
to the left.

481
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,638
Okay, thanks.

482
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,521
Oh, No way!

483
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,192
Oh, hey, Doc, is this where you guys
store all the, uh, stuff?

484
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,030
It's the intermediary station
before insemination.

485
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,239
Are you submitting?

486
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,534
No, My friend is, uh, yanking out a sample
in one of the rooms.

487
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,411
Oh, well, that's a good friend.
Yeah.

488
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,537
I'm Dr. Danzer.

489
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,705
Oh, cool,

490
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,500
Hold me closer, Dr. Danzer

491
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,668
Yeah, whatever,
I don't know.

492
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:47,547
Now, wait, You look familiar,
Are you that teddy bear who came alive?

493
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,049
I am, that's me, yeah.

494
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,175
See, I was trying
to figure out

495
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,551
where I'd seen you
before and that's it.

496
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,719
Good eye, good eye.

497
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:56,222
So, how did you get into this line of work?
Do you just love oum?

498
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:57,724
Uh, uh...

499
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,934
Not especially, but I love
helping good people

500
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,811
fulfill their dreams
of having children.

501
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,022
It's amazing
what we can do here.

502
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,149
You want to have a look?

503
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,776
Yeah, sure.

504
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:13,323
This is where we perform
our pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

505
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,366
We can eliminate
hereditary diseases,

506
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,620
such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy,
sickle-cell anemia.

507
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,413
The list goes on
and on, really.

508
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,539
Wow.

509
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,750
Hey, Johnny!
You did it!

510
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,834
Right here, buddy.

511
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,669
Ew, I mean, awesome!

512
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,047
Excuse me, Doctor,
your wife's on the phone.

513
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,423
She said it's an emergency.

514
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,550
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

515
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,513
You wanna see it? Huh?
You wanna see your kid?

516
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,972
I can see it from here,
thanks, yeah.

517
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,432
Dude, take a closer look.
It's your kid.

518
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,517
No, no, no!
Come on!

519
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,435
You got to take a closer look.
That's close enough, Johnny!

520
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,354
He's beautiful, Come on!
I'll trade you, Catch.

521
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,147
Oh, shit!
Oh, God!

522
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,982
Fuck! Dude,
that's somebody's kid!

523
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,443
Well, it's not my fault, A-Rod! You were
supposed to catch it!

524
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,569
We got to find something
to scoop it up.

525
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,238
There's containers over there.
Scoop it up with that.

526
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,656
Shit, All right.

527
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,116
No, no,
that's not gonna work.

528
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,867
You need two of them, you got to scoop
one into the other.

529
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,953
Oh, shit! Fuck!

530
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,497
Oh! Oh, fuck!

531
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,581
Oh, my God!

532
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,666
Fuck! Fuck!

533
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,918
Oh, my God!
It's in my eyes!

534
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,044
I'm blinking it in!

535
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,379
You got to fucking help me!

536
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,089
Oh, my God!
It's in my fucking mouth!

537
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,841
Hang on. I got to
post this on Facebook.

538
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,092
No!

539
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,886
Hashtag
"Grr, Mondays.

540
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,930
Oh, my God!

541
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,974
Look, I'm so sorry! We swear to God,
it was an accident.

542
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,183
We're so sorry.

543
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:26,020
Well, I guess it's all right.
Those are the rejected sickle-cell samples.

544
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,564
Ah, you hear that,
Johnny?

545
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,607
You're covered in
rejected black-guy sperm.

546
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,984
You look like a Kardashian.

547
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,402
Fuck!

548
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,875
No, make sure you
have all the updated

549
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,626
information on our
Comic Con placement.

550
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,005
This has to be the biggest,
most impressive rollout at the convention.

551
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,214
Morning, Mr. Jessup.

552
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,425
Good morning,
Now...

553
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,010
My name's Donny.

554
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,387
Hi, Donny.

555
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,181
Now this is
a multi-platform release,

556
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,473
so I want a full
report on all...

557
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,766
Fresh cakes.

558
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,853
What?

559
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,354
In the urinals, sir.

560
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,940
I noticed you always
use urinal four,

561
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,775
so I put fresh cakes
in there for you.

562
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,904
You're an important man.
You should never have to smell pee.

563
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,449
See, most people
flip the cakes.

564
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,701
I replace the cakes.

565
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,746
That's the Donny difference.

566
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,751
I need a full report on all the placement
of our merchandise.

567
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,045
Contact Bob Jennings
at Javas

568
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,632
I'm afraid I have bad news.

569
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,760
I won't be able to perform
the implantation procedure.

570
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,637
- Wait, what?
- Why not?

571
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:44,807
Tami-Lynn, according to your test results,
you're no longer fertile.

572
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:45,975
What?

573
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,977
Wait, Doc,
are you sure about that?

574
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,230
I mean, maybe you should check again
or something, you know?

575
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,648
I'm quite sure.

576
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,859
Tami-Lynn, because of your history
of excessive drug use

577
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,905
your ovarian canal
has been somewhat compromised.

578
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,949
What are you talking about?
It looks fine, Yeah.

579
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,285
Forgive me,
that's a normal ovary.

580
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,912
This is Tami-Lynn's.

581
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,247
Jesus!

582
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,624
Yeah, but I bet this
stuff happens a lot.

583
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,834
You probably see this kind of stuff
all the time, right?

584
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,379
No, not once, not ever.

585
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,757
When I saw this, I threw up.
Almost quit medicine.

586
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,760
Bottom line is,
insemination is not possible.

587
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,430
I don't understand,
okay? None of this makes any sense.

588
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,474
It's okay, It's okay, honey.
Come on, let's just go.

589
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,976
No, what does
this mean, Teddy?

590
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,269
Does it mean we
can't have a baby?

591
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,853
I don't know.
But it's gonna be okay.

592
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,438
Everything's gonna be okay.

593
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:33,856
It really isn't.

594
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,579
Well, I have gone
through your application

595
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,873
and vetted your
personal histories,

596
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,960
and I'm afraid this
isn't gonna work out.

597
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,129
What?

598
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,380
Why not?

599
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,007
Well, first of all,
there's the question

600
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,758
of Tami-Lynn's
drug conviction.

601
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,677
Hey, I did
my community service.

602
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,388
Yeah, besides, that was five years ago.
She's clean.

603
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,432
There's another issue,

604
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,560
and, honesty, it's the more
serious one.

605
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,895
I was reluctant to
bring it up because

606
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,690
it's a little awkward.

607
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,528
Ted, in the eyes of the state,
you are not a person.

608
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,323
Wait, what?

609
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,617
The state official
I spoke to said

610
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,829
that technically, you are
classified as property.

611
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,417
I'm not a person?

612
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,670
Not according to
the government, I'm sorry.

613
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,464
But that is so fucked up!

614
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,000
Property?

615
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,593
You know what, Teddy?
Let's get out of here.

616
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:44,844
Come on.

617
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,597
Look.

618
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,557
You seem like good people.

619
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:50,975
Be careful.

620
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,144
What do you mean,
"Be careful?

621
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,188
The state official I spoke to

622
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,900
made it sound like your status had gone under
the radar for some time.

623
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:02,111
Your adoption request
may have raised some red flags.

624
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,448
If they choose to
investigate the issue,

625
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,159
it may leave you
quite vulnerable.

626
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,758
Hey, I just got off work
and heard your message.

627
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,468
Is that for real? Did they actually
tell you that?

628
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,261
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"Property.

629
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,055
They said I'm property.

630
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,224
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

631
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,142
What, like garbage
or a piece of shit?

632
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,063
I mean, maybe more like a hammer
or an orange, but yeah.

633
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,356
What the hell
do they know?

634
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,482
It's just a word.

635
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,943
They can't change your whole life just by
calling you property!

636
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,946
Bullshit!
You better ask my ancestors.

637
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,490
One minute, you in Africa,
washing your clothes

638
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,492
in the river,
titties out, you good.

639
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,369
Then all of a sudden,
you somewhere

640
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,371
across the world,
fucking Thomas Jefferson.

641
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,832
Wow! You make
history come alive.

642
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,917
Why the hell is this
just coming up now?

643
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,169
I mean, I've never voted.

644
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,922
I don't have a driver's license,
I don't pay taxes.

645
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,049
I mean, hell, this is
the first job I ever had.

646
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,011
Ted, can I see you
for a moment?

647
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,681
I'm sorry,

648
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,307
but I'm gonna have to let
you go.

649
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,186
What? Why? I've been
busting my ass at this job for three years!

650
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,689
I just got a call from
the Labor Department.

651
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,650
I can't legally keep
you on as an employee

652
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,944
because I've been informed
that you're technically...

653
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:28,239
Technically not a person.
Yeah, Jesus Christ!

654
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,577
I'm sorry, But as of today,
you're fired.

655
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,040
"Dear Ted,
your Chase bank account

656
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,251
"has been terminated due to
a lack of citizenship.

657
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:43,212
"Dear Ted, your Discover card
has been revoked.

658
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,215
"Dear Ted, you are no longer
a Papa Gino's rewards member.

659
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,717
Fuck, that's a big one.

660
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,844
This poor baby bootie.

661
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:54,390
It's always gonna be empty.
There's never gonna be a little foot in here.

662
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,810
I don't understand, We would have made
such great parents.

663
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,188
Oh, my God.

664
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,981
Oh, my God, Teddy!

665
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,024
What? What's wrong?

666
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,400
Look at this.

667
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,776
"Dear Ted,

668
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,738
"the state of Massachusetts
regrets to inform you

669

"that due to an oversight
regarding your legal status

670
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:16,954

is unrecognized by the state

671
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,957
"and, therefore, invalid
and hereby annulled.

672
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,126
Teddy, can they do this to us?

673
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,252
Let me see that.

674
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,758
This is a nightmare.

675
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,262
You fucking
believe that?

676
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,431
No, This is insane.

677
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,391
I mean, Tami's
the woman I love.

678
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,727
You know, I never would even have
tried to adopt a dog

679
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,021
if I had known it was gonna cause me
this kind of shit storm.

680
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,856
This whole thing is
complete bullshit.

681
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,983
I mean, if you ask me,
we got to fight it.

682
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,486
What do you mean?
I mean, we get a lawyer.

683
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,363
Oh, my God,
Can we do that?

684
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,822
Hell yeah!
You know what we do?

685
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,115
We'll get a lawyer
and we'll sue

686
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,784
the fucking government
for your civil rights!

687
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,744
Johnny, that's a great idea!

688
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,038
Hey, hey! Maybe we get one of them
Harrison Ford lawyers

689
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,541
who gets shot in the head, then
turns all retarded and nice and goes,

690
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,708
"What we're doing is wrong.

691
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,919
Yes, You know what, we get out there
and we stick it to them good.

692
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,046
We take that shit all the way up
to Judge Judy if we have to.

693
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,172
Yeah.

694
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,800
But we don't know any lawyers, All our
friends make sandwiches.

695
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,302
Ah, Oh, we just Google
"Boston lawyers.

696
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,931
Jesus, Look at
that black cock.

697
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,160
Uh...

698
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,789
This is a very complicated case
you have here.

699
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:46,419
Most civil rights cases are, but
this one has some very obvious wrinkles.

700
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,713
Well, everybody says
you're the best in town.

701
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,508
Listen, your case is
not gonna be cheap.

702
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,677
What is your
financial situation?

703
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,930
Uh, all of our holdings are tied up
in the railroads.

704
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,433
Yeah, Reading Railroad, 5&0 Railroad,
Pennsylvania Railroad.

705
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,644
We're working on Short Line, Urn, I own Atlantic
Avenue and Marvin Gardens.

706
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,229
And I own four houses
on Baltic Ave.

707
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,315
I was thinking about just tearing them down
and building a hotel.

708
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:10,109
I won second prize in a beauty contest.
That's $50 right there.

709
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,111
Are you guys just
saying Monopoly stuff?

710
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:13,779
Tell you what, I'm gonna go
drive around the blook,

711
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:15,239
and I'll be back
with $200.

712
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,366
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

713
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,619
My niece recently
passed her bar exam

714
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,830
and I've hired her on as a junior associate
here at the firm.

715
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,291
I could assign her to
your case, pro bono.

716
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,209
And then you would get
a hungry, young attorney

717
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,546
and I would get a more
experienced lawyer in return.

718
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,089
So what do you say to that?

719
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,383
Yeah, sure,
sounds great.

720
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,178
Um, are those hard candies,
like, just to take?

721
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,972
Uh, those aren't
supposed to be out.

722
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:51,734
Hello?

723
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,986
Oh! Fuck!

724
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:55,738
Hi.

725
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,822
You Okay?

726
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,491
Yeah! I'm fine.

727
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,825
You must be Ted.

728
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,827
Yeah, Uh, I'm Ted,

729
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,329
- this is my buddy, John.
- Hi.

730
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:06,916
Um, my uncle says that you guys
are my first clients.

731
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,211
Uh, it's been discussed,

732
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,380
but do you mind if
I ask how old you are?

733
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,048
I'm 26.

734
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,257
Ah.

735
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:16,967
What, is there a problem?

736
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:19,011
Well, you know, I just don't want
my lawyer singing

737
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,846
Frozen songs during
the opening arguments.

738
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,682
It's just this is
a really important case.

739
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:25,142
Ted has already lost his job, his marriage
has been annulled.

740
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,478
I know, My uncle
gave me all the details.

741
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:29,772
Right, You see, the thing is, we don't
want to take any chances

742
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,816
because the stakes
are so significant.

743
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,109
We can't just
rush into anything.

744
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,610
We got to make sure we're making
the right decision.

745
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,028
We really
appreciate your time,

746
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,321
but I think what
we're probably gonna do is

747
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,948
just take a seat
and get to work.

748
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,032
Trust you completely.

749
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,492
Yeah, we really feel like
you got a lot to offer.

750
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:44,912
Sorry.

751
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,122
You don't mind the pot,
do you?

752
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,331
I get migraines.

753
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:48,874
Oh, absolutely, me, too.
That's fine.

754
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,585
I'm gonna get a huge migraine
in the parking lot in about 20 minutes.

755
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:53,504
Oh, I'm Samantha Jackson.

756
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,172
Ted, How are ya?

757
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,049
Good to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.

758
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,676
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your middle name?

759
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,261
Leslie.

760
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,556
Oh, my God! So
you're Sam L. Jackson!

761
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,516
That's fucking great!
Just like Sam L. Jackson!

762
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,684
Who is that?

763
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,812
You ever seen any movie ever?
He's the black guy.

764
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,108
That weed is really good.

765
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,568
It reminds me of
the strain I smoked

766
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,236
last summer called
"Here Comes Autism.

767
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,905
Yeah, I was just gonna say it's sort of like
this other batch we had called

768
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,615
"How Long Has
That Van Been There?

769
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:25,202
No, it's this new strain my dealer gave me called
Help Me Get Home.

770
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,455
You know, I'm surprised a lawyer
like you gets high.

771
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:28,914
I mean, aren't you
supposed to be fighting

772
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,458
the War on Drugs
and all that shit?

773
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,668
Please, the War on Drugs
is a joke.

774
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,086
It's just a way
for the government

775
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,588
to inflate law
enforcement budgets

776
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,299
and lock up minorities
for no good legal reason.

777
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,968
And you, my friend,
are an oppressed minority.

778
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,720
Yeah, No shit.

779
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,014
They've denied you the same rights
as everybody else

780
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,390
just because
you're different,

781
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,101
and I say that's a violation
of the Constitution.

782
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,687
So what do you say?
Can you get me my life back?

783
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,817
I'm gonna try.

784
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,611
Hey, guys?

785
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm having some trouble over here.

786
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,072
What's the matter?

787
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,909
Can you help me get home?

788
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,953
I'm having a really
hard time here, guys.

789
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,663
Johnny, it's okay,
buddy, It's okay.

790
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:10,915
You're doing fine.
You're doing great.

791
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,957
No, I'm scared, All right.

792
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,918
I know, Come on,
it's okay, though.

793
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,544
You just have to
hang onto the wall.

794
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,380
Don't let the goose get me!

795
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,216
How far away
does he live?

796
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:21,884
Uh, about a mile-and-a-half.

797
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,135
Fuck, okay.

798
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,096
Hey, it's okay, One foot in front
of the other.

799
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:39,109
All right, I got Dred Scott Vs Sandford,
Plessy Vs Ferguson

800
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,986
and Brown Vs
the Board of Education.

801
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,407
I got Kramer Vs. Kramer, Alien Vs. Predator,
and Freddy Vs. Jason.

802
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:48,786
I got, uh, Ernest Goes to Camp,
Ernest Goes to Jail

803
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,122
and The Importance of Being Earnest,
which was very disappointing.

804
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,521
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
a few test questions, Are you ready?

805
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,689
Yep, bring it on.

806
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,399
You're on the stand,
the DA says,

807
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,651
"Ted, do you consider yourself
to be human?

808
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,861
- Objection!
- Sustained!

809
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:22,945
No, the witness can't object.

810
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,029
- Overruled!
- Sidebar?

811
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,072
- Guilty!
- Speculation!

812
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,657
- Hearsay! Briefcase!
- Bailiff! Disregard!

813
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,242
- In my chambers!
- Stop beavering the witness!

814
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,660
- I rest,
- We could totally be lawyers.

815
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:30,744
Bang.

816
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,457
Oh, my God! I'm gonna
fall off the building.

817
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,215
Your name is Toby!

818
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,217
You're going to learn
to say your name.

819
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,927
Let me hear you say it.

820
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,054
What's your name?

821
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,891
Kunta, Kunta Kinte.

822
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,561
That's just like me, That's exactly what
I'm going through.

823
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,063
Well, it's
a little different.

824
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:25,109
You know, Ted, if you legally become a person,
you're gonna need a last name.

825
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,570
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Okay, okay, I got one.

826
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,738
Okay, what is it?

827
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,573
Clubber Lang.

828
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,325
Who is Clubber Lang?

829
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,535
Who's Clubber Lang?

830
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,620
Mr. T's character
in Rocky Ill, Hello?

831
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,664
Is that the boxing movies?

832
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:39,873
The boxing...

833
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:41,667
- You've never seen Rocky?
- She's not serious.

834
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,876
You've never seen Rocky?

835
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,961
You know...

836
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:48,924
You know, Rocky!

837
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:50,676
I'm not gonna remember
a movie I've never seen

838
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,469
just because you're singing a song
I don't know.

839
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,139
You don't know Samuel L. Jackson,
you don't know Rocky.

840
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,016
You are literally
pop culture illiterate.

841
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,517
I have a college degree.

842
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,020
My pop culture references are Hamlet,
Achilles and Dorian Gray.

843
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,187
Ever heard of any of them?

844
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,732
No, but I'm pretty sure
Mr. T could kick their ass!

845
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,775
Yeah, Sam, you really
need to be educated.

846
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:11,280
Oh, really? Um, can either of you
tell me who wrote The Great Gatsby?

847
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,906
- Judy Blume?
- Hitler?

848
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,199
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

849
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:15,325
Who's that?

850
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,618
The author.

851
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,203
Why are you saying,
"Fuck him?

852
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,246
What?

853
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,706
You just said "F"
Scott Fitzgerald."

854
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,499
- What did Scott Fitzgerald do to you?
- Yeah.

855
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,293
No, that's his first name.

856
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,253
His name's Fuck
Scott Fitzgerald?

857
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,463
What? No.

858
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:28,881
Well, then, what's the "F"
stand for?

859
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:29,965
Francis.

860
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,592
- No, It's got to be "Fuck.
- It must be "Fuck.

861
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,010
- It's got to be "Fuck.
- It has to be "Fuck.

862
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,261
Why the hell
would it be "Fuck?

863
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,013
Well, because otherwise,
why wouldn't he just say it?

864
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,473
Yeah, he's hiding
something, It's "Fuck.

865
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,391
- Come on, read between the lines, Sam
- It's Fuck.

866
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,643
That's completely
insane, you guys are idiots.

867
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,813
Yeah, well, whatever.
Ted Clubber Lang, Get used to it.

868
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,612
Yes!

869
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:54,490
Sir?

870
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,701
Um, one of the janitors
would like to see you.

871
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,161
I'm busy.

872
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,288
Fresh cakes!

873
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,165
What is it, Danny?

874
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,583
Uh, Donny, sir.

875
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,087
Well, Donny, I'm extremely
busy with the Comic Con presentation...

876
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,547
I'm told that you have an open-door policy
here at Hasbro

877
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,175
for new toy ideas
from any and all employees?

878
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:15,969
Yeah, I suppose
that's true.

879
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,514
All right, come in.

880
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,140
Okay.

881
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,851
Thank you, Thank you.
I love your dress.

882
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,192
Mr. Jessup,

883
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,820
I can make this company
a billion dollars.

884
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,363
I'm listening.

885
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:36,532
Thirty years ago,

886
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,992
a little boy named
John Bennett made a wish

887
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:41,328
that his teddy bear
would come to life.

888
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,747
Somehow, one of
our Hasbro bears...

889
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,541
Yes, I'm aware
of the story.

890
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:49,086
Have you seen this?

891
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:55,342
So what?

892
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,595
Well, Ted is suing
for his civil rights.

893
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:01,640
If he loses, the state
will officially declare him

894
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:04,351
a non-entity with
no rights under the law.

895
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:07,020
That means
he becomes property.

896
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,647
Mr. Jessup,

897
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,902
we could take him back,
with only a trivial degree of legal consequence

898
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,529
if we were even caught.

899
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,322
And why would
we do this?

900
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:22,411
Sir, if we could cut him open to see
what makes him tick,

901
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:26,707
we could manufacture millions of Teds for
every child in the world.

902
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:29,418
Hasbro would double
its profits overnight.

903
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:31,545
Go on.

904
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,423
We just have to make sure
Ted loses the case.

905
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:37,676
You use every back channel,
every bribe,

906
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,052
you call in every favor

907
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:43,432
and you get the best lawyer in the world
on the defense.

908
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,977
When Ted's rights
are officially null,

909
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:49,897
we grab him.

910
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:54,401
No one's going to kick up a legal fuss
over property.

911
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,322
You're a hell of a lot smarter than
your urinal cakes, Danny.

912
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,948
Really?

913
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,451
Now, what exactly
do you want from this?

914
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,913
Mr. Jessup, I'm not interested
in money.

915
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:10,667
I just want a Ted
for my very own.

916
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,963
All right, I think I can
handle the defense.

917
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,549
But let's make
one thing clear.

918
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,301
We never had
this conversation.

919
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,971
Goldner and the board
cannot know about this until we have him.

920
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,890
Do you understand?

921
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,308
Yes, I do.

922
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,855
I need Shep Wild.

923
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,277
That was such
a good dinner, Tami-Lynn.

924
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,238
I've never had Pringles on
my steak before.

925
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:40,489
Oh, it's my pleasure.

926
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,951
It's the least I can do
with all you're doing for us, Really.

927
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,286
Oh, I haven't done
anything yet.

928
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,080
Well, you know, we wanted to take
you out to dinner,

929
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:52,167
but, uh, all we got is Tami's income
these days since nobody will hire me.

930
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:53,710
Things are getting
really tight, huh?

931
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,213
Yeah, I've had to do
some things I'm not proud of.

932
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:59,883
BJs here! Get your BJs!
Get your red-hot BJs!

933
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,761
Toothless and ready to go.
Just 3 dollar! 3 dollar!

934
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,179
Get your BJs here.

935
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:05,722
Wow.

936
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,057
Hey, listen,
l got an idea.

937
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,685
Uh, Tami, what do
you say you and me go do the dishes

938
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,312
and give Sam and Diane here
some alone time, eh'?

939
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:14,856
All right, all right.

940
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,567
Hey, you go pull
a bad back, bitch!

941
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,612
What do you think
that was about?

942
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,948
Oh, it's nothing, That's his way of saying
I should ask you out.

943
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,074
Ah.

944
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,242
Uh, yeah, look...

945
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,953
We should probably focus our attention
on the case for now.

946
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,663
I completely agree.

947
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:34,793
You know, l am a little bit curious, How is it that a guy
like you is unattached?

948
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:40,382
Well, I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

949
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,718
Shits, I'm sorry,
That sucks.

950
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:46,346
No, I mean, we'd make it work
day to day,

951
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,432
but she was always
just trying to change me

952
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,725
into someone I'm not.

953
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,601
And I tried, you know?

954
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,897
I really tried everything
I could to be the man that she wanted.

955
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:59,985
One day I woke up and I just realized
I wasn't myself anymore.

956
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:04,906
You know, as much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

957
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,826
At least you
figured it out early.

958
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:09,661
Some people go through
their whole lives

959
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,580
trying to make it work
with the wrong person.

960
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,415
Yeah.

961
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,126
So, we're gonna
win this thing?

962
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:18,462
Honestly, I don't know.

963
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,339
Oh, we're betting on you.

964
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,550
Hey, Johnny, come on, It's almost 7:00.
We got to get up there.

965
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,926
Hey, Sam,
you want in on this?

966
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,053
What is it?

967
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:29,139
On Tuesday nights, we get fucked up
and throw apples at joggers.

968
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,353
Oh, there's one!

969
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,397
- How's your workout?
- Fuck you!

970
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,358
Eat my pussy!
Have some apples!

971
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,942
Jesus, what the hell
is your problem?

972
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:43,653
It's everybody
else's fault, Mary Decker!

973
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:45,155
Barn!

974
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,407
You sons of bitches!
What the fuck is your...

975
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,788
That's the lottery!
That's the lottery!

976
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,499
That's what you get
for fucking exercising!

977
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,709
That is unbelievable!

978
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,245
Teddy.

979
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:35,747
Teddy, I'm scared.

980
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,082
Baby, we're gonna be fine.

981
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:40,377
I don't care what any fucking
piece of paper says, You're my wife.

982
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,504
I love you so much.

983
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:43,839
And I swear to God,
if we lose,

984
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,507
I'm gonna
fucking cut that judge.

985
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,217
Wait a minute.
You brought your switchblade?

986
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,301
Yeah.

987
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:50,762
But they patted us down on the way in here.
Where'd you even hide it?

988
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,264
Oh!

989
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:54,558
Hey, Sam.

990
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,935
Who's that buttnut
over there?

991
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,524
That is why we've been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild.

992
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,359
It's our bad luck
they put him on the trial.

993
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,820
He's never lost
a case in his life.

994
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:11,158
Mr. Wild, your opening statement,
if you please.

995
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,826
Thank you, Your Honor.

996
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,538
I would first like to thank
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

997
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,708
for taking time out
of their busy schedules

998
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,960
to be a part of
these proceedings.

999
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:27,632
Now, the case we'll be examining today
is really quite a simple one.

1000
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:30,260
Is Ted a human being?

1001
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,304
Or a piece of property?

1002
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:38,935
You know, it really is a very special,
very unique thing to be human.

1003
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:43,523
It's a gift from God bestowed upon
only one species.

1004
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:45,025
Us.

1005
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,445
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

1006
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:50,906
where does that lead us?

1007
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,575
Does your dog
deserve human rights?

1008
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,368
Your cat?

1009
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,870
Your toaster?

1010
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:03,293
Suddenly, being human
doesn't seem so special anymore, does it?

1011
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:07,172
I'm confident you'll make
the right decision.

1012
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:10,967
Thank you, Mr. Wild,
for your opening statement.

1013
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:12,552
Ms. Jackson?

1014
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:19,684
Hi.

1015
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,479
I am Samantha Jackson.

1016
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,148
I got to be honest
with you, I'm...

1017
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,859
I'm a little nervous.

1018
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:29,986
Why am I nervous? Um...

1019
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:34,616
Well, not because I'm a junior attorney
arguing her first case.

1020
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,868
And not because
some of you might laugh

1021
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:39,663
at the fact that
I'm representing a teddy bear.

1022
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:46,753
No, I'm... I'm nervous because
of one simple word.

1023
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,465
"Justice.

1024
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:56,054
I'm nervous that you're going
to be swayed

1025
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,224
by smooth talk
and a haircut,

1026
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:03,603
and forget about the most important
aspect of this case.

1027
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,147
Justice.

1028
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,276
A hundred
and fifty years ago

1029
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:11,736
a slave by the name
of Dred Scott

1030
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,407
sued to prove that he was a person and
not a piece of property.

1031
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:17,325
He lost.

1032
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:21,580
And as history has shown us,
that wasn't justice.

1033
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,543
In every
civil rights conflict,

1034
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,256
we are only able to recognize
the just point of view

1035
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,174
years after the fact.

1036
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:35,844
And when the next conflict
comes along,

1037
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:39,014
we're once again blind to it
as it's happening.

1038
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:43,435
"Well, this is different,"
we say, but it isn't.

1039
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:47,772
It is the same beast, just wearing
a different face,

1040
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,482
and it's happening
again today.

1041
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:54,237
So I urge you, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1042
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:57,532
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.

1043
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,370
Don't wait too long
to be right.

1044
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,123
Thank you.

1045
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,211
Erection.

1046
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,921
Sustained.

1047
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,552
Ms. Mc.Cafferty, you and Ted recently
considered adopting a child.

1048
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:18,678
Is that correct?

1049
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,096
Yeah.

1050
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,806
And if I may inquire,

1051
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,142
why did you not choose to have
a child of your own?

1052
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,353
Because Teddy
ain't got no dick.

1053
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,149
Uh-huh.

1054
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:35,945
And, uh, why does Ted not possess a, uh,
male appendage?

1055
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,781
Is it a freak of genetics?

1056
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:40,492
No, asshole, he ain't got a dick
because he's a fucking toy!

1057
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,618
What's your excuse?

1058
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:43,370
Whoa-ho! Take a burn!

1059
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:45,914
Yeah! How's your tongue
taste in your own ass, Poindexter?

1060
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,207
Yeah! How'd you...
What?

1061
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,042
Order!

1062
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,336
Mr. Bennett,

1063
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,090
how would you categorize
your relationship with Ted?

1064
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,258
He's my best friend.

1065
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:59,761
So you don't see him
as your property.

1066
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:02,722
No, he's not my property.
He's a person.

1067
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:04,808
He's way more of a person
than lots of other people.

1068
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:06,267
I mean,
fucking Steven Tyler?

1069
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:07,602
What the fuck is that?
Some kind of

1070
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,270
weird soccer-mom-looking
Goonie monster?

1071
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:10,855
- Your Honor?
- I'll allow it.

1072
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,649
Thank you,
Your Honor.

1073
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,776
Your witness.

1074
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,489
Mr. Bennett,

1075
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:22,617
when and where did
you first encounter Ted?

1076
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:25,453
Oh, what do you mean? My parents got him
for me when I was a kid.

1077
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,664
A-ha, they
got him.

1078
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,625
Where did they get him?

1079
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,713
Child World toy store.

1080
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,715
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.
Could you repeat that, please?

1081
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,425
Child World toy store.
You fucking heard me.

1082
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:39,884
There's no need for hostility,
Mr. Bennett.

1083
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:41,261
Why? Nobody here likes you!

1084
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,388
I saw you eating lunch alone!
You're a loser!

1085
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,556
- Your Honor?
- Mr. Bennett.

1086
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,015
I hope your kids
get bird flu!

1087
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:47,142
Mr. Bennett!

1088
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,226
I'm sorry.

1089
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:51,521
Now, you said your
parents purchased Ted,

1090
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:54,983
as one might purchase
a baseball glove or a Big Wheel.

1091
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,234
No, it's not like that!

1092
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,318
Objection!

1093
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:58,611
You can't do that!

1094
00:53:58,695 --> 00:53:59,904
You know what?
This is bullshit!

1095
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:01,740
This court is
trying to tell me

1096
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:03,199
that I'm not as good
as other people,

1097
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,493
and this is exactly what you've been
doing to the fags!

1098
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:06,578
Ted!

1099
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,620
Sorry, sorry.
The homos, the homos.

1100
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,247
This is exactly
what you've been doing

1101
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,832
to the homos,
and I say it's wrong!

1102
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,501
Ms. Jackson,
please control your client

1103
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,670
or I'll hold both of you
in contempt of court!

1104
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:16,838
Oh, piss off!

1105
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,591
I'm standing up for rne and I'm standing up
for the homos!

1106
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:20,759
We deserve respect!

1107
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:21,843
Ted, shut up!

1108
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,219
Fine.

1109
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:34,939
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Ted Clubber Lang to the stand.

1110
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:36,024
Yes!

1111
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:38,276
My turn, assholes!

1112
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,532
Ted,

1113
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:46,493
do you love your wife?

1114
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,704
Objection, She's not his wife.
The marriage was annulled.

1115
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:51,372
I'll rephrase.

1116
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:53,958
Do you love Tami-Lynn?

1117
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,462
I love my wife, Okay?
My wife.

1118
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,963
More than anything
in the world.

1119
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,257
We're married, I don't care
what anybody says.

1120
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:05,220
So you're saying you are capable
of feeling love.

1121
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,763
Yeah.

1122
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:08,723
Hey, it must be weird
for you guys,

1123
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:10,183
having a doll up here
on the stand

1124
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,477
with no kid pointing to where his uncle
touched him, huh?

1125
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,938
Yeah, no, yeah, no.

1126
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,982
Yeah, lam capable.
I love a lot of stuff, Yeah.

1127
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,695
Ted, do you believe
you have a soul?

1128
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,449
What did you think

1129
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,452
I would do at this moment

1130
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,747
When you're standing before me

1131
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:35,542
With tears in your eyes

1132
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,669
That answer your question?

1133
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,212
Objection,
Your Honor?

1134
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,172
Overruled!

1135
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,467
A-ha! What it is, man!
Dynomite.

1136
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,594
Ted, Right, right.
Sorry, sorry.

1137
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:50,807
Look, I'm not
a scientist, okay?

1138
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,769
I don't know exactly what
makes a person a person.

1139
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:57,397
All I know is I feel stuff.

1140
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,274
Just like all you guys.

1141
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,777
And I don't think I ought to be treated
any different.

1142
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,283
Capable of love.

1143
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,494
Aware of his
own consciousness.

1144
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:15,999
Seems pretty human to me.

1145
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,877
No further questions.

1146
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:20,628
Mr. Kidder,

1147
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:25,133
you were an employee at Hasbro from 1976
to 1998. Is that correct?

1148
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,219
Yes, I supervised the stuffing of
the teddy bears.

1149
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:30,221
And what is that
stuffing made of?

1150
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:32,724
A synthetic
cotton-poly blend.

1151
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,559
Is there anything else
in there?

1152
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:38,813
The bear products are affixed with an electronic
device in the chest

1153
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:42,275
which can be programmed
to say any one of five phrases.

1154
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:44,819
Hmm.

1155
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:48,990
Ted,

1156
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,743
would you please
press your chest?

1157
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:54,996
What?

1158
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:58,166
Please follow the instruction,
Mr. Clubber Lang.

1159
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:04,839
I love you!

1160
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,601
No further questions.

1161
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,189
Also in the news,
a pending court case

1162
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:23,358
is beginning to get
national attention

1163
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,401
for its civil
rights ramifications.

1164
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,403
Ted, the bear,
who some of you may remember

1165
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:30,990
came to life back in the mid-'80s
right here in Boston,

1166
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:34,160
is suing to prove
he is indeed a person.

1167
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,955
Okay, so what are we even talking
about here?

1168
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:40,917
What we're talking about
is a civil rights issue, This bear has rights.

1169
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,961
Oh, come on! He does not!
He's a toy.

1170
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,545
Then why are you
calling it a "he"?

1171
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,965
Look, we call the Statue
of Liberty "she,

1172
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:50,385
but we all know it's an object made
of copper and steel.

1173
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,511
Oh, good point.

1174
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,973
Yes, but she isn't conscious
or sentient, He is, Mmm-hmm.

1175
00:57:55,223 --> 00:57:56,265
Now, come on!

1176
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:57,976
Are any of you
gonna sit there and tell me

1177
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,769
that this stuffed
doll is a person?

1178
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:00,812
- No.
- Not at all.

1179
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,063
We all agree
all the time.

1180
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,482
I don't think he should want to be
considered a person.

1181
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,442
After all, you know,
Ted spent many years

1182
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,319
sleeping and cuddling
with a child.

1183
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:10,238
That's cute when
you're a stuffed animal.

1184
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,323
When you're a person,
that's a felony.

1185
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:17,203
Ted, do you have anything to say
in your own defense?

1186
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,958
I am not an animal!

1187
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:26,754
You see,
your Honor?

1188
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:28,172
He's not an animal.

1189
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:39,100
I'm sorry, your Honor.
I'm on my period.

1190
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:45,273
And live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

1191
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,709
What is taking
them so long?

1192
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,586
Oh, is it bad that
they're taking this long?

1193
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,296
It's not good or bad.
lt just means

1194
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,839
that they're probably
having a debate.

1195
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:12,675
Johnny, it may be time
to play the Betelgeuse card.

1196
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,760
What do you mean?

1197
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:15,428
I mean saying his
name three times.

1198
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,554
What?

1199
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:17,805
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse,
Betelgeuse.

1200
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:18,973
Shut up!

1201
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,391
You fucking crazy?
We don't want

1202
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:21,642
that guy running
around in here.

1203
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:22,894
No, Johnny,
he'll be on our side.

1204
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,312
He'll help us.
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse...

1205
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,981
You are meddling with powers
you do not understand.

1206
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:28,149
Cut the shit.

1207
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,412
Please be seated.

1208
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,085
Mr. Willer, has the jury
reached a verdict?

1209
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,170
Yes, we have,
your Honor.

1210
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:53,925
Um, 'm the case of Ted v. The Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

1211
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:59,347
we, the jury, find for the Commonwealth
in that Ted is not a person.

1212
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,693
Very well.

1213
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,738
The plaintiff is hereby
legally deemed property.

1214
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,866
The definition entails
the rights there of

1215
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,410
and will be recognized
in the terms set

1216
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,871
by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

1217
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:27,041
The court wishes to thank the jury
for its service.

1218
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,134
Are you sure
you can get him?

1219
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,219
Remember, you're
on your own out there.

1220
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,179
Hasbro can have
no connection to this.

1221
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,848
Oh, I'll get him.

1222
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,392
And when I have him, I'll call you
with the code phrase.

1223
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,353
Do you remember what it is?

1224
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:48,938
Yes, I remember it.

1225
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,356
Should we say it
just for safety?

1226
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,440
No, that's not necessary.

1227
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:52,483
Say it, Just say it.
Say it.

1228
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:53,734
I don't want to.
I don't have to.

1229
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,902
Fresh cakes.

1230
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,071
Fresh cakes.

1231
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,498
This isn't fucking fair.

1232
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,500
Teddy's a good man.

1233
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,461
Why is he being treated differently
than everybody else?

1234
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:15,089
It's what
this country does best.

1235
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:17,175
Putting different people
into little groups

1236
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:18,634
and making them
watch Tyler Perry.

1237
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:19,927
It's wrong!

1238
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:22,680
I'm so sorry, baby.

1239
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,267
No, I'm sorry! I thought
I'd built a better case.

1240
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:27,518
It's just...

1241
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,854
The reality is you have
a really shitty lawyer.

1242
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,022
Hey, come on.

1243
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,774
Nobody's blaming you for this.
You did everything you could.

1244
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,943
I... I'm sitting here

1245
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,362
and I...
I can't believe it's official.

1246
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,364
Oh, so what are
we gonna do now?

1247
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:43,284
I mean, we can't take this lying down, right?
We got to do something.

1248
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,787
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna
call Patrick Meighan.

1249
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,039
Who's that?

1250
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:51,000
He is the top civil rights attorney
in America.

1251
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,544
Wait, Is he the one who got that female
midget into the Marines?

1252
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:54,629
Yeah.

1253
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:56,047
Yeah, that had a sad ending though,
you remember?

1254
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,506
She was at
a Veterans Day parade,

1255
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,841
and somebody handed her
a bunch of balloons

1256
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:00,092
and... gone!

1257
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:02,261
It was very sad.
Very sad for the family.

1258
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,889
You know what? If anyone oan get this verdict
overturned, it's him.

1259
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,057
He's not cheap,

1260
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,226
but we've become such
a high profile case,

1261
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:10,561
l feel like he might take it
pro bono.

1262
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:12,063
He's a sucker for media.

1263
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:17,568
Hey, Johnny,
how about a beer, huh?

1264
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:19,153
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1265
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:22,907
Hi, I'm calling for Patrick Meighan.
This is Samantha Jackson.

1266
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:26,327
I defended Ted Clubber Lang
in Ted Vs Massachusetts.

1267
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:28,246
Hey!

1268
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:32,375
Hi, Mr. Meighan. Thank you so much
for taking my call.

1269
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,921
Oh, you've been following
the case, That's great.

1270
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,840
Yeah, that's actually why I'm calling.

1271
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:41,759
Yeah, I was wondering

1272
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:46,180
if, um, maybe you would consider helping us
try to overturn the verdict.

1273
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:52,019
Well, yeah, I mean, it would have to be
a pro bono situation

1274
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:54,272
because we're not really working
with much money.

1275
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:56,565
But I think you'll be impressed
with my client.

1276
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:58,442
Oh! Ha-ha!
Motherfucker!

1277
01:02:58,526 --> 01:02:59,777
Sure.

1278
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,155
Yeah, great.
Okay, Thank you so much!

1279
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:05,574
Okay, I'll see you
then, bye.

1280
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,034
Oh, my God!

1281
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:08,995
He said he'll meet with us on Friday
at 9:00 a.m.

1282
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,496
at his office in New York.

1283
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,789
Is he gonna take the case?

1284
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:13,916
I don't want to jinx it,
but I think so.

1285
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,210
Oh, my God!
You hear that, Johnny?

1286
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:17,503
- I still get a shot!
- Yes!

1287
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:19,213
Oh, my God!
We got to celebrate!

1288
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,464
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1289
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:22,883
Let's go down to the improv
and yell sad suggestions?

1290
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:23,968
Fuck yeah!

1291
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:27,054
So first we need a historical event.
Who's got an event?

1292
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,222
911.

1293
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,891
Okay, maybe something else.

1294
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,643
All right, let's start
with a person.

1295
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:33,811
Robin Williams!

1296
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:37,189
Okay, all right, for real, guys, for real.
Who's got a person?

1297
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:39,150
Robin Williams on 911.

1298
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:40,985
All right, we've heard
from these guys.

1299
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,821
Let's maybe give somebody else
over here a chance.

1300
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,698
How about a location?
Let's go with a location.

1301
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,742
The offices
of Charlie Hebdo.

1302
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:50,911
Okay, seriously, sir, uh,
I just need a location.

1303
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,204
Ferguson, Missouri.

1304
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,664
Germanwings cockpit.

1305
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:55,791
- Okay, I heard "Starbucks.
- No, you didn't.

1306
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:57,043
Nobody said Starbucks.

1307
01:03:57,126 --> 01:04:00,254
All right, Starbucks, Okay, now,
who's in the Starbucks?

1308
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,589
Bill Cosby.

1309
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:02,923
You people are monsters.

1310
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:04,675
We're giving you
the tools, buddy.

1311
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:06,260
Come on, make some
fucking comedy.

1312
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,648
All right, We'll be back
tomorrow afternoon.

1313
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,817
I love you so much, Teddy.

1314
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:25,321
You go kick some ass because I am
not taking off this wedding ring.

1315
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:28,616
I love you too, baby.
I'll see you soon.

1316
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:15,204
If you wanna sit
there with a pie of meat

1317
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:17,498
Just fuck your own brother
in the front seat

1318
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,376
Oh, why can't you
just say please?

1319
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,962
Hey! Must be the money

1320
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:26,257
Hey, Sam, why do you have a duffel bag
that says Arizona State?

1321
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,716
Because that's
where I went to school.

1322
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,885
What, you went
to Arizona State?

1323
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:30,970
Yeah, why?

1324
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,097
Oh, man, that's why
we lost the case.

1325
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,265
- Hello?
- You're dicks.

1326
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,601
Arizona State. Hey, how many times you been
fucked on a houseboat?

1327
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:40,855
Oh, come on.

1328
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,106
Did you write
your dissertation

1329
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,525
on the collected
works of, uh, Red Bull?

1330
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,694
Yeah, Yeah, I did, I got
an A on it.

1331
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:51,073
So do you say Arizona State University
or do you just say HPVU?

1332
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,456
This is perfect, We're gonna get to
the city before 10:00.

1333
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:00,666
Hey, Sam,
how's your boring salad?

1334
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:02,209
Mmm, it's actually delicious.

1335
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,295
Everybody always says
that about their salad.

1336
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:05,629
They're all
a bunch of fucking liars.

1337
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,673
No, I love it.
It's really good.

1338
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:10,092
Have some Cookie Crisp, You need
something nutritional.

1339
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:11,552
Why do you think
I want your Cookie Crisp?

1340
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:13,387
Because you've been staring at it,
and you want it.

1341
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:16,390
Hey, what's the deal here?
You guys ever gonna make out or what?

1342
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:17,975
Teddy, come on, dude!

1343
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,312
No, I'm just saying, You look like you're
hitting it off, you know?

1344
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,272
Sam, you dig him, right?

1345
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:26,317
Hey!

1346
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,277
Where the hell's my coffee? I've been
waiting for 10 minutes.

1347
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,571
I'm so sorry, sir, I forgot.
I'll get it right away.

1348
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,491
Jesus, you're a waitress,
you're not building rockets, Figure it out!

1349
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,493
What a prick!

1350
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:38,579
Hey, 20 bucks I can toss a Cookie Crisp
into his ass crack.

1351
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:39,914
Wait, let me try.

1352
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,458
I used to pitch for the softball team
at Arizona State.

1353
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,418
Oh, yeah? Was your mascot
a broken condom?

1354
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,003
Shut up.

1355
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:48,506
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

1356
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:50,341
Who did that?

1357
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:53,344
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You got to be kidding me!

1358
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,179
Now, we're assholes.
Look what you did.

1359
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:58,015
I swear to God, I'll kick your goddamn ass!
Who was it?

1360
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,018
Uh, sir, I apologize
for my 5-year-old son.

1361
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:02,478
I'm sowwy!

1362
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:03,646
Sowwy, sir.

1363
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:06,190
Cookie Crisp in your bum-bumzies,
I'm sowwy.

1364
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:10,110
Well, under the circumstances,
I guess it's okay.

1365
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:12,696
Oh, my God, Now we're even
bigger assholes.

1366
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,448
Go get my Cookie
Crisp out of his ass.

1367
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:15,908
You guys making
trouble over here?

1368
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,660
Uh, no, ma'am. We're just
minding our business.

1369
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:20,120
Let's try to keep your boyfriend
under control here, yeah?

1370
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,289
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

1371
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,707
Oh.

1372
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,334
Good.

1373
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,044
We'll just get the check.
Thanks.

1374
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,420
Of course.

1375
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:31,757
Oh, my God.

1376
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,802
John, did you see that? She was totally giving
you the fuck-me eyes.

1377
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,053
No, she wasn't.

1378
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,471
She was giving you
the fuck-me eyes.

1379
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:38,847
What are the fuck-me eyes?

1380
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:41,517
Some women just
have fuck-me eyes.

1381
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:43,227
Do I have fuck-me eyes?

1382
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,729
No, you have "Give us the ring,
my precious" eyes.

1383
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,314
We better get going.

1384
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:49,400
We got two hours of driving left and
I'm kind of beat.

1385
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,151
Yeah, we got to be
well rested for tomorrow.

1386
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:53,153
I'll drive.
You can take a nap.

1387
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,488
You don't have a license.

1388
01:07:54,572 --> 01:07:56,073
Who cares?
Johnny lets me drive

1389
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:57,575
every once in a while
when he's too hammered.

1390
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:58,659
I'm a fucking pro!

1391
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:00,494
Besides,

1392
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:03,080
I've been kicked around
a lot this week. I just...

1393
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,249
I want to feel useful,
you know?

1394
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,001
Twenty minutes
behind the wheel.

1395
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,168
Yay!

1396
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:13,567
Ah! Ah!
Shit, shit, shit!

1397
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,432
What the fuck?

1398
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,976
Well, Sam, it's been 20 minutes.
You wanna take over?

1399
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,991
Hey, listen, Sam,
I'm real sorry.

1400
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:04,785
That barn just
came out of nowhere.

1401
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,204
No, no, it's my fault.
I... I, uh...

1402
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,914
I should never
have let you drive.

1403
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,582
Yeah, You were wrong.

1404
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,292
- You were wrong to do that.
- Yeah.

1405
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:16,296
But that and the trial are the only two things
you fucked up, So, uh...

1406
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:18,882
I can't see shit
in there.

1407
01:10:18,966 --> 01:10:21,051
We're gonna have to wait till tomorrow
to get the car out.

1408
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:23,971
Uh, wait, Are we gonna
spend the night here?

1409
01:10:24,138 --> 01:10:26,682
Yeah, it'll be fine, We just got to find
some firewood.

1410
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,736
What the hell?

1411
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:46,910
Holy shit! Hey, Ted!

1412
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:51,165
You know what this is?
It's Super Lemon Haze.

1413
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,374
It's a really rare strain.

1414
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,668
It's a cross between Lemon Skunk and
Super Silver Haze.

1415
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:56,044
It's totally potent.

1416
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:57,421
I've only had it
once in my life

1417
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,006
and it was one of
the best highs I ever had.

1418
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:00,424
What the hell is
a leaf of this stuff

1419
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,675
doing out in
the middle of a...

1420
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:33,832
Dear God! Dear God in heaven!

1421
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:36,376
So beautiful.

1422
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:39,296
It's so beautiful.

1423
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,423
No words.

1424
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,635
No words.

1425
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:46,720
They should've sent
a poet.

1426
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,896
They're moving in herds.

1427
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:58,732
They do move in herds.

1428
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:05,656
Please tell me that's not the only bong
you brought on this trip.

1429
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,659
Yeah, Sam. This puts us in kind of
an awkward position, here.

1430
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,202
I mean, we wanna
get high, too.

1431
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:11,620
I don't have any
papers or nothing.

1432
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,623
Is this hilarious? I got it at
a bachelorette party.

1433
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,835
It's so stupid.
Here, try it.

1434
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,002
Uh, no.

1435
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:20,128
Why?

1436
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:22,673
I don't wanna put
a big glass cock in my mouth.

1437
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,132
Oh, you think
this is big?

1438
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,052
Johnny, you walked
right into that one, pal.

1439
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,095
This is all I brought.

1440
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,013
How about this? I'm gonna go
check out the barn

1441
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:32,099
and I'm gonna see
if I can find a soda can or something

1442
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:33,350
for us to make an actual bong.

1443
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,269
Yeah, see if you can
make a non-dick bong.

1444
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:38,188
Yeah. Hey, that's the name of the South
Korean president.

1445
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:39,356
Right?

1446
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,858
She gets...
You get it.

1447
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:41,942
Right? No.

1448
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:43,151
What?

1449
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,987
Okay, I'll be back.

1450
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,822
Sorry.

1451
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:49,491
No, This is nice.

1452
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:51,493
You know?
I always wanted my ex-wife

1453
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:53,203
to get stoned with me.
She never would.

1454
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,371
Really?

1455
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:57,374
Wow, That's the cornerstone
of any great marriage.

1456
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,959
I agree.

1457
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:05,507
So, you think this Meighan guy
is gonna help us?

1458
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:08,510
I mean, honestly,
I don't know. Um...

1459
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,388
But we're going
to the right place.

1460
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,141
Listen, I just really
want to thank you

1461
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:16,059
for all you've clone,
all you're doing for us.

1462
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,936
I know it's not
making you rich.

1463
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,062
Please.

1464
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,398
There are more important things
in life than money.

1465
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,026
Look,

1466
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,945
I don't know what
kind of mojo was in

1467
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:28,739
that wish you made
when you were a child,

1468
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,699
but this bear is alive.

1469
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:35,704
And it seems to me that once the law
devalues one kind of life,

1470
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,498
how soon before
it devalues another?

1471
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:40,751
Who gets subjugated
after the bear?

1472
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,379
You're really smart,
you know that?

1473
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:46,965
How come
you don't have a guy?

1474
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,593
Dude, have you seen
the guys in Boston?

1475
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,678
I'm supposed to date
some pale, blotchy guy

1476
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:53,680
with a wife-beater
under his Bruins jacket

1477
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:56,183
and a shamrock tattoo
on his calf? Nope.

1478
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:57,309
Yeah.

1479
01:13:57,392 --> 01:13:58,685
That's so dumb.

1480
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,188
I couldn't
find any cans,

1481
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:03,941
but I got to tell you,
there's some awesome shit in that barn.

1482
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:07,069
Take a look at this, I found a cowboy hat
and a rifle and a guitar.

1483
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:08,654
Hey, be careful
with that, huh.

1484
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,947
No, it's okay.
It's not loaded.

1485
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,076
And my fucking nose
came off.

1486
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:17,537
Jeez, I wonder who
this place belongs to.

1487
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:19,623
Maybe we should find someplace else.

1488
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:21,708
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

1489
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,835
If we get out of here by dawn, we should
be fine, right?

1490
01:14:26,088 --> 01:14:27,339
You play the guitar?

1491
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,717
A little bit.
I learned when I was a kid.

1492
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,063
Mean moon

1493
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,565
It must be fun

1494
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:52,114
To shine upon me
as I come undone

1495
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:58,578
Till I'm all alone
beneath the sun

1496
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:05,252
You mean on moon

1497
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:11,174
With your beam you led the way

1498
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:18,098
And found me love
I thought was here to stay

1499
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:24,688
Then you went and
took my love away

1500
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:29,943
You mean on moon

1501
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:36,950
Oh, you mean on stars above

1502
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:43,582
The games that
you play with me

1503
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:49,046
I could find some happiness

1504
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:56,136
If all of my nights
were cloudy

1505
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:59,347
Mean on moon

1506
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,309
I hope it's true

1507
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:08,815
You're takin' all the light
that's left in you

1508
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:15,739
And saving it up
for you know who

1509
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:21,745
You mean on moon

1510
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:28,835
You mean on moon

1511
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:49,022
Yes!

1512
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:05,914
You got it.

1513
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:07,290
You got it!

1514
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,042
Come on, put your legs
into it.

1515
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,088
There you go! Nice job!

1516
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,172
Jesus.

1517
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,674
So, listen, I got to ask.

1518
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:18,885
Was it just kissing last night?
Or was there finger stuff?

1519
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:27,519
Man, we got a lot of pot in this car.
I wish we could smoke it.

1520
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:28,854
Oh, we're gonna
smoke it, all right,

1521
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:30,147
but just stuff it
under the seat for now.

1522
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,231
We don't wanna
go to jail.

1523
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,566
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1524
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,751
Oh, what the fuck?
What are you doing?

1525
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,921
Hashtag "My amazing summer.

1526
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:57,007
God damn it! What the hell's
wrong with you?

1527
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,425
Oh, I fucking owe you,
you bastard.

1528
01:17:58,508 --> 01:17:59,759
What do you mean?
I was just messing around.

1529
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:01,803
Oh, shut up
and suck that dick.

1530
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:02,888
Oh, fuck you.

1531
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,292
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1532
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:34,127
Watch it, Jesus! Watch where
you're going!

1533
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:37,130
It's a crosswalk, jackass!
We have the right of way! Yeah.

1534
01:18:37,214 --> 01:18:38,215
Whoa!

1535
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:40,634
Hey, what the hell you doing
walking around dressed like Star Wars?

1536
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:43,762
It's Comic Con, you idiot! We're going to
the Javits Center.

1537
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:45,222
You're the idiots,
because you three guys

1538
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:46,556
would never be
walking together!

1539
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,559
Yeah, you're his boss and you two guys
are enemies!

1540
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,269
Yeah, bite me,
Captain Kirk!

1541
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,104
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
Hey! Come on, That's Star Trek!

1542
01:18:53,188 --> 01:18:54,397
Yeah, that's two
different franchises.

1543
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:56,107
Yeah, sorry, guys.
She doesn't know.

1544
01:18:56,191 --> 01:18:58,568
Nah, it's okay, I'm sorry you have
to deal with that.

1545
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:00,987
All right, let's go.

1546
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,907
Oh, hey, come on.
It's not worth it, man.

1547
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,575
Come on.

1548
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,388
This Patrick Meighan's
got a classy setup, huh?

1549
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:27,514
Mmm.

1550
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:34,854
And there is our
first impression.

1551
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:37,357
Ms. Jackson?
Mr. Meighan will see you now.

1552
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,025
Oh, okay,
thank you.

1553
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,118
Ah, Ms. Jackson,
Do come in.

1554
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:50,537
Mr. Meighan,
this is such an honor.

1555
01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:52,289
Thank you so much
for meeting with us.

1556
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,624
Not at all, It's my pleasure.
Please, sit down.

1557
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,960
Oh, this office is
fucking awesome.

1558
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,962
Yeah, totally.
Hey, hey.

1559
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:00,463
You ever bring chicks up here?

1560
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:02,549
What do you think?

1561
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:05,885
I think I want to sleep on a bed
made of your voice.

1562
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:09,014
I'll get right down to it.

1563
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,099
I don't want to waste
too much of your time.

1564
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:15,729
Ted, I've been
reviewing your file.

1565
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,315
And while I'm sympathetic
to your cause,

1566
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:21,609
I'm sorry to say
I won't be taking your case.

1567
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:22,819
- What?
- Why?

1568
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:23,903
Why not?

1569
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:25,822
Well, it comes down to this.

1570
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,702
You want to be human
in the eyes of the law.

1571
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:33,413
That's a hard sell,
even for me.

1572
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,333
See, the important
thing about being human

1573
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,793
is making a contribution
to society.

1574
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:41,254
Assisting in
the betterment of your race.

1575
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,423
You've done none of that.

1576
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,216
I've read about your life.

1577
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:48,553
The drugs, the parties,
the prostitutes, the arrests.

1578
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:51,056
Mr. Meighan, we've come
a long way to meet you

1579
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:52,766
because you said
that you could help us.

1580
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:55,018
I said I would consider it.

1581
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:56,936
And I have.

1582
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:00,607
Ted, you're special.

1583
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,318
You could've been
an inspiration to the world.

1584
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,653
Could've been a leader,
a role model.

1585
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:08,239
Instead you're

1586
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,283
Justin Bieber.

1587
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:11,826
Fuck you!

1588
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,203
Hey, Ted! Come on!
I'm sorry.

1589
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,288
He doesn't mean that.
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

1590
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:16,748
There's just no indication

1591
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:19,751
that you've had any positive effect
on the world around you.

1592
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:22,587
Well, that's not true, He's had a positive
effect on me.

1593
01:21:22,754 --> 01:21:25,632
Would that positive effect
be your join to arrest

1594
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:28,051
for purchasing
marijuana in 2003?

1595
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,845
Well, how the fuck do you prepare for
a Foo Fighters concert?

1596
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,724
You know why
you lost this case?

1597
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:38,311
It can't be argued by reason.

1598
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:41,815
The precedent it sets would affect
the public directly.

1599
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:45,276
And unfortunately,
the public doesn't judge by reason.

1600
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,570
It judges by emotion.

1601
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:51,783
And you can't appeal
an emotional conviction.

1602
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,662
Nonetheless, I wish you all the best
in your efforts.

1603
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,499
He needs help.

1604
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,501
And from what
I know about you,

1605
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:04,045
at one point in your
career that would've been enough.

1606
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:08,341
I'm sorry you're not
who I hoped you'd be.

1607
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,893
Are those Tootsie Rolls
just, like to take?

1608
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,231
Those aren't
supposed to be out.

1609
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:36,411
So that's it.
I'm property.

1610
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,080
No rights, no nothing.

1611
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:42,709
Ted, dude, I'm so sorry, man.
This completely sucks.

1612
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:44,544
I feel terrible.

1613
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:47,046
I let you guys down
all over again.

1614
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:50,383
Hey, You didn't let us down, Sam.
You did your best.

1615
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:53,178
And, look, regardless of
all this shit,

1616
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:55,847
you're still the best thing that's happened
to me in a long time.

1617
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,062
Oh, Oh, that...

1618
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:04,397
That's great!
That's fucking great!

1619
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:05,523
I'm glad you guys
are so happy!

1620
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:06,649
What?

1621
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,693
What do you mean, What?
I'm totally screwed here.

1622
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:11,279
And you're sitting there
basically banging my lawyer,

1623
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,031
and she's probably
still fucking billing us!

1624
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:15,200
Well, don't yell at us, dude!
We didn't do anything!

1625
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,659
Yeah, exactly! exactly!

1626
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:19,829
Maybe if you guys had spent a little less time
mooning over each other,

1627
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:22,749
Sam could've won this
thing and I wouldn't be a fucking thing!

1628
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:25,001
Like garbage or
a piece of shit!

1629
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,795
Hey, we've been fighting
right alongside you the whole way.

1630
01:23:27,879 --> 01:23:28,922
And remember,
you're the one

1631
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,006
who's been pushing me
to get back on the horse.

1632
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,008
I finally meet someone and you're giving me
shit for it?

1633
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:33,676
Oh, no, you're right.
No, Johnny, it's fine.

1634
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,844
You're right, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

1635
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:37,347
I got no job,
no marriage and no life!

1636
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,517
But you have fun porking Gollum here,
while I'm left with shit!

1637
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:41,768
Ted!

1638
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:42,977
Who's Gollum?

1639
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,104
She's a model.
Ted, come back!

1640
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:46,356
Leave me alone!

1641
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:47,607
- Ted!
- Ted!

1642
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:52,904
Shit.

1643
01:24:03,656 --> 01:24:04,457
Whoa.

1644
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,543
Sorry, bro.

1645
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,290
Hey, Ted!

1646
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,418
Guy?

1647
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,877
I thought that was you.
What's happening, man?

1648
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:51,963
Hey, Rick! It is Ted.

1649
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:53,089
Hey, how you doing?

1650
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,341
- Hey, what's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1651
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:59,846
I just feel at home among the outcasts.
What are you guys doing here?

1652
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,724
Well, you know, Rick and I,
we just come here as a gag.

1653
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:06,144
Dress up like we're into this shit
and fuck with the nerds.

1654
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:07,437
Hey, spaz.

1655
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,398
Uh, why don't you go get me some Big
League Chew, How about that, huh?

1656
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:17,572
Uh-huh, All right, well,
good luck with your dick, there.

1657
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:19,032
Right on.
You, too, man.

1658
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:22,493
God damn it, that under wear
had shit on it!

1659
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:28,458
Hey.

1660
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,251
Are you Ted?

1661
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:32,211
Uh, yeah.

1662
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:34,964
This is so exciting!

1663
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:37,383
I was such a big fan of yours
in the early '90s.

1664
01:25:37,634 --> 01:25:40,345
Oh, thanks a lot.
What's your name?

1665
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:41,971
I'm Raphael.

1666
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:44,057
Hey, do you think I could
take a picture with you?

1667
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:45,767
Uh, yeah, yeah,
No problem.

1668
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,644
Great, great!
Here, follow me.

1669
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:51,689
Uh, okay, why are we
doing this back here?

1670
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:52,940
Well, you're a celebrity.

1671
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,193
I just don't want you to get mobbed
when people recognize you.

1672
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:58,154
Yeah, that's true, I've been mistaken for an
Ewok three times today.

1673
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,280
All right,
let's do this.

1674
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:05,995
Holy shit! Donny!

1675
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:08,414
It's so good to see you, Ted.

1676
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:10,792
It's been some time,
hasn't it?

1677
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:13,252
What, you mean since
you ripped me in half?

1678
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,963
That wasn't
supposed to happen.

1679
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,632
That was an accident.

1680
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,718
I have some big plans
for you, Ted.

1681
01:26:21,469 --> 01:26:22,929
Very big plans.

1682
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,056
I need you to come
with me now.

1683
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:26,182
Go to hell!

1684
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,114
Nice lunch, spaz.

1685
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,333
Hey! What the hell!

1686
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:58,673
He could be anywhere.
We're not gonna find him.

1687
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:00,049
We should just
wait by the car.

1688
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:01,718
What do you mean?
We have to find him, okay?

1689
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:03,845
He's a teddy bear on his own in New York,
for God's sakes.

1690
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,683
Hello?

1691
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:10,560
Johnny, Johnny, it's me.
You got to help me.

1692
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:12,979
Ted, where are you? Dude, we've been looking
everywhere for you.

1693
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:16,649
I'm at Comic Con, but,
John, it's Donny! He's here!

1694
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:18,234
He's after me.
You got to get over here.

1695
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,902
What the fuck?
Did you just say Donny?

1696
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:21,070
John, what's going on?

1697
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:22,697
Yes, it's him!
He's...

1698
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:25,825
Oh, shit!

1699
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:30,830
Ted! Ted, hello?

1700
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,915
What's the matter?
Oh, my God, Déjé vu.

1701
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,667
We got to get to
Come on, Come on!

1702
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,007
Get out of the way!

1703
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,187
You know,

1704
01:27:55,229 --> 01:27:57,398
I really love
that Neil Diamond.

1705
01:27:58,065 --> 01:28:02,862
Especially that song they sing
at the Red Sox games.

1706
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:06,532
It's just so infectious.

1707
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:09,243
You just can't
help but sing along.

1708
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:14,749
Hands touching hands

1709
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:18,294
Reaching out

1710
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:24,759
Touching me, touching you

1711
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:28,805
Sweet Caroline

1712
01:28:28,888 --> 01:28:30,306
Bah, bah, bah!

1713
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,390
Fuck!

1714
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:33,226
Crazy son of a bitch!

1715
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:37,980
Hey!

1716
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:39,398
What are you doing
to that bear?

1717
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,067
I'm sorry,
I, uh...

1718
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,985
You better be planning
on buying that!

1719
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:45,780
He just reminds me
of when I was a kid.

1720
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:46,823
Yeah, that's great.

1721
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:47,907
$40.

1722
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,242
Okay.

1723
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:51,911
I have $40, here.

1724
01:29:01,796 --> 01:29:02,839
You see him anywhere?

1725
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:04,674
No, Let's try in there.

1726
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,471
Hi, have any of you guys seen a talking teddy
bear run through here?

1727
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:12,598
Shh, They're about to announce
the new Superman.

1728
01:29:12,682 --> 01:29:15,268
The new Superman is...

1729
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,811
Jonah Hill!

1730
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:18,104
Fuck!

1731
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:19,564
- Who's Superman?
- What?

1732
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:21,691
I'm just kidding,
I'm fucking with you, Come on!

1733
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:24,777
And if that is
not big enough news,

1734
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:27,697
Hasbro will be
unveiling a brand-new line

1735
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,616
of Transformers
merchandise next fall.

1736
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,287
We've got a brand-new
line of Decepticons...

1737
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,371
Hey!

1738
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,789
that is gonna be...
Fresh cakes.

1739
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:38,374
Fresh cakes.

1740
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,793
Fresh cakes.

1741
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:44,130
Comic Con fans,

1742
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:46,048
let's take a look at
this thrilling sizzle reel

1743
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:47,925
with all of our
exciting new toys.

1744
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:49,594
Take a look.

1745
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,185
Come on, there's an empty
supply room downstairs.

1746
01:29:58,269 --> 01:29:59,270
Is that him?

1747
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:01,355
Yeah, there was
an issue, so he's

1748
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:02,899
unconscious now,
but yeah, this is him.

1749
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:05,192
Jesus! Why did you
bring him here?

1750
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:07,361
I've been following him around
since yesterday.

1751
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,907
This was the only chance I could get him alone.
I had to move fast.

1752
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,033
Hey, Ted!

1753
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:14,911
Is that you?

1754
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,954
Uh, yeah, he had
a little too much to drink.

1755
01:30:17,038 --> 01:30:19,999
He puked a pile of cotton
all over this little girl in a stroller

1756
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:22,585
so we're gonna take him back
and sober him up.

1757
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,420
Ah, rock on, Ted.

1758
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:25,630
Eff yeah.

1759
01:30:25,713 --> 01:30:29,508
Hey, guys, be careful out there,
Some nerd spilled his lunch.

1760
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:31,844
Hey, watch that floor.
Comes up fast, man.

1761
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:39,769
Hey, Johnny.

1762
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:40,895
Guy?

1763
01:30:41,187 --> 01:30:43,481
Man, it's a goddamn party
here today.

1764
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:45,650
Hey, I remember
you from the wedding.

1765
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:47,693
- You get a nose job?
- No.

1766
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,695
Yes, you did,
you fucking liar.

1767
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:51,322
Hey, we just ran
into your buddy Ted.

1768
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:52,448
Ted? Where is he?

1769
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:55,868
He got a little wasted, so these two
dudes took him out back to sober up.

1770
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:57,036
Did you see
which way they went?

1771
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:58,955
Yeah, yeah, Baok hallway,
past the photo booth.

1772
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:00,164
Come on!

1773
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,208
Thirsty, Urkel?

1774
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,211
I fucking love this place.

1775
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,806
What the fuck? What the fuck's
going on here?

1776
01:31:16,973 --> 01:31:18,057
Who the hell are you?

1777
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:20,643
He really is
extraordinary, isn't he?

1778
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:23,145
You son of a bitch!
This is kidnapping!

1779
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,064
No, it's not.

1780
01:31:25,314 --> 01:31:29,735
Kidnapping only applies to people.
And you, Ted, you're property.

1781
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,737
Yeah, so is
that fucking hairpiece.

1782
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:37,076
What do you say there,
happy face'?

1783
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:40,329
Right there, Death to Ming.
Yeah! Come on, All right.

1784
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:41,914
Happy guy.

1785
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:45,418
Right there, Death to Ming.
Good, yeah.

1786
01:31:47,253 --> 01:31:48,504
Hey, Bennefi!

1787
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,881
Oh, shit!

1788
01:31:50,965 --> 01:31:52,425
You messed up my car.

1789
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:54,051
What the hell is
wrong with you?

1790
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:56,721
Look, Sam, this is a really bad time, all right?
Something happened to Ted.

1791
01:31:56,804 --> 01:32:00,307
But it was a good time for you to vandalize
my Chrysler though.

1792
01:32:00,391 --> 01:32:02,143
Hey, fuck your Chrysler!

1793
01:32:11,485 --> 01:32:12,695
Holy shit!

1794
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:15,114
Look, Donny, Donny!
You don't wanna do this! Okay?

1795
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:17,116
Think about what
happened at Fenway.

1796
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,703
You remember? You cut me open,
that's it! I'm gone, dead!

1797
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:22,872
Just a regular old teddy bear.

1798
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:24,999
I won't be any
fun then, will I?

1799
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,959
This isn't about you, Ted.

1800
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:29,003
You're only one bear.

1801
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:31,005
We're gonna figure out
what makes you real,

1802
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:32,673
and then we're gonna
make millions of Teds.

1803
01:32:32,757 --> 01:32:34,717
One for every
child in the world.

1804
01:32:35,259 --> 01:32:36,635
One for me.

1805
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:41,557
One that loves me
just as much as you love John.

1806
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:44,393
Look, Donny,
I can never love you.

1807
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,313
God, that sounds fucked up.
Listen, I don't wanna die.

1808
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,522
Okay? So, uh...

1809
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:50,649
What if I gave you
a hand job outside

1810
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:52,485
your pants while
you ate an ice cream?

1811
01:32:55,654 --> 01:32:57,323
I'll give you a minute.

1812
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:04,663
Come here!

1813
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,907
Hey, check it out, Nerd fight.

1814
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:41,242
Ah!

1815
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,213
Come here.

1816
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:01,512
Come on.

1817
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:10,020
I'll see you in heaven, Ted.

1818
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:19,155
Ted!

1819
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:20,364
Who the hell are you?

1820
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:22,783
Get away from him,
you bastard!

1821
01:34:22,867 --> 01:34:24,952
- Ted, you okay, buddy?
- Johnny, thank God!

1822
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:26,036
I'm out.

1823
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,455
Wait, Mr. Jessup, please don't go,
Come on, we can still do this.

1824
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:31,167
You're on your own, Danny.
I can't be implicated in any of this.

1825
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,418
Wait, wait, wait.
Who are you?

1826
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,253
I work for Mattel.

1827
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:37,590
You piece of shit.

1828
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:39,925
Killing him at Fenway Park
wasn't enough for you, huh?

1829
01:34:40,551 --> 01:34:41,719
What do you wanna do now?

1830
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:45,347
You don't deserve him, John.
you never did, you never did!

1831
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:47,641
I've been wanting
to do this for a long time.

1832
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:51,145
A-ha! I fucking knew it!

1833
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:53,564
Come on.

1834
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:08,329
Listen, Johnny, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am.

1835
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:09,705
No, forget it, buddy.

1836
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:12,583
Look, Teddy, you were upset, and I shouldn't
have brushed it off, I'm so sorry.

1837
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:13,751
No, listen to me.

1838
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:16,086
Just listen to me.
You, too, Sam.

1839
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:18,130
I acted like an asshole.

1840
01:35:18,214 --> 01:35:21,800
All right? I was just hurting
because I knew I'd lost.

1841
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:26,722
And that, in the eyes of the world,
I'll always be property.

1842
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,892
But you know what?
Who gives a shit? Right?

1843
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:33,270
It doesn't matter what
the world calls me, I know who I am.

1844
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:35,147
And that's all
that's important.

1845
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:37,608
And I know who my friends are.

1846
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:39,318
And honest to God,

1847
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:42,905
if you two want to be together, nothing
would make me happier.

1848
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,740
Aw, buddy,
I love you for that.

1849
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:46,700
Thanks, Ted.
That means a lot.

1850
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:52,164
And for what it's worth,
as far as I'm concerned,

1851
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,999
you're a person.

1852
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,752
As much as anybody
I've ever known.

1853
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:01,674
Sam, that means the world coming
from someone who went to Arizona State.

1854
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,191
Ted!

1855
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,493
Holy shit!
Johnny!

1856
01:36:29,618 --> 01:36:31,453
- Oh, my God, John!
- Johnny!

1857
01:36:31,537 --> 01:36:32,746
John!
Oh, Jesus!

1858
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,290
- Are you okay?
- Johnny, you all right?

1859
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,374
Shit.

1860
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:36,792
- John, hey.
- Oh, my God.

1861
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,127
Jesus, what happened here?

1862
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,545
The rocket ship just hit him!

1863
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:41,964
Jesus Christ, that's
the starship Enterprise... Forget it.

1864
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:43,465
Somebody call 911!

1865
01:36:43,549 --> 01:36:45,426
Johnny? John, come on,
stay with me, pal.

1866
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:47,803
We need an ambulance
at 655 West 34th.

1867
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:49,138
How the hell did it fall?

1868
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:50,222
I don't know!

1869
01:36:53,267 --> 01:36:54,310
It was him!

1870
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:55,769
The guy dressed like
the Ninja Turtle!

1871
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:02,234
Which one?

1872
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:06,030
All right, two can play this Where's Waldo shit,
you son of a bitch!

1873
01:37:06,113 --> 01:37:07,364
Sam, give me your phone.

1874
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:28,594
That's him.

1875
01:37:32,556 --> 01:37:33,599
Get off me!

1876
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:35,476
Get off me!

1877
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:39,104
Johnny?

1878
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:40,731
Johnny, come on.

1879
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:43,025
Johnny, you got to
wake up, pal.

1880
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:44,651
Johnny, wake up!

1881
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:46,820
Wake up, Johnny.

1882
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:49,156
Johnny.

1883
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:50,616
Johnny, wake up!

1884
01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:53,827
Johnny, wake up.

1885
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:42,167
Hi, How is he?
Is he gonna come out of it?

1886
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:45,379
I don't know, Ms. Jackson.
We've done everything we can

1887
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:47,589
and it's all up to him now.

1888
01:38:57,683 --> 01:38:58,851
John,

1889
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:01,353
please wake up.

1890
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:10,988
Somebody help!

1891
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:12,614
- Oh, my God, John!
- John? Johnny?

1892
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:14,700
Hello?
There's something happening.

1893
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:15,951
Mr. Bennett?

1894
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:18,328
Something's wrong, What's going on?
What's happening to him?

1895
01:39:18,412 --> 01:39:19,872
Mr. Bennett? John?

1896
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:23,041
We have a Code Blue in Room 134!
What does that mean?

1897
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,460
I'm sorry, You three are gonna
have to wait outside.

1898
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:25,794
What the hell is going on?
Is he gonna be okay?

1899
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:26,920
The doctors will do
everything they can,

1900
01:39:27,004 --> 01:39:29,089
but I need you to go to the
waiting area now, please.

1901
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:30,340
Excuse me, excuse me.

1902
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:31,467
What's the status?

1903
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,135
He was stable a minute ago
and now he's unresponsive.

1904
01:39:33,218 --> 01:39:35,387
The monitor says he's in asystole, He's not
breathing, no pulse.

1905
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:37,055
Start compressions.
Prepare to intubate.

1906
01:39:37,181 --> 01:39:38,307
Give him a milligram
of epinephrine.

1907
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:10,255
I'm sorry.

1908
01:40:11,715 --> 01:40:12,883
He didn't make it.

1909
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:17,638
What?

1910
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:20,307
Johnny.

1911
01:40:21,058 --> 01:40:23,227
If you'd like, you can go in

1912
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,978
and say your goodbyes.

1913
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:06,103
Johnny.

1914
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:10,232
You were my thunder buddy.

1915
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:15,070
You were my thunder buddy
for life.

1916
01:41:17,406 --> 01:41:21,159
And you gave up your own life
to save mine.

1917
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:26,206
The only problem is

1918
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:31,753
I don't know how
my life works without you.

1919
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:37,509
Goodbye, John.

1920
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:42,639
I got you, motherfucker!

1921
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:46,435
Holy shit! Zombie!
He's a fucking zombie!

1922
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:48,854
I totally fucking got you!

1923
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:50,814
Holy shit!

1924
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:52,733
You should have seen
your fucking face!

1925
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:54,234
You son of a bitch!

1926
01:41:54,318 --> 01:41:55,819
That was fucking classic!

1927
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:58,822
Wait, wait, wait, this is payback because
I made you think that I was retarded!

1928
01:41:58,905 --> 01:42:00,282
You made me think
you were retarded!

1929
01:42:00,365 --> 01:42:01,408
Oh! Well done!

1930
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:03,285
Well done,
man, High five.

1931
01:42:03,368 --> 01:42:04,411
High five.

1932
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:06,538
What the fuck is going on?

1933
01:42:06,622 --> 01:42:10,792
What's going on, is this guy
just won the bullshit comedy blue ribbon.

1934
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:13,420
You are the fucking greatest man
Holy shit!

1935
01:42:13,879 --> 01:42:15,631
Wait, How was the doctor
in on it?

1936
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:17,799
They got me out of it with the paddles.
I was totally fine.

1937
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:19,259
So I talked him into
going along with the bit.

1938
01:42:19,343 --> 01:42:21,303
Hey, Doc, it worked out
hilarious, thanks.

1939
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:23,555
No problem.
We're a fun hospital.

1940
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:27,017
You asshole!
You think this shit is funny?

1941
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:28,769
Do you know how devastated I was?

1942
01:42:28,852 --> 01:42:30,520
I put a frowny face on Facebook!

1943
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:33,023
How am I supposed to
explain that to everybody?

1944
01:42:33,315 --> 01:42:35,359
You could change your
relationship status from "single"

1945
01:42:35,442 --> 01:42:37,611
to "it's complicated.

1946
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:40,155
You're gonna have to
do a lot better than that.

1947
01:42:41,114 --> 01:42:44,826
How about, in a relationship
with John Bennett?

1948
01:42:45,619 --> 01:42:49,247
Well, we'll have
to talk about that.

1949
01:42:54,127 --> 01:42:55,754
Okay, well, good talk.

1950
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:02,594
Hey, if you guys
want to bang,

1951
01:43:02,678 --> 01:43:04,054
me and Teddy
can totally leave the room.

1952
01:43:04,137 --> 01:43:06,390
No, no, honey, honey, they're classy,
they're not like us.

1953
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:08,141
They're good people

1954
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:11,395
I'm happy to see everyone
has made a full recovery.

1955
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,604
- Mr. Meighan.
- What the hell?

1956
01:43:12,688 --> 01:43:13,814
Holy shit!

1957
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,190
Is it all right
if I come in?

1958
01:43:15,732 --> 01:43:17,150
Sure, yeah.

1959
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:19,486
How are you feeling, John?

1960
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:21,238
I'm alive.

1961
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,240
You're very lucky.

1962
01:43:23,407 --> 01:43:25,325
I saw what you did on TV.

1963
01:43:25,492 --> 01:43:27,619
Yeah, he saved my ass
is what he did.

1964
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:30,580
You know why?
Because he's a person.

1965
01:43:30,956 --> 01:43:32,040
And no matter how many

1966
01:43:32,124 --> 01:43:33,625
of you smart-ass Harvard lawyers
try to keep him down,

1967
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:34,918
you're not gonna change that.

1968
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,420
Not in our eyes.

1969
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:37,754
Ted is real.

1970
01:43:38,088 --> 01:43:39,631
So you can go fuck yourself.

1971
01:43:40,549 --> 01:43:41,842
I will.

1972
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:45,011
And as soon as I'm done
fucking myself,

1973
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:47,389
I'd like to take
your case,Ted.

1974
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:48,682
- What?
- Seriously?

1975
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:50,392
- Oh, my God!
- You heard that?

1976
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:52,352
- Oh, my gosh!
- I don't believe it!

1977
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:55,272
Maybe we don't want you now.
Shut up.

1978
01:43:55,355 --> 01:43:57,315
No, yeah, we want you.
For sure, we want you.

1979
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,276
What made you
change your mind?

1980
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:01,570
Well, when I saw
what John did for you,

1981
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:05,157
that he was willing to
give his life for yours,

1982
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:07,576
it gave me a kick in the ass.

1983
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:10,871
Reminded me of why I chose to do
the kind of work I do.

1984
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,291
I'm sorry I turned you away.

1985
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,751
I was wrong.

1986
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:18,044
As far as I'm concerned,

1987
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:22,466
anyone who can inspire
that kind of love in another person

1988
01:44:22,549 --> 01:44:24,426
deserves to be called human.

1989
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:26,678
You mean it?

1990
01:44:26,762 --> 01:44:28,346
I certainly do.

1991
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:30,223
So,

1992
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:32,142
shall we get started?

1993
01:44:42,444 --> 01:44:44,112
What defines a person?

1994
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:48,241
What defines property?

1995
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:51,036
What's the difference?

1996
01:44:52,746 --> 01:44:57,042
The anthropologist and ethioist
Dawn Prince-Hughes

1997
01:44:57,417 --> 01:45:02,547
argues that the standards for personhood
include self-awareness,

1998
01:45:03,215 --> 01:45:06,384
an ability to understand
complex emotions

1999
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:09,262
and a capacity for empathy.

2000
01:45:11,097 --> 01:45:16,061
We're all in agreement
that Ted is self-aware.

2001
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,648
What is your name?

2002
01:45:20,232 --> 01:45:21,775
Ted Clubber Lang.

2003
01:45:26,488 --> 01:45:29,950
As for complex emotions
and the capacity for empathy,

2004
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,953
we all saw
the distressing images

2005
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:35,497
of Ted agonizing
over his fallen friend,

2006
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:37,040
John Bennett.

2007
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,209
In those images,

2008
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:44,381
Ted exhibits all of the remaining qualities
of personhood.

2009
01:45:46,508 --> 01:45:48,885
It's right there
for anyone to see.

2010
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:54,474
And I believe that a just court must,
by definition,

2011
01:45:55,308 --> 01:45:59,145
grant basic human rights
to all those who deserve them,

2012
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:03,149
just as
the Emancipation Proclamation

2013
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,945
and the Thirteenth Amendment did
so many years ago.

2014
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:12,158
So, ladies and gentlemen
of the court,

2015
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,246
I invite you

2016
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,833
to change the world.

2017
01:46:39,436 --> 01:46:42,564
Well, Johnny, this is the second time
you've made me real.

2018
01:46:43,315 --> 01:46:44,441
Thanks, pal.

2019
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:46,401
Hey, you were
always real to me, buddy.

2020
01:46:46,568 --> 01:46:47,736
Even when you weren't.

2021
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:49,154
Congratulations, Ted.

2022
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:50,822
Thanks, Sam.

2023
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:53,825
Ted!

2024
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,036
- Ted!
- Ted! Over here!

2025
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:57,329
Ted!

2026
01:46:58,705 --> 01:47:00,498
This is quite a victory
for you.

2027
01:47:00,582 --> 01:47:02,667
Is there any statement
that you'd like to make

2028
01:47:02,751 --> 01:47:04,169
now that
you're legally a person?

2029
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:06,129
Yes, there is.

2030
01:47:08,548 --> 01:47:10,050
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

2031
01:47:10,425 --> 01:47:12,093
will you marry me?

2032
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:14,846
Yes.

2033
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,355
And so our story comes to an end.

2034
01:47:23,688 --> 01:47:26,650
Ted and Tami-Lynn
were married once again,

2035
01:47:26,733 --> 01:47:31,446
and soon afterward, they adopted a fine,
young baby boy.

2036
01:47:31,696 --> 01:47:33,865
Johnny, meet your new godson,

2037
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:35,784
Apollo Creed Clubber Lang.

2038
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:37,953
Oh, Teddy, he's adorable.

2039
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,789
Oh! And we got something for him, too.
John, show him.

2040
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:42,290
Oh, shit, yeah, Hold on.

2041
01:47:42,374 --> 01:47:43,833
He got you something.

2042
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:46,461
Huh?

2043
01:47:46,544 --> 01:47:47,963
Oh, Johnny!

2044
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,006
Oh, Johnny, it's perfect.

2045
01:47:50,173 --> 01:47:53,009
Hey, you know, maybe someday,
if you wish hard enough,

2046
01:47:53,176 --> 01:47:54,511
maybe he'll come to life

2047
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:56,805
and you guys can do
all kinds of drugs together.

2048
01:47:57,097 --> 01:47:58,807
That's all I want for him.

2049
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:02,811
Oh! It smells like somebody's got
a poopy diaper.

2050
01:48:02,978 --> 01:48:04,187
Teddy, it's your turn
to change him.

2051
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:05,814
Oh, yeah, no problem.

2052
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:09,067
- Oh! Fuck me!
- What's the matter?

2053
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,944
That can't be normal.
He's got to be sick.

2054
01:48:11,027 --> 01:48:12,946
He's not sick,
it's just baby doody.

2055
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:14,280
Yeah, that's what
babies do, Teddy.

2056
01:48:14,406 --> 01:48:16,282
- Oh, you don't think this diaper's gross?
- No.

2057
01:48:16,408 --> 01:48:17,826
All right, Here, catch.

2058
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:20,328
Oh, Teddy,
What the fuck?

2059
01:48:20,453 --> 01:48:23,415
Holy shit!
Oh, you motherfucker!

2060
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:26,334
Hashtag Shit happens.
