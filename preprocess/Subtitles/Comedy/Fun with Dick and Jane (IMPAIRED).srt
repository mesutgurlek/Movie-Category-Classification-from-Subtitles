1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,127
Glob dyne is a consolidator
of media properties.

2
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:19,102
Glob dyne is a consolidator of media
properties. Consolidator. Oh, no!

3
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:25,369
Glob dyne’s a consolidator of
media properties and data retrieval...

4
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,673
...with a focus in fibber-optic
content provision.

5
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,577
It's basically a synergy
of Web-based...

6
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,049
...and platform-based
UNIX-driven delivery systems.

7
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,245
Okay, I made that last part up.

8
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:40,120
We spent months on this trip.
I just assumed...

9
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:42,854
...that you knew you needed
a passport to get into Russia.

10
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,929
But if I should have told you,
then I'm really sorry, Mr. Fairbanks.

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,500
It's not my fault airport security
strip-searched you, Mr. Fairbanks.

12
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:01,112
I mean, maybe you shouldn't have
made that joke. You know?

13
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,578
Hon? Fire.

14
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,048
You know what, I'm going to
load you up with drink coupons.

15
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:10,523
Blanca? Can you make this little man
something to eat?

16
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:23,333
Are you sure about this?

17
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:26,064
The trainer said it's just
a minor annoyance.

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,505
He said it just reminds him
to be a little less vocal.

19
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,378
- Hey, Dick.
- Morning, Joe.

20
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,149
That a new car?

21
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:17,214
It's the new Mercedes S500.

22
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,723
You can only special-order
these from Germany.

23
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:23,522
- How's it run?
- Well, it's a Mercedes.

24
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:26,730
Check this out.

25
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,366
Mercedes, on.

26
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,730
Yeah? Well, watch this.

27
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:36,740
Beemer, sit. Stay.

28
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,572
Play dead. Good boy.

29
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,808
That's cute, Dick. Mercedes, off.

30
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,834
"It has come to our attention
that certain departments...

31
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:15,038
...have begun to run into situations."
Situations.

32
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,342
The big boys want
to see you upstairs.

33
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,708
Which floor? Twentieth?

34
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:21,578
Twenty-sixth?

35
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:23,784
Thirty-second?

36
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,223
- Not the 51st?
- Yes.

37
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,421
Congratulations, Mr. Harper.

38
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
- Go ahead and wrap this up.
- Okay.

39
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:36,663
- How do I look?
- Great.

40
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,702
- Anything in my teeth?
- No.

41
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,737
I need a paper bag.

42
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:48,746
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey, Dick. Morning.

43
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:51,440
It is, isn't it? Sure is.

44
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,245
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,119
Hey, did you... ?
Did you hear about Bill?

46
00:04:57,024 --> 00:05:00,619
- Oh, yeah. That's.... That's wild.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:05,756
Yeah. I wonder.... I wonder
who's going to take his place.

48
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,598
That's the big mystery.

49
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,704
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:17,443
- You getting off?
- Not this time, Oz.

51
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,846
Son of a bitch!

52
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:19,762
That's it.

53
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,711
Hello. I'm...

54
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,284
...Dick Harper, and I'm here
to see Jack McAllister.

55
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,512
Oh, well, that's him now, sorry.
He had to step out.

56
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:40,958
Dick.

57
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,860
Damn glad to finally see you
up here.

58
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,098
Hey, man.

59
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,764
- Frank Bascombe, CFO.
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

60
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,306
Nice to meet you.
Listen, Dick. Dick.

61
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,673
Jack's very sorry that he couldn't
be here to congratulate you.

62
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:03,407
Well, on becoming the new
VP of Communication.

63
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:05,815
Are you--?

64
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,483
- Holy.... Thank you.
- No, no, no.

65
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:11,317
But also, he wanted to invite you
to his house...

66
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,517
...for an orientation meeting
on Monday morning.

67
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:23,295
Dick? Ann's got the address.

68
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,236
All right. Sure, I'll get that.
Okay. Ann?

69
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,806
- Thanks.
- Sure.

70
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,738
And thank you...

71
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:33,240
...Frank.

72
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:37,743
Cool exit.

73
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:40,180
How do you like your eggs?

74
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:44,187
Pardon me!

75
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,935
Ours is an age
of unmeasured prosperity,

76
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,661
Oh, yeah.

77
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,067
- You know what?
- What?

78
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,003
You should quit your job.

79
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,139
- Quit my job?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,811
Do you even know what you're getting
paid? I mean, I can't quit my job.

81
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:10,245
Well, not specifically, but....

82
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:14,481
Bob got VP last month,
he's making 1 50 plus bonuses.

83
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,583
Come on, you want to spend
more time with Billy.

84
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:19,918
Do it. Just-- Come on.

85
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:22,323
Do it. Do it. Quit your job.

86
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,257
We must never become
a winner-take-all society,

87
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,899
- You know what we should do?
- What?

88
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,227
We should have sex...

89
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,635
...on Saturday.

90
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:33,966
I'll buy candles.

91
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,337
I'll pick up the new Starbucks sampler
featuring Sade.

92
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:41,345
Oh, you animal.
That is going to be so wild.

93
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:42,914
Yeah.

94
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,792
Thank you.

95
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,792
Just make yourself at home.

96
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,530
Right.

97
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,311
Dick.

98
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,645
Yeah. Mr. McAllister.

99
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,751
- Dick. Hey, call me Jack.
- Likewise.

100
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:28,422
With my name. Dick, I mean.

101
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,620
Man. Dick Harper.

102
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,321
Dick Harper.

103
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:36,731
Dick Harper playing the harp.
Harpo Marx playing the jew's-harp.

104
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,661
D.H. DH.

105
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,769
You're my designated hitter.

106
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,035
I need you to step up
into the batter's box...

107
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,201
...and knock one out
of the ballpark for me.

108
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,074
- Gone.
- You ever have a nickname?

109
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,906
Well, it was....

110
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,416
Squirt. The Squirt.

111
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:56,556
Something about how I was
conceived, I don't know.

112
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,182
We going to think of something.
Have trouble finding the place?

113
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,660
No, sir. By the way, what a absolutely
beautiful hour-- Home you have.

114
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,696
So then my lawyer says
to her lawyer:

115
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,733
"lf she thinks she's getting that yacht,
she's a little dingy."

116
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:14,036
He always-- He loves that one.

117
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,971
The point is
that we need somebody...

118
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,236
...who projects confidence
in this position.

119
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,004
We've seen how
you handle yourself.

120
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,615
You've been a great cheerleader
for this company.

121
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:25,307
So we were thinking that....

122
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,054
- Well, you go ahead and tell him.
- No, you go ahead.

123
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,589
What's up, guys? Come on.
Don't hold out on me here. What?

124
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:38,060
We want you to go on
Money Life this afternoon...

125
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:40,461
...and announce
our quarterly projections.

126
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,466
You're the guy.
You're the guy we have faith in.

127
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,664
You can get our positive spin
out there.

128
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,302
Right. Positive spin.

129
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:53,446
These are fickle times, Dick.

130
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:56,275
We need to stick together
as a team.

131
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:59,879
Like my daddy always used to say....

132
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,491
Well, you can count on me, sir.

133
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:12,029
I mean, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

134
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,562
- Thank you.
- How were those eggs Florentine?

135
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,336
- Best I've ever had.
- Good answer.

136
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,371
I'm on the plane right now!

137
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,343
Do you know what's sitting
in front of me? Do you know?

138
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:31,541
A kosher meal! A kosher meal!

139
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:35,051
How many times do I need to tell
you? ! I don't need a kosher meal!

140
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,552
I'm Episcopalian!

141
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:40,386
No-- No, you, miss-- You--
No, you grow up!

142
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,392
For-- No, you, miss--

143
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,725
Phyllis, can l... ?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

144
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,197
- Here's a yell!
- It's personal.

145
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:52,869
- Never actually had makeup on.
- I'm happy for you.

146
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,736
- Hi.
- Hi.

147
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,742
- Where's Sam?
- Washington.

148
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,537
These are your talking points.
They were just faxed over.

149
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:03,683
And Sam is on the line for you.

150
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,342
Hello, Mr, Harper,

151
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,954
Hey, Sam. How you doing?
Nice talking to you.

152
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,386
I thought you were going to be here.

153
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,822
- Me too, I hear it's beautiful there,
- That's the thing--

154
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,984
- Okay, Dick, we're on in five,
- Yep, sure.

155
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:18,289
- -three, two....

156
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,441
Today we're talking with the new VP
of Communications at Glob dyne...

157
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,737
... Dick Harper,
How you doing, Dick?

158
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,937
Just terrific, Sam.
Thank you for asking.

159
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:37,208
And so is Glob dyne, by the way.

160
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:41,417
Now, Dick, tell me,
what is the shareholder to make...

161
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:44,716
...of the fact that Jack McAllister,
your CEO...

162
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,826
...has unloaded a considerable share
of his stocks?

163
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:56,231
I think CEOs sell their stocks
for many reasons, Sam.

164
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,771
Both professional and personal.

165
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:02,465
Actually, over the past year, Jack
McAllister has sold 80 percent...

166
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:04,507
...of his holdings
through shell companies,

167
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:07,612
Now, how do you explain that?

168
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,748
The reasons for doing something
like that would be--

169
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,820
Losing you there. Hold on.

170
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:19,254
The reasons for doing something
like that would be.... Could be many.

171
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:22,187
Both....

172
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:28,025
There's also talk of some of
the Glob dyne portfolio documents...

173
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,259
... being subpoenaed,

174
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:33,633
Specifically those of your CFO,
Frank Bascombe,

175
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:38,471
Now, joining us with his insights,
is presidential hopeful Ralph Nader,

176
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,311
Really?

177
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,507
Hi, Ralph. Big fan, love your stuff.

178
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,620
I wish I could say the same,
I don't know how you sleep at night,

179
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,686
Corporations like Glob dyne
pervert the American dream,

180
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,020
The super-rich get richer,

181
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:57,722
You are a disgrace,

182
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,224
Ralph, I don't know where
you're getting your statistics.

183
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:05,697
I can only say that, in my estimation,
Glob dyne is transparent.

184
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,405
We'd be more than willing
to share any and all documentation.

185
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,948
What is going on?

186
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,584
Can somebody tell me
what the heck is--?

187
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,079
Hey, there's a fi-- Somebody should--

188
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,014
Okay.

189
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:28,754
This can't be good.

190
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,023
Out of my way!

191
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:33,358
- Hey, that's my focus!
- My focus!

192
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:37,526
You're not even from this floor!
Help! Security!

193
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,134
What's going on?

194
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,303
Oh, so Dick finally wants to know
what's going on.

195
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,078
Frank?

196
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,882
Methinks somebody made
a boo-boo.

197
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:58,956
Maybe we didn't know how to
use Quicken. Yeah, that could be it.

198
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:03,292
Frank. Frank. Try to focus. Okay?
What's happening to Glob dyne?

199
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,762
- Glob dyne?
- Yeah, what happened, Frank?

200
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:11,302
- We took our shifting losses...
- Yeah?

201
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:15,072
- ... and we put them into businesses...
- Yeah, yeah?

202
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,806
...that we actually owned.

203
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,774
And then the balance sheet...

204
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,141
...it showed profit.

205
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:24,613
But actually, there was...

206
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,078
...debt.

207
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,743
What the hell? !

208
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,648
You're sick.

209
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,685
- I want you to hit me.
- Frank, let go of me now.

210
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:37,056
- I want you to hit me.
- Let go, you're scaring me.

211
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,664
- Hit me.
- Frank! Get off!

212
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:44,026
And I have the 6000 greatest
partners a man could ask for,

213
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:53,406
Mr. McAllister?

214
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,069
I don't know what to tell you.

215
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,241
We're just a cell in a much larger
organism called the global economy.

216
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:03,617
Weak companies have to die so that
stronger companies can get stronger.

217
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,452
- It's just nature.
- Nature? What?

218
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,992
You ever read Walden Pond?
It's all in there.

219
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,027
Hey, you send him a copy
of the tape.

220
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,097
What about the other employees, sir?

221
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,063
They're going to be fine.
Don't go there.

222
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,828
This is America,
the land of opportunity.

223
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:23,906
I don't know, sir. With all due respect,
this doesn't feel right.

224
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:28,571
Step away from the rotors now, boy.
They going to chop your head clean off.

225
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:58,100
Honey? I'm home.

226
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:01,706
Oh, and the vice president is home!

227
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,017
I see you got them digging
the hot tub.

228
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:12,157
I know. Yes, I called the guy.
They came right out.

229
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:18,024
- That almost never happens.
- I know. We're so lucky.

230
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,226
Dinner's ready!

231
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:32,436
- Look at it!
- Oh, my gosh!

232
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,672
Look! I did it and it's perfect!

233
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:39,841
My gosh! That could feed
a family of four.

234
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:44,049
I mean.... I-- In my--
Look at that, Billy.

235
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,850
I'm surprised you left off the hooves.

236
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:52,455
You know, before we get into that,
I have some wonderful news.

237
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,566
Mama quit her job!

238
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,835
- I did. I did, I did!
- You did?

239
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,975
- Isn't that great?
- My gosh! That's incredible!

240
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:06,543
Oh, the timing of it, it was just
beautiful, Dick. And, oh, thank you.

241
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,304
I just-- I just did it!

242
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:11,143
No. Oh, boy.

243
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,648
And now, you know what...

244
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,310
...I can spend so much more time
with my beautiful boy.

245
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:19,219
- Yeah.
- Now, what's your news, big Mr. VP?

246
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:23,761
I have something
of an announcement to make.

247
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,798
It turns out that a very wonderful
opportunity has just presented itself...

248
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:32,866
...in the form of me...

249
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:36,573
...not necessarily working
at Glob dyne anymore.

250
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,103
Were you fired?

251
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,145
I wasn't fired. Glob dyne tanked.

252
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:44,878
- Dick!
- Jeez. "Fired."

253
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,781
What do you mean?
How could that happen?

254
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,046
They just gave you
a promotion. And--

255
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:53,951
There is nothing to worry about.
I'll get my severance...

256
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,220
...money from my pension.
We're fine.

257
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,056
I am a winner.
Billy, tell your father he's a winner.

258
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:05,836
See?

259
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,882
- Hey! Our first day at home together.
- Hey.

260
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,478
Let's have a big family breakfast.

261
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,849
Oh, gosh, honey,
Billy's already gone to school...

262
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,719
...and I got to meet him for that
Mommy & Me lunch thing.

263
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:29,453
What are you going to do?
Are you going to look for a job?

264
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:33,326
You know what,
I think I might just take this day.

265
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:36,263
Great. I do. I think you should.

266
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,370
But, listen, I got to go pick up
that thing at the thing.

267
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,206
Baby, I got to go. I'm sorry. Sorry.

268
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:44,809
Okay, good.

269
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,839
I'll see you later, baby.
Have a really good time.

270
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,311
Bye.

271
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,280
Okay.

272
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,667
Cheers.

273
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,130
Former CFO Frank Bascombe
has been indicted...

274
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:48,034
...on charges of fraud
and money laundering,

275
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,108
Lead investigators say all roads
lead to Mr, Bascombe,

276
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:52,539
And no evidence has yet...

277
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:56,409
...to link former CEO Jack McAllister
to this growing scandal,

278
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,373
We've all had to make sacrifices,

279
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,549
I sold my place in Jackson Ho--
No,

280
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:06,521
- Martha 's Vineyard,
- Oh, shut up!

281
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,526
God.

282
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:17,731
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Can't be that bad, can it, bud?

283
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,713
God!

284
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,312
Oh, you know it.

285
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,920
So can I send you a résumé?

286
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:40,089
No, I got a terrific one here.
You'll love it.

287
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,159
Do you have a fax number?

288
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,693
So there are no new openings
at this time. Right.

289
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:50,062
And what about the near future?

290
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:55,363
Yeah. Sure. I could stop calling.

291
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,069
This afternoon. Okay.

292
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:00,543
I'll be there. Bye.

293
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:06,509
Hon. I got an interview
at Pyramid Tech.

294
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,783
I was really starting
to wonder there.

295
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:29,802
Hey!

296
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,335
Hold on!

297
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,589
- Dick.
- Oz.

298
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,815
Want to go get a drink?

299
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:49,216
- You buying?
- Sure.

300
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,784
- Harper?
- Yeah.

301
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:54,285
- Dick Harper!
- Yeah.

302
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,556
You don't have to stand in this line.
Come on with me.

303
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,926
Hey, Oz. Rain check.

304
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,600
Son of a bitch!

305
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:08,765
Okay, rip it out. Get it on the truck.

306
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,043
Hector, what's going on? What--?

307
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:14,611
- What happened?
- Your check go bouncy-bounce.

308
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,510
But it's okay, I heard what happened
to your husband.

309
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:20,117
Not everybody could afford
landscaping like this, eh?

310
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:23,483
- Hector, please.
- I am sorry, Miss Jane.

311
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:28,150
Oh, no, no, no. No! No, no!

312
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:31,522
This is all--
Everything, it's all wrong.

313
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:33,665
I want this out. Roll it all up.

314
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,893
I ordered Kentucky bluegrass.

315
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:39,799
This is green.

316
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:43,872
- Dick Harper! What a stroke of luck.
- Oh, jeez.

317
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:49,978
I'm sorry, I don't remember
where you know me from.

318
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,776
Oh, I don't know you.

319
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:56,149
I just saw you spaz out Money Life.
Oh, my God, that was great.

320
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:58,483
Hey, some of the fells would
like to meet you.

321
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,285
- Hello, Dick.
- I can't believe it's really you.

322
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,987
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Did you bring your statistics?

323
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,100
We have an expression around
here when someone makes a mistake.

324
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:10,895
It's called "pulling a Dick."

325
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,435
Up high, up high.

326
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:15,002
Have you seen
DickHarperIsATool. com?

327
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,267
Oh, you're going to love this.
This is dynamite.

328
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:20,674
I don't know where
you're getting your statistics,

329
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,849
Who is that? Who is that?
It's you! It's you!

330
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,451
Can we just get on
with the job interview?

331
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,780
This guy!

332
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:32,446
We couldn't hire you!
We just want to take your picture.

333
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:36,117
Okay, everybody, little bit closer.
One, two, three.

334
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:37,421
Statistics!

335
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,961
Hey, how'd it go?

336
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,968
Oh, not too bad.

337
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,703
It was good practice.

338
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:54,569
- What are you doing?
- Going through our finances.

339
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:55,907
I'm not sure...

340
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:59,676
...but it seems that we may be
in a little bit of a pickle, Dick.

341
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:03,811
Well, sure, our financial bounce-back
has taken a bit longer than expected...

342
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,321
...but, you know, that's natural.

343
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:10,053
Our lawn was repossessed today.
I didn't even know they could do that.

344
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:14,689
I think maybe it's time you start
thinking about accepting something...

345
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,267
...a little bit lower
than a vice-presidency.

346
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:20,530
No. Took me 1 5 years to get
a VP-ship. If I step back now...

347
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,367
...I'll lose everything I worked for.

348
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,101
We're just going to have to suck it up
for a couple months.

349
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:28,144
In a couple of months,
we'll be declaring bankruptcy.

350
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:31,044
- Oh, come on.
- Our savings--

351
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:34,879
Look. Our savings
was in Glob dyne stock.

352
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:38,615
Jesus. And, look, our pension
was in Glob dyne stock.

353
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:42,386
Everything was in Glob dyne stock!
All of it!

354
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:46,223
The lawn is covered with dirt!
It is so much fun!

355
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,559
I have made a mud man!

356
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,299
Now, Billy is looking
at the glass half full.

357
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:56,472
Hon, relax. We've got 600 grand.

358
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:59,835
- Where?
- We're standing in it. Our house.

359
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:05,009
Since Glob dyne, the local
property market crashed, Dick.

360
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:10,986
If we sold our house today,
we would owe the bank 1 50 grand.

361
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:15,959
I knew it. It was churning in my gut...

362
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:18,153
- ... and I didn't listen.
- It would be okay.

363
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,663
You said we could afford this house
and take out a second mortgage...

364
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,325
...so that we could put in the pool,
redo the kitchen...

365
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,664
- I said that.
- ... and now we are on the verge...

366
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,000
...of losing the house.
If we lose the house...

367
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:33,474
...then Billy loses all sense of security
and later, never have a relationship...

368
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,807
...so he'll just spend his whole life
just alone.

369
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,382
There he'll be, just alone,
nobody with him, just like a bum.

370
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:42,645
Hon? Hon? You need a paper bag?

371
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:46,055
You said everything
was going to be okay.

372
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:55,592
Mr. Dick! Something wrong
with the electricity!

373
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:01,232
Well, if you're going to do it,
be the best.

374
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:09,774
Hi, I'm Lucy, and I'll be your Kostmart
training team leader.

375
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:12,212
I am so happy to welcome you
to the Kostmart team.

376
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:14,443
Now, we work hard here,
but we play hard also.

377
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,554
I think we're
going to have a good time here...

378
00:28:16,722 --> 00:28:20,123
...because at Kostmart,
we're more than a store. We're family.

379
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,991
Now, before we get started...

380
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,687
...I am going to need you all
to piss in one of these cups.

381
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:39,741
- It's taking a little while.
- Just relax.

382
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:42,972
I've been married for 20 years.
I know what it looks like.

383
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:45,649
You want me to get you a cola?

384
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:49,282
It's just hard to do
while you're standing there watching.

385
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,253
I could sell you my pee for $1 00.

386
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:55,416
I been off the pipe for two years.
Thank you, Jesus.

387
00:28:55,594 --> 00:29:00,930
Unfortunately, we don't have any
positions available in Pilates or yoga.

388
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:04,733
But we are looking
for a Jeet Kun Do instructor.

389
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:08,134
Yes. I mean, that's-- Oh, my--
I thought--

390
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:10,741
I didn't even-- I didn't say that?

391
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,139
I was born doing...

392
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,211
...that.

393
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:18,506
- Hi, welcome to Kostmart.
- Watch.

394
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,912
Hi! Welcome to Kostmart.

395
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:24,783
Check out our makeup counter
on aisle 1 2B.

396
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:30,156
Welcome to Kostmart. Check out our
CDs. Garth Brooks on sale, aisle 51.

397
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:37,963
Welcome to Kostmart.
Your local gun emporium.

398
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:40,535
Aisle 42, hunting gear.

399
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:43,174
And the next thing I knew,
I was wearing it.

400
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:46,873
- Well, Jane.
- Hey, Veronica.

401
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,513
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

402
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,148
I didn't know
you worked out here.

403
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:55,252
Welcome to Kostmart. I hope
you'll take a trip by the deli today...

404
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,547
...for a complimentary cube
of jalapeño cheddar.

405
00:29:57,723 --> 00:30:01,318
I'm lactose intolerant.
Where do you keep the cigarettes?

406
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,461
Behind the counter.

407
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:06,655
- But I'm not sure that's a good--
- Dick? You missed one.

408
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:12,367
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Wait. Ma'am? Ma'am. Welcome!

409
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:14,699
Here we go. Hi. Hi.

410
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:22,206
My name's Jane, and I'll be your
instructor for beginners' Jin Ku Pow.

411
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:25,646
So let's just get right into it.
Here we go.

412
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,721
We're just going to loosen up
a little bit.

413
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:34,188
Here we go. Yeah.
There we go. And ho. And hit.

414
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,260
Excuse me! Ma'am!

415
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:43,926
And jab. And jab.

416
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,607
- Now I gotcha!
- Get this!

417
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,474
It's punch. And punch.
And step. And kick!

418
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,643
- It burns.
- I saw you eyeballing me...

419
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,014
...when I came in.
You were all up in my goodies.

420
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,020
You know something?
I'm glad you fired me.

421
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:14,655
How's a person supposed to survive
and feed their family on that salary?

422
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:21,372
It's a lease.

423
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:31,014
I don't know why we didn't think
of this before. It's such a good idea.

424
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,583
We're sorry we couldn't pay you.
We have no money.

425
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:36,346
It's okay. Your son
is very important to me.

426
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,319
I would do anything for him,
Mr. Richard.

427
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:43,359
In the meantime, thank you
for letting us pay you in appliances.

428
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:44,517
Yeah.

429
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:48,257
Congratulations.

430
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,695
Hey, think about this:

431
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,033
How many places you'll see
on one tank of gas.

432
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,702
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

433
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,998
Here it is!

434
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,998
We can live without it. People
have lived without these things.

435
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:33,235
- There goes the boxing match.
- You can go to a bar.

436
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,004
It's rigged anyway.

437
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:39,009
What are you doing
with the television?

438
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:47,216
- You're going to sell it!
- No, no. Billy!

439
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:48,586
God! Just go, Dick!

440
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,819
Damn it, Blanca, grab him!

441
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,296
- Papa! Mama!
- Go! Go, go!

442
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,128
- Don't take my Telemundo!
- Go! Go! Hurry, hurry!

443
00:32:57,302 --> 00:33:00,203
Sponge Roberto SquarePantalones!

444
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:04,274
- God! Just go, go, go!
- I want my MTV Latino.

445
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,944
Dick, what are we going to do?

446
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:19,422
We've run out of things to sell.

447
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,749
Well....

448
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,861
- There's always prostitution.
- Dick.

449
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,332
I mean me.

450
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:33,029
We just got to look
for more work, that's all.

451
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:38,108
There is no work, Dick. There's
6000 other people out of work.

452
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,369
Vice presidents are working
at Burger King.

453
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:43,537
It's going to be fine.
All we need is $400...

454
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:47,617
...and we're good for another month.
This is just temporary. So stay calm.

455
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,810
- And don't panic!
- Damn.

456
00:33:57,396 --> 00:34:00,593
Are you going to sit in the dirt hole
all night long?

457
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,333
- Come on, hon., let's get out.
- Yeah.

458
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,733
I'm starting to turn
into a raisin anyway.

459
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,505
What's the matter?
You look sad, Richard.

460
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,341
Blanca, call me Dick.

461
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:17,175
Well, Blanca,
there's just no jobs out there.

462
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,681
I have a cousin who might be able
to help you find some work.

463
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,619
It's not much. But it's something.

464
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,738
I need one guy
who knows how to paint.

465
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:51,143
That's me!

466
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:55,181
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I'm here!

467
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:57,014
Hey, I was here first!

468
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:05,529
Congratulations, güero.
You almost got that one.

469
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,999
Don't worry. There'll be more.

470
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,339
That thing is already starting
to swell up like a balloon.

471
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:16,599
Is it noticeable?

472
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:18,265
- No.
- Just a little bit.

473
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,571
Did you see that?
We should report that guy.

474
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:25,472
Report him!

475
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,245
- We should report him.
- Let's report him.

476
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,819
I do it for you.

477
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,455
This is a new drug
in the same family of Botox.

478
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,490
We don't expect any problems.

479
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,493
Your check for $1 4 is waiting for you
at the front desk...

480
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:43,498
...and we think you are all
going to look beautiful. Okay.

481
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,670
Now, if you can begin
by just filling out those forms.

482
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:48,829
Those are insurance waivers.

483
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:53,307
And then you'll find a list
of various aspects of your face.

484
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,605
Go ahead and check off
anything that you think...

485
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,214
...you might want to improve on
just a little bit.

486
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:03,017
Are deuces still wild?

487
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,249
No.

488
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,422
I'm screwed.

489
00:36:10,195 --> 00:36:14,427
Well, I think I'm going to go, guys.
Carlos. Eduardo. Gustavo.

490
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,061
Pleasure talking to you
the last couple hours.

491
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:20,534
Hey, congratulations
on the baby too.

492
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:24,006
- INS!
- All right, hold it right there.

493
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:26,406
- INS?
- Hold it right there.

494
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:28,443
You're not going anywhere.

495
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,672
- Hold it right there!
- You've got to be kidding.

496
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:31,941
Oh, this is hilarious.

497
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:34,244
You guys know the drill.
Let's see some papers.

498
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:35,909
- Against the wall.
- Papers.

499
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:39,215
Where's my wallet?
Where'd my wallet go? This is--

500
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,258
- No, no. I dropped my wallet.
- Back up.

501
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,486
- Oh, these are doozies.
- What do you got?

502
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:49,066
We got a Don Johnson,
Elvis and Opie Taylor.

503
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,532
- Dick Harper, you're free to go.
- Dick Harper?

504
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:55,833
That's me, Dick Harper. Hey, that
guy's not Dick Harper! Whoa, jeez!

505
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,133
We don't want problems.

506
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,437
You're making a serious mistake
in judgment. I am an American.

507
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:02,375
You got to work on
your accent, Pablo.

508
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,481
Could we--? You want to talk
to my wife, Jane?

509
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:06,913
Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah.
We'll call your wife, "Yane."

510
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:10,316
We'll ask her if you're American.
And we'll call my wife, Yennifer...

511
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:13,321
- ... and his wife, Yaqueline, too.
- It's ringing, it's ringing!

512
00:37:20,098 --> 00:37:23,192
No, wait! I'm an American!
I swear to God!

513
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:25,393
- Hey, watch your language.
- Get in there.

514
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,970
Okay, we have our results.

515
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,803
Negative side effects with only
three of 1 4 participants in the study.

516
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:35,742
- That's not bad. Let's see, now.
- Hello?

517
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,212
- Jill? Hi, Jill.
- Dick, what--?

518
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,510
Oh, honey, I can barely under--

519
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:43,245
What--? Why are you doing
that accent?

520
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,155
Holy hell!

521
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,392
I did this little cosmetics test...

522
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:03,398
...and I had a little reaction.
Is it really that bad?

523
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:07,402
No, it's not so bad.
It's just different.

524
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:09,699
Dick, can we talk about this
some other time?

525
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:11,967
Oh, yeah. Come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go!

526
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:35,292
I got to go in. I got to go to bed.

527
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:38,898
You coming?

528
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:44,502
I think I'm going to sit in the car...

529
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:49,410
...and think for a while.

530
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,108
Okay.

531
00:39:56,421 --> 00:39:59,515
Don't think for too long,
we got to get up early.

532
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:02,853
Soup kitchens stop serving at 8.

533
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,884
You're still pretty.

534
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:47,888
I'm not playing anymore.

535
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,296
I've just about had it!

536
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,638
Sorry.

537
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:11,288
O my God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

538
00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:14,357
It's okay. I'm putting it back.

539
00:42:14,526 --> 00:42:17,359
I'm putting it back! It's okay.

540
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:51,787
Hon, what happened?

541
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:56,290
I got the lawn back.

542
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:58,401
Got the... ?

543
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,081
Oh, Dick.

544
00:43:11,616 --> 00:43:13,140
It's beautiful.

545
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:16,545
Honey.

546
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:23,619
Oh, Dick, I love you.

547
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,729
I love you.

548
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:42,370
Are these too big for my face?

549
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,609
Well, now you look like
the Unabomber.

550
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,181
Good.

551
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:56,479
What are you doing
with Billy's squirt gun?

552
00:44:57,188 --> 00:45:00,123
We followed the rules
and we got screwed.

553
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,623
We were good people,
honest people...

554
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:05,024
...and we got screwed.

555
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,022
Damn it!

556
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:11,200
What are you going to do now,
you going to rob a bank?

557
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:13,997
We got screwed.
Over and over again, hon.

558
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,436
I stole the lawn back,
and you know what happened?

559
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,370
We have a lawn now.

560
00:45:18,676 --> 00:45:21,406
Yeah, but-- Okay.

561
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:23,937
We're all just cavemen...

562
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:26,948
...trying to protect
our little patch of land.

563
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:28,881
Well, now I have a club...

564
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:31,715
...and I'm going to take what I need.

565
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:34,822
Maybe you should steal
some Prozac.

566
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:39,421
Keep laughing, Jane.
Keep laughing, okay?

567
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:40,962
I'll be back soon...

568
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:44,101
- ... with the loot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm coming.

569
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:46,532
- Not going to miss this for the world.
- Suit yourself.

570
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:49,832
Besides, you're going to need
a good wheelman.

571
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:00,874
Okay, that's it, joke's over.
Let's go home.

572
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:02,349
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

573
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,784
- We haven't done the caper yet.
- Wow, okay, you--

574
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,356
Then-- Then let's do it before,
you know...

575
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:09,356
...we die of
carbon-monoxide poisoning.

576
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,392
When you're in there,
get me some Sno-Caps.

577
00:46:11,863 --> 00:46:14,297
Oh, no, no, no, Raisinets,
Raisinets. I want Raisinets.

578
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,560
Hon, your thingamabob.

579
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:21,068
- I know, I know.
- All right.

580
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:26,303
And don't forget
to kill the witnesses, hon.

581
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:29,012
Okay.

582
00:46:40,191 --> 00:46:41,658
Hi.

583
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:20,060
Brain freeze.

584
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:22,826
You ever get that?

585
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:48,858
One Brain freeze. Anything else?

586
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:54,660
Yeah. Yeah, I got something else...

587
00:47:54,832 --> 00:47:56,732
...right here.

588
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:01,564
Hey, Jake, take a break.
I got this one.

589
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:10,309
That'll be 1.29, please.

590
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:25,061
1.29.

591
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:31,026
Go! Jane, go! Just go!

592
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:45,111
Oh, God. You did it?

593
00:48:45,283 --> 00:48:46,773
Oh, there that is.

594
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:50,182
- That was wild. That was wild!
- You actually robbed that place?

595
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:53,380
No, but I had a slushie
and I didn't even pay for it.

596
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:00,255
- What?
- Well, then our problems...

597
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,126
...are pretty much over.

598
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,293
Jane, just drive the car, okay?
We'll find another place, okay?

599
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:15,977
Give me your money!
Garth!

600
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:17,580
Dick?

601
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:21,149
- Oh, my God.
- You remember Jane.

602
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:23,253
- She's in the car.
- Jane?

603
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:24,786
- Hi, Garth.
- Hey, Jane.

604
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:27,254
- Hon, it's-- Garth.
- What's with this?

605
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:31,259
- From the barbeque.
- Harper, what are you--?

606
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:33,021
I had you going there.

607
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:34,994
Had me going?
You scared me to death.

608
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,690
- Yeah, well....
- You're a madman.

609
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:38,767
- We should hang out soon.
- All right.

610
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:41,302
Yeah, you want to hang out
with Garth soon, hon.?

611
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:42,905
- All right.
- All right.

612
00:49:43,074 --> 00:49:45,804
Drive. Just drive. Just drive the car.

613
00:49:45,977 --> 00:49:48,571
- Okay, Dick.
- Okay.

614
00:49:57,755 --> 00:50:00,155
My car's right there.

615
00:50:00,324 --> 00:50:03,816
Get that for you, then. Okay.

616
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:06,122
- Thank you, sonny. Thank you.
- Oh, no, l--

617
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,492
Well, maybe.

618
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:12,894
Okay, stop the car.

619
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:18,539
Now, that place is loaded.

620
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:20,734
They are ripe for the picking.

621
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:24,938
And you are just the guy
for the job.

622
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,846
But seriously, doesn't this remind
you of that movie Heat...

623
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:30,010
- ... with Val Kilmer--?
- I'm trying my best.

624
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:33,623
There's nothing to be ashamed of,
is all I'm saying. Some people....

625
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:37,659
Some people have that robbing thing
and-- And some people don't.

626
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:39,295
Maybe...

627
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:41,522
...you're not a badass.

628
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:46,260
Hey, man. What can I do you for?

629
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:48,371
You can do me for
all the money in the till.

630
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:51,269
- This is a stickup.
- Whoa, what's wrong with you, dude?

631
00:50:51,442 --> 00:50:53,376
I'm married,
that's what's wrong with me.

632
00:50:57,114 --> 00:50:59,048
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

633
00:50:59,216 --> 00:51:02,117
Move it, parquet! Come on, Zigzag.

634
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,945
That's a real gun.
You're robbing me.

635
00:51:05,122 --> 00:51:07,920
- Dick?
- Honey, robe.

636
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,227
Oh, God, okay.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

637
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:14,057
Listen to me. What are you
doing, are you craz--?

638
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:16,256
- What?
- Listen, put your hands down.

639
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:18,800
- He's been stressed.
- Why are you undercutting me?

640
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:21,233
- To be fair, we both--
- I'm trying to rob this man.

641
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:24,602
- We don't need to do this.
- I got a call about the mortgage.

642
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:28,905
If we don't pay tomorrow, the sheriff's
coming to put us out on the street.

643
00:51:30,414 --> 00:51:32,814
Get the money out of
there right now, I mean it!

644
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:35,713
- Pull it out, put it in a sack! Let's go!
- Easy, hon.

645
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:38,377
- God! Oh, God!
- Come on.

646
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,688
Wow, that's fantastic.
Women are amazing, aren't they?

647
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,225
It's just like jelly jars.

648
00:51:44,395 --> 00:51:47,193
Whoa, hon.! Hon!

649
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:49,926
- Look, look.
- Hon?

650
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:53,002
- What?
- I don't think anybody's following us.

651
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,694
God!

652
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,470
Oh, look out for that.

653
00:52:05,683 --> 00:52:07,651
Oh, park under there.

654
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,790
Oh, my God.

655
00:52:19,964 --> 00:52:23,593
- I can't believe we just did that.
- But we did do it.

656
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,792
We did do it.

657
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:40,584
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

658
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,916
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

659
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:45,920
Exactly. And you know, maybe
we can figure out a way we can...

660
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,490
...give back some of what
we've taken to other people.

661
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:50,991
Maybe we will.
It's a definite possibility.

662
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:52,629
Want to grab a cup of coffee?

663
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:55,390
- Iced mocha sounds nice.
- Yeah.

664
00:52:56,333 --> 00:53:00,292
All right, this is a holdup. Get on
the ground and you won't get hurt.

665
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,098
Whoa, Jesus. Are you okay, hon.?

666
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:03,501
- I'm okay.
- All right.

667
00:53:03,674 --> 00:53:06,040
You. Two iced mochas, let's go.
Move it, move it.

668
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,973
- Two iced mochas.
- Yeah. Whipped cream.

669
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:10,306
- Whipped cream.
- Any whipped cream, hon., on yours?

670
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:11,709
- No, thanks.
- None on hers.

671
00:53:11,882 --> 00:53:14,874
- No whipped cream.
- Are these non-fat muffins?

672
00:53:15,052 --> 00:53:16,883
- Are they non-fat muffins? !
- I think so.

673
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:19,887
Okay. Hon, these are non-fat
muffins. Get some of those.

674
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:22,821
- Which ones, vanilla or chocolate?
- In the back, in the back.

675
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,221
- This one?
- No, no, that one.

676
00:53:24,395 --> 00:53:26,056
- Front? Honey!
- No, that one. Okay.

677
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,892
Yeah, okay, that's good.
Okay, nobody try to follow us...

678
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:31,591
...because we're desperate criminals.
We're crazy people!

679
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:34,067
And I'll kill you all!

680
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:37,036
- Oh, hon., the coffee. Coffee.
- Oh, yeah, right.

681
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:40,042
Thanks a lot.

682
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:46,379
What are you doing in there?

683
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,211
What do you think?

684
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,850
- It's Elvis on a motorcycle?
- It's Evil Knievel, hon.

685
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,184
I like the way it makes my butt look.

686
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:38,494
Honey, where's my car?

687
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:51,914
Mercedes, off.

688
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:03,591
Now I can watch soccer!

689
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:07,253
No matter what happens,
know that I love you.

690
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:09,194
I love you too.

691
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:11,095
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

692
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:14,203
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

693
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:28,712
Oh, my God.

694
00:55:28,886 --> 00:55:31,719
This guy's really loaded.

695
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,981
That's a lot of lettuce.

696
00:55:37,728 --> 00:55:39,855
Should we pistol-whip him?

697
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,694
Hey, don't laugh.

698
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:49,395
Don't you laugh now, okay?

699
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,000
Because it demeans
what we're doing here.

700
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:53,803
Yeah.

701
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:00,013
- Anyway, shall we?
- Let's do it.

702
00:56:00,184 --> 00:56:01,845
- What--? What is that?
- Nothing.

703
00:56:02,953 --> 00:56:04,750
Don't do anything funny, or else.

704
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:11,383
You could pay the ultimate price.

705
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:40,185
Honey, come on, cut the crap.

706
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,948
Okay.

707
00:56:47,164 --> 00:56:49,098
We sound so funny.

708
00:56:49,266 --> 00:56:52,064
I know. That's what I was thinking.

709
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:54,630
Oh, my God.

710
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,732
Hel--

711
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:14,313
Did you guys hear what happened
to Bob Bluestein?

712
00:57:14,992 --> 00:57:16,186
- Bob Bluestein?
- Yeah.

713
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,420
- Who's Bob Bluestein?
- Oh, he works at Sonent Global.

714
00:57:19,596 --> 00:57:22,190
Or should I say he worked
at Sonent Global.

715
00:57:22,366 --> 00:57:24,891
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and if they're not careful...

716
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,899
...they'll become
the next Pyramid Tech.

717
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,561
Absolutely. Absolutely.

718
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,332
Oh, Dick...

719
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:33,703
...what you been up to since
Glob dyne went under?

720
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:36,778
Just working at home,
playing in the stock market.

721
00:57:36,947 --> 00:57:38,744
I tell you, guys...

722
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,613
- ... it's like stealing money.
- You're on fire, Dick.

723
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:51,852
- Last job, try to stay focused.
- Okay.

724
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:55,557
- Let me hold that door for you, ma'am.
- Why, thank you.

725
00:57:55,732 --> 00:57:57,324
You're welcome.

726
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:01,468
Oh, my goodness.
This woman has fainted.

727
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:04,439
- Are you all right?
- You might want to open her blouse...

728
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:05,836
...so she can...

729
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,442
- ... breathe.
- Right.

730
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:10,444
- Oh, no, no, no, no, l--
- You okay?

731
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:16,419
Oh, no.

732
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:18,945
That's good.

733
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,782
- Let me get back to you. Excuse me.
- Yes?

734
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,286
- May I help you?
- Vault inspector.

735
00:58:26,063 --> 00:58:29,226
- What happened to Phil?
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

736
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:31,424
Caused by
an invasive streptococcus.

737
00:58:32,102 --> 00:58:33,501
What?

738
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,399
Flesh-eating disorder.

739
00:58:35,572 --> 00:58:37,597
It's all over the money.

740
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:40,140
Might want to wash your hands.

741
00:58:52,656 --> 00:58:54,988
- Everybody down!
- This is a robbery!

742
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:58,389
- No way!
- Freeze, everybody.

743
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,325
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

744
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:09,028
- Oh, no.
- Nobody move a muscle.

745
00:59:09,206 --> 00:59:11,868
You. Whiskers, whiskers.
On the floor.

746
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,509
Oh, Dick.

747
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:15,338
I will blow those whiskers...

748
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:17,104
- ... right off your face!
- I'm down!

749
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:20,045
- Go get the money, please.
- You're-- You're money, I'm guns...

750
00:59:20,217 --> 00:59:22,947
- ... that's the plan.
- Put your weapons down.

751
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,247
- Oh, shit.
- Stick to the plan, stick to the plan.

752
00:59:25,422 --> 00:59:29,017
- I'm putting the weapon down.
- Bring it on, pigs!

753
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:31,126
- Honey.
- What are you doing?

754
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:33,786
Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick.
Run, Dick, run.

755
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:36,057
- You coward!
- Stay on the ground.

756
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:38,758
- Whoa, boy.
- You quitter!

757
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:42,030
- I'm cuffed! I'm cuffed!
- You filthy pig.

758
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:43,832
- I'm sorry.
- Bring it on.

759
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:46,475
- Bring it on, I'll take on all of you!
- Oz?

760
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:49,874
- Hon, get the car! Get the car!
- Debbie.

761
00:59:51,415 --> 00:59:52,882
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, Dick.

762
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,711
Honey.

763
00:59:57,554 --> 00:59:59,351
Oh, thank God.

764
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:00,857
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

765
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:01,824
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

766
01:00:01,992 --> 01:00:04,051
... former employees
of now-defunct Glob dyne...

767
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:06,218
... were charged
with armed robbery...

768
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:11,060
- ... after holding up a local branch...
- Dick. Dick, that could have been us.

769
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,565
What were we thinking?

770
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:16,672
- and turned to crime as a result
of their sudden unemployment,

771
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:20,538
Like this woman, Naomi Seiler,
a human-resources manager...

772
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,874
... caught last May managing
a different kind of resource:

773
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:27,744
220 kilos of Canada 's
finest marijuana,

774
01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:32,077
I knew her. She always remembered
everybody's birthday.

775
01:00:32,255 --> 01:00:35,986
Or this man, Mark Fish,
a former VP of Glob dyne, , ,

776
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,719
... who was arrested after using
his home as the setting...

777
01:00:38,895 --> 01:00:40,863
... for secret high-stakes cockfights,

778
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:44,592
Mark Fish? He was such a nice guy.

779
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:46,599
Glob dyne CFO
Frank Bascombe...

780
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,898
...starts serving his 18-month
prison term next week,

781
01:00:50,073 --> 01:00:53,008
- Eighteen months? That's nothing.
- Bastard.

782
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:55,303
- -trying to incriminate
Jack McAllister,

783
01:00:55,479 --> 01:00:58,642
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't think I got away with anything,

784
01:00:58,815 --> 01:01:01,841
The collapse of Glob dyne
hurt me financially and personally...

785
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:05,978
... just like any other employee,
I'm sick about it,

786
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,881
I'm et up about it,

787
01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:12,856
Now watch this shot,

788
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,395
Did I get him?

789
01:01:19,236 --> 01:01:20,464
- Now you did,
- Great,

790
01:01:20,637 --> 01:01:22,070
Look at that guy.

791
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,936
Everybody's in hell,
he's on vacation shooting stuff.

792
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:29,601
Man, I hope every one of these
bastards get what they deserve.

793
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,771
Prosecutors say next
to be indicted will be...

794
01:01:31,948 --> 01:01:34,075
... company spin doctor Dick Harper,

795
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:36,918
- Harper gave misleading statements...
- What? Indicted?

796
01:01:37,087 --> 01:01:39,885
... about Glob dyne’s finances
one minute before the company...

797
01:01:40,057 --> 01:01:42,355
- Indicted?
- That's not fair. They made you...

798
01:01:42,526 --> 01:01:44,323
...go on that show.

799
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:46,758
You hear what they said?
I'm going to be indicted.

800
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,364
- But you only said what they told you.
- Indicted, Jane!

801
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:52,161
Indicted. I'm going to be indicted.

802
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:53,893
- Wait, it's going to be--
- Indicted!

803
01:01:54,071 --> 01:01:55,902
- Honey-- Dick--
- Indicted!

804
01:01:56,073 --> 01:01:57,301
- Honey--
- Gonne be indicted!

805
01:01:57,474 --> 01:02:00,443
Hold it, they can't--
It's going to be okay. Just calm down.

806
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:04,444
I can't calm down,
I'm going to be indicted. Indicted!

807
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:07,514
I'm going to be indicted!

808
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:10,009
Indicted!

809
01:02:11,288 --> 01:02:13,688
I'm going to be indicted!

810
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:15,791
Be indicted!

811
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:27,700
You know, I haven't seen you
in the downtown club for a while, sir.

812
01:02:28,905 --> 01:02:32,671
Well, that's because
I was very, very busy...

813
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:35,243
...being indicted.

814
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,561
Look at all the executives.

815
01:02:55,398 --> 01:03:00,028
You guys are my kind of peeps.

816
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:03,969
Captains of industry,
masters of the universe...

817
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:08,441
...presidents of Hair Club for Men.
That's a nice piece of hair.

818
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:11,376
You can't even see the tread marks.

819
01:03:12,182 --> 01:03:15,709
This squirrel died of natural causes.

820
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:19,617
Excuse me, pardon me.

821
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:26,962
I got to get to the "toppy tip"
of the financial summit.

822
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,223
Isn't anyone going to do anything?

823
01:03:29,399 --> 01:03:32,766
This happens every week.
This guy actually isn't that bad.

824
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:38,798
I'm a corporate puppet.

825
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:42,307
And I'm going to need
some more string...

826
01:03:42,479 --> 01:03:45,778
...so I can go on believing
I'll be a real boy someday...

827
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:48,645
- ... without being manipulated...
- No, no, no, I got it.

828
01:03:48,819 --> 01:03:50,650
...by the bullshit!

829
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:53,153
Oh, my God, Dick.
Come down from there.

830
01:03:57,227 --> 01:04:01,687
Hon, I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting.

831
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:05,392
Sweetie, you're standing on a table
pretending to be a puppet.

832
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:07,366
Who's pretending?

833
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:13,301
- Couldn't you have just cut him off?
- He only had half a beer.

834
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:24,009
Dick, hi. Long time no see.

835
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:30,793
- Frank! Frank!
- I'm going to get him. Just--

836
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:36,592
Frank, where are you going?

837
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:40,528
- Dick!
- Come on, Frank.

838
01:04:40,704 --> 01:04:44,333
I just want to have a talk.

839
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:46,741
Hey there, Frankie.

840
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:50,277
How do you like those
eggs Florentine?

841
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:53,575
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, it was Jack.

842
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,081
It was Jack.

843
01:04:55,252 --> 01:04:57,914
He siphoned off
all of Glob dyne’s assets...

844
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:01,489
...and then he dumped the stock.
It was his plan from the beginning.

845
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,682
Son of a bitch!

846
01:05:03,994 --> 01:05:05,518
That fucker!

847
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:08,755
- Hon, language.
- She's right.

848
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:10,364
When you get out of prison...

849
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:12,728
...you'll get $20 million
to keep your mouth shut.

850
01:05:12,936 --> 01:05:15,803
No, 1 0. You think
I could have gotten 20?

851
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:17,764
You son of a b--

852
01:05:17,941 --> 01:05:20,171
- You'll break-- Dick.
- I want him.

853
01:05:20,343 --> 01:05:23,073
- Let go.
- Don't you think I feel terrible?

854
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:25,544
Why do you think I'm drinking
myself to death?

855
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:29,151
Instead of drinking, why don't
you do something about it.

856
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:33,050
Yeah, Frank. Sometimes the cure
is a clean conscience.

857
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:38,194
- That is good.
- Thanks, hon.

858
01:05:38,361 --> 01:05:40,261
- I just thought of it.
- You did?

859
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,330
- Yeah.
- You're right.

860
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:44,490
You're right. Help me up.
Help me up.

861
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:47,762
Yeah, help me up.
I got to think of something.

862
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:50,265
Okay, just give me a minute.
Just give me--

863
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,340
Hey.

864
01:05:52,509 --> 01:05:54,170
Hey!

865
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:02,015
- Not this time, Frank.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

866
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:06,246
It's force of habit.
I know a way. I know a way.

867
01:06:07,624 --> 01:06:11,321
But it's really, really risky.

868
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:13,890
That's where Jack keeps it.

869
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:17,295
Four hundred million in
highly liquid U.S. bearer bonds.

870
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:21,198
So it's a vault job. Go in after
midnight, bypass security...

871
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:23,430
...and... power tools.

872
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:25,801
- It's a little simpler than that.
- Power tools?

873
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:30,777
Jack's going to have to take those
bonds out of the safe-deposit box,

874
01:06:30,947 --> 01:06:32,346
That should be fun for him,

875
01:06:32,515 --> 01:06:33,777
Here's my babies.

876
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,475
So, what's he going to do
with the money?

877
01:06:36,753 --> 01:06:39,085
There it is,
the Grand Cayman Bank.

878
01:06:39,255 --> 01:06:40,882
Grand Cayman. What is this place?

879
01:06:41,091 --> 01:06:43,218
It's where rich people
go to evade taxes,

880
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:44,860
- Bastards,
- Honey,

881
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:47,394
They can't hear us, What's next?

882
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:50,162
McAllister takes the bonds
to a representative...

883
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:53,530
... who asks him for his signature
to verify what they call "membership, "

884
01:06:53,703 --> 01:06:55,568
Once the bonds are counted
and confirmed...

885
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:58,708
... McAllister will receive
a CRM-114 deposit form...

886
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:01,309
... and on this form
he inputs his account number...

887
01:07:01,478 --> 01:07:04,538
... that only he and the bank know,
Then the agent will take this...

888
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:07,205
...to an authorization officer
for further verification.

889
01:07:07,384 --> 01:07:10,376
Once the representative has stamped
and initialled the document...

890
01:07:10,553 --> 01:07:12,987
... the account rep will take
the CRM- 1 14...

891
01:07:13,156 --> 01:07:16,853
... back to McAllister for final
approval before finalization,

892
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:18,858
You said this was
going to be simple.

893
01:07:19,262 --> 01:07:21,822
Can you explain it again?
Jane doesn't seem to understand.

894
01:07:21,998 --> 01:07:25,399
- Jane, it's simple. It's so simple.
- Jeez.

895
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:27,160
Now, listen.

896
01:07:27,337 --> 01:07:29,498
All we have to do...

897
01:07:30,707 --> 01:07:34,905
... is switch McAllister’s CRM-114
with his account number...

898
01:07:35,078 --> 01:07:36,545
... with one of our own,

899
01:07:36,713 --> 01:07:38,613
- I'm so sorry.
- A copy that we have made...

900
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:43,412
...that has a number from an account
that I have established.

901
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:47,852
And Jack sends the 400 million
to us without knowing it.

902
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:49,924
That's-- You got it. It's so simple.

903
01:07:50,093 --> 01:07:52,220
That is beautiful. It's a switch.

904
01:07:52,395 --> 01:07:53,885
- It's a switch,
- It's a switch,

905
01:07:54,064 --> 01:07:55,656
- It's a switch.
- That's so sexy, man.

906
01:07:55,832 --> 01:07:59,063
- That's unbelievable. It'll be fun.
- But Jane's going to have to do it.

907
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:03,103
Because if McAllister sees either
one of us, he'll know something's up.

908
01:08:03,273 --> 01:08:06,401
- And l... ?
- Do nothing.

909
01:08:07,977 --> 01:08:10,002
I can do that.

910
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:12,776
Yeah.

911
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:14,314
Okay.

912
01:08:14,484 --> 01:08:16,884
- You do it, then. You're the one.
- Yeah.

913
01:08:17,053 --> 01:08:18,520
Yeah.

914
01:08:20,824 --> 01:08:22,655
- You could do it, except--
- No, it's good.

915
01:08:22,826 --> 01:08:24,760
No, you do it. You do it. You do it.

916
01:08:24,928 --> 01:08:26,828
- You deserve to do it.
- Honey--

917
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:35,637
Are you ready to make the switch?
Do you have the form?

918
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:38,433
- It's right here.
- We should practice the move.

919
01:08:38,608 --> 01:08:39,973
- No, I got it.
- Okay, fine.

920
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,441
I won't be involved.
I won't participate at all.

921
01:08:42,612 --> 01:08:45,103
- You do it. It's all you.
- Let's do one for good luck.

922
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,681
I got dressed up.
You're not doing me any favours.

923
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:50,285
- Get out of the car!
- I just think it's important.

924
01:08:50,453 --> 01:08:52,080
That's all.

925
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:56,357
Okay, I'll be the bank representative.
And you be you.

926
01:08:58,895 --> 01:09:01,193
Hey. Hey! Wait, sir.

927
01:09:01,364 --> 01:09:03,958
- No! No, no. No!
- Sorry.

928
01:09:08,304 --> 01:09:11,205
- Everybody ready?
- No.

929
01:09:11,741 --> 01:09:15,142
- What?
- Well, Dick lost the form.

930
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:17,108
- So....
- What?

931
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,839
Do you have an extra copy?

932
01:09:20,016 --> 01:09:22,416
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that? !

933
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:24,678
Oh, let me guess, a fifth of Scotch!

934
01:09:25,488 --> 01:09:26,921
You son of a--

935
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,115
Wait. Stop it. Knock it off!

936
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:31,556
My God. Wait a second.
Can we get another one?

937
01:09:31,728 --> 01:09:33,320
Is that possible?
How can we do that?

938
01:09:33,496 --> 01:09:35,361
You know what,
I'm going to take the car...

939
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,363
...and I'm going to try
to delay McAllister.

940
01:09:37,534 --> 01:09:39,695
- He's here. He's here.
- Oh, God.

941
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:43,899
- What are you--?
- I'm going.

942
01:09:51,181 --> 01:09:54,412
That was not cool.

943
01:09:56,619 --> 01:09:58,587
Okay. It's very simple. I got it.

944
01:09:58,755 --> 01:10:00,279
- I got it. It's very simple.
- What?

945
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:03,892
Go into the bank. Go into the office
of the client-relations coordinator.

946
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,757
The document forms are backed up
on her disk, you have to print one out.

947
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:12,334
- Who's this guy? Do I say hello?
- Never mind. Just blow past them.

948
01:10:20,343 --> 01:10:22,277
Quaint.

949
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:25,876
McAllister, 1 2 o'clock.

950
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:29,280
Okay, I'm going to go.
I'm going to go stall him.

951
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,676
- Hon.
- What?

952
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:34,584
How am I supposed to find
the client-relations coordinator?

953
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:36,816
Turn around.

954
01:10:54,577 --> 01:10:58,638
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jack McAllister.

955
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:05,048
- I'm sorry?
- It's me, Deb Fester booth.

956
01:11:16,165 --> 01:11:18,156
- Hi.
- Hi.

957
01:11:19,502 --> 01:11:22,528
Oh, is that the legendary
espresso machine?

958
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:24,233
You want some?

959
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:25,965
- Really, could l?
- Sure, yeah.

960
01:11:26,142 --> 01:11:27,973
- Good to see you.
- From the fundraiser.

961
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:31,944
I am truly sorry,
but I really don't recall you, Miss... ?

962
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:35,482
Fester brook-- Booth. Yes.
No, listen, this is crazy.

963
01:11:35,652 --> 01:11:37,483
You have to remember.

964
01:11:43,526 --> 01:11:46,188
- And here you go.
- Thank you.

965
01:11:46,362 --> 01:11:48,023
Oh, excuse me. That's my phone.

966
01:11:48,197 --> 01:11:49,926
Oh, me too.

967
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:53,599
Grand Cayman Bank,
how may I help you?

968
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,938
Karen Williams, please.

969
01:11:58,241 --> 01:12:00,766
- This is Karen.
- Yes, Mrs. Williams...

970
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:04,640
...this is Officer Red green...

971
01:12:04,814 --> 01:12:07,408
...of the MVPDL.

972
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:11,075
And we've recovered a stolen vehicle
that is registered in your name.

973
01:12:11,254 --> 01:12:13,848
We'd appreciate it if you could
come to the impound lot--

974
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:16,218
What? My car's been stolen?

975
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:20,825
Don't you remember my tattoo
of a green monkey on my ass?

976
01:12:20,997 --> 01:12:23,192
Someone stole my car
right out of the parking lot.

977
01:12:23,366 --> 01:12:24,924
No way.

978
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:36,404
- Yeah.
- It's Dick.

979
01:12:36,713 --> 01:12:37,737
I got it.

980
01:12:39,582 --> 01:12:41,072
- Dick.
- Yeah.

981
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:44,944
Is the client-relations coordinator
a blond woman with a red scarf?

982
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:48,557
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She noticed her car isn't stolen.

983
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:52,456
- What's the account number?
- P-N-5-9-7...

984
01:12:52,628 --> 01:12:54,653
P-N-5-9-7...

985
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:58,398
- ...2-K-4-0.
- 2-4-K--

986
01:12:58,568 --> 01:13:01,002
No, 2-K-4-0.

987
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:07,707
- Oh, my God.
- Got it.

988
01:13:08,544 --> 01:13:11,206
Oh, my God, my car!

989
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:13,281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

990
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:15,576
- I didn't see you there.
- What is wrong with you?

991
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:17,219
What's wrong with me?

992
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:19,514
You're parked
in a handicapped space.

993
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:22,556
- That's not a handicapped space.
- It is now!

994
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,856
Yes!

995
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:52,047
- What are you doing here?
- It's too late.

996
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:54,985
The account rep's authorizing
the CRM-1 1 4 right now.

997
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:56,420
Oh, man!

998
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:04,021
Wait a second.
He's not going back into the room.

999
01:14:05,268 --> 01:14:07,133
- Where is he going?
- I'm going to go down...

1000
01:14:07,303 --> 01:14:10,602
...and get this stamped and initialled.
You stall him.

1001
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:12,941
Oh, I hate stalling!

1002
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:16,670
- Catches my dust.
- Traffic congestion.

1003
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:23,508
Hey, Spence, good to see
you again. How you been?

1004
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,219
Well, thank you.

1005
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:29,247
Will you excuse me for a moment?

1006
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:31,359
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1007
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:34,963
Say, Dick, I'm probably
going to be arrested for DWI...

1008
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:37,622
...so I won't be there
when you get out.

1009
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:40,663
- Can we talk about this later?
- Look what I found in his car.

1010
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,400
I don't wish to discuss this in front
of the branch employees, that's why.

1011
01:14:46,642 --> 01:14:49,941
Nobody likes to be the bad guy, Bill.
But here I am, chopping heads.

1012
01:14:56,552 --> 01:14:59,077
- I already verified--
- I understand the need for layoffs.

1013
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:00,517
I'm concerned about morale.

1014
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:03,158
I'm fine, really. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

1015
01:15:03,793 --> 01:15:06,694
- Madam, can I have my form back?
- What did you just call me?

1016
01:15:06,863 --> 01:15:09,127
I just don't want to start
a bloodbath.

1017
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:11,994
- Can I have my form back?
- Your "form"?

1018
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:16,468
- Is that how you spell your name?
- Why don't I just do this for you, sir.

1019
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:18,766
My form.

1020
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:22,006
You know, there is
one bright light here.

1021
01:15:22,178 --> 01:15:24,806
Spencer, the guy with the
stampy thing, he's top-drawer.

1022
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:26,915
Thank you, sir.

1023
01:15:27,683 --> 01:15:29,241
Dick?

1024
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:30,715
Dick Harper?

1025
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:35,516
Jack McAllister.

1026
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,318
- You just struck me.
- Look what the cat coughed up.

1027
01:15:41,497 --> 01:15:44,830
My gosh, you cut an impressive
swath, I'll tell you that.

1028
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:47,993
- And you smell good too, you devil.
- Just hold on a second.

1029
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,263
What do you say
we put all this behind us.

1030
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:54,000
- Dick, what are you doing here?
- You know, working, mostly, here...

1031
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:56,167
...temporarily, over in Transfers.

1032
01:15:56,345 --> 01:15:58,575
- Okay? Just drop it.
- I heard you left town.

1033
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:03,617
Yeah, I was in Mexico for a while. But
mostly I've been working in Transfers.

1034
01:16:03,786 --> 01:16:05,947
- Oh, I see.
- Poppy cocker.

1035
01:16:06,122 --> 01:16:08,352
I wanted to tell you that
you are my inspiration.

1036
01:16:08,524 --> 01:16:10,958
- There's no hard feelings?
- You did the best you could.

1037
01:16:11,127 --> 01:16:13,755
- That's all anybody could ask for.
- Decent of you to say.

1038
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,522
Like my granddaddy
used to tell me--

1039
01:16:15,698 --> 01:16:17,131
Bye.

1040
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:19,298
It was so great. We did it!

1041
01:16:19,468 --> 01:16:22,699
Mr. McAllister, please.

1042
01:16:24,707 --> 01:16:26,641
I don't know.
I think I made a mistake.

1043
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:28,800
- Are you kidding? You were great!
- No, no, no.

1044
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:30,336
Here we are, sir.

1045
01:16:30,513 --> 01:16:32,447
Days like this,
they make my hands shake.

1046
01:16:32,615 --> 01:16:34,276
- Know what I'm saying?
- I can imagine.

1047
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,216
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. What is he doing?

1048
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:40,445
We got one situation here,
now, fells...

1049
01:16:40,623 --> 01:16:42,921
...which is that that number wrong.

1050
01:16:43,092 --> 01:16:44,491
That's incorrect right there.

1051
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:48,956
- Did he see us?
- I have no idea.

1052
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:50,894
I think he saw you.

1053
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:54,359
I think he saw you.

1054
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:56,402
You were sticking your big head
out there.

1055
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:59,871
I got to hit the road here, fells,
so I'm going to sign this for you...

1056
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:01,839
- ... then you going to change it.
- Yes.

1057
01:17:02,011 --> 01:17:04,980
Oh, man. You know,
this is really not the time.

1058
01:17:05,147 --> 01:17:07,911
This is really not the time.
Oh, God, he's coming.

1059
01:17:08,084 --> 01:17:10,382
- He's coming, hon.
- Okay.

1060
01:17:11,854 --> 01:17:14,254
Jack, hey. It was great seeing you.

1061
01:17:14,757 --> 01:17:17,521
- Where's Frank Bascombe?
- Come again?

1062
01:17:18,227 --> 01:17:20,252
You didn't think I'd catch that,
now, did you?

1063
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,565
- What do you mean?
- Here's what you're going to do.

1064
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:26,099
You're going to turn around
and march out of here now.

1065
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:28,202
You're going to take Goldilocks
there with you.

1066
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:32,740
And I won't put the two of you
in prison for a very long time.

1067
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,610
Actually, honey, I think that sounds
pretty good. I think....

1068
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,407
I think we should take it,
you know.

1069
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:41,476
You think so, hon.?

1070
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:42,879
I do.

1071
01:17:47,056 --> 01:17:49,490
- Because I don't.
- Dick Harper.

1072
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:53,818
I've been terminated, bankrupted,
deported and blackmailed...

1073
01:17:53,996 --> 01:17:55,588
...because of you.

1074
01:17:55,765 --> 01:17:59,064
And I'm not leaving here
without your money.

1075
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:06,738
What you going to do, Dick?
Shoot me if I don't approve that form?

1076
01:18:09,412 --> 01:18:11,346
Write me a check.

1077
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:17,317
- You are kidding me.
- Dick, it's not going to do us any good.

1078
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:20,421
He's just going to cancel it
the minute we walk out of here.

1079
01:18:20,589 --> 01:18:22,489
I don't care.

1080
01:18:22,658 --> 01:18:24,455
I don't care.

1081
01:18:24,627 --> 01:18:27,653
I'm not walking out of this bank
empty-handed.

1082
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:35,333
All right. All right, Dick,
I'm going to write you a check.

1083
01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:38,735
- I'm going to need my hand back.
- Gladly.

1084
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:43,767
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm going to write you that check.

1085
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:46,210
And what's more,
I'm not going to cancel it.

1086
01:18:46,382 --> 01:18:48,475
Because I think it takes
a lot of cojones...

1087
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:52,348
...to do what you two have done
here today. And I admire that.

1088
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:53,988
So...

1089
01:18:55,558 --> 01:18:57,253
...here you go.

1090
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:01,096
Just a little something to show you
what I think you're worth.

1091
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:11,466
Y'all take care, now.

1092
01:19:16,345 --> 01:19:19,041
Dick, honey...

1093
01:19:20,082 --> 01:19:22,812
...give me the squirt gun, okay?

1094
01:19:27,857 --> 01:19:30,087
Do you still have
McAllister’s form?

1095
01:19:31,026 --> 01:19:32,288
Why?

1096
01:19:35,498 --> 01:19:37,898
Because I just got his signature.

1097
01:19:42,838 --> 01:19:44,999
Weren't you an art major?

1098
01:19:47,009 --> 01:19:50,103
Dick Harper! I had no idea
what you were doing.

1099
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:53,840
I was completely fooled.
My God, I didn't know you could act.

1100
01:19:54,016 --> 01:19:56,985
Hon, in 1 0th grade I played Biff
in Death of a Salesman.

1101
01:19:57,153 --> 01:19:58,745
- Come on.
- That's just--

1102
01:19:59,455 --> 01:20:01,719
See the way I got
my eyes watering up?

1103
01:20:01,891 --> 01:20:05,657
Yes, sir. It's all right there.

1104
01:20:06,295 --> 01:20:08,763
I am married to a genius.

1105
01:20:08,931 --> 01:20:10,455
It's a turn-on, isn't it?

1106
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:13,466
- You're a criminal.
- I'm a hardened criminal.

1107
01:20:14,537 --> 01:20:19,031
Hon, first we need
to talk to Spencer.

1108
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:21,639
Right.

1109
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:32,076
Are you in the habit of signing things
without looking at them?

1110
01:20:36,225 --> 01:20:38,193
Miss Sheinkopf?

1111
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:43,126
Miss Sheinkopf,
I'm going to be home by 6.

1112
01:20:57,446 --> 01:21:00,006
- Mr. McAllister!
- Jack!

1113
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:03,246
- Mr. McAllister!
- Mr. McAllister!

1114
01:21:03,419 --> 01:21:06,582
We're all waiting for you over here,
Jack. Everybody's really pumped.

1115
01:21:06,755 --> 01:21:08,416
Come on!

1116
01:21:09,058 --> 01:21:10,582
Is this some kind of a joke, Dick?

1117
01:21:10,759 --> 01:21:12,556
Are you still trying
to get even with me?

1118
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:14,719
Why would I get even
with such a generous man?

1119
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:17,923
I still can't believe you did that.
Jane and I were way off base.

1120
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,627
- He's on in 20, right? Hook him up.
- Wait, on what?

1121
01:21:21,804 --> 01:21:23,066
Sam Samuels. Money Life.

1122
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,868
Oh, and here are some
suggested responses.

1123
01:21:30,713 --> 01:21:32,476
Live to Southern California,
where...

1124
01:21:32,648 --> 01:21:35,742
... in a stunning act of personal
generosity, Jack McAllister...

1125
01:21:35,918 --> 01:21:38,409
Who the hell do you think you are?

1126
01:21:38,587 --> 01:21:40,521
I'm your
VP of Communications, Jack.

1127
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:43,590
- -personally funded the defunct
corporation's pension fund,

1128
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:46,394
You said I just did what?

1129
01:21:46,562 --> 01:21:49,622
God, I love this guy,

1130
01:21:49,798 --> 01:21:55,100
But seriously, Jack,
what made you do it?

1131
01:21:55,271 --> 01:22:00,208
Well, l-- Sam, l....

1132
01:22:12,321 --> 01:22:16,189
I realized, Sam, that since
the employees of Glob dyne...

1133
01:22:16,358 --> 01:22:20,590
...had given me so much, it was time
for me to give back to them.

1134
01:22:20,763 --> 01:22:25,200
So yesterday, I wire-transferred...

1135
01:22:25,367 --> 01:22:27,232
...$400 million...

1136
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:31,063
...into the newly created
Glob dyne Pension Relief Fund.

1137
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:33,969
Oh, yeah!

1138
01:22:39,348 --> 01:22:42,374
Let's look at what happened when
the first ex-Glob dyne employees...

1139
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:44,485
... received their shares of money,

1140
01:22:44,653 --> 01:22:47,986
Many people had their life savings
invested in the company...

1141
01:22:48,157 --> 01:22:51,126
...and were delighted to learn
their pensions had been returned,

1142
01:22:51,293 --> 01:22:53,727
It is the first time
in U, S, corporate history...

1143
01:22:53,896 --> 01:22:57,730
... that a CEO has personally funded
a bankrupted pension plan,

1144
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,835
This incredible gesture won't soon
be forgotten by the people...

1145
01:23:01,003 --> 01:23:03,494
... whose lives it has
so dramatically affected,

1146
01:23:03,672 --> 01:23:05,071
And this is just the beginning,

1147
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,141
In the coming months, thousands
more will be receiving a check...

1148
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:11,837
... for the full value of their
lost pensions and life savings,

1149
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:16,012
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1150
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:18,550
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1151
01:23:18,721 --> 01:23:20,882
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1152
01:23:21,056 --> 01:23:23,217
You hear that? They love you, Jack.

1153
01:23:23,392 --> 01:23:25,257
- Now, go to hell.
- Mr. McAllister...

1154
01:23:25,427 --> 01:23:27,725
...do you consider yourself
a modern-day Robin Hood?

1155
01:23:27,896 --> 01:23:30,865
- Does this mean you're off the hook?
- Do you want to save the whales?

1156
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,599
Now, hang on a minute.

1157
01:23:38,273 --> 01:23:40,537
Have you decided to contribute
to the homeless?

1158
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:42,677
What made you so gracious?

1159
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,209
Mr. McAllister,
how do you feel right now?

1160
01:23:46,382 --> 01:23:49,215
Mr. McAllister, how about giving
a brother a buck?

1161
01:23:52,254 --> 01:23:54,882
Look at our beautiful family.

1162
01:23:59,828 --> 01:24:01,989
My name is Dick Harper.

1163
01:24:09,271 --> 01:24:12,729
- I agree.
- Hey, Harpers, stick them up!

1164
01:24:12,908 --> 01:24:14,500
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Garth.

1165
01:24:14,676 --> 01:24:16,007
How you doing, Garth?

1166
01:24:16,178 --> 01:24:18,408
Great. Hey, how do you like
the new wheels?

1167
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,980
- Nice.
- Hooked up with a new company.

1168
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:22,742
- Great benefits.
- Yeah?

1169
01:24:22,918 --> 01:24:25,352
Yeah. They trade energy.
It's called Enron.
