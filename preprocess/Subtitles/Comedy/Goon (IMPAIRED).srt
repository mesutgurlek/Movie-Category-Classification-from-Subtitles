I've told him about you
and I think you can help him out.

It all starts with this player
he's got there, Xavier Laflamme.

Holy shit, could this guy dance
with a puck

and he could put
that cocksucker away too.

He's 100 % pure, natural scorer.

205

He ends up going number two
overall and Montreal grabs him.

The pressure's starting to mount
on this kid and he can't hack it.

He's missing practices,
hanging with the wrong people.

This is not some league where the

Well, that was borderline
treasonous

308
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,018
and a disgrace to our nation

309
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,147
and its proud and storied history.
My father didn't kick the Nazis...

310
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,902
And the puck drops. Faceoff win
by Hamilton. Chipped back to Hall.

Here's Jefferson of the Steelers.
Takes the shot.

- Don't pinch!

Halifax pinches in.

319
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,430
Johnson gets it over.
Here's the shot. He scores!

320

That's a Hamilton goal.

- It's not gay.
- Not if you're brothers.

If you're brothers it's gay
with a dash or something else.

My brother's gay
and he doesn't even do that.

Going through a divorce.
She wants all my money now.

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,409
Well, I guess it's kind of weird,
giving you these flowers.

609
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,494
Oh, man.

610
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,706
- Chocolates.
- Oh!

611
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,042
And this stuffed animal. It's a doll.

612
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,463
It's not really a stuffed animal.
It's a stuffed Angus.

613
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,383
It's the mascot of the team I play for,
the Halifax Highlanders.

614
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,844
It's a little toy.

615
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,763
But it's official.

616
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,600
- Fuck's sake.
- No it's hilarious.

617
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,896
It's a simple misunderstanding.
I'm fine.

618
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,483
- Okay. Bye, Eva.
- Bye, Doug.

619
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,361
It's official, the mascot.

620
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,281
Fuck.

621
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,081
What...?

622
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,667
Oh...

623
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:48,134
Fuck me, Angus.

624
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,471
(DOUG) It's not the first time
that wind blew garbage in my face.

625
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,225
My friends built this bike ramp
behind the medical centre.

626
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,436
I was pedalling fast
and as I was going up the ramp,

627
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,023
the wind blew these like bloody rags
right into my face.

628
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:06,027
I crashed into the dumpster
and I was rolling around in medical waste

629
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:10,407
because I was so disoriented.
I broke my ankle in three places.

630
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,201
The worst part was
there was a big bag of pee

631
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,663
and I rolled over on it
and it like burst all over me.

632
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,464
- You think it's funny, too?
- Yes, very much so.

633
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,300
Garbage blows in my face sometimes.

634
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,684
Thanks for the ride.
It was good to see you.

635
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,438
Doug...

636
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,995
Right. My boyfriend.

637
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,124
- Bye, Eva.
- Bye, Doug.

646
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,888
Douglas Manacham Glatt!

647
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,184
Prrt! Prrr! Pretzel, bitches!

648
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,729
- Hey, what the hell?
- Recognize.

649
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:09,192
- Of course I recognize you.
- Do you recognize your family?

650
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,194
My God! I'm so happy.

651
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,114
Glatt, what are you doing?
Start skating, shave some ice.

652
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,618
- Love you guys.
- We love you, Dougie!

653
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,704
(DAD) Hey, he can skate.

654
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,749
- (MUM) His shirt says Glatt.
- (PAT) It says your fucking name.

655
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,212
- Language. Do you mind, Pat?
- He can't stop. It's like Tourette's.

656
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,674
- Hey, do you want a go?
- Yeah, okay.

657
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,093
- Good luck, man.
- You, too, buddy.

658
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,513
- Puck drops and we got something.
- Oh...!

659
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,182
Kiss his fucking ass, Dougie!

660
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,398
Punch for a punch,
neither giving an inch...

661
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,441
- Wow.
- Right, left, right, left.

662
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,278
- Nail him, Doug.
- Landing blows to the head,

663
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,613
to the body, everywhere.

664
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,450
- Oh, my fuck!
- Oh, God.

665
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,997
Easy, okay, easy!

666
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,374
- Good fight, man.
- Good fight.

667
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,167
He's a nice guy.

668
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,671
(CROWD) Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

669
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,548
Do you hear that?

670
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,889
Just a minute four left.
The score's tied.

671
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,852
Everything on the line as Halifax look
to extend their wins to four.

672
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,439
Now a three on one develops
as Kim moves in.

673
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,482
- Kim lets the shot go...
- Ow!

674
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,484
- He scores!
- (HOOTER)

675
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,946
It was Doug Glatt in the conservatory
with his ass.

676
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,868
And the young gun from Orangetown
they call The Thug has done it.

677
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,786
Whoo! Shit!

678
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,458
The Highlanders might just make a run
for the playoffs after all.

679
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,127
You make me happy, man,
with your ass!

680
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,463
- My ass.
- With your ass!

681
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:06,684
Well done, boys. Tonight, good food,
good women, good rest.

682
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,686
Not necessarily in that order.

683
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:13,024
Glatt, Laflamme, get changed,
in my office.

684
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,568
Good job, boys.
See you tomorrow morning.

685
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,154
Way to go, Dougie!
This boy popped the cherry tonight.

686
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,531
Popped my cherry.
What does that mean?

687
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,827
- Boys.
- Coach.

688
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,165
One of you has really been
impressing me with your play lately

689
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,084
and one of you hasn't.

690
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,753
Want to venture a guess
as to who's who?

691
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,801
Well, Laflamme, I'm ripping that A
off your jersey.

692
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,262
You don't deserve it,
unless A stands for asshole.

693
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,224
Glatt, you're promoted.
Assistant captain.

694
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,434
Good on you.
Keep up the good work.

695
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,355
- There's the puck. I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Coach.

696
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,983
Xavier, you can take this the right way
or the wrong way.

697
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,778
Ladies' choice.

698
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,988
Xavier!

699
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,033
- Go get him.
- Hey, bud, wait up!

700
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,327
Oh, my God! You scored!

701
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:11,708
With your fucking ass, you scored?
You son of a bitch. Look at you!

702
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,503
You'll love this. I know how you like
Middle Eastern food.

703
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,006
And Uncle Stevie, he's a good friend.
He's very robust.

704
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,218
Holy fucking shitass, Dougie,
you fucking scored?

705
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,513
You just fisted that motherfucker
right in the ass.

706
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,057
Fuck, I'm so sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.

707
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,893
- There he is! There's the guy.
- Hey!

708
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,730
Dougie, my friend, good to see you as
always, eh?

709
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,859
That's my top customer right there.
Five times a week I see you, right?

710
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:42,655
I watched this guy fight three guys,
knock out all their teeth.

711
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,325
Three guys! Four teeth! One game.
It was unbelievable.

712
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,496
I'm so excited! Fuck it!
Doner on the house tonight.

713
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,124
- (CHEERING)
- For you, anything.

714
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,587
Doner sauce on the house, everybody,
don't get excited.

715
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,382
- Hey!
- Okay, the sauce.

716
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,925
Water down the sauce.

717
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,595
So could we get anything
for this on eBay?

718
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:11,058
I don't think so. No, I wanted to give it to
Mom and Dad, if they wanted it.

719
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,270
Seeing it's just...

720
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,315
Here.

721
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:23,279
Douglas, it's good to see that you're
having fun with this, you know, hobby.

722
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,740
It's not a hobby, it's my job.

723
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,826
I'm a hockey player.

724
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,454
Have you thought
about the head injuries

725
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,540
that come with such a violent sport,
the concussions?

726
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,335
- How long do you think you can do it?
- Mom...

727
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,172
It's an infantile way for a man to spend
his adult years.

728
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,634
- No, it isn't.
- You can do anything.

729
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,886
- No, I couldn't.
- You could teach.

730
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,430
I can't, okay?

731
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,433
I can't because I'm stupid. I'm stupid.

732
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,770
- Doug, you're not that stupid.
- I am.

733
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,816
I'm stupid. You're gay.
I'm stupid, he's gay.

734
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,484
- Stupid, gay.
- We get it.

735
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,569
- Stupid, gay.
- Okay.

736
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,780
You have one stupid son
and a gay son.

737
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,740
- Oh, God.
- For once in my life,

738
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,617
I'm a part of something.

739
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:14,163
I get to wear a uniform that doesn't have
"Security" on it.

740
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,501
Kids buy it and they wear it
and it's got our name on it.

741
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,715
For whatever reason you guys think that
I can be smart enough to be a doctor.

742
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,928
I have fist smarts.
I can fight. I'm strong.

743
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,513
I could protect people.

744
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,559
That's who I am, it's what I do,
and you should be proud of me.

745
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,354
We should be proud of you?
They call you Thug, for Christ's sake.

746
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,776
It might as well say "Security"
on the back of your sweater. Excuse me.

747
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,411
- Doug, I am proud of you.
- Thanks, buddy.

748
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,998
I am going to go
with Mom and Dad, okay?

749
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,792
They got my passport.

750
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:06,549
Look, no disrespect intended
but honestly? Fuck your parents

751
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,010
if they don't fucking appreciate you.

752
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,971
I mean, look at you.
You're a fucking beast.

753
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,141
You're like the fucking Hebrew
Dolph Lundgren.

754
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,643
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

755
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:24,025
Watching you tonight was like watching
a bunch of fucking birds flying in a V.

756
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:28,237
It was instinct, purpose...

757
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,116
It was like you were doing
what you were born to do.

758

I'm not here because I'm a good captain,
because I'm not.

1064
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,960
I fucked up a lot of things in my life.

1065
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,380
I lost my woman
and I don't see my kid enough

1066
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,926
and I guess what I'm trying to say is
I feel I've gained a family

1067
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,095
with you boys.

1068
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:01,561
You skated, you fought
and you fucking bled

1069
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:05,690
and you have earned every piece of this.

1070
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,401
You got that shit
that makes you keep going

1071
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,820
long after you got no reason to.

1072
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,240
That Doug shit.

1073
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,451
He's got it. He's got the stuff.

1074
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,831
Not matter what happens out there
they will know...

1075
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,585

- Je parle pas français.
- Fuck him.

1086

So the Halifax Highlanders
and the St. John Shamrocks.

1087
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:36,322
It's all on the line here.

1088
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:41,077
The eighth and final playoff spot
and this should be a confrontation.

No glory holes here tonight.

1090
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:50,795
Rhea runs into a couple
of Halifax players.

1091
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,506
Takes a shot.
The save is made by Belchior.

1092
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,716
Hey, hey!

1093
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,057
He's a one-man wrecking crew.

1094

- Too many men on the ice.
- Get the fuck out.

Ross Rhea! You cheap motherfucker!
You cheap bastard!

1096
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:15,194
Ross Rhea steals the puck,
he puts it out in front, he scores!

1097
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,197
- Fuck you, Rhea.
- Ha!

1098
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,700
Come on.

1099
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,836
I'm going to score a goal just for you,
right now.

1100
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:36,048
Here's Laflamme steps onto the ice.
He calls for the puck.

1101
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,509
He takes the pass.
Here comes Laflamme.

1102
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,722
He's straight up the middle,
through the defence. Shot...

- Give me it!

01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:53,733
- God-fucking-damnit!
- The fans are frustrated.

1106
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,028
- The Halifax team can't buy a goal.
- Come on Halifax!

1107
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,573
Great save, Belchior!

1108
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,788
- we just saw Rhea come off the ice.
- Glatt, Laflamme.

1109
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:12,877
- Let's go, boys. Stick with him.
- Rhea gets onto the ice at the same time.

1110
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,920
This could get scary.

1111
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:21,218
- Are they going to have a go?
- Come on.

1112
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:26,307
- Come on.
- Here we go.

1113
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,393
Rhea skates away.
Oh, he's suckered him.

1114
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:33,105
- What the shit is that?
- He forced him to take a penalty.

1115
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:35,232
- Fucker!
- Fuck you!

1116
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,819
Ref, you can't call that!
He was fucking instigating.

1117
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,947
You got to keep your boy
out of the box, Ronnie.

1118
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,242
Ah!

1119
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,873
Short-handed situation.
A great opportunity.

1120
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,210
- Rhea!
- I got it.

1121
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,420
- He scores!
- Shit.

Let's go now. Yes, sir!

That's the drop. Laflamme
out on ice now, Rhea as well.

(COACH) Let's go, let's go.

1126
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,607
And now Laflamme takes a run
at big Rhea.

1127
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:19,819
- That's shit bad luck.
- You want some? Huh?

1128
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,698
Eh? You want some?

Early in the third.
Glatt and Rhea are in the penalty box.

1134
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,557

to the Halifax zone.
