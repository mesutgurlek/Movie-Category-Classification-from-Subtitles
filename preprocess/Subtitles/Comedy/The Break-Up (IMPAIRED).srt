3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, here we go.

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,300
MAN: Take a seat, buddy!

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Come on.
It was a good play.

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,200
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

8
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,600
I don't know.
It's up to you.

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,900
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,400
like he's at home
on the toilet
with his legs spread.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,400
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
Why are you
sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,900
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,700
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,200
VENDOR: Ice-cold soda!

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,900
Get your soda here!

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
VENDOR: On the right.
Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Hey, hot dog guy,
can I get six hot dogs
down here, please?

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Right away.
GARY: And make it right,
please.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup
and the relish.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,600
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,100
We will.
Then why are you
getting hot dogs?

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
GARY: You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,600
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,000
That's okay.
Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,000
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Would you mind
passing the lady
one of the hot dogs?

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
You can have your own.
Thanks. That's really
nice of you.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,800
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Somebody give her a hot dog.
I got... The big guy can't
eat all of them. Have one.

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,400
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Okay, good.
Thank you.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,400
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

44
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,300
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,900
(CROWD CHEERING)

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,900
Cheers!
Thanks.

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
We'll share it.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,200
That's nice.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,100
You have a problem
with me eating a hot dog,
guy?

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,700
I'll smack him
in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,500
Hey, you want
to go get a drink?
No.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm with somebody, sorry.

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,700
Who? The guy with
the tucked-in shirt
and the visor?

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,600
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not
your brother, then.

58
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,900
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Who's this...
I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Who are you?
I don't know.
I'm kidding with you.

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Who's the guy with
the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Uh, it's...

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm going.
Do you think
you'll marry him?

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,100
What?
'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

65
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,600
The first time
you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

66
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,200
"I wonder if I could marry
this guy in plaid shorts who
tucks his shirt in. No way."

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,900
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
"I had a lot to drink
tonight. I'm kissing
the tucked-in guy."

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,100
My point is, if you're
not gonna marry him...
Yeah.

70
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,300
...and if it's not forever,

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
then you really don't have
anything to lose in
taking me up on my offer.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,900
Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,900
Okay.
To where? On an
ice-breaking first date?

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,700
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,700
If you want to stay
off the market
while you're with

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,100
I'm-not-the-one-
but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,600
But for all you know,
I just offered you

78
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,200
a get-out-of-bored-Iove-
for-free card
with no strings attached.

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,700
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,600
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
and then they go,
"It's genius."

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
They burned that witch.
And guess what, then they got
warm and they ate good stuff.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,300
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

86
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm better just to kind of
hang out and,
if we don't have fun,

87
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,200
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm not committing
to anything. I'll go hang out
with you for a little bit.

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,900
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
(YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND

<i>Don't make me ask you twice.</i>

CHRISTOPHER: Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.

117
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,000
The artist was inspired
by the neoclassical movement.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
CHRISTOPHER: No, she doesn't.

119
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,900
But wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent.

CHRISTOPHER: Okay, bye-bye.

$35,000.

Happy Holidays.

Hold, please.

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Will you excuse me
for a moment?
Sure. Go ahead.

124
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,300
Christopher?
Yes, sweetie.

125
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,600
Hi, honey.
Hi.

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,300
Christmas was months ago.
Don't remind me.
I miss it so much.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

128
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,300
I know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

130
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,200
Okay. I'm just saying,
I don't think Marilyn Dean
will "dig" the energy.

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,100
Oh, no.
She's the one that told me
to be creative. So...

132
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,700
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday
coming?

133
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,300
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

134
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, if you want
to get technical,
there's Memorial Day,

135
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
there's Flag Day.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Some people recognize
Father's Day as a holiday.
I don't.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,600
I get it. I get it.
Well, on those days
you can say, "Happy Holidays."

138
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
"good evening,
Marilyn Dean Gallery."
Okay?

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,100
Okay.

141
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm so sorry about that.
Oh, no.

142
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,800
So, now this is a new piece
by Zakrzewska.

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,700
What do you think of this?

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,600
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Other than taking
an art history class
in college,

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,500
which I pretty much
slept through, I don't have
the first clue about art

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,300
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

148
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,300
I mean, I don't see the point
in buying something that
I could have done myself.

149
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,100
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,700
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have."

152
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,200
You know, don't worry
about who the artist is
or how much it's worth.

153
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean, you have to live
with it every day. You have
to walk by it every day.

154
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
You know, you have to
really love it. You have
to really appreciate it.

155
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
It's kind of like
picking a mate.

156
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000

Hi.

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,700
How's it going?
BROOKE: It's good.

159
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,100
Oh, wow. You got
a lot happening.
I know.

160
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,900
Very exciting.
I am starving.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,900
Oh, careful. That's really...
That's very hot.
Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Yep.
Jesus.

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,700
Hey, honey,
you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

164
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,300
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

165
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,700
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

167
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,700
I just need you
to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

168
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,300
(TV CLICKS)

(COMMENTATOR CHATTERING)

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Gary?
Yeah?

171
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,700
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

173
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

174
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,100
Why would you want 12 lemons?

175
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,000
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

176
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
So, no one's actually
even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,700
Yeah. They're just
show lemons. Shown in
the center of the table.

178
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,900
I'm glad you find that
amusing,

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
Well,
can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm not gonna use
a drinking...

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
We could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece.

183
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece.

184
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
You know what?
I've got an idea.

185
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,100
Why don't we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether,

186
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,100
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

187
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,000
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it.

188
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,600
Guess what? Now we've made
a better meal versus something
visually nice to look at.

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,700
What are you do...
What's happening here?
What are you doing?

190
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,300
What are you doing?
(STAMMERING) Oh, I had
such a long day on the bus.

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,600
I need a little bit
of down time.
My feet are killing me.

192
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
Gary, come on,
my feet are killing me, too.
I'm exhausted.

193
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,600
I worked all day.
Went to the market.

194
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,100
I cleaned this entire condo
and then I've been cooking
for the last three hours.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,300
Come on. Help set the table.

196
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,000
GARY: Sweetheart.
What?

197
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,300
You've done such a great job
already. Don't you want
to finish it yourself

198
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,900
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Set the table.
Listen to me.

200
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,100
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

201
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,700
was painting
the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,500
"Hey, guys, you know,
I did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels,

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,700
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,900
"And maybe
you could help me...
Give me a brush

205
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,100
"and you guys can
grab brushes, and we can all
make a great chapel." Uh-uh.

206
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,300
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know
what the results were?

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
A masterpiece.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

209
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,300
and I bet when Michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes,
they didn't bring him three.

210
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,900
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting
to drain me,

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,200
and now I'm gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what I missed here.

212
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
Honey, look, Gary, just...
Down time's important.

213
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Gary, please just
take a shower, okay?
Down time's important.

214
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,900
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't want the doorbell
to ring. I'm then forced
to answer the door,

216
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,200
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

217
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah.
Okay?

218
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,400
You're absolutely right.
Let's do that. The second
that this inning's over...

219
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
Gary.
There's one out all ready.

220
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,400
They're gonna be here
in 20 minutes.

221
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Baby, have you ever seen
a shower of mine take
more than four minutes?

222
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Yes, I have. Come on.

(DOORBELL RINGING)
Oh, great!

224
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,800
They're here. Okay.
Table's not set.
Dinner's not ready.

225
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,200
Would you please
just let my parents in?

226
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,800
I gotta jump in the shower.
What?

227
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,400
(DOORBELL RINGING)
I gotta go.

228
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,100

230
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
GARY: Well, seeing how
our families haven't
had many opportunities

231
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,400
to get to know one another,
we figured, what better way
than to break some bread?

232
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,800
So, everyone,
thank you for coming
and enjoy the meal.

Cheers, honey.

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200

Nice to meet you.
Thank you.

GARY: Sweetheart,
cheers to you.

236
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Darling, I see that you put
those Feng Shui books

237
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
that I sent to you
to good use.

238
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,000
This place is
so well balanced.
Thanks, Mom.

239
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

240
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
WENDY: Yes.

241
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

242
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,900
if we had a pool table.

243
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,500
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

244
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,300
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

245
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,600
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table
because...

246
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,500
Gary.
Yeah. You could take
the dining room table,

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

248
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,000
BROOKE: Really?
GARY: Plenty of room.

249
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,900
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

250
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,900
How do you...
I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,900
Eat on it.
We'd have no furniture
in the living...

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

253
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,100
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

254
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,300
Well, this isn't a dorm.
Look, baby,
I completely understand.

255
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

256
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,500
We will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

257
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you.

258
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,500
The food is outstanding.
It is delicious food.

259
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
DENNIS: It's outstanding.

260
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
LUPUS:
Yeah, it really is nice.
Okay, everybody.

261
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Time for the joke of the day.
Knock, knock.
Dad. Dad, come on.

262
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
Who's there?
Norma Lee.

263
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,300
Norma Lee, who?

264
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,900
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,700
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia?
LUPUS: I got a joke.
I got a joke.

266
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
(ALL CHUCKLING)
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

267
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,800
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
All right, look,
I think we've had enough
with the jokes for tonight.

269
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,800
Thank you, though.
Let's just talk
with each other.

270
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
All right.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,700
I saw that Three Brothers
article in the <i>Trib</i> this week.

272
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,300
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

273
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Basically, our big goal is to
try to take Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

274
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,800
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

275
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,000
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

276
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,500
then we'll take it
to the squids.
Yeah.

277
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,100
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,300
As soon as we control
the waterway, then we'll
bring in air supports

279
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

280
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
You know, Dennis,

281
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,100
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions,

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,100
it's really inspiring.

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

284
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,100
how you feel that passion.

285
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,900
RICHARD: And sharing it
with other people, I think
that's what life's about.

Sorry.

288
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,900

But I do feel it
about singing.

With my <i>a cappella</i> group,
The Tone Rangers.

290

Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

291
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,200
it's really
more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,200
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

293
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,000
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

294
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,300
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

295
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,400
It's transcendent.

296
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
But it's still very real.

297
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

that it was gonna be

at that goddamn table

bag of lemons.

about the lemons.

Well, that's all
you're talking about.

I'm just saying
it'd be nice if you did
things that I asked.

409
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,200
It would be even nicer
if you did things without
me having to ask you!

to yourself, you know,
you could have said,

"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers."

417

on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

to take that to mean
that you do like flowers?

No. This is not about...
You're not...
God, you're not getting it.

It's not about the lemons.

424

It's not about the flowers.
It's not about the dishes.

425
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,800
It's just about...
How many times do I have to
drop hints about the ballet?

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,200
wondering when the hell's
the goddamn nightmare
gonna end.

432
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,900
Go to a damn ballet.
It's not about you
loving the ballet, Gary.

433
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,100
It's about the
person that you love
loves the ballet

434
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

435
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,400
Not when they're
at the ballet.

436
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,500
Okay. Forget the ballet!
Forget the ballet!
I will.

437
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
We don't go anywhere together.

438
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,000
We just went
to Ann Arbor together.
To Ann Arbor.

439
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
To the
Michigan-Notre Dame game.

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,700
You think screaming,
drunk kids and leprechauns
doing backflips, that's fun.

441
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,800
That's fun for me.
Come on, man.
I did that for you.

442
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,300
What do you...
How do you show up for me?

443
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

444
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,700
Come on. You...
I'm busting my ass

445
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city,

446
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,900
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

447
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,700
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

448
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
I want to work.
All I ask, Brooke,

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,100
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

450
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

451
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,500
instead of being attacked
with questions and nagged
the whole damn time.

452
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
You think that I nag you?
That's all you do!

453
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,900
All you do is nag me!

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,100
"The bathroom's a mess."
"Your belt doesn't match."

455
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out."

456
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Nothing I ever do
is ever good enough!

457
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I just want to be left
the hell alone!

458
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
Really? Is that
what you want, Gary?

459
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

460
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,300
That's what you want?
Yeah.

461
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,200
Fine. Great.
Do whatever the hell you want.

462
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,500
You leave your socks
all over this house,
dress like a pig,

463
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,100
play your stupid-ass
video game.
I don't care, I'm done.

464
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
What?
I'm done!
I don't deserve this.

465
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,600
I really do not deserve this.
I deserve somebody
who gives a shit.

466
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm not spending one more
second of this life
with some inconsiderate prick!

467
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
You're a prick!

Addie, it just became
so clear tonight

471
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,800
how much he takes me
for granted.

472
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,500
What happened?
BROOKE:
<i>Just the same old shit.</i>

473
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,700
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

474
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,900
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,600
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

476
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,200
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

477
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,500
And it sounds like you
made the right one.
You respected yourself.

478
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,000
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up
with him.

479
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,100
I don't. I just want him
to say thank you. I want him
to want to do the dishes.

480
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

481
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,500
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

482
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,100
I just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it.

483
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

484
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,800
and I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.
No, Ad. Don't.

485
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
Please, I really don't
want to see anybody.
I really don't.

486
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

487
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,000
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

488
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,900
And I don't want you
getting out your Clorox
and your rubber gloves,

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,900
and taking this out
on the kitchen.
Look, look, look.

490

Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little
out of hand,

491
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,800
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

492
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,300
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

493
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,100
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

You know,
do whatever you want to do.

497
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm done with
the relationship.
Whatever.

498
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,300
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done
with the relationship?"

499
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,800
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

500
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,400
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

501
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

502
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,200
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

503
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

504
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,500
Gary, you're devastated.
Now, what's the name
of the guy she's doing?

505
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

506
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,500
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

507
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

508
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,400
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

509
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

510
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,500
You get a password, you check
her e-mail. You find out
everything about her.

511
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,900
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,500
that Stacy was
running around with.
Okay.

513
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
You are reading
a little too much
into this situation.

514
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,400
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

515
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
We had a fight
over the groceries
I brought home.

516
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
You're probably right.
She's probably not
sleeping with anybody.

517
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,300
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

518
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Maybe she's with
another guy, maybe not.
She's not.

519
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

520
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,200
But what we do know
is that she doesn't want
to be with you anymore.

521
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,300
I mean, I hate to be shitty
about it, and so cut and dry,
but let's face it.

522
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
She says she doesn't
want to be with you,
and I believe her.

523
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna
need a place to go

524
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
and lick your wounds
while you get your head
right over this thing.

525
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

526
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
You're gonna stay with me.

527
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,500
I'm not gonna hear it.
Look it...

528
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
I'm not moving
out of the place.
Oh, you're not moving out.

529
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
No. I put money in the place.
I put half my money
in the place.

530
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,000
You're obviously not
the one calling the shots
in this case.

531
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah, but I own the place.

532
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,300
With her.
Yeah.

533
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
But it's not up to her
who gets to keep
the goddamn place.

534
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
If you find out
who she's sleeping with,
maybe we could leverage it.

535
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,100
I want you to listen to me.
You listen to me.

536
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm gonna leave you a key.
I don't need a key.

537
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
Why?
'Cause she's gonna put...

538
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,300
She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

539
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,900
Did she say
she was moving out?
She will.
She's gonna move out.

540
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Oh, she's...
I'm gonna keep the place.

541
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm not moving
out of the place.

I always wanted my own place

I finally got my own place,

to have a pool table.

I'd rectify that today.

My point's your point.
Your three points.

That it's not unnoticed,
that it was not acceptable,

Gary, are you here
for couples bowling?
Yeah.

628
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,500
Well, don't you think
you and I should discuss
something first?

Like what? How your
47 average is killing us?

Okay. Great. No.

631
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,000
Gary, this is couples bowling.
And since you and I
are no longer a couple,

632
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,000
because you have chosen

633
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,900
not to participate
constructively
in our relationship,

634

it's a good idea

for you and I to be around
each other any more
than we have to right now.

Brooke, when a man makes
a commitment to a team,
he honors that commitment.

or personal issues
get in the way of victory.

either, Gary.
Yeah. Sure, they don't.

falling apart piece by piece

was pretty great.

that was holding it all
together.

the message quicker.

720
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,600
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

721
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,300
How you doing, ladies?

722
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,500
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

723
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,900
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

724
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

725
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,400
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

726
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,600
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

727
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,500
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe,
obviously.

728
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,700
And the other one...
Asshole.

729
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,500
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

730
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,800
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

731
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,800
Come here.
Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

732
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,200
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

733
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
The L.G. thanks you.

734
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,500
Will you listen to me,
please? You're my brother
and I love you very much,

735
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,000
and maybe you do
get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

736
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,200
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

737
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,900
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes,
tell your jokes.

738
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,800
But sooner or later
you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

739
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,600
And jokes might
make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

740
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm gonna go take a lap.

No, in my bedroom.

746

And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

747
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,200
when you so arrogantly
claimed the bed
without asking me,

748
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,700
but you can't just waltz
into my room and turn it
into a damn art fair.

749
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,100
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,100
I don't care if you only
took an inch.

751

There might not be
a door here, but this
is my domain. Okay?

752
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,100
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

Well, then what the hell
is that pool table
doing in the dining room?

754

Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

755
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,900
Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

This is how I am

761

pretty strange.

to think about moving out.

No, I'm not moving anywhere.

but can we please
just leave it...

Problems? She slept with
the entire Arizona Cardinals

That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

come out of the closet,

I want you to listen to me

he won't even have kids.

But then one day
his wife will come home,

00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,700
If it's our turn to host game,
I'm gonna host
goddamn game night.

865
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,500
You want to host game night?
I'm fine, Brooke.

866
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,700
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

867
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Okay.

868
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,400
If there's anyone
that should feel weird
about seeing people,

869
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,300
that's you, Tonya Harding.
Me? I'm gonna honor
my commitments.

870
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,700
Great.
Great.

871
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,900
Fine.
Fine.

872
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,800
Let's do that.
Let's do that.

873
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Let's honor the commitment.

874
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
(WATER RUNNING)

875
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,000
Hey, there's no food in there!
BROOKE: So?

876
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,400
Well, people are gonna
be here in an hour.
What are they supposed to eat?

877
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

878
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,400
Oh, great.
Well, that's what we got.

879
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,300
We have only tap water
because, you know,
Gary didn't shop.

880
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,300
BROOKE: And we don't have
any ice either 'cause
he didn't fill the trays.

881
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,700
That's trash. It's your shot.
What is your name again?

882
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,900
Diane.
Diane.

883
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
GARY: Did you call?
JOHNNY O: I called the five.

884
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,700
Well, yeah,
but you didn't call
the second ball,

885
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,900
so that's trash,
so it's your shot.

886
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,900
GARY: You got to play
by the rules. It's your shot.

887
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Hi.
Hi.

888
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,300
Andrew.
BROOKE: Oh, hi.

889
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

890
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,600
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

891
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,900
Who sent an invite to them?
I'm sorry.

892
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,900
These are very loyal friends
and they are always welcome
in my condo.

893
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,100
Oh, really? Why don't we
take it to a vote and see
who has the numbers this time?

894
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,500
GARY: All right.
Show of hands here.

895
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,400
Who thinks that these two
traitors should leave and
not be a part of game night?

896
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,600
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

897
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,900
Raise your hand.
I know I feel that way.
Who else?

898
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,000
GARY: Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

899
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,900
Come on. Thank you.
You, Miss? New girl.

900
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,100
Who's the girl?
What's her name?
What's her name?

901
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,800
The girl you're with.
What's her name?
Her name's Diane.

902
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,900
Oh, I'm sorry.
You might want to go ahead
and touch some sky.

903
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,800
Thank you. Come on,
Riggleman, please?
What are you doing?

904
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,100
No. We need the eight
to count towards
a running tally.

905
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,300
You know that. Come on.

906
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Show her whose side
that you're on.
Put your hand in the air.

907
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,400
You know whose side I'm on.
You know we need eight,
though. Come on.

908
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,200
Put your hand down.

909
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,300
Please don't touch
my Ruffles.

910
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,700
GARY: Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

911
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,100
Don't eat them, please.
Thank you.

912
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,700
Oh, Gary.
They're mine.

913
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,000
Come on.
Here we go. All right.

914
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,800
RIGGLEMAN: Eyes front. Ready?
Hold on. Get the
timer going, please.

915
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,000
Ready?
GARY: Now I gotta do it. Go.

916
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,600
ANDREW: Okay.
It's a brick.

917
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,500
ADDIE: Square. Square.
Box. Box.

918
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,100
Corner. Corner.
A dot in the corner.

919
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,700
A house.
Home plate!

920
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
JEN: Football! Baseball!
Sports. A house.
ADDIE: A triangle.
It's algebra.

921
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,000
Okay, it's a house.
ADDIE: It's a house.

922
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,500
JEN: It's a house.
ANDREW: Two words.

923
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,100
JEN: Banana?
ADDIE: Chimney,
chimney, chimney!

924
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,900
A fruit. House. Fruit.

925
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,500
Oh, restaurant. Or...

926
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,000
ANDREW: No, chimney, chimney.
ADDIE: Smoke...

927
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,100
JEN: Oh, a house call.
House call!

928
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,600
(TIMER RINGING)
Oh! House call!

929
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,500
Yeah, well, I thought
it was a house call.

930
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Like a hotel, then it hit me
it was a house.
ADDIE: Yeah!

931
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
You're terrific.
Absolutely terrific.

932
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,700
All right, beat that.

933
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,000
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

934
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,700
So let's stay focused.
Let's stay calm.

935
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,800
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

936
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,000
Let's get a mind-meld.
Let's try and get a mind-meld,
okay?

937
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,500
GARY: Here we go.
Let's go. Mind-meld.
I heard you!

938
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,100
Don't over-think it.
Mind meld.
ANDREW: Ready?

939
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,900
I heard you!
Well, just keep it simple.

940
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,100
Shush.

941
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,600
Ready? Wait. Go!
Here we go!
We're mind-melding.

942
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,300
Draw faster.
It doesn't have
to be beautiful,

943
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,800
just has to be
something we can get.
Shoe, shoe...

944
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,600
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

945
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,300
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Draw something different.
No one's getting it.

946
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,000
Shoe. What, is that
a smaller shoe?
JOHNNY O: Baby shoe.

947
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
JOHNNY O: Shoes.

948
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,800
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

949
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,000
GARY: Smaller shoes.
DIANE: Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

950
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,600
Running Olympics.
JOHNNY O: Inside the shoe.

951
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,500
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
JOHNNY O: Lining.

952
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,800
Stop pointing at the shoe.
We're not...
No one's guessing shoe.

953
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,400
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

954
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
(TIMER RINGING)
Draw something different.
You...

955
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,100
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

956
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,300
You drew a big shoe,
then a small shoe,
and no one got it.

957
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,600
You gotta draw something
different. Everyone said
"shoe" seven times.

958
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,400
It's a sock, asshole.

959
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,800
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

960
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,500
A three-year-old with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this.

961
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,400
I'm sorry, I don't have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus

962
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,600
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built!

963
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,900
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

964
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,700
I shouldn't sit here
and pick on your art.
No.

965
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,900
Because you got
the nuts part down,
Picasso.

966
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,600
GARY: All you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear.

967
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,800
BROOKE: That's Van Gogh,
you idiot!

968
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,800
And your insults
are much more effective
when they're accurate.

969
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,000
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

970
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,200
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

971
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,500
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

972
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,700
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

973
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,000
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

974
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,600
At first,
I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

975
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,800
something that you two
would work out and get past,

976
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,400
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

977
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,600
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together.

978
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,600
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

979
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,300
I'm just...
I got you.

980
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,600
As your friend
and as your realtor,

981
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,900
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

982
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,600
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

983
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,000
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

984
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,400
Gary?

985
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,400
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

986
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
is for her to move out
of the condo,

987
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,800
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for

988
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,100
the labor that I did
all around the condo.
What? What?

989
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,200
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

990
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,400
We fixed this place up
together.
Are you nuts?

991
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,200
Stop calling me nuts,
I swear to God.
I fixed the...

992
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
You went around with a sponge,

993
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,900
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

994
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,600
That's what you're saying
that I did?
GARY: There's no...

995
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,200
BROOKE: That was...
That's called aesthetics.

996
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,300
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

997
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,600
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

998
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
I'll tell you what
it's called in his language,
depreciated.

999
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
That's what it's called.
You don't even know
what that means.

1000
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,100
Unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

1001
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,400
All right.
Let me tell you
something else.

1002
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,900
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall.

1003
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,400
The holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called.

1004
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Oh, please. Gary.

1005
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,600
GARY: You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

1006
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,200
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value
to the condo.

1007
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,100
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

1008
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,000
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling
in the bathroom.

1009
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,800
Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

1010
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,700
That tile is the
shittiest tile job.
GARY: I did the plumbing!

1011
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,200
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

1012
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,100
Okay. Let's talk
about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

1013
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,300
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

1014
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,100
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

1015
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,700
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

1016
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,100
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

1017
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,200
GARY: Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

1018
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
I get a minute
to take a shower.

1019
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,600
One minute?
BROOKE: One minute of warmth?

1020
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,800
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

1021
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,600
Thank God you're not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in Chicago on time.

1022
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,200
This is basic logic.
You are out of your mind.
You have lost it.

1023
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,000
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

1024
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,200
Cheese and rice,
you guys are gonna kill
each other. Now, let's just...

1025
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,800
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

1026
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,000
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

1027
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,700
And that's a shame,
because this building will
continue to increase in value.

1028
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,000
I get nothing but
phone calls about it,
all right?

1029
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,700
Waiting for a unit to open up.

1030
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,400
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest
is selling.

1031
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,000
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see
any other solution.

1032
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,300
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

1033
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,300
and you get on
with your lives.

1034
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,800
I know that selling is not
the easiest thing, but
I do think that it's the best.

1035
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,000
And to be honest,
this is a situation

1036
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,400
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

1037
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,100
That's great. Thank you.
That's great.
Thank you for that.

1038
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,000
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

1039
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,900
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1040
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,800
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying
in theory, you know.

1041
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,300
In this situation,
'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1042
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,800
No can do, though.

1043
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,100
As soon as you can,
I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1044
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,100
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1151
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,900
Excuse me.

1152
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, I have to get this.
I'm so sorry.

1153
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,700
Hello.

<i>I'm supposed to call?</i>
What?

1155
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,700
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1156
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,400
<i>Okay, that's great.</i>
Wait. What? Oh, all right.

1157
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,700
Listen, where...
Just don't move.
Where are you?

1158
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
<i>I'm sitting in my kitchen.</i>
Sitting? Okay.

1159
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,900
(STAMMERING) Don't move.

1160
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,900
Don't... I'm gonna be
right there, honey. I'm gonna
be right there, okay?

1161
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,700
Is everything okay?
Oh, my gosh.

1162
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,300
That was my best friend.

1163
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,200
She just had an accident
and she...
She has this knee thing

1164
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,200
and she's just very fragile,
and I have to go.
What?

1165
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,800
I can give you a ride.
No. No. That's okay.

1166
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,600
I'm gonna grab a cab, so...
I'm so sorry.

1167
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,200
I like your dress.

1168
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,000
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously
read a lot of books.

1169
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,700
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1170
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,000
He reads a lot of books
because nobody
wants to talk to him.

1171
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,800
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1172
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,300
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1173
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,400
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1174
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,500
We've got to find somebody
who is really gonna
make Gary jealous.

1175
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,700
LUPUS:
Can I just say something?

1176
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,200
You sound a little jealous,
Gary.

1177
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,200
GARY: Why would I be
jealous of some guy
with computer skills?

1178
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,800
Let's say he doesn't have
computer skills, but he's got
a big old elephant hog on him?

1179
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,600
Would that bother you
or would you be
okay with that?

1180
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,100
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1181
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,400
LUPUS: My mind works great.

1182
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,800
So, what's this bullshit
I hear about you
selling the condo?

1183
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
Selling that condo
is ludicrous.

1184
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,600
I was waiting for
when I was gonna get

1185
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,200
the how-Gary-always-
screws-his-life-up
speech again.

1186
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,900
This must be the right time.
Look, you tell me,

1187
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,100
you just tell me, tell me.
Is it happening now?
Yeah. Okay.

1188
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,700
Tell me how
losing that asset

1189
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,900
is gonna get us
on the river?

1190
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,700
Go ahead, just tell me.
Tell me. Somebody tell me.
What is this?

1191
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,200
What is this? What is it?
What is it? Hey!
Don't patronize me.

1192
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Helicopters.
Helicopters. Exactly!

1193
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,300
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1194
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,100
Dennis, I'm being totally
serious with you. I don't
need this shit right now.

1195
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,200
Hey, you want to cry,
cry to Mom.

1196
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,900
Nobody's crying.
I'm not crying.

1197
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,800
I just don't feel
like hearing it.
There's no feelings here.

1198
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,500
This is about money
and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1199
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,100
You broke up. Fine.

1200
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,200
You know, sad.

1201
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,900
Sad is, instead of putting
$1,000 into your mortgage
every month,

1202
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you waste it on rent.
That's what sad is.

1203
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,900
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused,
brokenhearted.

1204
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,300
Heartbreak is not
having that money

1205
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,000
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1206
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,200
so that after taxes
you can invest!

1207
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:20,400
You know, you're confused.

1208
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,800
Are you finished?
Look, I need
the damn tour logs.

1209
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,900
Yeah.

1210
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,300
Well, I really,
really appreciate
the heart to heart.

1211
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,700
It was a great talk, Dennis.
Thank you.

1212
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, well, you're behind
three months. You're still
behind three months.

1213
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,100
And those logs are imperative
to insuring that our books
are straight!

1214
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,800
I'll tell you what those
logs are. Those logs are
bullshit is what they are!

1215
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,800
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn
things yourself!

1216
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,000
I do, I do!

1217
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,500
And I don't appreciate it,
because it cuts into
my time with my family.

1218
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,500
I could be spending that time
with my family instead of
doing your books.

1219
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,800
I already do the taxes.
I do the billing.

1220
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,100
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1221
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1222
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,100
You do the tours!
I am the talent, Dennis!

1223
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,000
They sign up a month
in advance to see me.

1224
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,500
They'll wait in line
for the next bus
to see me! All right?

1225
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:18,400
So don't drain me
with all this bullshit
about the goddamn tour logs!

Hi, Mike.

Is your mom
in the room with you?

1238

'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1239
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,300
I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1240
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,300
I'm gonna be just
a few more seconds.
So, just sit down and relax.

1241
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,200
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1242

GARY: I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

1243
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,500
You take the fun
out of beating you, because
you have an excuse to lose.

<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

1245

that your mom won't
love you anymore

1246
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

Oh, hey,

01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,500
Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

Awesome, all right?

Oh, I could, too.
I love it, yeah.
I love it, don't you?

1270
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,400
I mean, it's the kind of thing
where literally

I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

You push yourself
trying to achieve
the impossible,

that when that moment comes

has prepared you for victory!

I can't take credit
for it, Mike.

that Lupus sent, we each have
eight articles of clothing.

1313
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,900
Now, if you want to bet,
you take off an article
of clothing,

1314
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,100
you put it in the center.

1315
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,400
If you win,
you take back the clothes,
you put back on what you bet.

other people bet
will stay in front of you,

You can go all in
at any point,

1319

but as I outlined,
you must take off
all your clothes to do so.

I've picked your shit up
off the floor.

that tough on me,

some of the things

Brooke, that I don't always
do the right thing

or always say
the right things,

to do things differently.

01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,100
Oh, God.

1590
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,300
I just, I think...
I don't know,

1591
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,600
but I don't think I have

1592
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,700
anything left to give.

1593
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,700
I'm sorry.

1594
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,700
I was hoping for...

1595
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,600
It doesn't matter.

1596
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,700
Oh, this is now
beyond awkward.

1597
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,500
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1598
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,500
and I think I'm gonna go.

1599
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,700
Okay.

1600
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,900
Thank you.

1601
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,300
I made a dinner,
and I don't know if
it's any good or not,

1602
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,300
but you're welcome to have it.

1603
01:30:58,700 --> 01:30:59,800
Okay.

1604
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,300
Gary, that's really...
That's not what
you think that it is.

1605
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,500
It's okay.

1606
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,900
I'm gonna go take a walk.

1610
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,600
I'm sorry about that.
No.

1611
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,200
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

1612
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,700
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

1613
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,100
I think it's great.
Good.

1614
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,400
Okay.
Okay.

1615
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,600
So,

1616
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,400
I will have that wrapped up.

1617
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,200
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

1618
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,000
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1619
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,200
Sure.

1620
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

GARY: So, the thing that
I was most afraid
of happening happened

1625
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:32,100
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows
how I feel.

1626
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,100
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1627
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,400
I think,
what you got to do now
is really think hard,

1628
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,500
because you have
to find somebody

1629
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,100
that can't be traced back
to either of us

1630
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,000
to visit this guy.

1631
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,600
What are you talking about?
I don't...

1632
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,400
The guy who came with her.

1633
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,900
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

1634
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,700
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1635
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,900
It's not about him.
I don't care about that.
...it's a problem.

1636
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,500
The guy, he's not a...
They're not dumb.
Cops are smart, trust me.

1637
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,500
Okay, but he's not
a problem to me.
Right.

1638
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,400
Listen to me.

1639
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,900
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1640
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,100
I got you.

1641
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,100
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1642
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,700
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

1643
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:19,700
I don't want you
to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1644
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,800
I'm being serious with you.
I know, I know.
Smart. You're smart.

1645
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,200
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

1646
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,700
I don't want anything
to happen to him.
Me, either.

1647
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,800
Promise me you're not
gonna have anyone
do anything to this guy.

1648
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,800
But you've gotta
tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1649
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,800
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell
a different story...

1650
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,700
Nothing.
Promise me one thing.
We don't care...

1651
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,700
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this.
I'm exhausted.

1652
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,100
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbors know
you're going home.

1653
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,900
Do me a favor.
They got phone records. Make
a couple phone calls tonight.

1654
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,700
Especially around 10:00.

1655
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,100
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

1656
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,800
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

1657
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,300
No, no, I got it.

1658
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,100
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

1659
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,900
I don't want anything
to happen.
Right.

1660
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,400
Say it louder.

1661
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,500
What are you doing here
so early?

1662
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,100
Hey.

1663
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,500
Everything okay
with you and...
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

1664
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,100
I just wanna get
my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1665
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,600
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

1666
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,800
I love you, Dennis.

1667
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,000
(GASPING)
It's all right. It's okay.

1668
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,500
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

1669
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,100
So, that's it
for all my stuff.

1670
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,300
If you want, you could give me
your key and I'll drop it off
at Riggleman's.

1671
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,100
All right.

1672
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,600
Thanks.

1673
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,800
Gary.

1674
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:17,200
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

1675
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
I would have done differently.

1676
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,500
Me, too.

1677
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,000
Sort of, actually,
when I see this space, I
realize that if we didn't have

1678
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:33,900
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1679
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:39,700
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

1680
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,000
Yeah.

1681
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:46,800
Although the oversized couch
did come in very useful the
last couple of weeks, so...

1682
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,600
Yes, it... I guess.

1683
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,000
Have a good trip.

1684
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,700
Thanks.

Hi.
Hi.

1712
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,100
Wow.

1713
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,100
(CHUCKLES)

1714
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:50,100
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

1715
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:54,500
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of
full with all the bags here.

1716
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,200
How've you been?
I've been really good.

1717
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,800
How have you been?
I've been good.

1718

Yeah.

1719
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,600
You look great.
Thank you.

1720
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:10,000
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice.
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1721
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,600
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very
deceiving, actually.

1722
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,500
I've managed to become thin
without having any real muscle
on me whatsoever.

1723
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,800
Very tough thing to
accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

1724
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,400
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

1725
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,900
I heard your trip
went really well.
It did. It went really well.

1726
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,600
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

1727
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,200
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1728
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:38,800
But, you know,
you do realize
how much you love home.

1729
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,900
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

1730
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:48,700
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat.
Thanks.

1731
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,700
I'm waiting for it
to get warm, and I'm gonna
come by and take a ride.

1732
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,600
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house.
Come on by.

1733
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,800
Well, I will, then.

1734
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,700
I hope you do.

1735
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,200
Definitely.

1736
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,100
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

1737
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:13,900
I got to drop these bags
off anyway, but it's really
good to see you, Brooke.

1738
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,000
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

1739
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,200
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1740
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,700
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time
before we...

1741
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,100
Yeah.
...catch up.

1742
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,600
We have a lot more
to talk about.
Yeah.

1743
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So.

1744
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:30,900
Be good.
Okay.

1745
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,200
Bye.
Bye.

1746
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,500
(I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW
PLAYING)

1747
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,100
(RAINBOW CONNECTION PLAYING)

1748
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,000
<i>THE END</i>
