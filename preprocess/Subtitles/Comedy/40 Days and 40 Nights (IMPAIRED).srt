falling for Erica...

794
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,467
and I'm finally over Nicole.

795
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:37,629
You really think
you're over her?

796
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:40,401
Fuck, yeah! Bitch.

797
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,968
Hmm. I ran into her
and her fianc last night.

798
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:53,215
What was he like?

799
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:57,685
He--he parties
with a friend of mine.

800
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,589
Apparently, the dude
works late every night.

801
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:00,718
That's what I heard.

802
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:03,955
So?

803
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:07,330
He works late every night--
a different girl every night.

804
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,164
Not that
it should matter to you.

805
00:42:09,202 --> 00:42:11,295
No.
Why would it matter to me?

806
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,067
Yeah.

807
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:20,169
JERRY: My wife and I have
been married for eight years.

808
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:23,114
I love her very much.

809
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,587
I...consider myself
a lucky person.

810
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:30,021
That being said...

811
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:31,922
this woman...

812
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:36,225
does not put out at all.

813
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,254
I mean, at all.

814
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:40,698
I mean, we used to have sex
everywhere.

815
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:43,430
We used to have sex
in this office.

816
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,668
We had sex on this floor.
We had sex on this desk.

817
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:51,041
-On that chair.
-OK. I get it, I get it.

818
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:53,308
But now, I have
to practically beg for it.

819
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:57,181
I mean, it was kind of hot
for the first eight months.

820
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:59,276
The chasing after her...

821
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:03,449
surprising her
with my sexy new underwear.

822
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,359
But now,
I feel a little like a...

823
00:43:08,395 --> 00:43:10,727
like I'm a pervert.

824
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,560
I heard about the vow...

825
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:17,570
and I think it's genius.

826
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:19,595
Thanks.

827
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,130
I mean, this is
the perfect way for me...

828
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:23,904
to regain the power
in my relationship.

829
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:25,411
See, I take the vow.

830
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:29,176
I tell her I'm gonna do without
for a few months.

831
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:32,708
I bet in half the time she's
going to be begging for it.

832
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:34,015
Don't you think?
What do you think?

833
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:38,013
I think you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

834
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:46,454
Hey, put that away. Books
get you in trouble around here.

835
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,230
-I can't work right now.
-So go home.

836
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:52,705
-I need the money.
-So work.

837
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,003
It all reminds me of Matt.

838
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:58,910
Even "donkey lovers"?

839
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:04,242
Call him or leave.
You're bugging me.

-Good.

/ This strange condition /

852
00:44:50,597 --> 00:44:52,588
Why is this so weird?

853

Ahem.

854
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,128
If I told you, "Don't think
about the color red..."

855
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,330
what would you think about?

856
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:01,333
Sex.

857
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:02,966
[Laughs]

858
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:05,000
OK, so we're both sitting here
thinking about sex...

859
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:06,569
because
we can't think about sex...

860
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:08,103
because
we can't talk about sex...

861
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:11,140
and we certainly cannot
have sex.

862
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:14,676
lt's like,
so what are we doing here?

863
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:17,383
You know, if I didn't have
this vow thing...

864
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,255
I'd kiss you right now.

Nicole. How are you?

00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:32,858
Well, better than you
at the moment.

Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

Matt, you work at one
of those dot coms, don't you?

Yes. Yes, I do.

lt's all good, Matt.

to give it one more try?

Bye.

She's the real reason
you took that vow.

904

[Sighs] No.
She's just an ex.

905
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:38,962
The vow is something
completely separate from her.

906

You're a really bad liar.

907
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:43,432
I get that a lot.

908
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:46,901
Look, I know I should've
told you about her.

909
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,100
Yeah, you should've.

910
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:50,006
But I guess it's hard for you
to get the truth out.

Shit.

912
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:02,253
Hey, how about I quit the vow?

913
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:04,314
I mean, honestly,
I don't care about the vow.

St. Matt wants a piece.

-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

920

Yeah.

925
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,649
Then finish your stupid vow.

And if you finish it...

927
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,556
then maybe we can talk
about being together. Maybe.

I just want to connect

Is it working?

Working?
Of course it's working!

lt's like this incredible high.
Can you not feel that?

Just sitting here
talking with you...

I'm mind orgasmic right now.

00:49:18,765 --> 00:49:21,256
Mind orgasmic.

938
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:23,826
Yeah.

00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,236

I can't. I gotta go.

945
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:05,073
I--I understand
what you're doing, Matt.

946

-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

947
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:10,146
Women have been doing this
since, well, forever...

948
00:50:10,183 --> 00:50:12,242
so we know all about the power.

949
00:50:12,285 --> 00:50:14,583
See, us having the power,
that's part of the system...

950
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:17,283
and by you taking the power,
you're fucking with the system.

951
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:20,884
And I think you see why
we can't let that happen.

1593
01:28:13,564 --> 01:28:14,861
about someone
until you kiss them?

1594
01:28:18,035 --> 01:28:20,367
Well...

1595
01:28:20,404 --> 01:28:24,636
I screwed up.
I--I should've just done this.

1596
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:38,481
Are you done talking now?

1597
01:29:00,244 --> 01:29:02,303
Thirty eight hours exactly.

1598
01:29:02,346 --> 01:29:04,644
-Son of a bitch.
-Damn it.

1599
01:29:04,682 --> 01:29:08,015
The pot's up to 140. Anybody
else want in on hour 39?

DUNCAN: Hey, hey.

1601
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:13,323
How do we even know that
they're still even in there?

1602
01:29:13,357 --> 01:29:17,157
They could've put the CD player
on repeat or shuffle.

1603
01:29:17,194 --> 01:29:19,958
-That's a good point.
-It is a good point...

1604
01:29:19,997 --> 01:29:21,521
because they could've
snuck out the back window...

1605
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,556
and we're still sitting around
here like a bunch of chimps.

1606
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:25,967
-Chimps.
-You know what? Look at me.

1607
01:29:26,003 --> 01:29:28,767
I've been here the whole time.
Believe it.

Oh, put me in for a tenner.

1611
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:48,555
He'll keep going.
Two dollars, please.

-What's up, Matt?

1615
01:30:04,809 --> 01:30:05,935
Hey, Matt.

1616
01:30:05,976 --> 01:30:08,968
All right, you guys. Come on,
get out. Get out of my house.

No, no. You know what?

1619
01:30:12,316 --> 01:30:13,749
Come on, come on.
Get out of my house.

1620
01:30:13,784 --> 01:30:15,149
I'll just take this.

1621
01:30:15,186 --> 01:30:16,949
Bye.

1622
01:30:16,987 --> 01:30:18,545
-Later, stud.
-See you later.

1623
01:30:18,589 --> 01:30:21,251
Thanks for the fish, Matt.

1624
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:23,385
Looking good. How long
are you going to be in there?

1625
01:30:23,427 --> 01:30:24,826
-Let's go.
-Hey, I'm going.

1626
01:30:24,862 --> 01:30:26,762
Chris, I'm going to call you
tomorrow, all right?

1627
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:27,957
-What are you doing?
-You, too.

1628
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:29,966
-I don't have my keys on me.
-Good.

1629

Wait, this is my house, dude.

Not for the next
twenty four hours, it's not.

You're kidding.
Don't have sex on my bed.

He can't last in there
another 24 hours. He'll die.

How much you want to bet?

1635
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:48,615
How much do I want to bet
that he'll actually die?

1636
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:51,314
-I'll put ten bucks on it.
-Another ten.
