00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,450
Goal....

3
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:55,750
- What, what was that? Ellie, did you hear that?
- I heard it Manny, whatever it is is miles away.

4
00:02:56,075 --> 00:03:01,350
- Peaches, you alright?
Where is she, no teenager is ever up early.

5
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
- Nooo... easy warden,
she's not on lockdown.

6
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
- You two were supposed to be responsible uncles.

7
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,555
- What... I didn't see Peaches sneak
off maybe 15-20 minutes ago.

8
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:16,670
- Or that she went with Louis to the falls.

9
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,770
- The falls... where the deliquents go!
- Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.

10
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,480
- No, no... it's a gateway hangout.
First it's the falls then she's pucing

11
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:29,480
her trunk and the next thing you
know she's addicted to berries.

12
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,580
- Manny, you are over-reacting.
She's not going to be your little girl forever.

13
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,890
- I know, that's what worries me.

14
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,490
- C'mon...

15
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,490
Louis... would you get your head out of the ground for once and try to have a little fun.

16
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,105
- Ow... I'm a mole-hog, my head's
supposed to be underground and my idea

17
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:59,070
of fun isn't risking death so  you
can meet some cute mammoth.

18
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:06,490
- Ethan isn't cute... he's hot. Besides you can't spend you whole life playing it safe.

19
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:10,590
- I know I would.
- Dad!! There's no reason to be mad.

20
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,590
- You know how I feel about you
going into the falls, especially alone.

21
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,490
- Ahem... she's not alone sir.
- You don't count weiner.

22
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,510
- Yes, there's my place and he
just put me in it... thankyou.

23
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,945
- C'mon young lady we're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.

24
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,695
- So... should I just, um, wait here or...?

25
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,725
- Yeh you don't scare me mother nature, there's nothing you can throw at me that I can't handle.

26
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,640
- Whoohoo... I think we're almost there.
- We better be I've just lost the steering.

27
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:11,850
- Has anyone seen Precious, it's her feeding time.
- Mum, Granny's talking about her dead pet again.

28
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,725
- Hey, paws up everybody.
- Paws down, Uncle... please... that is nasty.

29
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,725
- Be careful Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody.

30
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,750
- Bad kitty...
- Rock...!

31
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,750
- Ok, so tell me when exactly will
I be allowed to hang out with boys?

32
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,688
- When I'm dead... plus 3 days
just to make sure I'm dead.

33
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:05,555
- Manny, are you ok...?

34
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:11,455
- Get off... my face.

35
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:16,555
- That was fun...
now, who should I eat first?

36
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,455
- Uncle Morgan, can that really be you?
- Hey... hey...

37
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,475
- Sorry, sorry...

38
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:31,775
- Mum, dad... pop.
Marshall...

39
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,265
- Hey...
- Granny?

40
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,775
- This rump is ripe for picking.

41
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,675
- Oh, my whole familiar.
- See, he still hugs his parents.

42
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:44,876
- I never thought I would see my little baby again, we've been searching everywhere for you.

43
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,925
- You have? I knew it, I knew it...
deep down I  knew I wasn't abandoned.

44
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:56,500
- Ahah that's incorrect, we totally abandoned you.
- But... we always missed you. Right...

45
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:05,510
- Yeh, right. Yeh, yeh, yeh... And we just knew Sid would want to see his poor dear Granny before... her time is up.

46
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,510
- I'll bury y'all and dance on your grave.
- So frail.

47
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,560
- And she can't wait to spend time with you Sid.
- Oh yeh... Granny, Granny?

48
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,405
- Oww...
- Granny...
- I don't get to have any fun.

49
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,875
- Why don't you show her your cave hmm...
yeh, she could use a  nap.

50
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:34,450
- Boy, there's so much to tell you. You know a lot has happened since the last time I saw you.
- Not interested.

51
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,670
- But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age...
didn't make sense but sure was exciting.

52
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,160
- We're getting rid of the crazy wretch, lets go...

53
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't
just leave Sid'll be crushed. Whoa, whoa...

54
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:53,750
- Sorry cookie things are breaking apart back home.
- Nope, we're headed inland and Granny is just dead weight.

55
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:54,543
- See ya.

56
00:07:56,483 --> 00:08:00,545
- And warn the community...
she tends to wander.

57
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:03,563
- Well that explains a lot about Sid.

58
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,903
- Mum... dad do you have
Granny's teeth, she can't find'em.

59
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,613
- Hey, can you chew this thing for me?

60
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,753
- Guys... where is everyone?
- I'll handle this.

61
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,520
Sid... your family was wiped out by an asteroid...
sorry.

62
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:30,875
- What...
- Ahem... what Diego is trying to say is... they left.

63
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,580
They only wanted to find you so
you could take care of Granny.

64
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:39,525
- Oh c'mon, c'mon what kind of sick family
would ditch their old Granny with someone...

65
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:51,445
that's just  crazy... that's just... that's just... my family.
- At least you still have Granny, right buddy.

66
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,645
- Yeh... Granny. Granny...? Granny...?
Wow, for an old girl she moves fast.

67
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,545
Granny...
- Granny...
- Granny.

68
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:07,585
- Come out, come out wherever you are.
- C'mon Granny.

69
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:15,605
- Here Granny, Granny... Granny... Granny... I have  prunes for ya. Just the way ya like them... Blehh...

70
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:23,455
- I... don't want to see that...
Huh...? Oh no...

71
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:28,505
- What if you dad finds out, I'm not as tough as I  look.
- Wait, sshhtt... do you hear that?

72
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,118
- Go long...

73
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:44,958
- Hey look, there's Ethan.

74
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:48,470
- Yaay.... Ethan...
You go boy....

75
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,470
- Yehh...

76
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,408
- See... fun, no danger.

77
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,158
- Check me out.

78
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,950
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not... fine.

79
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,890
I did not just do that, that was crazy.
- Nice...

80
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:27,408
- Isn't he perfect.
- Perfect... ehhh it, it's such a
strong word, maybe adequate.

81
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,768
- Who are we stalking, is it Ethan?
- I bet it's Ethan.
- Ok... we know...

82
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:33,425
- What are you guys doing here?
- Manny told us to keep an eye on you.

83
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:40,408
- But not to let you see us under any circumstances.
- Ohh... Stupid, stupid, stupid... stupid...

84
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:45,745
- Ok, I'm going for it. Do I look ok?... Louis.

85
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,658
- Ok doesn't even begin to cover it.

86
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:54,055
- Oh Louis, you're the greatest friend ever....

87
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:57,708
- Thats me.

88
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:05,828
- Hi Ethan, my name's Peaches... what's yours?  Oooh, what am I doing. Ok just be cool, just be cool...

89
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,208
- Yep hoho, that's intense.

90
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:25,115
- No, no, no... noooo....

91
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:30,545
- Gross, it's that weirdo that chills with possums.

92
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:40,545
- Whoa, what just happened?
- Oh no, Ethan I am so sorry I... Wow... even better looking up close, phenomenal, I mean...

93
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,955
- You have a twin sister?

94
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,445
- Am I interrupting something?
- Dad.

95
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:47,545
- Oh boy. Ok...
- Sorry, I just...

96
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,545
- Wait...
- No, you go...
- Move back, good...

97
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,645
- You, keep away from my daughter.
- Dad, nothing...

98
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,345
- And you, you're grounded.
- But I didn't...

99
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,545
- Grounded...
- Loser alert...

100
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:03,345
- Seriously, that's embarrassing...
- What a freak...

101
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,345
- Peaches.

102
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:12,100
Awww.... Peaches c'mon lets talk about this.

103
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:17,645
- How could you embarrass me in front of my friends.
- You deliberately went where you weren't supposed to.

104
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:23,145
- You can't control my life.
- I'm trying to protect you. That's what fathers do.

105
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:26,580
- Well... I wish you weren't my father.

106
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,570
- She's just upset honey.

107
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,620
Peaches it's not the end of the world.

108
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,760
- Whoa, excuse me.
- I don't think that was you.

109
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,180
- Oh what was that?
- I don't know. Stay there... I'll come to you.

110
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,080
Ellie...
- Manny...

111
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,380
No...

112
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,880
- Dad.
- Peaches, get back.

113
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,480
- Hurry dad hurry, hurry.
- Manny.

114
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,780
- Diego...
- You never would have made it.

115
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,645
- Ellie, behind you.
- What's happening?

116
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,775
- Go to the land-bridge,
you'll be safe on the other side.

117
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,745
- No Manny, no.
- I'll meet you there.

118
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:10,175
- Manny...... No...
- Ellie, you have to get out of here. Go! Go now!

119
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,455
- Mum...
- Get back... get back.

120
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:52,885
- Daddy....

121
00:14:55,215 --> 00:15:02,475
- Stay alive.
No matter how long it takes... I will find you.

122
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:09,280
- Mum, this is all my fault. If I'd just...
- Peaches this is not your fault, ok.

123
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,175
- What if I never see him again and
the last thing we did was fight.

124
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,675
- Hey... your father is the toughest most
stubborn mammoth that I have ever met.

125
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,875
He'll come back for us... that's a promise.

126
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,480
- C'mon, help me turn this thing around.

127
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,680
- Everyone, please settle down... don't panic.
- Wait mum, where's Louis, we have to find him.

128
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,335
- Ok... fast.

129
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,434
- They need me, we've gotta get back.

130
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:01,680
- Buddy this thing's too big to turn,
the current's pulling us out.

131
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,845
- You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.

132
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,680
- Was this before she abandoned you?

133
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:15,580
- Yes it was... but the point being that even though things look bad there's a rainbow 'round  every corner.

134
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,450
It's nothing but smooth sailing ahead....

135
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,685
- Smooth sailing Sid?

136
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,870
- Louis... Louis...
- Louis...

137
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,470
- Weiner...
- Weiner...

138
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,870
- Weiner...
- Weiner...

139
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,570
- Louis where are you, come on we have to go.

140
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,370
- Louis.
- Peaches.

141
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:57,370
- Louis, you have to jump.
- No, no... save yourselves.

142
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:00,570
- We're not leaving without you
- I'll think on this.

143
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,370
- Jump...

144
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,650
- This is why I travel underground.

145
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:21,270
- Thanks for coming back.
- What do you mean, you don't leave a friend behind.

146
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:26,895
- Great, lets go.
That wall is going to keep moving and crush us.

147
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,850
We need to get to the land-bridge.
Any questions?

148
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,620
- Ooh Ooh...
- Yes?

149
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,875
- When you drink water through your
trunk does it taste like boogers?

150
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,670
- Ahhh.... no... well sometimes.
Lets move.

151
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,412
- Just keep your eye on the horizon.
- I can't find the horizon.

152
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,770
- Whoa...
- Holy crab...!

153
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,175
Hold me...

154
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:31,470
If I don't make it,
find me a wife and tell her I love her....

155
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,860
We made it. Come on ocean, is that the best
you can do... am I right buddy?

156
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:05,770
Hey... there really is a rainbow around every corner.

157
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,127
- Peaches.....!

158
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,658
You ok?
- I'm just so worried about my dad.

159
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,085
- Listen, we're gonna get to him. At this
pace we'll stay ahead of the wall and we'll

160
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:43,578
make it to the land-bridge before you know it.
We're all gonna survive this.

161
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,778
Ok, maybe they won't but everyone
else... totally fine.

162
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,985
- We're still heading away from home.

163
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:23,478
- Yeh but we survived and we still have each other. Things could be worse... right.

164
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:27,478
- For once, he's actually right.
We made it through storms and tidal-waves

165
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:32,478
and a vicious assortment of seafood...
what more can they hit us with?

166
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:33,810
Oww....

167
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:41,582
Hello.... What the...?
- Dag nabit, I'm trying to sleep.

168
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:45,795
- Granny... you're alive.
- And can we say how thrilled we are to see you.

169
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,795
- Hey fats, you wanna get me out of here....
- Whoo.

170
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:54,895
- Hey... pretend I'm a dessert...
that should motivate you.

171
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,885
- I can't believe this...
you slept through that storm.

172
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:04,495
- Aaahh, I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorn.

173
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,705
Thanks for drawin' my bath Sidney.
- Granny, grab my paw.

174
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:12,705
- No way, this is my first bath in decades.

175
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,125
- There's your proof.

176
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,625
- Quick, somebody do something.

177
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,440
I got you Granny.
- Get off'a me.

178
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:28,375
- Granny...

179
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:36,725
- What are you peepin' toms all lookin' at?
Lady can't take a bath in peace.

180
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,625
I'll wallop you with a wallop you...

181
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:41,725
- What's the life expectancy of a female sloth?

182
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:47,565
- Oh , she'll outlive us all you know that, right. Yeh, the spiteful ones live the longest.

183
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:10,425
- How big is this ocean?
- Water, water... everywhere. Not a drop to drink.

184
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:12,755
Uh, except maybe that drop.

185
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:19,988
Hmm that's a little.... salty...

186
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:26,765
- Precious... mummy's calling you...
Precious... Precious sweety...

187
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,325
Hey lady... have you seen Precious?

188
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:34,825
- If you mean the imaginary or perhaps deceased pet that you keep searching for... No... I haven't.

189
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:40,955
- Guys, look... where there's birds there's land, right?
- Hey buddy, come here.

190
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,055
- No wait, wait... come back.

191
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:47,780
Come back.

192
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:09,465
- It's a huge bounty Capitan, four passengers
ripe for the taking. One very smelly and one very plump.

193
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:17,665
- In my ocean... what a terrible turn
of events. I love a terrible turn of events.

194
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,875
- Am I hallucinating or is that ice
coming straight towards us.

195
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:35,470
- Yeh, yeh, it's coming. It sounds
like there's animals on it.

196
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,470
- Yippee... we're being rescued,
we're being rescued.

197
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,470
- I hear laughter.

198
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,470
- Oooh, must be a party cruise.

199
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,470
- Hey, they look fluffy.
- I get the big woolly one.

200
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,570
- Wow...

201
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,755
- Get ready to slice and dice boys.
- Knock it off Squint, wait for Captains' orders.

202
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:33,925
- Ahoy down there... how lucky are you. Do you know these waters are infested with pirates, right boys...

203
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,185
Glad we found you before they did.

204
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,270
Captain Gutt here to help.

205
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:44,260
- You know, that's a nice monkey.

206
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:52,570
- Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.

207
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:55,650
- The continent... that pile of rubble...

208
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:01,285
- My family's there so if you could just...

209
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:09,470
- Awww, your family... that is so sweet. I hope you said goodbye because there's no way back.

210
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:14,470
- Yes there is... don't you remember Captain. You can sail to Switchback Cove

211
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:18,570
and catch a current back from there.
Haha, steel-trap this noggin' is...

212
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,575
- Hahaha... thankyou Mr. Flynn.
- Oww.....

213
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:26,445
- See, I knew there was a way home.
- There is no home...

214
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,680
...there is only here and here,
your ship belongs to me...

215
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,710
Battle Stations...!!

216
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,655
- Fly the Colours...!!

217
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:50,775
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.

218
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,410
- Or face your furry what?
- Not furry... fury.

219
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,215
Fire!

220
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,120
- Hit the mast... win a prize.

221
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:08,380
- Fire the starboard cannon.
- I... love... this... job...!

222
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
- Shira... fetch.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

223
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,470
- Aww, you almost made it.
- I don't fight girls.

224
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,780
- Huhhuh... I can see why.

225
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,455
- Belly-flop...

226
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,355
- Lets rumba tiny...

227
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,255
- Lights out big-fella...

228
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:50,015
- Hello.

229
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:53,756
- Hey buddy... welcome to the party.

230
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480
- Lets see what kinda moves you got.
Dance little scrab-fish.

231
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,288
- Dodge the coconut ball...

232
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,750
- Happy days.... Oohmm...

233
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,780
Oohh... look at him.

234
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,480
Where's my booty, has anyone seen it?
- Flynn, it's right behind you.

235
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:19,480
- Where? Where's my booty. I can't see it.
- Yuk... it's all I can see.

236
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,480
- Ooh, this is a lovely vacation...
best I've ever had.

237
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,550
- Mornin' sunshine... let me be the first to
extend a hand of friendship.

238
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,550
- That's your foot.
- Hohoho... nothing gets by you, does it.

239
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,850
- What do you want?

240
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,550
- I bet you're feeling lost... scared...
confused. Allow me to explain.

241
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:45,650
Help me out boys...
- Oooh, Captains' going to sing a shanty...

242
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,110
- Aye, aye,  Captain Gutts...

243
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,510
- Aww... jeeez...

244
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:44,750
- Kill them? Hoho, me? No, no... well,
at least not this very large, useful mammoth.

245
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,720
- Hey, hands off.
- Anyway...

246
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,540
- We really should be leaving...

247
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,410
- We gotta get going...

248
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,650
- How I wish we could be staying...

249
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,220
- Oh please...

250
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,210
- Good shanty sir...

251
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:32,430
Captain Gutt... really? You know, I have a little paunch too but ahh... I wouldn't name myself after it.

252
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,410
- Thats funny... you're a funny guy.
But that's not how I got my name...

253
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,410
These... got me my name.

254
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:47,410
- I don't get it.
- No? Ok, let me give you a visual aid.
I just gently press here...

255
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,885
- It tickles.
- And go down like this...

256
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,560
- And then your innards become your outs...

257
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,885
- Um, I still don't get it.

258
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:07,650
- Look, as much as I'm tempted to join a monkey, the Easter Bunny and a giant bag of pudding... I'll pass.

259
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:10,670
No one's gonna stop me getting back to my family.

260
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,465
- I'm gonna lambado your liver buddy.

261
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,340
Let me at him.

262
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:24,685
- That family is going to be the death of you.
First mate, jettison the dead weight.

263
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,410
- Aye, aye sir. Prepare the plank
- Prepare the plank.

264
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,410
- Preparing the plank.

265
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,410
- Heh...
- Ow.... What, you want me to walk into the water?

266
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,410
I can't because I ate less than 20 mins
ago and you know the rule.

267
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,550
- That's a myth...
- Oh ok, as long as it's safe.

268
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,410
- Wait...
- Thank goodness.

269
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,350
- Dump the wench too...

270
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,710
Ladies first.
- Such a nice boy.

271
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,640
Why can't you be more like him Sidney.
- Granny... no, wait...

272
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:02,525
- Manny... get me to the vine.

273
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:05,135
- Yeh, yeh, got it.

274
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:12,475
- Hmmhmmhmm... hmhmhm. you'all
got some ugly goldfish.

275
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:15,575
- C'mon, a little bit more.

276
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:23,575
- Hmm? No...!

277
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,575
- Take that mammoth.
- Go on Manny, kick that monkeys' butt...

278
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:37,475
- Look at you, 11 tons of land-lubber flubber.
- Hey, I'm not fat... I'm poomfy...

279
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:42,485
- Too bad tubby... I could have used you.
- Ain't gonna happen Captain.

280
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:53,476
- I got you Granny.
- Giddee up, lets go.

281
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,685
- Can anyone have bounties.

282
00:34:07,455 --> 00:34:09,325
- No, my bounty...

283
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:29,485
- They sank our battleship, what are
we gonna do... we're all gonna drown.

284
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:35,285
- You're a sea creature you idiot.
- Oh... Quite... sir.

285
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,485
- Should I flag a white Captain?
- No...!

286
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,485
- Wait, what about Shira?
- What about her.

287
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:46,885
- Yeh, what about her.
- Anyone else want to play Captain?

288
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:47,485
...Good.

289
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:50,485
- Now come on blubber-brain, swim.

290
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:58,071
- Hey... Gutt... Flynn... anyone there?
- Here, grab hold.

291
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:02,421
- No, go away... I'd rather drown.
- Whatever the lady wants.

292
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:10,851
- I said I didn't need your help.
- Your welcome...

293
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:13,851
wassup... care to join our scurvy crew.

294
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:19,335
- Two sloths, a mammoth and a sabre?
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.

295
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:23,485
- And we saved you... that makes
you the punchline... kitty.

296
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:27,585
- Don't... call me kitty.
- Ok I won't...

297
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:29,673
...kitty.

298
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,551
- If they kiss I'm gonna puke.
- What? Wait... no...

299
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,085
- I don't think we're ever going to get there?
- Maybe we should rest for a few hours.

300
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,480
- Night Alex...

301
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,655
- I miss you dad.

302
00:36:18,895 --> 00:36:21,575
- Well that's something you don't see everyday.

303
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,875
- Ethan... Hi....

304
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,075
Meant... to do that.

305
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:33,775
- I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.
- What... No... This just helps me think.

306
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:37,775
It gets the blood to the old noggin'
and away from the old... whatever.

307
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:42,875
- Ahh... ok, that's a little weird.

308
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:55,675
So, how you doing... you know, with all of this.
- Honestly, a little scared. Ok, a lot scared.

309
00:36:55,885 --> 00:37:03,475
Everything we knew is gone.
- Yeah, I was pretty scared too. I mean, not scared... you know, like concerned.

310
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:10,475
Hey, um, do you want to walk with me tomorrow? Try and get our minds off all of this stuff.
- You want to walk with me.

311
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:17,775
- Well, you did almost flatten me this morning so I figure it can't really go worse than that, right.
- Yeah...

312
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:25,875
- Oh, just one thing, totally no big deal but... you might want to lose the mohawk.
- Louis... yeah, sure... not a problem.

313
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:33,875
Aahhh... wow...
- Someone looks happy.

314
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:42,775
- Ethan's great isn't he.
- Baby, I know you like this one but just don't let anyone change who you are, ok.

315
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:43,675
- I know.

316
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,550
- You coming up?

317
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:57,755
- I think I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
- Ok... night baby.

318
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:02,555
- Night mum... Night dad.

319
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:21,555
- Hey, chew this sandwich for me.
- Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us.

320
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:26,015
- Aaah, they think that we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.

321
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,195
- It's a rat...

322
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:38,695
- Screw-up.
- Oh Sid...

323
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:45,990
- Never make home on this thing.
- Huh well, maybe you should have thought of that before you capsized our 'berg genius.

324
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,325
- Yeh, trying to escape.
- Wimp...

325
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:48,325
- Whiner...
- Crybaby...

326
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:50,945
- Land...!
- Yeah, land... Wait. What?

327
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,455
- Not her... there!

328
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,976
Land!!

329
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,765
Everyone paddle, paddle.

330
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:28,855
- Food... Aww, I miss you so much.
Look at me, I've wasted away.

331
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:39,785
- Ok, snack time's over. We gotta build a raft.
- Manny...

332
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:45,855
- Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.
- Go get her, she can help us get back.

333
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:46,475
- Shira...

334
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,275
- Gotcha...

335
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:13,875
Ohh....

336
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:23,875
- Let go of me.
- Where do you think you're going?

337
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:25,126
Whoa....

338
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:30,676
Switchback Cove... it's the way home.

339
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:32,876
Oh... no...

340
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:38,456
- You call this a ship you miserable runts?
- Yeh you little runts... get to work.

341
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,460
- Faster you worthless worthy sons of
sorry excuses for shark-bait weevils..

342
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,460
- What did he say?
- I dunno...

343
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:51,480
- Now get this chunk of ice seaworthy by
sundown or I will keel-haul the lot of you.

344
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,480
- So, what do you think.
- Two words... Anger... Management.

345
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,410
- I'm talking about the current...
Diego's right, we've found a way home.

346
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,470
- Yes that's great... too bad
we don't have a ship.

347
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,680
- Sure we do, it's right there.

348
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,310
- Yeh well...
- Guys... sssshh... the trees have ears.

349
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,680
- Wait a minute, maybe we can
help each other.

350
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,850
Hey little fellas. Hey, come on out. No, no, no. no, it's ok, we're not gonna hurt ya.

351
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:56,480
How about you and us against
the pirates, huh?

352
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,480
You got no idea what I'm saying do ya.
Ok, ahh... ship me want.

353
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:08,880
- Yeah, nice try jungle-jim.
- Yeh go ahead make fun ok, he got it.

354
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Oh... Ahh... thankyou.

355
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,896
- Ah, may I try?
- Yeh, knock yourself out.

356
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,680
- Ok... watch this.

357
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,220
Sick sloths sip broth...
Sick sloths sip broth...

358
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:49,875
- That they got...?

359
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,840
- Yep... they're ready.
- Great, we'll free your buddies we can all work together to kick a little pirate booty.

360
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,650
- Easy kitty... water... you need it.

361
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,420
- I don't need anything from you.

362
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:38,920
- Fine, die of thirst that'll really show me.
- Wait. I'll take it... thankyou.

363
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,420
- You know, you have a way of saying thankyou that makes it sound like drop dead.

364
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,575
- It's a gift. You're pretty soft... for a sabre.

365
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,925
- Excuse me... I am not soft ok, I happen
to be a remorseless assassin.

366
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:56,885
- Diego-poo... hey, I made you another
coral necklace... he keeps losing them.

367
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
- Yeah, I think I get why I'm starting
to get why you're not in a pack.

368
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,520
- Listen I chose to leave my pack, alright.

369
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,520
- Congratulations warrior princess, so did I.
- Really?

370
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,520
- What?
- Nothing... I just... I know how hard that is... walking away from everthing you know.

371
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,420
- Oh great... what, are we going
to braid each others fur now?

372
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,520
- Funny, really funny. Can I tell you
the difference between you and me.

373
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,920
- I won't still be wearing their necklace.

374
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:28,380
- No. We both might have wanted
out of our pack-life but at least

375
00:44:28,383 --> 00:44:31,780
I didn't trade one pack-life for
another. I got something more.

376
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:36,156
- Oh yeah... what's that.
- A herd...
- What's the difference?

377
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,555
- We have each others backs.
- Gutt has my back. I'm his First Mate.

378
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,555
- Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.

379
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:54,145
- You know you won't beat him. Your big furry friend over there, he has no idea what he's up against.
- Yeah, but neither does Gutt.

380
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,775
- With the vines, don't let go until
we're all on board.

381
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,645
Ok, we need precision timing from
everyone to get that ship.

382
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:02,865
Half-pint, you've got your end covered, right.

383
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:09,245
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

384
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,445
Diego...
- I'll free his little friends.

385
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,445
- Sid and Granny...
- Sir, untie the ship... sir.

386
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:20,545
- Right, unwind the vines... don't let go until we're all on board. We're relying on you Sid... you got that.

387
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:26,155
- Yes sir, totally focussed sir.
- Don't worry, it'll be easy since we
don't have to guard Shira anymore.

388
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:32,565
- We need to move... now.

389
00:45:33,255 --> 00:45:36,455
- Batten down the hatches.
Brad, hoist the anchor.

390
00:45:36,885 --> 00:45:39,885
And Gumpta, fly the colours.
- More sports, Captain.

391
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:45,255
- We'll settin' sail for vengance lads.
- Whoo... I love vengance.

392
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:52,355
- Captain...
- Shira... Oh what a relief, I'd thought we'd lost you.

393
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,185
- The mammoth, he washed ashore with me... He's...

394
00:45:55,188 --> 00:46:01,225
- What, he's here... Did you sink your
fangs into him? Did he beg for his life?

395
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,975
- No, the sabre took me down.

396
00:46:03,145 --> 00:46:13,145
- Whaa... you're a failure. I need warriors and all I have are kitty cats and bunny rabbits
- And a seal and a kangaroo...

397
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:22,865
- You take the sabre down or you
die trying... no excuses.
- Yes Captain.

398
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:27,965
- Mr. Squint...
- Aye sir...
- You're First Mate now.

399
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:36,465
- Yohoho and a bottle of who-with-me Captain. Out of my way sailor... you answer to me now.
- Gutt listen... he's coming for the...

400
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,150
- Huh....?

401
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,150
- Grab your weapons mates.

402
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,450
- Yes...
- A spoon Flynn?
- No...

403
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,170
- Follow me...

404
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,655
- Let me at him...
- Yeh, it's their turn now...

405
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:39,610
- Guys, it's not necessary really.
And yeah, I love you too. Yeah...

406
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,510
- Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up...

407
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,550
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

408
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,550
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

409
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,815
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let... oh, yummo.

410
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:59,750
- Sid, no, it's a lolus berry, it'll paralyse you.
- Oh please... I know my berries.

411
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:09,850
- Don't.... swallow...
- I'm fine, if there's one thing I know
it's berries... Oh oh...

412
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,650
- Yeah, finally...

413
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,850
Who's the Easter bunny now.

414
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,990
- It worked... he bought it.
- C'mon.

415
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:59,575
- Oh no... it's been a diversion.
- Oh no... I'm having a blast.

416
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,985
- No pinhead, they're stealing my ship.

417
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:14,450
- One thing Sid... you couldn't do one thing. Look at you... Sid can you hear me.
- Bye bye...

418
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,320
- Say something buddy.
- Whoa...

419
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,125
lets go...

420
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,805
- The ship... c'mon, we've got
to catch it before it hits open water.

421
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,365
Sorry, I'll hold you higher... Sorry... Sorry...

422
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,770
- Say adieu mammoth....
- Owww...

423
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,320
- Sorry buddy.

424
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,790
I'm coming Sid.

425
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,645
I gotya... I gotcha... gotcha...

426
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,970
- I'm coming for you mammoth.

427
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,350
- Diego, c'mon...

428
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,670
C'mon move it.

429
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,650
- Why are you doing this?
- You don't understand I don't have a choice.

430
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:52,750
- You don't have to live this was Shira... you'll be safe with us. We take care of each other.

431
00:50:52,775 --> 00:50:55,750
- Diego... I can't hold on much longer....

432
00:50:57,776 --> 00:50:58,550
Diego...

433
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,875
- Come with us... come with me.

434
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,340
- What are you doing?
- I've got your back...

435
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:44,450
- So long banana breath...
Thanks for the ship.

436
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,770
- Oh no, he's gone forever... Oh, there he is.

437
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:27,940
- Shore leave's over. Get your sorry
carcasses on board... now.

438
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,150
- Gutt, I can explain.

439
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:49,650
- When this ends, I'll have a tiger skin
hanging on my wall. I don't care who's...

440
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:59,845
That mammoth has taken my ship,
my bounty and now the loyalty of my crew.

441
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:04,890
I will destroy him and everything he loves.

442
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,280
- Wait for it... wait for it....

443
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,775
That was awesome.

444
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,150
- Can I ask you guys something.
How are you both so happy,

445
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,650
doesn't it weigh on you that
the world might be ending...

446
00:54:09,715 --> 00:54:18,125
- Can I tell him our secret?... Come here... come here... we're very, very stupid.

447
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:30,875
- But still, you're not a tinsy bit concerned
about... I don't know, say imminent death!
- Beep...

448
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,555
- I'm gonna go find Peaches.

449
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:42,955
- Hey guys over here, c'mon it's a
short-cut. You're gonna love this...

450
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,205
- C'mon guys, lets have some fun...

451
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:50,970
- Oooh, wow, this is so cool...
it's like we're upside down.
- That is amazing...

452
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:52,750
- Echo...

453
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:56,770
- Huh...?

454
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:02,750
- Too bad your mohawk friend isn't here, huh.
- You're not really friends with him are you?

455
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,940
- Yeah, come clean Peaches.
- Are you friends with that awful little rodent or not?

456
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:14,610
- I mean Louis and I we hang out... or whatever. But no, we're not really friend friends.

457
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:19,130
- Not friends...
- Louis... I...

458
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,660
- Busted...

459
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,310
- I mean...

460
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,980
- Good to know.
- Louis... wait.

461
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:29,260
- Oww...

462
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:36,540
- Haha... he even runs away like a loser.
- Whoa Peaches, don't stress... you're with us now.

463
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,540
- Yeah, stress is so... stressful.
- Yeah girl, if you want to stress it out like that...

464
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:54,340
- Err, guys... we should get outta here.
- Are you kidding, this is epic.

465
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,850
- Go, go, go...

466
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:12,880
- Yeah...
- How sick was that... Yo, that was insane. Hey Peach loosen up... have some fun.

467
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,550
- Fun...! You call that fun... I'm outta here,
- Come on, I mean... do you really want to go back

468
00:56:18,553 --> 00:56:22,670
to hanging out with a weird mole hog for
a week than getting along with us.

469
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,440
- I mean, it's bad enough that your
family's half possum...

470
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:29,440
- Bad enough...? There's nothing bad
about being part of my family.

471
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,770
I make like hanging by my tail and if you genious's are normal the species is going to end up extinct.

472
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,850
- Ah, yeah. Well your species is going to be extinct first.
- Haha, Burrrnnn....

473
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:44,770
- We're the same species genious.
- What.... double burrrnnn.

474
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:10,550
- Hey, I can wriggle my toe again... the important one... the little piggy who went to market.

475
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:16,550
Wait, I'm talking again. Oh, I had so many things trapped inside of me that I couldn't say

476
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:22,750
... like "Hey, I'm not dead..."
and why'd it hurt me in the eye but not in an ear.

477
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:25,450
- I'll push him overboard, you guys
say it was an accident.

478
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:26,445
- And why do males have nipples?

479
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,450
- I'm in... how about you Diego.

480
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:36,770
Diego... Hey relax buddy Captain Crazy and his floating petting zoo are history. C'mon, we're finally heading home.

481
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:41,750
- I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't eat, can't sleep... Maybe I'm coming down with something.

482
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:48,750
- Hohohoo... I know what you've got.... The "L" word.
- Yeah, leprosy.

483
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:56,485
- No Sid, no. It's four letters, starts with L ends with E.
- Ahha, lice...

484
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:02,750
- No... Diego, my friend, is in love.
- Oh yeah... Love.

485
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:08,750
- You mean with the pirate?... No.
- Oh, Shira's gotten under your skin, c'mon admit it.

486
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,850
- A rugged sabre like you...
- A more rugged sabre like her...

487
00:58:13,005 --> 00:58:21,975
- No, no, no, you guys are dead wrong.
- Denial is the clincher... You're in love pussycat.

488
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:27,175
- Diego and Shira sitting in a tree,
K.I.S.S.I.N.G...
- K.I.S.S.I.N.G...

489
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,705
- Real mature guys... real mature.

490
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,430
- Diego.....

491
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,880
- Diego.....
- Shira....?

492
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:54,775
- I wanted to come with you...
- She's beautiful...

493
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:02,730
- Sid... I adore a sloth who cares
nothing about personal hygiene.
- That's me... baby.

494
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:11,830
- Granny... come to me Granny...
- Well... hello.

495
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:20,670
- The wrinklier the resin... the sweeter the fruit.
- Woo... Granny like it... Granny like it very much.

496
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,430
- Huh...? Guys, guys,
aren't you paying... attention...

497
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,730
- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie...?
- We're over here Manny.

498
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:36,660
- This way daddy. I really need you.
- I know honey, stay there...

499
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,430
...I'm coming.

500
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,430
- You were right Manny,
you're always right.

501
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:48,230
- No, no, look I...
Wait a minute, Ellie would never say that.

502
00:59:48,535 --> 00:59:53,395
- Manny... Manny...
- No, no, they're not real... they're monsters.

503
00:59:53,175 --> 01:00:00,125
<i>They're Sirens, don't listen to them.
"Who can take the sunrise.... sprinkle it with dew"</i>

504
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:07,270
No, they may look real but they're not,
they're going to destroy the ship.

505
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:10,705
- Come my tiger, swim with me.

506
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:20,995
- Sid.... I have a snack for you, uhuhbleh....
- And she cooks too.

507
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:23,675
- Sid... no!

508
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:42,575
- Why are we kissing?
- Um... because cruises are romantic.

509
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,875
- Whoo... five for seconds and we
would've been goners.

510
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:51,975
- Call me...
- MmmMmm, Uhuhh...

511
01:01:08,675 --> 01:01:10,665
- Yoohoo...

512
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:07,425
- Here girl... here Precious...
- She thinks she finally found her pet.

513
01:02:08,255 --> 01:02:09,525
- Good girl...

514
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:14,825
- Here you go...
- Look Granny, can't you throw imaginary
food to your imaginary pet?

515
01:02:16,425 --> 01:02:20,725
- Enough already...
We need to keep a lookout for home.

516
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:23,865
- Ignore them Precious... I do.

517
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,880
- Nah, can't take your eyes off her for one minute.

518
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,470
- Nope, it's like having a child...

519
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,270
...only without any of the joy.

520
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,550
- Hey brains trust... brace for impact.
- Huh...?

521
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:53,455
Guys... look, we're almost home.
- Buddy, I never doubted ya.

522
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,660
- Me either. Well... except for the six or
seven times I thought you were gonna die.

523
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,695
- What's wrong sweetheart?
- You ever say something you
knew you couldn't take back.

524
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,880
- Is this about Louis?
- I messed up so bad, mum.

525
01:03:20,895 --> 01:03:27,210
- It's ok, it happens. Cute boys can
whiplash a brain... no doubt about that.

526
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:32,890
- But Ethan was the wrong guy.
- And you figured it out. You'll know what to say to Louis.

527
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,490
- What's going on?

528
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:49,190
- The land-bridge... it's gone.

529
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,090
- We're trapped.

530
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,190
- But we were supposed to meet dad here...
What are we gonna do?

531
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:16,750
- Ellie... Peaches...

532
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:25,060
- Oh no, the land-bridge.
- But, if it's gone then how are we gonna...

533
01:04:25,065 --> 01:04:27,690
- Sid...
- No... they have to be on the other side.

534
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:36,190
- Manny, there is no other side.
- They have to be here. Ellie... Peaches... I'm here...

535
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,790
Please, she's gotta be here.

536
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:53,490
Wait, wait, did you hear that?
- Manny...

537
01:04:53,495 --> 01:04:55,860
- No, I... I heard something. I heard it.

538
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:01,150
- Is that...?
- Peaches... There she is.

539
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,690
- Dad...
- We're coming sweetie. Don't move.

540
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,450
- Daddy...
- Peaches...

541
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,780
- Welcome home daddy...
- Let go of me.

542
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:16,350
- What the odds, we we're just talking about you.

543
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:21,750
You like the new ship...
I call her Sweet Revenge.

544
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,150
- And look here,
we've got ze catch-de-jour.

545
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:31,770
- Ellie.
- I'm alright. Let my daughter go.

546
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,750
- It's ok, he wants me...
and he's gonna get me.

547
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:47,150
- Sacrificing yourself for your daughter...
how touching... how predictable.

548
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,750
Now come and get her.

549
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,850
- G'day mate...
- You remember us... we're the bad guys.

550
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:07,650
- Alright, let them go.
- I don't think so. You destroyed everything I had...

551
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:09,850
I'm just returning the favour.

552
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,125
- No...!

553
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:17,465
- I warned you.
- Stop...!!

554
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:23,665
Let... the mammoth... go...
- Weiner?...

555
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,805
- Hoho... ohoh... who brought the muscle to the party?
- Louis don't.

556
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:33,665
- What's he doing, he's gonna get himself killed.
- It's ok, I can handle him.

557
01:06:33,675 --> 01:06:40,865
- How cute, a hero... lets see what bravery gets you. Gupta, give the lad your weapon.

558
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,110
- Nice knowing you kid.

559
01:06:56,455 --> 01:06:58,675
- Lets dance, hero.

560
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:15,475
Ooowwww...!!

561
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,885
Don't stand there like barnacles... get him.

562
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:23,855
- Oi, going somewhere mate?

563
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:30,585
- Let me at him.

564
01:07:35,575 --> 01:07:36,795
- Any last words?

565
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:41,880
- Precious....
- Will you stop with the Precious...

566
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,950
- Mummy...

567
01:07:49,185 --> 01:07:52,385
- Well, I guess we showed them... huh.
- Precious...

568
01:07:52,395 --> 01:07:54,255
- That's your pet...

569
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:00,585
Maybe that crazy old bat isn't that crazy after all.

570
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:10,485
- You waiting for a formal invitation fancy pants... get in.
- I'm gonna regret this.

571
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:16,685
- Flags away...
- Ow...

572
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:23,145
- Don't be a scaredy cat.

01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:40,785
- Back off.
- It's ok... I'm on your side.

575
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:43,985
- I knew you were a traitor.

576
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:48,165
- Oh your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutist way when you're mad.

577
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:54,385

01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:03,475
- Peaches... No... It's too dangerous.
- Not if your half-possum.

592
01:10:19,445 --> 01:10:23,445
- She did it... my daughter's all grownup.

593
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:29,955
- That's my girl...

594
01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:36,885
We need to get out of here...
- Go, go, I'm right behind ya.

No...

597
01:10:54,245 --> 01:10:56,445
- There's nowhere to run Manny.

598
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:11,845
You know this ocean isn't big
enough for the both of us.

599
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:16,775
- Don't worry, you won't take
up much space once I flatten you.

600
01:11:30,445 --> 01:11:35,845
- Told ya chubby, you shouldn't have
messed with the master of the seas

601
01:11:36,445 --> 01:11:40,445
- You know, sometimes... it
pays to weigh eleven tons...

602
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:44,675
- Nooo....
- Bon voyage.... big boy.

603
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:55,545
- Did somebody hail a whale?

604
01:11:59,045 --> 01:12:01,665
- So, you must be Precious.

605
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:08,225
- Mission accomplished Granny.
- Ha... who says old ladies can't drive.

606
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:25,860
- Oh Captain Gutt...
- That's me...

607
01:12:25,865 --> 01:12:30,845
- Let's rule the seas together...
- Aye, aye...

608
01:12:33,426 --> 01:12:36,845
Nooo.... let me out...

609
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:45,125
- Dad...

610
01:12:47,055 --> 01:12:48,755
- How's that for an entrance.

611
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:55,485
- Dad...

612
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:57,785
- Manny...

613
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:04,585
I told you your father would never give up on us.
- Never...

614
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:11,585
- Hey, I actually... Ow...

615
01:13:14,025 --> 01:13:18,345
- You know Sid, you're not such a screw-up.
- Aahh... really?

616
01:13:18,385 --> 01:13:20,485
- Really!! You're a hero.

617
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:24,785
- You too Granny.
- Thanks lady.

618
01:13:25,385 --> 01:13:30,585
- So, still want me on your scurvy crew?
- You bet, welcome to our herd.

619
01:13:32,885 --> 01:13:38,685
- Hey you... I can't believe you
did that. Thankyou.

620
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:43,585
- Well, someone once told me that no matter what... you never leave a friend behind.

621
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:49,385
- All this sweetness is gonna rot my teeth...
if I had any.

622
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:57,785
- Our home is gone...
Where do we go now?

623
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,885
- Aww... Mumma loves you too...

624
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:53,385
- Whoa... I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah...

625
01:14:53,391 --> 01:14:54,385
- Excuse me...
- Dad...

626
01:14:54,395 --> 01:15:00,895
- When you two get off this ship
I expect you both to... have fun.
- Huh...?

627
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,345
- You're a brave kid weiner.
- Wait...? What...?

628
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:08,875
- You heard me... You two should go out and... and explore. Go where the day takes you...

629
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:14,200
but be back before sunset.
- An hour after sunset...?

630
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:19,235
- Yeh, not a minute later...
- Deal... I love you dad.

631
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:26,845
- Hey, ok if we hang with you guys?
- Sure.

632
01:15:27,345 --> 01:15:32,645
- I always liked him... Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious...

633
01:15:34,345 --> 01:15:38,545
- She's not my little girl anymore.
- And you're both going to be just fine.

634
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:39,675
- I know.

635
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:50,385
- You know Sidney, you've got yourself
a nice family here... A real family.
- Yeh... I'm pretty lucky.

636
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,745
- Here, chew this kiwi for me.
- Na ahh, never again... Tadahhh...

637
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:56,485
- Huh....

638
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:01,935
- Ahhh...

639
01:16:04,345 --> 01:16:05,675
- Hey, sailor...

Stop...

645
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:59,055
Brother, rise above this base desire

646
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,055
