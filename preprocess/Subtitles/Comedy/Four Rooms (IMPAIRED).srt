on a night-by-night basis,

01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:58,962
- $72.1million.
- Ellen, l'm sorry.

1078
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:02,234
That's fucking asses
in fucking seats.

1079
01:17:02,307 --> 01:17:04,275
You know, it's not your f ault.
l mean, they hit you both barrels.

1080
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:06,937
But you know, fuck, you know, l just
would like a little consideration.

1081
01:17:07,012 --> 01:17:09,913
And my new one,
The Dog Catcher,

1082
01:17:09,982 --> 01:17:12,450

1086
01:17:26,965 --> 01:17:29,763
Now, take a look at some of

- Um, f-f ar be it--
Far be it f or me, uh, Chester--
- Uh-huh.

1088
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:37,399
But l was just wondering if you could
tell me, what is all that stuff f or?

1089
01:17:37,476 --> 01:17:39,808
Hey, one thing at a time, man.
l'm not a frog, and you're not a bunny.

1090
01:17:39,878 --> 01:17:42,472
- So let's not jump ahead.
- Very good, sir.

All right, man.
Tell it.

1095
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,158
A block of wood.

Continue.

1097
01:18:00,966 --> 01:18:03,491
- Three nails.
- Why three nails?

1098
01:18:03,569 --> 01:18:07,505
That's how many Peter Lorre
asked f or. Continue, Ted.

1099
01:18:07,573 --> 01:18:09,803
A ball of twine.

1100
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,844
Well, that is definitely
a ball of twine. Continue!

1101
01:18:14,246 --> 01:18:16,908
- A bucket... of ice.
- [ lce Clattering ]

1102

All right.

[ Clears Throat ]

1108
01:18:35,968 --> 01:18:40,769
And... a hatchet!

1109
01:18:40,839 --> 01:18:46,038
""A hatchet as sharp as the devil
himself,"" is what l asked f or.

1110
01:18:46,111 --> 01:18:49,012
Well, sir-- Chester--
you be the judge.

1111

No, no, no, no, no.

lt's a sharp
motherfucker.

1114
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:02,720
Forget the nails and the twine.
Bring all this other bullshit
over to the bar. Come on.

- You're still married, man?
- Yeah. l don't fucking know anymore.

Okay, Ellen, l'm sorry.

Get in a fuckin' car, and go run
over six or seven fuckin' kids?

That'd be real fuckin' nice.

- All right then.

- l'll just be off back downstairs, sir.
- Not so f ast.

- Fuckin' treat that bitch
like a queen, man.
- We're gonna walk back...

- to this little bar here.
- l told you to dump her, didn't l?

1155

- All right.
- Um, sir?

01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:20,064
- Uh-huh.
- A word in your ear, sir.

- l treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- Chester.

1162
01:21:25,337 --> 01:21:27,362
That shit don't help,
treating a woman like a queen.

1163
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,671
- l'm fuckin' working.
- As long as you

l don't give a fuck
what you do.

1165

- Took all your money.
Gonna take your kids and house.
- As f ar as l'm concerned,

01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:38,839
go ahead, trash the place!

1167
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:41,886
Oh, but, look, let me explain
what we're talkin' about.

1168
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:44,421
Sir, sir, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

1169
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:49,222
Whatever constitutes a good
time, as f ar as you guys are
concerned, that's your business.

1170
01:21:49,294 --> 01:21:53,788
Well, no, it's your business too, Ted,
because we want you to take part.

1171
01:21:56,601 --> 01:22:00,367
- [ Tooting ]
- Take part in what, sir?

1172
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:04,273
Chester, your way of breakin'
the news to him gently is
scarin' the fuck outta him.

1173
01:22:04,342 --> 01:22:06,276
- Think so?
- Just spit it out.

1174
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:08,312
Okay, okay, here we go.
Okay.

1175
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,110
Thing is, Ted,
first off,

1176
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:13,981
there's nothing homosexual
about what we want you to do.

1177
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:16,077
l mean, l was thinkin'
you might be thinkin'...

1178
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:18,315
that we want you to do somethin'
like weird sex thing,

1179
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,881
you know, like, suck us off,
pee on us, shit like that.

1180
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:23,120
Nothing, nothing could be
further from the truth.

1181
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:25,755
- Can l just jump in here f or a second?
- No. No.

1182
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:28,732
My kind of way of telling him
is kind of going all around the world.

1183
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,064
- But it's the journey that's worth it.
- Yeah, well, l see that.

1184
01:22:31,136 --> 01:22:34,071
But he's been here f or 15
minutes and you have, you know,
talked about everything but--

1185
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:37,108
- What do you care?
- Why don't you just shut
the fuck up, bitch?

1186
01:22:37,175 --> 01:22:39,268
- ""Bitch""?
- Bitch!

1187
01:22:39,344 --> 01:22:41,938
Uh, excuse me, aren't you the one who's
being paid to suck his cock, cork boy?

1188
01:22:42,013 --> 01:22:45,847
- Whoa!
- Cork boy, man! Business card!

1189
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:48,681
- l see a new business card.
- [ Spoon Tapping Glass ]

1190
01:22:48,753 --> 01:22:50,983
Excuse me, if it
please the court.

1191
01:22:51,056 --> 01:22:55,083
Allow me to present
our intentions to Theodore.

1192
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,028
- l second the nomination.
- l move that nomination be closed!

1193
01:22:59,097 --> 01:23:01,031
- Thank you.
- The court is yours, Leo.

1194
01:23:01,099 --> 01:23:03,192
Thank you very much,
Chester.

1195
01:23:03,268 --> 01:23:08,001
- Ted, you ever seen any of them
old Alfred Hitchcock episodes?
- Yes, sir.

1196
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:12,203
You ever see the one called The Man From
Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen?

1197
01:23:12,277 --> 01:23:14,302
- Uh--
- Ah, if you saw it, you'd remember it.

1198
01:23:14,379 --> 01:23:16,677
lt's called The Man From Rio
with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen.

1199
01:23:16,748 --> 01:23:19,979
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes
a bet with Steve McQueen...

1200
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:23,384
that Steve McQueen can't light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row.

1201
01:23:23,455 --> 01:23:26,219
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1202
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,225
he wins Peter Lorre's
new car.

1203
01:23:28,293 --> 01:23:32,229
But if he does not light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1204
01:23:32,297 --> 01:23:36,893
Peter Lorre gets to chop off
Steve McQueen's little pinky.

1205
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:41,132
Norman and Chester here
just made that same bet.

1206
01:23:41,206 --> 01:23:44,369
Norman has bet
his pinky...

1207
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:48,503
that he can light his cigarette lighter
ten times in a row.

1208
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,514
lf he does,

1209
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:54,916
he wins Chester's
1964 Chevy Chevelle...

1210
01:23:54,986 --> 01:23:57,921
red, fuckin',
beautiful car.

1211
01:23:57,989 --> 01:24:02,892
lf he doesn't, chop off
his fuckin' pinky. What do you say?

1212
01:24:09,668 --> 01:24:11,602
You guys are drunk.

1213
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,503
- Yes!
- Of course! Of course we're drunk!

1214
01:24:14,573 --> 01:24:16,507
Teddy, that's why we're here,
