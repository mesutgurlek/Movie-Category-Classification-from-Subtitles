00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.260
which is why I work
at lnitech to begin with.

164
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.000
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah, well,
I work at lnitech...

165
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.100
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

166
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.480
SAMIR:
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

167
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.670
MICHAEL: They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

168
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.410
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

169
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.010
SAMIR: That's right.

170
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.710
MICHAEL: They don't understand.

171
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.880
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

172
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.510
PETER: Yeah.

173
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.720
MICHAEL: Big time.

174
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.760
STAN: Whoa!

175
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.950
There she is.

176
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.620
SAMIR: Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

177
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.770
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

178
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.960
Oh, I can't do that.

179
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.240
I'm just another
asshole customer.

180
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.870
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

181
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.930
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

182
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.780
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

183
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.180
Why not?

184
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.240
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

185
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.690
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

186
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.160
PETER:
I know. Anne wants me to go.

187
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.450
She thinks it might help.

188
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.230
Um...

189
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.700
You know,
sometimes I think that...

190
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.290
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

191
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.770
Yeah. I know what you mean.

192
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.290
Yeah.

193
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.700
What is that supposed to mean?

194
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.200
Nothing.

195
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.470
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

196
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.640
and you wanna play poker
with us?

197
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.270
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

198
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.720
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

199
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.340
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

200
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.620
Peter, she's anorexic.

201
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.490
Yeah, I know.

202
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.860
The guy's really good.

203
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.550
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

204
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.330
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

205
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.130
Hey, and speaking of problems...

206
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.690
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

207
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.030
with your T.P.S. reports?

208
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.440
SAMIR:
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

209
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.660
TOM: Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

210
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.290
SAMIR: ls that Smykowski?

211
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.360
-Samir!
-What's he doing?

212
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.100
MICHAEL: Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

213
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.970
TOM: I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

214
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.770
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

215
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.500
PETER: What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

216
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.100
TOM: So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

217
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.840
They're gonna downsize lnitech.

218
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.110
SAMIR: What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

219
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.380
TOM: How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

220
00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.540
That's how I know.

221
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.350
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

222
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.250
It happened
at lnitrode last year.

223
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.090
You have to interview
with this consultant.

224
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.890
They call them
efficiency experts...

225
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.120
but what you're really doing...

226
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.560
is interviewing
for your own job.

227
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.960
MICHAEL: Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

228
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.230
and you're still here.

229
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.700
TOM: Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

230
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.900
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

231
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.030
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

232
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.440
SAMIR: Shit.

233
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.500
TOM: You know there are people
in this world...

234
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.010
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

235
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.210
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

236
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.480
You see,
that's what you have to do.

237
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.410
You have to use your mind...

238
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.580
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

239
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.990
and you can make millions--
never have to work again.

240
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.190
MICHAEL: You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

241
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.090
Sure it was.

242
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.260
The guy made a million dollars.

243
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.670
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

244
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.140
a long time ago.

245
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.840
PETER: Really? What was it, Tom?

246
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.440
Well, all right.

247
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.410
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

248
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.350
You see, it would be this mat...

249
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.610
that you would
put on the floor...

250
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.890
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

251
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.220
that you could jump to.

252
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.600
MICHAEL: That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

253
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.330
SAMIR: Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

254
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.430
Uh, look...

255
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.770
I gotta get outta here.

256
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.670
I'll see you guys later...

257
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.680
if I still have a job.

258
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.640
MICHAEL: Yeah.

259
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.510
Our high school
guidance counselor...

260
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.920
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

261
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.080
didn't have to work...

262
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.390
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

263
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.910
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

264
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.790
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

265
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.950
SAMIR: So what did you say?

266
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.860
I never had an answer.

267
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.600
I guess that's why
I'm working at lnitech.

268
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.160
No. You're working at lnitech...

269
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.260
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

270
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.970
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

271
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.370
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

272
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.840
SAMIR: You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

273
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.070
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

274
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.550
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

275
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.710
who works in securities--

276
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.950
MICHAEL: Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

277
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.650
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

278
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.160
what you would want to do if--

279
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.160
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

280
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.270
[Turns on television]

281
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.150
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

282
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.410
Check out this chick!

283
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.920
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

284
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.980
Iike we can't hear
each other through the wall?

285
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.320
LAWRENCE: Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

286
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.520
No, but...

287
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.020
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

288
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.460
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

289
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.330
ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

290
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.500
Tumors that are detected--

291
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.540
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

292
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.340
LAWRENCE: Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

293
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.920
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

294
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.540
Yeah.

295
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.850
A little bit. I...

296
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.720
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

297
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.190
You two still goin' out?

298
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.920
Yeah.

299
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.480
I guess. I--I don't know.

300
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.860
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

301
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.060
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

302
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.020
What do you mean by that?

303
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.590
I don't know, man.

304
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.740
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

305
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.110
she's the type of chick
that just...

306
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.300
Uhh.

307
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.410
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l--I--

308
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.540
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

309
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.980
PETER: Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

310
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.750
Just--I had a rough day.

311
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.480
LAWRENCE: Tell me about it, man.

312
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.920
Ohh...

313
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.790
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

314
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.890
at six a.m.
every day this week...

315
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.090
drag up to Las Golindas.

316
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.930
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

317
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.700
Let me ask you something.

318
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.340
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

319
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.570
does anyone ever say to you...

320
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.100
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

321
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.910
No.

322
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.180
No, man.

323
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.880
Shit, no, man.

324
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.550
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

325
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.220
PETER: Huh.

326
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.720
LAWRENCE: We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

327
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.890
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

328
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.050
I just know it.

329
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.560
LAWRENCE: Well, you can
get out of that easily.

330
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.690
PETER: Yeah? How?

331
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.890
Well...

332
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.430
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

333
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.460
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

334
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.630
PETER: Yeah.

335
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.700
LAWRENCE: So all you gotta do is
avoid him--that's all right...

336
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.010
I got it--on the last few hours
on Friday...

337
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.910
duck out early...

338
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.570
turn off
your answering machine...

339
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.280
you should be home free, man.

340
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.410
That's a really good idea.

341
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.450
Fuckin' "A," man.

342
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.090
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

343
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.030
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

344
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.360
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

345
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.330
That's it?

346
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.600
If you had a million dollars...

347
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.700
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

348
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.540
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

349
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.410
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

350
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.210
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

351
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.680
Well, not all chicks.

352
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.520
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

353
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.710
Good point.

354
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.750
LAWRENCE: What about you, now?
What would you do?

355
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.190
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

356
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.450
Well, yeah.

357
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.050
Nothing.

358
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.180
Nothin', huh?

359
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.400
I would relax.

360
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.610
I would sit on my ass all day.

361
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.910
I would do nothing.

362
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.580
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

363
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.110
Take a look at my cousin.

364
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.150
He's broke, don't do shit.

365
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.020
NINA: Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

366
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.530
Just a moment.

367
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.030
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

368
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.970
Just a moment.

369
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.300
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

370
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.930
Just a moment.

371
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.640
BILL:
So, you should ask yourself...

372
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.270
with every decision you make...

373
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.470
"ls this good for the company?

374
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.240
"Am I helping with..."

375
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.810
PETER: ls that the guy?

376
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.040
TOM: Yeah. We're screwed.

377
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.640
BILL: OK, then, um...

378
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.200
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

379
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.610
a new member to our team here.

380
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.980
This is, uh...

381
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.580
Bob Slydell.

382
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.190
Yeah. Uh...

383
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.620
Bob is a consultant.

384
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.290
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

385
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.950
helping us out...

386
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.460
a little here...

387
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.960
asking some questions...

388
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.520
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

389
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.260
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

390
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.460
around here.

391
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.330
Yeah.

392
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.740
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

393
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.110
is Hawaiian shirt day.

394
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.750
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh....

395
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.380
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

396
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.320
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

397
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.580
Because I told Bill...

398
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.090
that if they move my desk
one more time...

399
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.960
then I'm--I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

400
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.490
and I told Dom, too...

401
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.800
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

402
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.030
and I used to be over
by the window...

403
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.330
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

404
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.600
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

405
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.110
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

406
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.110
because it didn't
bind up as much...

407
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.770
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

408
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.940
PETER: OK, Milton.

409
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.140
MILTON: No, it's not OK,
because if they make me--

410
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.620
If they take my stapler,
then I'll--I'll--I'll--

411
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.950
I'll set the building on fire.

412
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.220
PETER:
OK, well, that sounds great.

413
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.060
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

414
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.290
MILTON: Peter--

415
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.440
BILL: Good-bye.

416
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.300
Come on.

417
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.430
Oh, for cryin'--

418
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.750
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

419
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.460
Um...

420
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.470
I'm gonna need you...

421
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.400
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

422
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.600
so if you could be here
around...

423
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.130
nine, that would be great.

424
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.410
OK?

425
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.140
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

426
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.980
Um...

427
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.820
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

428
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.450
on Sunday, too, OK?

429
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.150
We, um...

430
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.020
Iost some people this week...

431
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.150
and, uh...

432
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.260
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

433
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.530
Thanks.

434
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.160
PETER: So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

435
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.200
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

436
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.000
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

437
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.710
the day before it.

438
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.380
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

439
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.220
that's on the worst day
of my life.

440
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.450
What about today?

441
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.790
Is today
the worst day of your life?

442
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.450
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's messed up.

443
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.890
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.190
Go on.

445
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.800
PETER: ls there any way
that you could sort of...

446
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.640
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

447
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.160
that I'm at work...in here?

448
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.680
Could I come home...

449
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.200
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

450
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.980
That's...really not what I do,
Peter.

451
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.350
Heh.

452
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.550
However...

453
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.080
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

454
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.220
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

455
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.090
I want you to try and relax.

456
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.660
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

457
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.970
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

458
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.910
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

459
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.910
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

460
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.280
as you slip deeper and deeper...

461
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.690
into a state
of complete relaxation.

462
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.920
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

463
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.520
Deeper and deeper.

464
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.530
Way down.

465
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.760
Your concern about your job...

466
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.800
melts away...

467
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.800
way...

468
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.310
way down.

469
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.710
Unh.

470
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.210
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

471
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.710
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

472
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.720
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

473
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.420
and you will remain
in that state...

474
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.960
until I snap my fingers.

475
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.480
Three.

476
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.290
Deeper and deeper.

477
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.020
Way...

478
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.550
way down.

479
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.570
Two.

480
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.660

that we did start

while Dr. Swanson dies...

then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

on hypnosis, either.

is you take the specifications

to the software engineers?

why couldn't the customers...

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.390
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

TOM: Well, I'll tell you why.

you physically take the specs
from the customer?

say you do here?

Well, look,
I already told you.

593
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.080
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

594
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.980
so the engineers don't have to.

595

to the pop singer?

MICHAEL: No, it's--it's
just a coincidence.

608
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.240

To be honest with you...

609

know if it gets any better...

612

than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

613

love his music, huh?

he's pretty--
he's pretty good, I guess.

617

[Michael clears throat]

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.270
I don't--I don't know.
Heh heh.

623
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.680
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

624
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.880
SLYDELL: That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

625
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.220
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

626
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.720
being you have
the same name as him.

627
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.690
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

628
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.250
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

629
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.490
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

630
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.060
Hi.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.400
Hey.

632
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.240
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

633
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.410
I think it would be OK.

634
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.210
Would you like to sit down?

OK.

Yeah. Is it?

compared to Chotchkie's!

I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

642
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.330
I like yours.

643
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.530
JOANNA: Ugh!

644
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.400
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

645
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.530
JOANNA: Yeah.

646
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.010
Really. Ha ha.

647
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.440
It's on your...

648
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.010
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

649
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.020
That's, uh...

650
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.040
That's one of my--
my pieces of flair.

651
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.210
PETER:
What's a "piece of flair"?

652
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.280
JOANNA:
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

653
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.920
Iike these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

654
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.050
We're actually required
to wear...

655
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.090
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

656
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.360
It's really stupid, actually.

657
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.630
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

658
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.160
JOANNA: Yeah, yeah, we do.

659
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.400
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

660
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.770
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

661
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.470
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

662
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.840
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

663
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.320
OK.

664
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.380
JOANNA:
So, where do you, work, Peter?

665
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.940
PETER: lnitech.

666
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.790
JOANNA: And--Yeah?
What--what do you do there?

667
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.650
I sit in a cubicle...

668
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.660
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

669
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.260
What's that?

670
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.490
PETER: Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

671
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.500
and, uh, to save space...

672
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.330
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

673
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.340
So like 98 instead of 1998.

674
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.610
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

675
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.480
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

676
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.450
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

677
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.780
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

678
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.320
You're just not gonna go?

679
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.580
PETER: Yeah.

680
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.780
Won't you get fired?

681
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.950
I don't know.

682
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.790
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

683
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.060
So you're gonna quit?

684
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.300
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

685
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.930
I'm just gonna stop going.

686
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.300
PETER: What?

687
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.430
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

688
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.600
PETER: About an hour ago.

689
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.110
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

690
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.310
JOANNA: An hour ago.

691
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.240
So you're gonna get another job?

692
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.440
I don't think I'd like
another job.

693
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.390
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and--

694
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.980
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

695
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.490
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

696
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.720
Ahh...

697
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.890
well, so what do you want to do?

698
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.920
I want to take you
out to dinner...

699
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.330
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

700
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.670
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

701
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.570
I love "Kung Fu."

702
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.910
-Channel 39.
-Totally.

703
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.740
PETER: You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

704
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.770
-OK.
-Great.

705
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.010
OK. Can we order lunch first?

706
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.610
-Yeah.
-OK.

707
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.710
[Mumbles]

708
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.990
[Inaudible conversation]

709
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.260
BILL:
Took a stapler off my desk...

710
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.840
[Laughter]

711
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.570
BILL: Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

712
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.790
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

713
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.410
MILTON: Nothing.

714
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.420
BILL: I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

715
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.750
and move your desk
again, so...

716
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.590
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

717
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.530
against that wall as possible...

718
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.860
that would be great.

719
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.420
MILTON: No, because I was--

720
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.990
BILL: That way,
we'll have some room...

721
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.870
for some of these boxes
and things...

722
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.070
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

723
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.560
Oh. Oh, there it is.

724
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.340
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

725
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.400
[Milton moans]

726
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.740
Great.

727
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.220
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

728
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.020
that would be terrific, OK?

729
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.820
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

730
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.090
[Mumbles] OK.

731
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.530
I could set the building
on fire.

732
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.830
-Peter.
-Michael.

733
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.000
What the hell's going on, man?

734
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.900
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

735
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.030
No. I just came to get
my address book.

736
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.270
I'm not gonna stay.

737
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.640
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

738
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.440
MICHAEL: What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

739
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.470
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

740
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.220
PETER: Michael, I did nothing.

741
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.740
I did absolutely nothing...

742
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.760
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

743
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.450
MICHAEL: I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

744
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.090
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

745
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.320
PETER: The who?

746
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.700
MICHAEL: The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

747
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.930
PETER: Oh, yeah...right.

748
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.740
MICHAEL: Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

749
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.900
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

750
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.140
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

751
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.010
It's the best day of my life.

752
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.650
SLYDELL: Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

753
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.850
PORTER: Uh-huh.

754
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.150
SLYDELL: Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

755
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.850
You must be Peter Gibbons.

756
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.290
Uh-huh. Terrific.

757
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.760
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

758
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.260
PETER: Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

759
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.820
SLYDELL: Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

760
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.130
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

761
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.140
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

762
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.070
for how people spend their day
at work.

763
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.840
So if you would...

764
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.440
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

765
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.950
-Yeah.
-Great.

766
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.470
PETER: Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

767
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.990
Uh, I use the side door.

768
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.010
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

769
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.020
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

770
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.620
PORTER: Uh, "space out"?

771
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.790
PETER: Yeah.

772
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.700
I just stare at my desk.

773
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.220
But it looks like I'm working.

774
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.140
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

775
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.000
I'd say in a given week...

776
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.910
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

777
00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.810
of real, actual work.

778
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.580
SLYDELL: Peter,
would you be a good sport...

779
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.610
and indulge us and just...

780
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.710
tell us a little more?

781
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.280
Oh, yeah.

782
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.020
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

783
00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.220
Ahh...

784
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.700
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

785
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.760
It's that I just don't care.

786
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.990
PORTER: Don't...don't care?

787
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.600
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

788
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.260
Now, if I work my ass off...

789
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.210
and lnitech
ships a few extra units...

790
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.110
I don't see another dime.

791
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.740
So where's the motivation?

792
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.450
And here's something else,
Bob...

793
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.450
I have eight different bosses
right now.

794
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.610
-I beg your pardon?
-Eight bosses.

795
00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:36.780
-Eight?
-Eight, Bob.

796
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.580
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

797
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.280
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

798
00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.660
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

799
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.960
That and the fear
of losing my job.

800
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.860
But you know, Bob...

801
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.590
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

802
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.790
not to get fired.

803
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.460
SLYDELL: Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

804
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.800
PETER: OK.

805
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.800
SLYDELL: What if--
and believe me...

806
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.830
this is strictly hypothetical--

807
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.940
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

808
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.710
equity-sharing program?

809
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.050
Would that do anything for you?

810
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.350
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

811
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.410
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

812
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.720
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

813
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.390
SLYDELL: Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

814
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.020
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

815
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.890
I hope your firings
go really well.

816
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.130
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

817
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.900
SLYDELL: Great. Wow.

818
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.940
BILL:
So, Peter, what's happening?

819
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.340
Listen, uh...

820
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.120
STAN: Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

821
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.060
JOANNA: Yeah.

822
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.320
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and l, uh...

823
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.950
STAN: We need to talk about
your flair.

824
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.700
JOANNA: Really?
l--I have fifteen pieces on.

825
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.260
I also...

826
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.500
STAN: Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

827
00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.670
JOANNA: Oh. OK.

828
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.680
STAN: Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

829
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.610
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

830
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.870
Well, like Brian, for example...

831
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.350
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

832
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.750
And a terrific smile.

833
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.080
OK, so you want me to wear more?

834
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.850
Look, Joanna...

835
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.020
Yeah?

836
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.960
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

837
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.120
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

838
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.260
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

839
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.990
-It's about fun.
-Yeah.

840
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.190
OK, so more then, yeah?

841
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.200
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

842
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.700
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

843
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.610
but some people choose
to wear more...

844
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.510
and we encourage that, OK?

845
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.840
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

846
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.080
Y-yeah.

847
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.590
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

848
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.180
OK.

849
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.090
SLYDELL: Right, so there's
three more people...

850
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.160
we can easily lose.

851
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.430
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

852
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.460
He's useless.

853
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.100
Gone.

854
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.770
DOM: Sounds good to me.

855
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.210
SLYDELL: Here's a peculiar...

856
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.580
-Uh, Milton Waddams.
-Who's he?

857
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.640
PORTER: You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

858
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.810
DOM: Oh, yeah.

859
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.540
SLYDELL: We--we can't actually
find a record...

860
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.920
of him being
a current employee here.

861
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.820
PORTER: I looked into it
more deeply...

862
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.820
and I found that
apparently what happened...

863
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.620
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

864
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.850
and no one ever
told him about it...

865
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.390
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

866
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.800
he still gets a paycheck.

867
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.700
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

868
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.860
BILL: Great.

869
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.630
DOM:
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

870
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.800
SLYDELL: Just a second there,
professor.

871
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.430
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

872
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.640
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

873
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.170
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

874
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.310
PORTER: We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

875
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.480
The problem is solved
from your end.

876
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.650
[Laughter]

877
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.180
SLYDELL: I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

878
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.820
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

879
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.490
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

880
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.290
with upper management
written all over him.

881
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.730
Eech. Ooh.

882
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.100
Yeah. Um...

883
00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.430
I'm going to have to go ahead...

884
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.670
and sort of disagree
with you there.

885
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.300
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

886
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.140
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

887
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.480
that we would want
for upper management.

888
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.210
He's also been having
some problems...

889
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.150
with his T.P.S. reports.

890
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.190
PORTER: I'll handle this.

891
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.320
We feel...

892
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.490
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

893
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.330
SLYDELL: Mm-mmm.

894
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.490
PORTER: It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

895
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:45.660
to get him really motivated.

896
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.860
SLYDELL: There it is.

897
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.830
Yeah...Ah, well...

898
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.170
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

899
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.940
SLYDELL: Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

900
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.280
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

901
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.280
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

902
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.680
Yeah...

903
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.670
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

904
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.980
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

905
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.650
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

906
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.280
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

907
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.390
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

908
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.920
And niggers always
gotta hide here

909
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.800
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

910
00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.100
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

911
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.800
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

912
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.870
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

913
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.380
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

GETO BOYS RAPPING:
Although I was born in Jamaica

926
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.220
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

927

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.470
Some got killed in the past

933
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.140
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

934
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.110
Started living for the Lord

941
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.360
what's happening?

942
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.740
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

943
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.710
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

944
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.110
PETER: No.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.910
Ahh...yeah...

946
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.890
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

947
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.860
and have a little talk, hmm?

948
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.920

I'm--I'm kinda busy.

949
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.790
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.930
Just come back another time.

951
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.330
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

952
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.600
BILL: Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

953
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.830
PETER:
Yeah, they called me at home.

954
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.770
BILL: That sounds good, Peter.

955
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.010
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

956
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.380
get this all fixed up for you.

957
00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.540
Great.

958
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.080
[Mumbles]

959
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.290
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

960
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:25.490
[Mumbles]

961
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.890
I--I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

962
00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:32.560
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

963
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.900
I did and they said--

964
00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.800
BILL:
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

965
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.600
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

966
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.370
No, l--I...

967
00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:45.400
BILL: New people are coming,
and we need the space.

968
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.780
MILTON: But there's no space--

969
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.410
BILL: So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

970
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:52.180
and move it down there...

971
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.250
that would be terrific.

972
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:55.650
OK?

973
00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.750
MILTON: Uh, excuse me...

974
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:03.390
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

975
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.700
PORTER: You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

976
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.900
PETER: I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

977
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:10.670
PORTER: Good one.

978
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.540
SLYDELL:
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

979
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.770
I'm sure you've--you've heard
some of the rumors...

980
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.570
circulating
around the hallways...

981
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.410
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

982
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.750
with some software people.

983
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.980
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

984
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.050
PORTER: We'll be getting rid
of these people.

985
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.960
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

986
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.190
SLYDELL: Naga...

987
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.490
PORTER: Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

988
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.990
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

989
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.760
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

990
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.330
PORTER: Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

991
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.600
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

992
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.900
SLYDELL: It's standard
operating procedure.

993
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.170
PETER: Do they know this yet?

994
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.410
SLYDELL: No. No, of course not.

995
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.320
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

996
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.610
Studies have
statistically shown...

997
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.280
there's less chance
of an incident...

998
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.020
if you do it at the end
of the week.

999
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.220
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

1000
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.960
to have as many
as four people...

1001
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.330
working right underneath you.

1002
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.530
This is a big promotion, Pete.

1003
00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.260
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

1004
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.130
and give me more money?

1005
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.840
SLYDELL: Uh-huh.

1006
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.140
Wow!

1007
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.170
MICHAEL: Hmm. Yeah.

1008
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.050
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

1009
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.410
Give it to me.

1010
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.940
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

1011
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.580
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

1012
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.180
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck--

1013
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.090
-Michael.
-Hey.

1014
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.490
PETER: Listen to me.

1015
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.590
What are you doing tonight?

1016
00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:47.070
PETER: Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

1017
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.630
and maybe that time for you
is now...

1018
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.440
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

1019
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.570
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

1020
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.340
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

1021
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.650
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

1022
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.740
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

1023
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.520
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

1024
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.020
Yeah, and, uh, and l--Listen...

1025
00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.860
That virus
you're always talking about...

1026
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.090
the one that could
rip off the company...

1027
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.600
for a bunch of money.

1028
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.930
Yeah, what about it?

1029
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.630
Well, how does it work?

1030
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.840
It's pretty brilliant.

1031
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.030
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

1032
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.570
where interest is computed--
there are thousands a day--

1033
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.600
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

1034
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.170
which it usually rounds off.

1035
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.610
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

1036
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.620
and puts it into an account.

1037
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.380
-This sounds familiar.
-They did it in "Superman Ill."

1038
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.620
PETER: Right, uh...

1039
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.390
MICHAEL:
An underrated movie, actually.

1040
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.830
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

1041
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.920
-So they check for this now.
-No, here's the thing.

1042
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.260
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

1043
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.460
they'd never notice.

1044
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.530
You're right.

1045
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.970
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

1046
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.980
MICHAEL: Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

1047
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:04.970
PETER: So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

1048
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.540
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

1049
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.250
What if you didn't have
a good job?

1050
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.920
MICHAEL: Cock gobblers!

1051
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.360
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

1052
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.630
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

1053
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.530
Actually, I'm being promoted.

1054
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.260
-What?!
-I know, Michael.

1055
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.830
It's completely unfair.

1056
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.400
And I realized something today.

1057
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.410
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

1058
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.410
It's about all of us together.

1059
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.480
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

1060
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.040
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

1061
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.820
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

1062
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.850
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

1063
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.860
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

1064
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.160
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

1065
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.170
staring at computer screens
all day...

1066
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.360
filling out useless forms...

1067
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.060
and listening
to eight different bosses...

1068
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.600
drone on
about mission statements.

1069
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.580
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

1070
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:12.310
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

1071
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.250
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

1072
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.380
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

1073
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.820
Five years...

1074
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.690
of your mid-twenties now gone.

1075
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.020
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

1076
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.720
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

1077
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.560
You know why?

1078
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.040
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

1079
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.730
Ugh.

1080
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.900
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

1081
00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.930
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

1082
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.270
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

1083
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.680
Your software works, right?

1084
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.440
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

1085
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.010
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

1086
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.610
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

1087
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.360
Yeah. But Samir does.

1088
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.890
SAMIR:
But that's not much money.

1089
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.160
PETER: That's the beauty of it.

1090
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.290
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1091
00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.600
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1092
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.100
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1093
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.430
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1094
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.730
It's like "Superman Ill."

1095
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.830
SAMIR: "Superman Ill"?

1096
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.610
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

1097
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:22.880
PETER: For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1098
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.650
SAMIR:
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1099
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:29.850
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1100
00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.690
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1101
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.220
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1102
00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.290
Come on. Sit down.

1103
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.500
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1104
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.500
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1105
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.970
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1106
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.410
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1107
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.140
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1108
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.840
-Really?
-Yes.

1109
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.250
MICHAEL: Shit!

1110
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.010
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1111
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.850
So what do you think?

1112
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.410
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1113
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.650
PETER: Samir?

1114
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.190
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1115
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.390
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1116
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.830
Tomorrow is your last day
at lnitech.

1117
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.430
You have two options--

1118
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.900
unemployment
or early retirement.

1119
00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.500
What's it gonna be?

1120
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.940
-I have a question.
-Yes?

1121
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.740
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1122
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.480
Yep, you sure can.

1123
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.250
OK, I'll do it.

1124
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.220
PETER: That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1125
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.660
Can we discuss the plan?

1126
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.420
OK, yeah, good, right.

1127
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.950
It works like a computer virus.

1128
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.620
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1129
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.890
It'll do the rest.

1130
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.300
PETER: Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1131
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.240
Before we go any further,
all right?

1132
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.800
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1133
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.370
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1134
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.500
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1135
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:00.780
-Of course.
-Agreed.

1136
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.050
LAWRENCE: Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1137
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.310
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

1138
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.790
PETER: All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1139
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.720
SLYDELL: Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1140
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.020
PETER: Thank you, Bob.

1141
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.320
PORTER: We'll get some people
under you right away.

1142
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.030
ICE CUBE RAPPING:
I got something for your mind

1143
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.730
Your body and your soul

1144
00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.540
I got something for your mind

1145
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.100
Your body and your soul

1146
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.380
[Bang bang]

1147
00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.340
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

1148
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.580
Sippin' on Crevassier

1149
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.650
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

1150
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.290
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

1151
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.850
But it's necessary

1152
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.420
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

1153
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.030
I put the pedal to the floor

1154
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.970
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

1155
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.300
You know how it's done

1156
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.900
Slammin', bumpin'

1157
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.540
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

1158
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.050
She's flyin' in the Blazer

1159
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.210
Like no Speed Racer

1160
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.650
But I ain't gonna chase her

1161
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.090
Like Racer X

1162
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.950
But I won't flex

1163
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.720
Till it's time to have sex

1164
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.990
So when you want
to get together?

1165
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:26.860
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

1166
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.930
[Bang]

1167
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.350
MICHAEL: That was easy.

1168
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.440
Yeah, I guess it was.

1169
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.110
What'd you do with the--

1170
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.090
DREW: Hey, man.

1171
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.820
PETER: Oh, hey, Drew.

1172
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.520
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1173
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.720
That he got laid off?

1174
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.280
No, man, check it out.

1175
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.920
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1176
00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.330
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1177
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.530
PETER: ls he dead?

1178
00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.160
DREW: No, man, check it out.

1179
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.370
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1180
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.310
DREW: He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1181
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.310
TOM: I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1182
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:12.710
It's jammed.

1183
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.240
I--I couldn't get it
into drive.

1184
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.050
-I--I--I mean, reverse.
-You OK, Tom?

1185
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.420
DREW:
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1186
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.480
he decides he wants to live.

1187
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.050
TOM: Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1188
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.490
Right.

1189
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.720
Seems to be working now.

1190
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.260
See you later, honey.

1191
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.530
Love ya.

1192
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:38.070
DREW: But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway...Bam !

1193
00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.770
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1194
00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.800
-Is he OK?
-Sort of.

1195
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.040
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1196
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.280
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1197
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.540
Like seven figures.

1198
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.110
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1199
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.120
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1200
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.180
We're all invited.

1201
00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.950
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1202
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:00.520
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1203
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.960
Oh, oh, oh...

1204
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.090
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1205
00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.330
Yeah. Right.

1206
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.700
See you guys there.

1207
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.240
MICHAEL:
Wow, our last day at lnitech.

1208
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.570
SAMIR: I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1209
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.840
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1210
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.280
I stole something.

1211
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.380
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1212
00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.080
PETER:
No, I stole something else.

1213
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.590
What did you steal?

1214
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.460
Call it a going-away present.

1215
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.840
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

1216
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.310
Is the group
harder than an erection

1217
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.150
That shows no affection

1218
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.980
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

1219
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.450
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

1220
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.350
Die, motherfuckers

1221
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.480
Nothing but the ghetto

1222
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.320
Taking drugs, step slow

1223
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.830
Kept my head low

1224
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.120
And never let go

1225
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.990
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

1226
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.900
I'm going insane

1227
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.300
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

1228
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.130
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

1229
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.870
I done the shit
that they believe in

1230
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.670
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

1231
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.830
I seen this

1232
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.540
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

1233
00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.200
Because it's die, motherfucker

1234
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.770
Die, motherfucker

1235
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:28.680
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1236
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.690
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1237
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.160
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1238
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.660
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1239
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:40.680
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1240
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.460
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1241
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.830
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1242
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:47.460
I think it's something
in the water

1243
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.830
I think it's something
in the water

1244
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.800
So good to be free again

1245
00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.470
With unity for men

1246
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.140
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

1247
00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.440
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

1248
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.780
The murder rate may decrease

1249
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.780
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

1250
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.180
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

1251
00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.550
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

1252
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.560
For no reason

1253
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.650
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

1254
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.180
MICHAEL: Who's got my keys?

1255
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:14.630
SAMIR: I'm driving.

1256
00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.390
PETER:
Everything is gonna be OK.

1257
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:18.330
All right? OK?

1258
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.990
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1259
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:22.590
I gotta--I gotta go. All right?

1260
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.860
Joanna's coming over.

1261
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.100
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1262
00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.340
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1263
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.500
Everything will be OK.

1264
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.710
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1265
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.480
All right? Good night!

1266
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.210
[Rapping] Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1267
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.950
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1268
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:46.760
Oh, um...l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1269
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.590
I really can't.

1270
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.400
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1271
00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.600
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1272
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.570
that just get rounded off.

1273
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.200
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1274
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.540
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1275
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.570
into an account that we opened.

1276
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.120
So you're stealing?

1277
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.050
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1278
00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:17.890
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1279
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:20.990
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1280
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.400
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1281
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.200
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1282
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.570
-Yeah.
-Right.

1283
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.730
It's not yours?

1284
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:33.000
Uh...well, it becomes ours.

1285
00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.840
How is that not stealing?

1286
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.780
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1287
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.940
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1288
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.280
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1289
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.620
From the crippled children?

1290
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:48.850
No, that's the jar.

1291
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:52.420
I'm talking about the tray--
the pennies for everybody.

1292
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.860
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1293
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.990
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1294
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.930
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1295
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.800
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1296
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.930
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1297
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.500
So what's wrong with that?

1298
00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.200
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1299
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.440
PETER: It's not wrong.

1300
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.700
Initech is wrong.

1301
00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.300
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1302
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.440
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1303
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.450
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1304
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.540
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1305
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.020
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1306
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.750
taking money from the register.

1307
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.020
Well, maybe you should.

1308
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:29.130
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1309
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.430
What?

1310
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:33.830
Look, we don't...l'm--

1311
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.530
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1312
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:39.060
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1313
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.830
TOM: Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1314
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.030
-Hey, Tom.
-Hello, Tom.

1315
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:49.200
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1316
00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.000
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1317
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.530
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1318
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.600
PETER: Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1319
00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.550
-This is, uh, Joanna.
-Hi.

1320
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.980
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

[Coughing]
Ooh, ooh.

1323
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.990
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1324
01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.030
Well...what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1325
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.870
PETER: Huh...that's...

1326
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.460
that's exactly as you
described it.

1327
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.070
Uh, listen, I heard about
your--your settlement.

1328
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.340
Congratulations.

1329
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.540
Well, thanks, Peter.

1330
01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.520
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1331
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:37.920
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1332
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.650
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1333
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.420
I used to be the same way.

1334
01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.480
-Really?
-Sure.

1335
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.220
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1336
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.130
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1337
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.500
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1338
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:52.900
Wow.

1339
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.530
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1340
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.770
good things can happen
in this world.

1341
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.900
I mean, look at me.

1342
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.340
Thanks, Tom.

1343
01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.280
TOM: Ah, sure.

1344
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.810
[Music playing]

ROB: Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1346
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.650
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1347
01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:20.860
I have a client in there
right now.

1348
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.560
He says the trick is...

1349
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.500
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1350
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.020
or become someone's bitch.

1351
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:28.700
Then everything
will be all right.

1352
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.400
Why do you ask, anyway?

1353

MICHAEL: Oh, no, we just--

1354
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.970
SAMIR: It's a...

1355
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.310
-Hey, Peter.
-Drew.

1356
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.580
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1357
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.420
-Yeah.
-Lucky bastard.

1358

DREW: Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1359
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.690
PETER: Yep.

1360
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.360
Who's she here with?

1361
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.660
She's with me.

1362
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.630
-Really?
-Yep.

1363
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:03.100
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1364
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.270
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1365
01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.740
Why's that, Drew?

1366
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.470
Are you kidding me?

1367
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.570
She gets around. All right?

1368
01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.110
She does, does she?

1369
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.280
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1370
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.660
PETER: Like with who?

1371
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:26.660
Oh, let's see, uh...

1372
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.820
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1373
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.660
Uh, let me see, who else?

1374
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.960
Lumbergh?

1375
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.740
JOANNA: What if you get caught?

1376
01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.040
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1377
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.170
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1378
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.580
What?

1379
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.810
What are you--

1380
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:52.010
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1381
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:53.540
Aah!

1382
01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.750
Oh...God...Lumbergh!

1383
01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.780
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1384
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.560
That was, like, two years ago.

1385
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.030
What? Did you know him?

1386
01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.690
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1387
01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:05.060
He's my boss.

1388
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.560
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1389
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.700
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1390
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.040
PETER: He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1391
01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.840
and you slept with him.

1392
01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.310
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1393
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.220
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1394
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.480
I don't care.

1395
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.610
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1396
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:27.880
Listen to you.

1397
01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.410
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.020
How dare you judge me?

1399
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.890
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1400
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.690
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1401
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.430
wannabe criminal man.

1402
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.200
Yeah, well, that may be.

1403
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.730
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1404
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.090
OK, that's...l'm done.

1405
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.380
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1406
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.290
Call me when you grow up.

1407
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.520
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1408
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.790
So don't call me, OK?

1409
01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.030
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1410
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.740
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1411
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.330
Lumbergh fucked her.

1412
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.610
Lumbergh fucked her.

1413
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.610
That is great.

1414
01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.740
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1415
01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.580
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1416
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.250
Ooh.

1417
01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.950
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1418
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.430
That's it. Great.

1419
01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.620
Peter, what's happening?

1420
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.570
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1421
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.800
Oh!

1422
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.580
-Joanna.
-Yeah.

1423
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.030
We need to talk.

1424
01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.960
Do you know what this is about?

1425
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.500
My, uh, flair?

1426
01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.700
Yeah.

1427
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.570
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1428
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.040
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1429
01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.410
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1430
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:14.540
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1431
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.850
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1432
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.180
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1433
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.590
Iike your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1434
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.260
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1435
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.290
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1436
01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.960
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1437
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.270
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1438
01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.300
JOANNA: Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1439
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.830
I do want to express myself.

1440
01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.710
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1441
01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.910
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1442
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:50.280
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1443
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.050
There it is.

1444
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.680
I hate this job.

1445
01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.390
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1446
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.300
Oh, shit.

1447
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.970
-Shit.
-Shit.

1448
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.570
-Shit.
-Son of a bitch.

1449
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.350
-Shit.
-This is a fuck.

1450
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.510
SAMIR: l--I...Shit.

1451
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.040
MICHAEL: What happened?

1452
01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:25.280
PETER: You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1453
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.910
SAMIR: Yes, it's your software.

1454
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.150
PETER: Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1455
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:31.920
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred....

1456
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.230
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1457

SAMIR: Oh, shit.

1458
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:38.690
MICHAEL: They probably
won't know it's gone...

1459
01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.530
for another three or four days.

1460
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:44.170
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1461
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.730
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1462
01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.070
MICHAEL:
Technically, it did work.

1463
01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.440
No, it didn't!

1464
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.420
SAMIR:
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1465
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.040
MICHAEL: OK.

1466
01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.280
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1467
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.850
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1468
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.950
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1469
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.550
MICHAEL:
Quit getting pissed at me.

1470
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.500
This was all your idea, asshole.

1471
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:10.760
All right. OK.

1472
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.330
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1473
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.930
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1474
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.700
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1475
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.980
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

Happy birthday to you

BILL: Looks terrific.

1480
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.760
Mmm.

1481
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.500
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1482
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.970
Mmm.

1483
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:54.440
Oh, that is terrific.

1484
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.810
Just terrific.

1485
01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:59.610
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1486
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:01.020
It's very special.

1487
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:03.350
NINA:
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1488
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:06.690
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1489
01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.850
MILTON: But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told--

1490
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.420
Just pass.

1491
01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:16.660
OK, here. But this...

1492
01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:21.760
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1493
01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.800
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1494
01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.890
[Mumbles] I could set
the building on fire.

1495
01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.060
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1496
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.930
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1497
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.940
I--I think
they'd figure that out.

1498
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.200
Well, we have to do something.

1499
01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.230
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1500
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.570
That's a great idea.

1501
01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:04.710
OK, how do we do that?

1502
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.480
I don't know.

1503
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.250
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1504
01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:10.050
I think coke dealers do it.

1505
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:12.650
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1506
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.020
My cousin's a cokehead.

1507
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.120
Fuck.

1508
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.460
We're in deep shit.

1509

Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

-Milton.
-Yes.

1511
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:35.440
BILL: What's happening?

1512
01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.000
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1513
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.170
MILTON: But...no.

1514
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.050
BILL: Since you're down here...

1515
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.320
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1516
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.150
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1517
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.250
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1518
01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.130
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1519
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.560
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1520
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.790
and crawl down--

DOM: Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1522
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.200
We got a big problem--big.

1523
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.170
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

the last straw.

help us, Michael.

what a bunch of nerds we are.

1535
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.410
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

-Yeah, you didn't know that?

MICHAEL: A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1541
01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:01.530
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the lnitrode guy? The young guy?

Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

I come from a rough area.

Yeah. Um...

magazine subscriptions...

1573
01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.670
than I ever did at lnitrode.

1574
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.880
Heh. At lnitrode?

1575
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.940
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

1576
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:29.350
about all this stuff
we told you.

1577
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:32.620
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1578
01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.120
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1579
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.060
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1580
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.500
MICHAEL:
We never should have done this.

1581
01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.370
What were we thinking?

1582
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.430
You know what I can't
figure out?

1583
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.710
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1584
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.180
can be so good at crime...

1585
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.700
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1586
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.310
SAMIR: We're new to it, though.

1587
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.910
If we had more experience...

1588
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:06.390
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1589
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.910
I think
there's enough evidence...

all over that building
to link us to this.

1591
01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.190
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1592
01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.860
What we've done is bad enough.

1593
01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.190
We get caught
laundering money...

1594
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.260
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1596

SAMIR: I don't want to go
to any prison.

1597
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.740
Why the hell did I do this?

1598
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.470
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1599
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.770
We weren't thinking clearly...

1600
01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:31.010
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1601
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.450
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1602
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.750
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

-I flipped off my boss.

Actually, a line cook...

to be standing there, so...

about that computer scam.

That was a bad idea.

I'm gonna take the blame for it,

I'm on my way now
to return the money...

I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

Lumbergh is not my problem.

It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

Yeah. Well...

I may never be happy
at my job...

that I could be happy
with my life.

told me to talk to payroll...

to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.280
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1729
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.690
And I said no salt, no salt...

1730
01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.450
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1731
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:19.120
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1732
01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.820
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1733
01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.730
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1734
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.360
Sir?

1735
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.840
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1736
01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:35.330
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1737
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.640
I could have this place
condemned.

1738
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.510
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1739
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.340
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1740
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.030
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1741
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:01.940
DREW: Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1742
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:04.010
Aaaah!

1743
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.460
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yeah

1744
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.890
Yo, 6:00 every morning,
you're waking up yawnin'

1745
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:11.990
To the sound
of your alarm clock alarmin'

1746
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:13.330
About an hour from now

1747
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.460
You should be
at your place of employment

1748
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.400
Which is annoyin'
'cause it's so borin'

1749
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.600
You coworkers are talking

1750
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.300
LAWRENCE: Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1751
01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.570
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1752
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:25.010
CANIBUS RAPPING: You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

1753
01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.310
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

1754
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:30.510
People get depressed,
they get ulcers

1755
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:33.240
From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

1756
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.010
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

1757
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:38.580
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

1758
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.060
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

1759
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:43.750
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

1760
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:45.280
But my advice to anybody--

1761
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.590
JOANNA: I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1762
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.690
and it's very cool.

1763
01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.360
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1764
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.340
I ain't working here no more

1765
01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:56.570
Take this job and shove it

1766
01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.670
I ain't working here no more

1767
01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.840
Take this job and shove it

1768
01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.780
CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it,
take this job and shove it

1769
01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:07.550
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job, take this job

1770
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:09.550
take this job and shove it,
shove it

1771
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:11.780
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yo, if your boss is a S.O.B.

1772
01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:14.920
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b

1773
01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.330
Put your middle finger
up slowly

1774
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.690
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

1775
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.490
Say "l ain't working here
no more

1776
01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:23.800
"Who do you think you are?"

1777
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:25.560
Whip the apron off,
throw it on the floor

1778
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.940
Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

1779
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:31.070
Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

1780
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:33.540
So they can come
and get you in the car later on

1781
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.210
And help you search
for a new nine-to-five job

1782
01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:38.680
If the unemployment line
ain't that long

1783
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.450
You can take your time
filling out W-9 forms

1784
01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:44.390
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

1785
01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.050
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

1786
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:48.750
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

1787
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:50.690
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

1788
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:52.290
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

1789
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.230
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1790
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:57.600
I ain't working here no more

1791
01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.540
Take this job and shove it

1792
01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:02.800
I ain't working here no more

1793
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.140
Take this job and shove it

1794
01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:08.040
I ain't working here no more

1795
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.850
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

1796
01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.510
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

1797
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:18.020
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

1798
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.610
While the most hated get placed

1799
01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.280
In some small cubicle spaces

1800
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.950
Or get thrown down
in the basement

1801
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.720
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

1802
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.990
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

1803
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:29.330
And you still ain't get paid yet

1804
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:30.860
Here's an optimistic motto

1805
01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.560
If you ever late for today

1806
01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.470
You can stay early for tomorrow

1807
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:36.200
Most nine-to-fives are hard

1808
01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.670
'Cause the description
of the job

1809
01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:39.440
Ain't no picnic in the park

1810
01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.340
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

1811
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.870
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

1812
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.350
BIZ MARKIE RAPPING: You came in
late, you already ate

1813
01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.980
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

1814
01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.750
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

1815
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.760
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

1816

I ain't working here no more

Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,

CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it

BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Canibus and the Biz

1833
01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:45.210
Ah-aah aah-ah

It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1835

It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1836

From, from Canibus
