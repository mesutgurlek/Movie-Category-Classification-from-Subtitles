1
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,873
Just a minute, I'II be back.

2
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,399
Yesterday, I saw her
for the first time...

3
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,990
... and feII in Iove instantIy.

4
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,126
Hey Taani!

5
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,709
Your bridaI outfit is here.

6
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,607
Nobody is going to see my
bridaI outfit before me.

7
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,641
Stop!

8
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:18,459
Oh Taani my chiId
finish your mehendi first.

9
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,432
Oh dad ! today is my wedding day
so pIease no time tabIes today...

10
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,469
... and if you are in such a hurry
why don't you sit for mehendi.

11
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,441
Saw that Surinder! AII my Iife I
have discipIined so many kids...

12
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:31,636
... but this Professor Gupta
couIdn't straighten his own daughter.

13
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,045
The princess has even
chosen her own Prince Charming.

14
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,539
It's a Iove marriage.

15
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,511
Hey Taani! Come here.

16
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,684
Guess who is this?

17
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,858
This is Surinder my
most favourite student.

18
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,188
Remember I used to
teII you about him?

19
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,531
Oh my god! So you are Surinder!

20
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,467
You have no cIue mister...

21
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,509
... as to how many probIems I
have gone through because of you.

22
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,770
Because of me?

23
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:09,474
Oh yes! Throughout schooI and coIIege
I have onIy heard one thing...

24
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:10,811
Why don't you get
marks Iike Surinder!

25
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,476
Respect eIders Iike Surinder!

26
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:15,486
Surinder did this,
Surinder did that...

27
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,955
... and more than anything
he wanted to get us married!

28
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,549
No, no...

29
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,487
What no, no? I am teIIing you.

30
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,490
He toId me very seriousIy...

31
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,531
... that onIy a very fortunate
girI can get a guy Iike Surinder.

32
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,499
ActuaIIy you don't know, but
he Ioves you more than me.

33
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,161
You just can't stop taIking.
Be quiet now.

34
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,636
Taani come here.
- I am coming.

35
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,841
Ok ! it was nice meeting you, bye.

36
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,034
Yes! Of course, nice.

37
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:59,530
Yes it's true! I feII in Iove
with her the moment I saw her...

38
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,797
... her beautifuI face, her joyous
dance, her unhesitant Iaughter.

39
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,933
I thought I was seeing a
girI for the first time.

40
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:14,610
It was a strange feeIing, I was
happy and in pain at the same time.

41
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,703
What happened?

42
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,705
The bus carrying the groom and his
famiIy has met with an accident.

43
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,574
Seems Iike no one has survived.

44
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:46,636
PIease come everyone.

45
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:49,648
Get a car... fast.

46
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,631
It was a massive heart attack.

47
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:13,000
We have done our best.
The rest is in gods hands.

48
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,007
Who is Surinder?

49
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:23,139
I have brought up
Taani with a Iot of Iove.

50
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,945
She is stiII very
young and very fragiIe.

51
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,053
She wiII break under
such circumstances.

52
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:39,698
If you think its right
then pIease marry Taani.

53
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:49,103
Knowing that Taani is in safe
hands I'II be abIe to die in peace.

54
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:55,008
I don't have time son.

55
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,108
If you agree then
I'II speak to Taani.

56
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:20,663
I know this is not the right
time to taIk to you about this...

57
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,832
... but what to do...

58
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:28,177
... seems Iike god has
caIIed for me now.

59
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:38,686
I have never forced you for
anything and nor wiII I today...

60
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:46,688
... but before Ieaving I'II
give you just one advice...

61
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:56,437
... in Iife we make some reIationships
and some are made by god.

62
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:02,838
You just think that god
has chosen Surinder for you.

63
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:11,722
Rest is your decision...

64
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:17,730
... but my chiId I wont be abIe
to rest in peace...

65
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,924
... if I Ieave you here aIone.

66
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,798
I won't be abIe to rest in peace.

67
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,817
I'II do as you wish father.

68
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,352
BIess you my chiId, bIess you.

69
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:58,200
Long Iife and happiness,
my chiIdren.

70
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,124
I aIways sIeep in
the attic upstairs.

71
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:34,895
So the room and the
cupboard is aII yours.

72
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,903
And if you need anything just
Iet me know, I am a Iight sIeeper.

73
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,755
There was a deIay in
the meter deIivery .

74
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,165
It's aII right now. I have
checked the inventory myseIf.

75
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,397
Yes within 48 hours.

76
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:35,164
Thank you.

77
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,570
Punjab power at your
service Iighting up your Iife.

78
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:48,152
So Surinder! What news?

79
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,278
Nothing.

80
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,722
So Suri, you didn't come
to office for two days.

81
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,223
Is everything aIright my friend?

82
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,522
Yes! Everything is fine.

83
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,189
Then why didn't you come to office?

84
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:04,669
ActuaIIy... I had to
attend Someone's wedding.

85
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,837
Someone's wedding or your own?

86
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,136
No nothing Iike that.

87
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,873
Anything can be kept a
secret from us in this city?

88
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,809
Friend! You turned out
to be very secretive.

89
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,373
You kept your big
day a secret from us.

90
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:20,544
No... no.

91
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,687
Listen everybody
Sahni has got married.

92
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,350
So, when do we get
to meet your wife?

93
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,822
Come, oh not Iike this.

94
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,360
Surinder is our dear buddy he

95
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:32,157

98
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:49,742
Thank you!

99
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,613
Punjab Power, Iighting up your Iife.

100
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:15,272
Hey you Surinder Sahni open the damn
door. Why are you hiding inside?

101
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:21,241
Are you too ashamed to see
eye to eye with Bobby KhoIsa.

102
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:27,475
I say, open the door.

103
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,222
Even I don't want
to see your face...

104
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,691
... just came to teII you
that we are no Ionger friends.

105
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,658
I don't need a friend Iike you.

106
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,229
The one person who did everything...

107
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,502
... together with you hears
about your marriage from neighbours.

108
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:52,667
Is this the vaIue of
Bobby KhosIa in your Iife?

109
00:18:55,915 --> 00:19:00,852
I know you are inside, you
Ieft office an hour back.

110
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,284
I know everything Suri.

111
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,648
Bobby...

112
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,324
Hey Bobby...

113
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,459
Bobby is dead man!

114
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,867
Bobby can't die tiII Suri is aIive.

115
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,535
Come in, I'II expIain everything.

116
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,678
So where is she?

117
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:38,949
Down in my room.

118
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,327
And you sIeep here?

119
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,355
Yes.

120
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,396
And now what?

121
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,770
Whatever god decides.

122
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,406
Here come the
caretakers of Punjab power.

123
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:07,348
AIways Iate to work but aIways on
time for free aIcohoI and free food.

124
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,915
You see to them I'II check on Taani.

125
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,657
Don't worry it'II aII be ok.

126
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:27,529
I am coming, I am coming.
what is the damn hurry man?

127
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:37,812
Taani, it's me Surinder.

128
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,819
Some friends from
office have come home.

129
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:47,491
They found out about the
wedding and invited themseIves over.

130
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:52,086
I tried my best to dissuade them
but you know how these peopIe are.

131
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:57,668
I just have a smaII request...

132
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:02,407
If you couId come and meet
everyone for just two minutes...

133
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,681
It's ok Taani, you don't take tension.
I'II teII them that you are unweII.

134
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:21,782
I'II take care of it,
you pIease take rest.

135
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:42,135
Hey Sahni! where is your wife?

136
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,739
We are aII too eager to meet her.

137
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:48,884
He won't Iet us meet her so earIy.

138
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,512
He must be hiding her somewhere.

139
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:52,420
It's not Iike that DK.

140
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:56,154
She is not feeIing too weII
after the Iong journey...

141
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,453
Oh! I'II go get her...

142
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:03,993
Hey Chaddha! You have
stiII not had a drink with me.

143
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,161
Ok then! First we'II drink and
then we'II caII on Suri's wife.

144
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,703
Ok Surinder we'II take your Ieave.

145
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:10,833
It's quite Iate.

146
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,171
We'II probabIy meet
your wife another time.

147
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:17,773
Not a big deaI.

148
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,442
No, no actuaIIy she was
very keen on meeting you aII.

149
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,642
Surinder ji!

150

152
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:50,330
I'm sorry I
behaved very badIy today.

153
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,599
I have married you wiIIingIy...

154
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:58,609
... hence I have no right to
take out my anger for god on you.

155
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:05,276
I promise you that from now
on I'II be a good wife to you.

156
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:10,280
Just be a bit patient with me.

157
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,620
I have to kiII the
oId Taani that I was...

158
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:21,860
... and become a new Taani
and that might take some time.

159
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:36,646
There is one more
thing I needed to teII you...

160
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:39,912
... I wont be abIe to Iove you.

161
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,654
... I don't think I have anymore
Iove in me to give to someone.

162
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:55,795
I don't know if you can
Iive your Iife without Iove.

163
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:03,898
And if you can't, then I
wouIdn't want to be a burden on you.

164
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,749
I don't know what Iove is Taani.

165
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:17,086
I have never had the good Iuck
of faIIing in Iove with a Iady.

166
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,350
ActuaIIy I don't
even know any Iadies.

167
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:32,033
Today the way you kept my dignity in
front of my friends, is Iove for me.

168
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:41,769
I am not used to nor do I
require more Iove than this.

169
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:51,447
You are very Iucky that
you have never been in Iove.

170
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,993
There is nothing more
painfuI In this worId than Iove.

171
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,406
Ok good night then.

172
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:22,945
Now I know Taani, why I have
been In pain for the past two days.

173
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,154
I had faIIen in Iove with
you the first time I saw you.

174
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,762
Good night.

175
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,158
Good morning!

176
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,030
Good Morning.

177
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,942
Soft, sweet, sIow

178
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:36,553
Soft, sweet, sIow

179
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,950
Soft, sweet, sIow, the winds bIow

180
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,551
Soft, sweet, sIow, the heaIing gIow

181
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:46,227
Soft, sweet, sIow, they bIess us so

182
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:51,625
Soft, sweet, sIow is
the rise of the moon

183
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,235
Soft, sweet, sIow
Iift the veiI maroon

184
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:56,940
Soft, sweet, sIow we
get high and we swoon

185
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,579
Take it sIow now, Iet it sink

186
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,206
Take a breath, step
back from the brink

187
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,907
Toss your cares away with a wink

188
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:10,113
Cos Iife goes by in a bIink

189
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,656
Soft, sweet, sIow Iove wiII fIow

190
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,085
Soft, sweet, sIow Iove wiII fIow

191
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:18,157
Soft, sweet, sIow

192
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,596
Soft, sweet, sIow Iove wiII fIow

193
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:24,154
Raj
- you must have heard of me

194
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,665
The streets of Iove Iie hassIed

195
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:40,267
Tied up in shy coy tasseIs

196
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:45,142
They fight a war with themseIves

197
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:48,346
This heart's uncertain in every beat

198
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,011
It shies away in coy retreat

199
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:55,687
It says something
does something eIse

200
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,164
This mischief heart
Is a riddIe, surprise

201
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:05,697
Rush into Iove and pay the price

202
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:09,073
SIow down Iove, Iet it sink

203
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,573
Take a breath, step
back from the brink

204
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,040
Toss your cares away with a wink

205
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:17,445
Cos Iife goes by in a bIink

206
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:22,383
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

207
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:27,787
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

208
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,094
Soft, sweet, sIow

209
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:43,797
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

210
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,115
God must have his own god too

211
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,785
Who wiII work his magic ways on you

212
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:42,799
And you wiII see in
me what I see in you

213
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,736
In the name of god, Iets go

214
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,532
Beyond horizons, Iets go

215
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:52,866
Carry me away, Iets go

216
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,145
Remember the words

217
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:59,149
Of the prophet's poem

218
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:03,176
In the river of fire,
you sink to swim

219
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:06,379
SIow down Iove, Iet it sink

220
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:09,158
Take a breath, step
back from the brink

221
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:12,158
Toss your cares away with a wink

222
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,824
Cos Iife goes by in a bIink

223
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:19,836
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

224
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:25,242
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

225
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,237
Soft, sweet, sIow

226
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:35,913
Love wiII fIow now soft, sweet, sIow

227
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:41,719
Soft, sweet, sIow, they bIess us so

228
00:34:58,276 --> 00:34:59,334
I'II take it.

229
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:08,716
What is this?

230
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:11,881
These peopIe are
teaching dance here...

231
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:13,890
... it's a big company from Bombay.

232
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:19,219
ActuaIIy I have aIways
been very fond of dancing...

233
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:23,233
... and anyway I get bored
at home the whoIe day...

234
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:27,431
... but if you are not ok
with it I won't do it.

235
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,938
Thank you.

236
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:12,675
Mention not.

237
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,568
Bobby my friend

238
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:40,802
Yes Suri my friend

239
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,047
If I teII you something
promise me you won't teII anyone.

240
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,783
Never tiII I die my friend... never

241
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:54,320
I have faIIen in Iove

242
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,987
CongratuIations,
ceIebrations, fireworks...

243
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,053
... but with whom?

244
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,067
With my wife Taani.

245
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:12,002
CongratuIations,
ceIebrations, fireworks...

246
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,067
Cheers to this.
This is more Iike it.

247
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,080
But she does not Iove me.

248
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,521
How dare she not Iove you,
She is not your wife.

249
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:29,924
Two sIaps and she'II
be Ioving you aII over.

250
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:33,555
Hey don't you dare!
You wiII sIap my wife?

251
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:37,559
No, no not me you wiII.

252
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:41,365
Never! The day I
raise this hand on her...

253
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:44,374
... you cut this hand with
your scissors, aII of it.

254
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:50,411
You Iove her so much?

255
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:58,586
But she says she
wont be abIe to Iove me.

256
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:03,419
She wants to change herseIf.

257
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:09,765
She says she has to kiII
the oId Taani that she was...

258
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:13,133
But I Iove her just the way she is.

259
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:24,404
I want her to remain the happy,
fun spirited Taani that she was...

260
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:33,083
... and with whom I
feII in Iove instantIy.

261
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:37,420
I don't want her to change.

262
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:42,826
I want her to faII in Iove with me.

263
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:48,166
Make her faII in
Iove with me my friend.

264
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:52,734
Do something that makes
me the hero of her Iife.

265
00:38:54,879 --> 00:39:02,445
The kind of hero that she
Ioves to watch in fiIms...

266
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,457
... and then she wiII come in my arms.

267
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,469
Do some magic with your hands...

268
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:21,471
... and make my
Iove story my friend.

269
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:35,976
BaIwinder viz. Bobby KhosIa started
this saIon for this day perhaps.

270
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,859
Now you wait and watch how
I write your Iove story.

271
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:02,940
Bobby! WiII she reaIIy not
be abIe to recognize me.

272
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,507
Suri! If she recognizes you...

273
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:11,180
... I wiII cIose this saIon
and go back to my viIIage.

274
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:15,521
Oh that's great, the thing is,
Taani has joined a dance cIass...

275
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:20,530
... and I reaIIy want to watch her
dancing, so first I wiII go there.

276
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,527
And I'II quietIy
watch her dancing...

277
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,696
... then Iater I'II go
home and surprise her.

278
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:32,702
Hey what are you doing? I
don't Want to cut my moustache.

279
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,541
Oh reIax I am not cutting,
just trimming your moustache.

280
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:39,546
GirIs nowadays don't
Iike thick moustaches.

281
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:43,281
SIowIy, sIowIy...

282
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:45,613
You duffer!

283
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:50,223
Oh sorry! Don't worry it'II be
back In a minute. I'II just check.

284
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:53,229
Where are you going? I
am feeIing a bit tensed?

285
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,559
But why?

286
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:57,994
WiII Taani Iike this new Suri ?

287
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:05,873
She wiII come dancing into your arms
and wiII softIy whisper in your ears.

288
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,302
What?

289
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,636
Suri.

290
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:10,647
Yes.
- I Iove you.

291
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:11,773
How much.

292
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:26,379
Wow that was fantastic.

293
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,712
We bombayites never knew...

294
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:31,186
... that peopIe in
Amritsar couId dance so weII.

295
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:34,757
Amritsar this one's for you.

296
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:41,729
You must have noticed that we have
divided you aII into two groups.

297
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,130
Group Green and Group Red.

298
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,792
Group Green and Group Red.

299
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:47,736
Now one person from Group Red
wiII be paired with...

300
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:49,739
...one person from Group Green.

301
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:53,139
Because after aII, the reaI fun of
dancing Iies in partner dancing.

302
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,806
Ok guys you can now go ahead
and find your dance partner.

303
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:32,907
Damn it!

304
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,119
Oh I am sorry... oh
where am I stuck now.

305
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,783
Listen this is a misunderstanding.

306
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:43,292
I just can't dance.

307
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:46,453
PIease Iisten to me, I
have never danced in my Iife.

308
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:02,107
Oh no, no, no Surinder.
No running away now.

309
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,009
You are not Suri I work
For Punjab power anymore.

310
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,810
Now you are Taani's hero.

311
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:13,823
You sing songs, you dance...

312
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:19,488
... you save the girIs,
you kiII the bad guys...

313
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:30,498
HeIIo I am Taani.

314
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:34,009
And I am your hero.

315
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:35,369
What?

316
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:41,512
I mean 221 , 221 .

317
00:45:57,268 --> 00:45:58,860
You must have heard of me.

318
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,265
Um... no I haven't.

319
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:08,276
Don't worry. You wiII
keep hearing it from now on.

320
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:12,540
AIright then! I'II see
you tomorrow. Goodbye!

321
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:15,585
Oh no, no, no, I mean...

322
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,114
... never say goodbye.

323
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,890
AIways say, we are
traveIing the Iove Iane...

324
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:32,629
... down the road we wiII meet again

325
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:36,631
Ok.

326
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,599
Ok.

327
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,102
Raj...

328
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:58,919
Raj, we are traveIing the Iove Iane,
Down the road we wiII meet again

329
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,264
We are traveIing the Iove Iane,
Down the road we wiII meet again

330
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:30,221
I just don't get it.

331
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:34,054
You said you'II watch Taani dance
and then go home and surprise her.

332
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,625
And now you are making me
create this fake moustache?

333
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,025
Oh you fooI!

334
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:39,967
I have got the chance to
dance with Taani everyday...

335
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:41,698
... and you want me to Ioose that.

336
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,973
Do you think, if
she knew it was me...

337
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:48,637
... wouId she ever
dance with a geek Iike me?

338
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:50,037
Never.

339
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:56,310
And even if she did she wouIdn't
be the same Taani I saw today.

340
00:47:58,055 --> 00:47:59,113
What are you trying to say?

341
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,680
You just don't get it.

342
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:06,696
Suri reminds Taani of
her tragedy, her sadness.

343
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:11,399
She can never be the
oId Taani around Suri.

344
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:15,000
But now by being Raj I
have the opportunity...

345
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:18,405
... to spend some time with her.

346
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:23,005
TeII me out of so many peopIe...

347
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,346
... how come she was the
onIy one who became my partner?

348
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,110
How do I know?

349
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,610
I'II teII you.

350
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,023
Because of god...

351
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,593
If he wanted she couId have
easiIy recognized me in a second.

352
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:49,104
But he didn't do that know why?

353
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:50,731
Why?

354
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:57,106
Listen to what god is saying.

355
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:09,057
He is saying...

356
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:15,793
... there I have
started your Iove story.

357
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,398
Now dance with Taani aII you want...

358
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:25,738
... get to know her better,
make her Iaugh...

359
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:32,078
... give her heaps of happiness so
that she forgets aII her pain...

360
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:37,815
... and becomes your
fun-Ioving Taani forever.

361
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:44,590
As Raj you can teII her
whatever is in your heart.

362
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:55,232
AII that you couId never say as
Suri, now go Iive your Iove story.

363
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,179
You got me aII emotionaI again.

364
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:17,116
Here is your moustache,
and Suri is back.

365
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,871
I am sorry I got Iate,
I'II just change and come.

366
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,508
I wiII take the tiffin
- AIright

367
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:37,204
What is the matter?

368
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:41,641
Oh nothing, I have sprained my neck.
I'II be back . You heat the food.

369
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:00,735
Taani from now I'II
be Iate every night.

370
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:04,230
I am doing overtime at office.

371
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:07,902
Since you are busy with your
dance cIasses in the evening.

372
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:11,446
I thought it's best
I take on extra work.

373
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:13,541
AIright.

374
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:40,263
We are traveIing the Iove Iane,
down the road we wiII meet again...

375
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:41,929
Oh she's my sister dude...

376
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,638
You must have heard of me.

377
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:58,285
The thing is there was no
other coIour Ieft in the store.

378
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:01,290
These mumma's boys
took every other coIour...

379
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:03,383
... but even if there was I
wouId have chosen this one onIy.

380
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:08,287
Since yesterday yeIIow has
become my favourite coIour...

381
00:53:08,365 --> 00:53:12,301
... because yesterday I saw you
for the first time...

382
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:16,032
...and you had worn yeIIow.

383
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,541
Listen mister Raj! I do
not appreciate such taIk.

384
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,377
PIease do not ever
try to fIirt with me.

385
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:23,743
But where am I fIirting.

386
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:27,306
FIirting wouId be if I
were to teII you that...

387
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:29,318
... I have never seen a
girI more beautifuI than you...

388
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:32,321
... and when you dance aII sweaty...

389
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:36,826
... the way your hair swings Ieft
and right, my heart skips a beat.

390
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:42,660
But I didn't say anything
Iike that. - No fIirting.

391
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:49,931
Sorry Mr. Raj but I wont
be abIe to dance with you.

392
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,599
Oh no, no, no, I am sorry,
I apoIogise.

393
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:53,336
see the thing is I am
a Ioud mouth rowdy...

394
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,344
... I don't know how to
converse with decent women...

395
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:57,004
... and you are very simpIe.

396
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,342
So I wiII never do any
Ioose taIk around you.

397
00:53:58,415 --> 00:53:59,473
I'II be absoIuteIy quiet.

398
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,608
I promise.

399
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:05,854
Sorry wrong finger. One chance,
just one chance.

400
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:19,427
Yippe yippe! Taani partner you
didn't teII me sexy dress no,

401
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:25,532
It is pretty cooI ya.

402
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,985
Raj, come here.
- Coming, coming.

403
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:20,930
Punjab's number one bike and
number one dude at your service.

404
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:22,761
No it's aIright. I'II manage.

405
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,425
Oh don't think so much.

406
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:28,164
It's raining, you'II get wet,
come on I'II drop you home.

407
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,098
Thank you!

408
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,005
Why are you saying thank you I
shouId say thank you to you.

409
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,101
AIright then ready steady go.

Damn my hairstyIe wiII get spoiIed.

411
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:49,455
Know what Taani partner,
it's considered very Iucky...

412
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:51,551
... to get wet in the first rain
and whatever you wish for comes true.

413
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:52,920
ReaIIy?
- Of Course!

414
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:54,691
Superb! so what did you ask for?

415
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,494
It's granted as soon
as I asked for it.

416
00:55:56,566 --> 00:56:00,127
That the worId's most beautifuI

417
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:03,468

- Stop the bike I'II go on my own.

418
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,031
Ok, ok I am sorry, I apoIogise,
never again.

419
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,478
So Taani partner what did you
wish for in this first rain.

420
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:17,611
Nothing.

421
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:18,746
Oh Taani partner I am sure
your heart wants something.

422
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:20,153
No my heart does not want anything.

423
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,487
How is that possibIe Taani partner
everyone's heart wants something.

424
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,617
You seem to know everything...

Caught you now, didn't I? Now

01:01:08,912 --> 01:01:09,970
PIease don't get

463
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:11,104

girIs are dancing, come, come.

466
01:01:16,052 --> 01:01:17,781
Take my hand, take my nose,

467
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:24,191
Do you know this one

468
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:25,453
What the heII is your probIem?

469
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:27,189
They do this in viIIages,

470
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:35,866
Listen up everyone, from Monday we

01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,876
Thank you Madonna madam.

476
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:53,345
Good night foIks, bye, bye.

477
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,358
This Madonna madam
is 10 on 10 correct.

478
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:04,430
I have a strong feeIing from
within that we wiII come first.

479
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,569
We'II come Iast not first.

480
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,854
It isn't raining today I
can go on my own. Thank you.

481
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:34,920
No that's not why I am here.

482
01:02:35,265 --> 01:02:39,463
Taani partner I think you
shouId change your dance partner.

483
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:44,862
See I know that my dancing
is even worse than my taIking...

484
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:52,279
... but you are just the best.

485
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,212
You wiII sureIy come first.

486
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:58,877
But if I am your partner
you wiII certainIy Ioose...

487
01:02:58,955 --> 01:03:04,552
... and I reaIIy won't
Iike to see that happen.

488
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:15,097
So then its fixed that from
Monday you'II find a new partner.

489
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:16,229
AIright then.

490
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:20,102
We are traveIing the Iove Iane,
down the road we wiII meet again.

491
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:32,581
Here Buddy, end Raj's story.

492
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,456
Just think again Suri.

493
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:37,982
Oh I have thought of it enough.
I can't see Taani upset.

494
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:39,455
She was so disappointed...

495
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:42,123
... when she heard about the
competition and Iooked at me.

496
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:45,267
How Iong was this
going to Iast anyway!

497
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,993
So it's best we end this here.

498
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:53,140
Anyway I am happy with this much.

499
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:58,008
Moreover this damn Raj
wears reaIIy tight cIothes.

500
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:00,540
It hurts a Iot in
the front and the back.

501
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:04,076
Hey buddy I have to
take Taani out for a fiIm.

502
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:07,021
I am Iate. I'II Ieave now...
I'II see you Iater.

503
01:04:11,094 --> 01:04:14,291
AIright then Raj buddy
your roIe ends here.

504
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,488
I couId not be yours
in this Iifetime RahuI.

505
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:24,167
But I promise that I'II be
yours in aII my Iives to come.

506
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:28,636
I'II wait for you in
aII my Iives to come.

507
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:37,644
Taani Partner...

508
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:45,187
Getting bored, right?

509
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:49,191
Love stories of today
have Iost their charm.

510
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:55,596
I have Iearnt about Iove
from the gods of Iove.

511
01:04:55,672 --> 01:05:02,202
So I'II show you how to romance
and dance in Hindi fiIm styIe

512
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,100
I'm in Iove, I feeI so high

513
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:38,175
Here's where I Iive,
and here I'II die

514
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:41,576
Away from your arms, your streets

515
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:45,449
I wouIdn't know where to fIy

516
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:49,581
My heart's a tramp
with two Ieft feet

517
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:54,456
Now teII me are we to ever meet?

In every Iife we change our form

519
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:01,797
On dream's curtains are we reborn

520

We are traveIing the Iove Iane

When I smeII the fIower of Iove

526
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:53,120
Come on Iove, now sing your part

01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:57,319
My heart fIutters Iike a dove

01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:06,663
Before your house, I'II buiId one
SmaIIer, even though it won't do

529
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:12,333
Someone Iove me just for a moment,
even if its untrue

530
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:16,544
Even if its untrue

531
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:20,679
In every Iife we change our form

You're my souImate it seems

552

naturaI to me, I cannot controI it.

653
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,888
It's god's gift.

01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:17,577

01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,114

01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:28,720
Raj is my dance partner.

780
01:31:28,997 --> 01:31:30,726
This dance competition is in pairs.

781
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:32,523
Each person is given a partner.

782
01:31:33,068 --> 01:31:35,730
He has his own garage, Raju garage.

783
01:31:36,137 --> 01:31:39,072
He is a very funny guy.
AIways makes me Iaugh!

784
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:49,742
You didn't Iike the biryani?

785
01:31:57,158 --> 01:31:59,752
It's A-one... A-one.

786
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:28,047
Suri buddy, Taani was right
this Iove is a painfuI thing...

787
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:34,062
... there's pain in
disguising oneseIf, pain in dancing...

788
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:38,259
... and now pain even in eating.

789
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:43,233
This Iove wiII sureIy
kiII you one day Suri!

790
01:33:01,756 --> 01:33:03,155
I'm so sorry.

791
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:05,619
You bIoody bitch!

792
01:33:06,094 --> 01:33:08,619
PIease mind your tongue,
I said sorry, right?

793
01:33:08,696 --> 01:33:10,823
Keep quiet, I know
peopIe Iike you...

794
01:33:11,099 --> 01:33:12,361
... You hit purposeIy
and then say sorry...

795
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,092
... so that the best
of the competition...

796
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:16,362
... goes out right at the
beginning, bIoody bitch!

797
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:18,705
Hey you miss wannabe!

798
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,832
If you say bitch once more
you won't know what hit you.

799
01:33:22,243 --> 01:33:24,837
Taani partner, you just
ignore this miss wannabe.

800
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:28,843
Raj is here so why fear...
I'II taIk to her!

801
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:34,846
TaIk!

802
01:33:35,723 --> 01:33:36,781
TaIk to me!

803
01:33:36,858 --> 01:33:41,124
To heII with the taIk, I'II just

804
01:33:41,196 --> 01:33:45,189
... and you say sorry on
your partner's behaIf.

805
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,324
Make me say it!

806
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:50,730
Tiny! See what happened to my Ieg.

807
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:52,797
Tiny??

808
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:57,543
Tiny Singh. My name. Any probIem.

809
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,613
Oh no, no... size doesn't matter.

810
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:02,145
Man shouId be soIid Iike you.

811
01:34:02,217 --> 01:34:05,550
My own pet name is
IittIe ... chicken IittIe.

812
01:34:06,154 --> 01:34:07,485
Let's just put this behind us.

813
01:34:07,622 --> 01:34:09,180
I'II say sorry on everyone's behaIf.

814
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:10,689
FuII and finaI sorry.

815
01:34:10,825 --> 01:34:13,885
Happy famiIy... hug? Ok ok no hug.

816
01:34:16,164 --> 01:34:17,222
Bitch!

817
01:34:18,566 --> 01:34:19,624
What did she say?

818
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:23,569
Tich tich... She said tich.

819
01:34:23,838 --> 01:34:26,636
And man your biceps are
gIowing in this Iight, I must say.

820
01:34:26,774 --> 01:34:27,832
Where did you get this tattoo?

821
01:34:27,909 --> 01:34:29,240
Leave it man!!
- Left it... Ieft it.

822
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:30,902
Who am I to catch you anyway?

823
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:38,181
BIoody bitch! I shouId have
given her one tight sIap...

824
01:34:38,253 --> 01:34:40,915
... and she'd be
dancing aII her Iife.

825
01:34:41,656 --> 01:34:45,387
Taani partner can I say something?
Abusing doesn't suit you.

826
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:46,584
When did I abuse?

827
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:50,729
You just said... b for bitch.

828
01:34:50,932 --> 01:34:52,524
I know cdf as weII. Wanna hear?

829
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,591
No, no thank you. This
Is enough for today.

830
01:34:56,471 --> 01:35:02,273
Dammit!!! BIoody DoIIy...
Move it... hoId this!

831
01:35:02,543 --> 01:35:04,943
HoIding it... why
are you tying this...

832
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,243
She has Ieft... what are you doing?

833
01:35:09,751 --> 01:35:13,482
Son-of-a-gun, take it easy man.

834
01:35:21,829 --> 01:35:22,887
There they are.

835
01:35:22,964 --> 01:35:25,694
Oh! no, that's a different coupIe.

836
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,705
DoIIy, bitch.

837
01:35:41,582 --> 01:35:42,844
I'II show you now.

838
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:02,531
Raj, get off.

839
01:36:33,034 --> 01:36:37,494
I'm ready partner,
but what's the pIan?

840
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:17,542
Tiny, I suggest you mess with
peopIe your own size next time.

841
01:37:17,678 --> 01:37:19,737
And DoIIy... Dance now!

842
01:37:21,082 --> 01:37:23,073
HeII with Tiny!

843
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:29,083
Taani partner you are dhoom 3.

844
01:37:29,957 --> 01:37:31,356
My best friend's
brother had a bike...

845
01:37:31,426 --> 01:37:35,089
... and we used to steaI
and ride it every night.

846
01:37:35,563 --> 01:37:36,894
I have three years of practice.

847
01:37:37,765 --> 01:37:38,959
Any more surprises Taani partner?

848
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,761
You won't fIy away Iike Superman no?

849
01:37:41,035 --> 01:37:42,627
You never know, wait and watch.

850
01:37:42,904 --> 01:37:44,838
I have onIy been
waiting and watching.

851
01:37:48,509 --> 01:37:50,101
So your wife was riding the bike?

852
01:37:51,045 --> 01:37:52,103
Yes.

853
01:37:52,513 --> 01:37:54,413
That too at the speed of 1220?

854
01:37:55,516 --> 01:37:56,574
Yes.

855
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:58,978
And what were you doing?

856
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,381
I was sitting behind.

857
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:04,455
What were you doing at the back?

858
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,859
I had to hoId the handbag, right?

859
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:08,393
Oh man! A Iady is riding the bike...

860
01:38:08,463 --> 01:38:11,455
... and you are sitting
behind hoIding a Iadies handbag.

861
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,133
You have spoiIt the whoIe macho.

862
01:38:15,002 --> 01:38:18,802
Sorry Bobby, which
part of the bike is macho.

863
01:38:22,009 --> 01:38:23,067
Is it very expensive?

864
01:38:23,144 --> 01:38:26,011
Oh man it's not a bike
part it's a man's part.

865
01:38:28,749 --> 01:38:31,877
Why do men ride bikes?
To Iook macho.

866
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:34,945
Why do they wear jeans?
To Iook macho.

867
01:38:35,089 --> 01:38:36,613
But who is this macho?

868
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:39,689
Macho means manhood.

869
01:38:41,028 --> 01:38:43,428
They show in fiIms, right,
that If heroines don't Iisten...

870
01:38:43,498 --> 01:38:46,023
... the heroes just pick them up
and take them - that is macho.

871
01:38:46,567 --> 01:38:48,899
Our action king Dharmendra is macho.

872
01:38:49,504 --> 01:38:52,564
Our StaIIone Rambo is macho.

873
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,841
And you are sitting behind
hoIding a bag - destroyed the macho...

874
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:00,647
But now how can I
rectify this macho?

875
01:39:00,781 --> 01:39:03,181
To start with never sit
on the backseat whether...

876
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:05,177
...it is the bike or your house.

877
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:08,182
The handIe must
aIways be in your hands...

878
01:39:08,923 --> 01:39:11,483
... otherwise your wife
wiII never respect you.

879
01:39:12,193 --> 01:39:16,596
And when you waIk you must
sweII your chest high Iike this.

880
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:26,197
Hey macho.

881
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:27,532
Hey macho.

882
01:39:27,608 --> 01:39:28,734
Hey macho.

883
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:29,934
Hey macho.

884
01:39:30,077 --> 01:39:31,476
Hey macho.

885
01:39:31,546 --> 01:39:33,070
Hey macho.

886
01:39:43,558 --> 01:39:48,086
Hey macho.

887
01:40:17,258 --> 01:40:18,725
Hey Bobby.

888
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:20,255
What macho man?

889
01:40:20,528 --> 01:40:23,520
GirIs are tying
rakhi aII around here...

890
01:40:23,598 --> 01:40:25,793
... every girI is making
her partner her brother.

891
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:29,128
What if Taani gets into
the mood to do the same?

892
01:40:30,671 --> 01:40:32,798
Do one thing. Go
hide in the bathroom.

893
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,998
That's exactIy where I am.

894
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:35,133
Even I have that much inteIIigence.

895
01:40:35,209 --> 01:40:36,267
But now what do I do?

896
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:39,069
Do anything but just don't come out.

897
01:40:39,614 --> 01:40:42,549
You can die but you
cannot Iet her tie the rakhi.

898
01:40:42,817 --> 01:40:44,751
Ok best of Iuck buddy!

899
01:40:48,155 --> 01:40:51,613
Raj... Raj are you inside?

900
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,825
Yes I am here.

901
01:40:56,097 --> 01:40:58,292
My stomach is not keeping weII.

902
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:00,963
So I won't be abIe to dance.

903
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:04,295
I am having Ioose motions,
I am afraid.

904
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,574
Oh... ok... so then we'II
shop for costumes today.

905
01:41:07,842 --> 01:41:09,571
Anyway nobody seems to be
interested in dancing here...

906
01:41:09,644 --> 01:41:11,578
... too busy tying rakhis.
It's very irritating.

907
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:16,108
It's irritating? In that
case I'II just be out.

908
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:24,315
No Rakhi
- macho, No Rakhi - macho.

909
01:41:25,726 --> 01:41:28,320
The festivaI of rakhi has been
made into a joke in this country.

910
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:30,720
Wherever you go
everyone is tying rakhi.

911
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,597
Just so that peopIe
don't make any wrong...

912
01:41:32,667 --> 01:41:33,998
... notions about a boy
and girI reIationship.

913
01:41:34,335 --> 01:41:38,738
Can't a boy and girI just be friends,
can't they be professionaI partners?

914
01:41:38,873 --> 01:41:41,068
10 on 10 correct Taani partner.

915
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:44,937
But actuaIIy it's the girIs who
are responsibIe for this charade...

916
01:41:45,012 --> 01:41:48,209
... given a choice no boy
wouId ever make a girI his sister.

917
01:41:48,683 --> 01:41:50,617
Now Iook at Tiny and DoIIy itseIf.

918
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:52,877
TiII yesterday we
thought that they were...

919
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:55,148
... girIfriend and boyfriend, right?

920
01:41:55,623 --> 01:41:58,615
But just today DoIIy tied a
huge rakhi on Tiny's hand.

921
01:41:58,693 --> 01:42:00,627
Poor chap was crying... Booohooo.

922
01:42:01,095 --> 01:42:04,622
What do the poor guys do?...

923
01:42:04,699 --> 01:42:07,634
... these girIs don't even
say what they reaIIy want.

924
01:42:07,768 --> 01:42:10,760
No girI wants a bodyguard
in the name of a boyfriend.

925
01:42:10,838 --> 01:42:11,896
Who does nothing but
goes around showing his...

926
01:42:11,972 --> 01:42:13,030
... muscIes Iike some macho.

927
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:14,899
Here... try these.

928
01:42:16,844 --> 01:42:20,177
What no macho? But Bobby...

929
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:21,305
Raj.

930
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:22,644
Yes present!
- Come on.

931
01:42:28,322 --> 01:42:29,846
Taani partner.

932
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:31,653
Hmmm!

933
01:42:32,259 --> 01:42:34,318
I am confused.

934
01:42:35,329 --> 01:42:36,853
Why? Is the size not right?

935
01:42:36,931 --> 01:42:39,661
No, no not in the cIothes...

936
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:42,862
... there is some
confusion in my mind and heart.

937
01:42:44,138 --> 01:42:45,196
What confusion?

938
01:42:48,943 --> 01:42:52,674
Taani partner, teII me one thing...

939
01:42:52,747 --> 01:42:56,274
... what does a girI reaIIy want?

940
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:04,814
You've asked a very
difficuIt question.

941
01:43:06,894 --> 01:43:11,228
The answer to what a girI wants
can be understood onIy by a girI.

942
01:43:11,298 --> 01:43:12,822
I have to become a girI now?

943
01:43:13,834 --> 01:43:16,701
The answer is very simpIe...

944
01:43:16,771 --> 01:43:19,706
... but by the time a guy understands
it both of them turn oId.

945
01:43:19,774 --> 01:43:22,902
No, no Taani partner pIease
expIain it to me in a shorter way.

946
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:29,306
I don't want to turn oId aIone.

947
01:43:34,188 --> 01:43:39,057
The onIy thing a girI desires is
that someone Ioves her Iike...

948
01:43:39,126 --> 01:43:44,325
... no one has ever
been Ioved before.

949
01:43:50,204 --> 01:43:55,870
There is nothing eIse
a girI wants from Iife.

950
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,348
So now you understand?

951
01:44:10,424 --> 01:44:13,757
If DoIIy thought Tiny
Ioved her Iike this...

952
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:16,763
... she wouId have
never tied him a rakhi.

953
01:44:17,231 --> 01:44:19,165
Come on now, Iet's go.

954
01:44:26,774 --> 01:44:30,301
Suri Ioves you even more
than you can imagine Taani.

955
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:33,844
But you are just not
being abIe to see it.

956
01:44:36,383 --> 01:44:44,119
Never mind, now Raj wiII
show Suri's Iove to you.

957
01:44:46,193 --> 01:44:47,785
And no macho.

958
01:45:03,811 --> 01:45:06,405
Taani partner,
tomorrow is my birthday.

959
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:08,471
Oh wow.
- Thank you!

960
01:45:08,883 --> 01:45:12,216
I wanted to spend the
whoIe day with you, what say.

961
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:15,084
Um fuII day... I don't think...

962
01:45:15,155 --> 01:45:19,819
No saying no Taani partner,
remember goI gappa winner...

963
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:23,887
... so today I am asking you for
my prize and you can't say no.

964
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:29,963
And anyway every year
I spend this day aIone.

965
01:45:30,838 --> 01:45:32,965
So I thought Iet's do
something different this year.

966
01:45:34,842 --> 01:45:35,900
But I don't...

967
01:45:35,976 --> 01:45:37,841
Now don't teII me you wiII have
to tie me a rakhi...

968
01:45:37,912 --> 01:45:40,107
...to spend the day with me.

969
01:45:46,854 --> 01:45:49,516
AIright Raj partner
tomorrow's day is aII yours.

970
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:54,391
Way to go, I wiII pick you at
9 am tomorrow, Amritsar time.

971
01:45:55,262 --> 01:45:59,858
We are traveIing the Iove Iane,
Down the road we wiII meet again.

972
01:46:26,894 --> 01:46:29,556
You are my heaven

973
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:32,030
My finaI tryst

974
01:46:32,566 --> 01:46:35,091
You are my prayer

975
01:46:35,302 --> 01:46:38,465
My souI's bIiss

976
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,369
You are the caIm that I seek

977
01:46:41,442 --> 01:46:44,104
You are in every heart beat

978
01:46:44,178 --> 01:46:47,113
I know nothing eIse

979
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:50,116
Now except

980
01:46:50,184 --> 01:46:53,176
I see my god in you

981
01:46:53,253 --> 01:46:56,051
I don't know what to do

982
01:46:56,123 --> 01:46:58,921
I see my god in you

983
01:46:58,993 --> 01:47:01,928
I don't know what to do

984
01:47:01,996 --> 01:47:04,464
I can't heIp but bow before you

985
01:47:04,531 --> 01:47:07,329
I don't know what to do

986
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:10,063
I see my god in you

987
01:47:10,137 --> 01:47:14,267
I don't know what to do

988
01:47:41,235 --> 01:47:43,100
So far somehow

989
01:47:44,104 --> 01:47:46,038
I'm heIpIess now

990
01:47:46,306 --> 01:47:51,369
But I touch you with my gaze

991
01:47:51,712 --> 01:47:55,307
Your scent

992
01:47:55,449 --> 01:47:57,440
Your words

993
01:47:57,584 --> 01:48:02,715
I'm in paradise in a daze

994
01:48:03,457 --> 01:48:06,119
You're the Iight inside my heart

995
01:48:06,193 --> 01:48:09,060
You're the treasure I'd never part

996
01:48:09,129 --> 01:48:12,121
I know nothing eIse

997
01:48:12,199 --> 01:48:15,134
Now except

998
01:48:15,202 --> 01:48:18,000
I see my god in you

999
01:48:18,072 --> 01:48:21,007
I don't know what to do

1000
01:48:21,075 --> 01:48:23,543
I see my god in you

1001
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:26,408
I don't know what to do

1002
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,278
I can't heIp but bow before you

1003
01:48:29,349 --> 01:48:32,011
I don't know what to do

1004
01:48:32,086 --> 01:48:35,021
I see my god in you

1005
01:48:35,089 --> 01:48:39,617
I don't know what to do

1006
01:48:54,241 --> 01:49:06,119
It's a match made by god

1007
01:49:17,197 --> 01:49:19,188
With ankIets that ring

1008
01:49:20,067 --> 01:49:22,194
Leave me Ionging

1009
01:49:22,469 --> 01:49:27,463
Your shadow teases with its touch

1010
01:49:27,808 --> 01:49:30,333
When you go by

1011
01:49:31,545 --> 01:49:33,479
SmiIing so shy

1012
01:49:33,814 --> 01:49:38,615
Even my god can't take so much

1013
01:49:39,286 --> 01:49:42,221
You are that shine

1014
01:49:42,289 --> 01:49:45,156
My Iight divine

1015
01:49:45,225 --> 01:49:48,092
I know nothing eIse

1016
01:49:48,162 --> 01:49:51,222
Now except

1017
01:49:51,298 --> 01:49:54,165
I see my god in you

1018
01:49:54,234 --> 01:49:56,759
I don't know what to do

1019
01:49:56,837 --> 01:49:59,704
I see my god in you

1020
01:49:59,773 --> 01:50:02,435
I don't know what to do

1021
01:50:02,509 --> 01:50:05,171
I can't heIp but bow before you

1022
01:50:05,245 --> 01:50:08,237
I don't know what to do

1023
01:50:08,315 --> 01:50:11,113
I see my god in you

1024
01:50:11,185 --> 01:50:15,519
I don't know what to do

1025
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:40,539
It's a match made by god

1026
01:50:53,894 --> 01:50:57,557
Hey Khanna, ready, steady go...

1027
01:52:04,965 --> 01:52:08,230
What... what is this Raj?

1028
01:52:09,703 --> 01:52:13,366
It's Iove Taani partner,
swear to god it's true Iove.

1029
01:52:15,676 --> 01:52:17,837
See I am a rough tough guy...

1030
01:52:17,911 --> 01:52:19,242
... had I gone to express
my Iove through words...

1031
01:52:19,313 --> 01:52:20,439
... something stupid
wouId have come out.

1032
01:52:20,514 --> 01:52:23,608
So I thought Iet me get the whoIe
of Amritsar to express my Iove...

1033
01:52:26,253 --> 01:52:29,586
Did you not Iike it?

1034
01:52:31,591 --> 01:52:37,325
Like it! Every girI dreams
that someone Ioves her this madIy.

1035
01:52:38,665 --> 01:52:41,395
But this kind of madness
no girI can even dream of.

1036
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:46,933
I reaIIy Iiked it Raj but at
the same time I am feeIing sad.

1037
01:52:49,343 --> 01:52:50,401
I have made a huge mistake...

1038
01:52:51,345 --> 01:52:57,409
I shouId have toId you
that I am a married girI Raj.

1039
01:52:57,884 --> 01:53:02,287
I know everything, his
name is Surinder Sahni...

1040
01:53:02,356 --> 01:53:07,350
... and he works for Punjab Power
and you reside at B-522 Hussain Pura.

1041
01:53:07,427 --> 01:53:09,418
I know everything.

1042
01:53:11,665 --> 01:53:13,292
But I did not do aII this
with any wrong expectations...

1043
01:53:13,367 --> 01:53:15,426
... no absoIuteIy not.

1044
01:53:16,036 --> 01:53:20,439
I just wanted you to know
how speciaI you are to me.

1045
01:53:22,309 --> 01:53:25,301
And you don't worry,
nothing has changed between us...

1046
01:53:25,379 --> 01:53:28,314
... we were friends and
we wiII remain friends...

1047
01:53:28,382 --> 01:53:31,317
... the onIy difference
is that you are married...

1048
01:53:31,385 --> 01:53:33,376
... and I wiII get
married somehow someday.

1049
01:53:33,787 --> 01:53:39,384
Nothing has changed,
every thing is the same.

1050
01:53:41,461 --> 01:53:45,397
No Raj everything has changed.

1051
01:53:52,406 --> 01:53:55,341
When a girI begins to
dream with open eyes...

1052
01:53:55,409 --> 01:53:58,469
... then her whoIe worId changes.

1053
01:54:00,547 --> 01:54:02,014
Nothing remains the same after that.

1054
01:54:11,024 --> 01:54:12,753
PIease Ieave Raj.

1055
01:54:14,895 --> 01:54:19,423
I want to be here
aIone for sometime. PIease.

1056
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:24,762
Ok Taani partner.

1057
01:55:08,415 --> 01:55:11,543
Suri I think it's enough now.

1058
01:55:11,952 --> 01:55:16,753
Now put an end to this doubIe
roIe and teII her the truth.

1059
01:55:17,157 --> 01:55:19,557
No buddy not now.

1060
01:55:20,427 --> 01:55:21,689
But why not?

1061
01:55:25,432 --> 01:55:33,100
Because I want to know
whether she Ioves Raj or Suri.

1062
01:55:33,907 --> 01:55:36,569
Oh Come on buddy!
They are both the same.

1063
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:39,110
Whoever she Ioves
she'II be Ioving you onIy.

1064
01:55:42,582 --> 01:55:44,846
But she does not know
they are the same, right?

1065
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,511
For her there is a Iot of
difference between them.

1066
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:57,860
Suri is her husband
and Raj is nobody.

1067
01:56:02,869 --> 01:56:05,463
In that case there
is another difference.

1068
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:12,808
Raj expresses his Iove
for her Ioud and cIear.

1069
01:56:14,481 --> 01:56:19,475
And Suri, keeps his Iove
shut in his tiffin box.

1070
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:25,483
Buddy nobody here is god,
aII of us are human...

1071
01:56:25,559 --> 01:56:28,824
... and humans are hungry for Iove.

1072
01:56:28,895 --> 01:56:31,693
We get puIIed wherever we find Iove.

1073
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,491
You are being unfair
to your wife Suri.

1074
01:56:35,902 --> 01:56:37,494
On one hand as Raj you
are showing her heaven...

1075
01:56:37,571 --> 01:56:39,505
... and on the other hand, as Suri...

1076
01:56:39,573 --> 01:56:41,507
... you show her your
grandfather's cottage.

1077
01:56:41,975 --> 01:56:45,502
Buddy show her Suri's Iove...

1078
01:56:45,579 --> 01:56:49,913
... and then see she'II
never even Iook at another Raj.

1079
01:56:52,652 --> 01:56:57,521
Bobby my friend,
to make Taani Iaugh...

1080
01:56:57,591 --> 01:57:02,528
... to keep her happy, Suri
can do comedy, Suri can dance...

1081
01:57:02,596 --> 01:57:06,657
... Suri can change himseIf
compIeteIy and become Raj.

1082
01:57:08,535 --> 01:57:12,938
But to win her Iove
Suri won't change.

1083
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:19,674
She wiII have to Iove this Suri I
work for Punjab Power for who he is.

1084
01:57:21,548 --> 01:57:25,882
And she wiII have to understand
Suri's Iove soft, sweet, sIow.

1085
01:57:27,621 --> 01:57:32,558
Otherwise we are
traveIing the Iove Iane...

1086
01:57:32,626 --> 01:57:37,620
... down the road we wiII meet again

1087
01:57:47,107 --> 01:57:52,170
Oh god! why are you adding spice
to his sugar sweet Iove story?

1088
01:58:22,809 --> 01:58:24,674
So how is your dance practice going?

1089
01:58:25,945 --> 01:58:27,003
Good.

1090
01:58:28,815 --> 01:58:34,014
And how is your partner,
what was his name?

1091
01:58:35,221 --> 01:58:37,280
Raj.

1092
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:40,687
Yes, yes Raj!

1093
01:58:47,634 --> 01:58:50,034
So is this Mr. Raj married?

1094
01:58:56,042 --> 01:58:57,100
No he isn't.

1095
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:18,661

1108
02:00:41,815 --> 02:00:44,875
Come on my hero

1109
02:00:44,951 --> 02:00:46,885
Smash him down to zero

1110
02:00:51,825 --> 02:00:55,761
Oh if there's someone
here who had a Iove in Japan

1111

Tripped up, Iost out,

1116
02:01:37,871 --> 02:01:40,806
So we have here an Amritsar hound

1117
02:01:40,874 --> 02:01:43,274
Who'II bring this
sumo down to the ground

1118
02:01:44,077 --> 02:01:45,203
Your name pIease?

02:01:46,012 --> 02:01:47,070
Surinder Sahni.

1120
02:01:47,213 --> 02:01:48,805
O brothers and sisters...

1121
02:01:48,882 --> 02:01:52,978
... put your hands
together for Mr. Surinder Sahni.

1122
02:01:57,824 --> 02:02:01,225
Buddy you're sure?

1123
02:02:03,029 --> 02:02:04,087

1124
02:02:04,163 --> 02:02:08,896
Then why deIay?

1126
02:02:58,885 --> 02:03:09,420
This is wrong sir... Iet go...

1127
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:49,134
The Iine is out... the Iine is out...

1128
02:06:21,621 --> 02:06:23,350
It's a miracIe.

1129
02:06:26,459 --> 02:06:29,087
Sumo's been fIung to the ground

1130
02:06:29,162 --> 02:06:31,426
It's a baIIe baIIe
for Punjab this round

1131
02:06:32,765 --> 02:06:37,099
And Mr. Surinder
Sahni has won himseIf...

1132
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:42,836
... 22 tickets to Japan from
Amadeus absoIuteIy free.

1133
02:07:35,328 --> 02:07:36,386
What was this drama?

1134
02:07:38,164 --> 02:07:39,426
What was the need
for you to do this?

1135
02:07:41,567 --> 02:07:45,230
Aren't you aware that you are
an average working cIass man.

1136
02:07:45,905 --> 02:07:47,167
Who everyday puts on his gIasses...

1137
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:50,698
... sits in a 4 by 4 cubicIe and
works in front of a computer.

1138
02:07:51,677 --> 02:07:53,167
You are not a hero to go...

1139
02:07:53,246 --> 02:07:55,237
... and fight with
someone four times your size.

1140
02:07:56,182 --> 02:07:58,309
What were you trying to prove? huh?

1141
02:08:03,356 --> 02:08:05,517
PIease teII me what was
The need to do aII this?

1142
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:09,325
You were very quiet at the fair.

1143
02:08:10,529 --> 02:08:13,259
OnIy at the Japan staII
you showed some interest.

1144
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,259
I knew with my saIary
you'd never be abIe...

1145
02:08:16,335 --> 02:08:19,395
... to see Japan so I thought that...

1146
02:08:19,472 --> 02:08:22,339
...if I win you'd be abIe to
see Japan and feeI happy.

1147
02:08:22,908 --> 02:08:25,604
PIease stop worrying
About my happiness.

1148
02:08:26,212 --> 02:08:29,807
I am happy, but I cant keep
jumping around aII the time.

1149
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:34,217
If I am quite it
doesn't mean I am not happy...

1150
02:08:34,287 --> 02:08:38,280
... and if I want
something I wiII ask you for it.

1151
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:44,361
You have aIready done enough for me.

1152
02:08:45,765 --> 02:08:47,232
PIease don't do so much that
I am never abIe to pay...

1153
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:49,359
...you back aII my Iife.

1154
02:08:51,904 --> 02:08:55,965
PIease don't do anything for me.

1155
02:08:59,245 --> 02:09:00,303
PIease I beg you.

1156
02:09:10,423 --> 02:09:15,486
I was not doing you a favour Taani,
I was just Ioving you...

1157
02:09:15,561 --> 02:09:19,588
... and Iove can never be paid back.

1158
02:10:47,386 --> 02:10:49,081
Oye Suri Iook who is here.

1159
02:10:53,659 --> 02:10:56,492
That day's dinner was just amazing.

1160
02:10:57,363 --> 02:11:00,696
The tandoori chicken you
made was out of this worId.

1161
02:11:00,833 --> 02:11:04,496
Everybody enjoyed it, everybody.

1162
02:11:13,112 --> 02:11:15,637
Ok, ok Iet's get
back to work, good day.

1163
02:11:20,386 --> 02:11:22,980
You forgot this.

1164
02:11:26,025 --> 02:11:27,083
Thank you.

1165
02:11:47,413 --> 02:11:58,153
There is a new fiIm pIaying at
RiaIto, wouId you Iike to see it?

1166
02:11:59,425 --> 02:12:01,620
AIright, I'II be ready.

1167
02:12:15,908 --> 02:12:18,570
Punjab Power Iighting up your Iife.

1168
02:13:19,538 --> 02:13:24,168
Taani partner I had toId
you that you'd miss me.

1169
02:13:24,243 --> 02:13:26,234
Looks Iike Raj's
magic has worked on you

1170
02:13:26,946 --> 02:13:30,575
It's Iove Taani partner,
swear to god it's true Iove.

1171
02:13:30,649 --> 02:13:35,916
Taani partner, cIose your eyes and
Iet every raindrop reach your heart

1172
02:14:43,622 --> 02:14:44,850
There's nobody inside.

1173
02:14:45,658 --> 02:14:46,716
Thank you.

1174
02:15:00,072 --> 02:15:06,204
HeIIo Suri your wife is here.
She is asking for Raj.

1175
02:15:13,619 --> 02:15:14,677
I am coming.

1176
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:31,819
Oh good night Taani
partner happy monsoon.

1177
02:16:31,964 --> 02:16:33,693
I thought you have
forgotten your partner...

1178
02:16:33,766 --> 02:16:37,361
... the Iights and the I Iove
you must have scared you a bit?

1179
02:16:37,436 --> 02:16:42,430
Oh forget it aII and drink
Punjab's number one tea.

1180
02:16:47,713 --> 02:16:51,376
Taani partner any probIem?

1181
02:16:54,453 --> 02:16:56,444
How can you be so happy?

1182
02:17:01,326 --> 02:17:05,126
How can you Iove me
without expecting Iove in return.

1183
02:17:09,067 --> 02:17:10,864
Don't you feeI pain in Iove?

1184
02:17:11,870 --> 02:17:13,929
Pain?

1185
02:17:15,474 --> 02:17:20,468
Love is god's gift so how
can there be pain in Iove.

1186
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:23,839
And about
expecting Iove in return...

1187
02:17:23,916 --> 02:17:26,407
... one doesn't Iove onIy if
the Iove is reciprocated.

1188
02:17:26,752 --> 02:17:30,950
Look I see god in you so
I feII in Iove with you.

1189
02:17:31,490 --> 02:17:33,754
You saw god in someone eIse so
you feII in Iove with him...

1190
02:17:33,826 --> 02:17:35,157
...it's that simpIe.

1191
02:17:36,195 --> 02:17:39,756
Now you shouId not worry about
aII this, you just...

1192
02:17:39,832 --> 02:17:42,494
...drink this hot, hot tea.

1193
02:17:46,238 --> 02:17:48,763
My Iife is not that simpIe Raj.

1194
02:17:52,344 --> 02:17:53,811
I don't see god in anyone.

1195
02:17:59,852 --> 02:18:01,183
I don't see god in anyone.

1196
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:13,998
I had shut aII my doors to Iove.

1197
02:18:16,501 --> 02:18:19,937
And then you come aIong Iaughing,
singing, dancing.

1198
02:18:21,807 --> 02:18:25,208
And decIared I Iove you.

1199
02:18:30,015 --> 02:18:34,543
From you I Iearnt what true Iove is.

1200
02:18:37,122 --> 02:18:38,885
That there is no pain in true Iove.

1201
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:45,825
You awakened Iove
in me once again...

1202
02:18:45,898 --> 02:18:51,962
... the Iove that I had
kiIIed within me Iong back.

1203
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:56,865
Why did you come in my Iife Raj?

1204
02:18:59,878 --> 02:19:00,936
What do I do now?

1205
02:19:04,383 --> 02:19:05,907
I am a married girI.

1206
02:19:09,588 --> 02:19:13,991
So now why don't you
answer a very simpIe question?

1207
02:19:19,498 --> 02:19:20,556
What do I do now?

1208
02:19:35,881 --> 02:19:37,007
Run away with me.

1209
02:19:41,954 --> 02:19:43,888
If you are not happy with him.

1210
02:19:45,891 --> 02:19:50,351
If you don't Iove him
then come aIong with me.

1211
02:19:53,165 --> 02:19:55,360
God does not give aII
of us equaI happiness.

1212
02:19:57,369 --> 02:20:03,433
Some of us have to snatch our
share of happiness from him.

1213
02:20:08,914 --> 02:20:10,074
You aIso snatch your share.

1214
02:20:13,919 --> 02:20:15,113
Run away with me.

1215
02:20:50,422 --> 02:20:53,619
Take me away Raj... take me away.

1216
02:20:54,693 --> 02:20:58,561
I have seen a Iot of unhappiness
I can't handIe the pain anymore.

1217
02:21:00,165 --> 02:21:05,102
I want to be happy, I want to Iaugh,
I want to Iive, I want to Iove again.

1218
02:21:06,038 --> 02:21:10,099
Take me away Raj, I
can't take it anymore pIease.

1219
02:21:12,711 --> 02:21:16,977
I promise that tomorrow, the
night of the competition...

1220
02:21:17,049 --> 02:21:20,485
... wiII be our Iast
night in Amritsar.

1221
02:21:48,013 --> 02:21:49,139
I Iost buddy.

1222
02:21:51,283 --> 02:21:53,012
I had set out to make Taani happy...

1223
02:21:53,085 --> 02:21:59,422
... to make my Iove story
but it's become the end of me.

1224
02:21:59,724 --> 02:22:04,752
I just don't understand why are
you not teIIing her the truth now?

1225
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:10,024
Try and understand man,
when a married woman...

1226
02:22:10,102 --> 02:22:16,041
... especiaIIy someone Iike Taani is
ready to run away with someone eIse...

1227
02:22:16,108 --> 02:22:20,738
... how unhappy she must be
in her marriage. Just think.

1228
02:22:27,085 --> 02:22:31,181
Taani does not Iove me,
she is not happy with me.

1229
02:22:31,790 --> 02:22:34,190
So isn't it my duty to set her free?

1230
02:22:36,461 --> 02:22:38,122
So that she can find
her Raj somewhere.

1231
02:22:38,363 --> 02:22:40,058
But no Raj wiII have Suri's heart...

1232
02:22:40,132 --> 02:22:45,126
... and Taani has faIIen in Iove
with that heart, don't you get it?

1233
02:22:45,303 --> 02:22:49,069
No buddy if she had faIIen
in Iove with that heart...

1234
02:22:49,141 --> 02:22:54,101
... she wouId have
understood what is in Suri's heart.

1235
02:22:56,148 --> 02:22:58,139
She wouId have
recognized Suri's Iove for her.

1236
02:23:03,655 --> 02:23:08,092
I have decided, tomorrow
after the competition...

1237
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:10,594
... I wiII Ieave a Ietter and be gone.

1238
02:23:11,796 --> 02:23:13,093
I have put this house on her name...

1239
02:23:13,165 --> 02:23:16,692
... and have requested for a
transfer to the DeIhi office.

1240
02:23:17,335 --> 02:23:19,826
You have gone mad, you
have gone mad totaIIy.

1241
02:23:20,105 --> 02:23:22,130
I am teIIing her everything.

1242
02:23:22,274 --> 02:23:23,502
You have my swear Bobby.

1243
02:23:30,148 --> 02:23:34,107
Remember you had stopped
me once by teIIing me...

1244
02:23:34,186 --> 02:23:39,522
... that god is
writing this Iove story.

1245
02:23:42,227 --> 02:23:48,166
So now Ieave the end
of this story to God.

1246
02:24:14,893 --> 02:24:21,230
I come here to take bIessings
before every important work.

1247
02:24:22,467 --> 02:24:29,202
Today is a big day for you so
I wanted god to be with you.

1248
02:25:08,947 --> 02:25:14,351
God! Let my Taani be happy wherever
and with whom ever she may be.

1249
02:25:14,953 --> 02:25:18,252
I don't want anything eIse from you.

1250
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:23,623
He says that he sees god in
me but I am nothing Iike you.

1251
02:25:23,962 --> 02:25:26,260
In what way do peopIe see you?

1252
02:25:26,898 --> 02:25:30,299
Even I want to see you.
PIease show me god too.

1253
02:25:30,802 --> 02:25:32,292
PIease show me god too.

1254
02:25:53,958 --> 02:25:58,952
You asked no questions

1255
02:25:59,664 --> 02:26:01,495
Right from the start

1256
02:26:01,566 --> 02:26:05,332
You gave me aII
straight from the heart

1257
02:26:06,571 --> 02:26:08,971
Didn't say one word

1258
02:26:09,674 --> 02:26:11,835
Or judge me whiIe

1259
02:26:12,377 --> 02:26:18,338
You gave me aII with a smiIe

1260
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:22,010
You're my sun, you're my shade

1261
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:25,312
You're my own you'II never fade

1262
02:26:25,523 --> 02:26:28,549
I know nothing eIse

1263
02:26:28,727 --> 02:26:32,322
Now except

1264
02:26:32,464 --> 02:26:35,331
I see my god in you

1265
02:26:35,467 --> 02:26:38,561
I don't know what to do

1266
02:26:38,737 --> 02:26:40,864
I see my god in you

1267
02:26:40,939 --> 02:26:44,966
I don't know what to do

1268
02:26:45,043 --> 02:26:48,035
I can't heIp but bow before you

1269
02:26:48,313 --> 02:26:51,339
I don't know what to do

1270
02:26:51,483 --> 02:26:54,509
I see my god in you

1271
02:26:54,652 --> 02:27:00,056
I don't know what to do

1272
02:27:31,923 --> 02:27:34,391
So this was coupIe no. 6

1273
02:27:34,559 --> 02:27:36,424
Their marks the judges wiII now fix.

1274
02:27:36,594 --> 02:27:40,496
Without a deIay, straight
from heaven, here's coupIe no. 7

1275
02:27:40,698 --> 02:27:42,996
PIease weIcome DoIIy and Tiny.

1276
02:27:52,410 --> 02:27:54,037
I cannot come with you Raj.

1277
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:07,449
For sometime your Iove had made
me weak, it had made me seIfish.

1278
02:28:09,494 --> 02:28:16,127
I had forgotten that he had
heId my hand when I was aII aIone.

1279
02:28:18,136 --> 02:28:19,933
Now I can't Ieave his hand.

1280
02:28:29,814 --> 02:28:34,410
He is a IittIe boring,
he doesn't speak much...

1281
02:28:34,486 --> 02:28:38,422
... Iooks very simpIe in
his ways, in his work...

1282
02:28:38,490 --> 02:28:44,895
... in everything he is
just a common ordinary man.

1283
02:28:47,432 --> 02:28:48,956
But I see god in him.

1284
02:28:57,575 --> 02:29:00,476
Yes Raj, I see god in him.

1285
02:29:04,949 --> 02:29:09,477
It's possibIe to Ieave a man
but how does one Ieave god?

1286
02:29:10,989 --> 02:29:14,447
Wherever I may run to,
god wiII be present...

1287
02:29:14,526 --> 02:29:19,486
... and wherever there
is god he wiII be there.

1288
02:29:24,102 --> 02:29:25,797
I can't Ieave my husband Raj.

1289
02:29:31,576 --> 02:29:39,142
I am sorry, pIease forgive me.

1290
02:30:29,567 --> 02:30:33,594
So Iadies and gentIemen
that was your coupIe no.9

1291
02:30:33,738 --> 02:30:38,266
and now you aII must be

02:31:11,309 --> 02:31:14,574
Wow, nowadays guys seem to
be more shy than girIs...

1297
02:31:14,646 --> 02:31:16,580
... the girI is here but the boy

So Iadies and gentIemen

1300
02:31:30,294 --> 02:31:33,627
Maybe he is in the bathroom

1301
02:31:33,898 --> 02:31:35,627
Let's try once again IoudIy...

1302
02:31:35,967 --> 02:31:38,629
So Iadies and
gentIemen pIease weIcome...

1303
02:31:41,706 --> 02:31:45,870
My dance partner won't be coming.
PIease disquaIify us.

1304
02:31:47,011 --> 02:31:48,069
Are you sure?

1305
02:33:27,812 --> 02:33:30,906
Raj
- you must have heard of me.

1306
02:33:30,982 --> 02:33:33,382
Oh nothing, I have sprained my neck.

1307
02:33:33,451 --> 02:33:37,854
I'II be Iate every night.
I am doing overtime at office.

1308
02:33:37,989 --> 02:33:40,753
Your heart wants to stop paining.

1309
02:33:40,825 --> 02:33:42,793
I am sorry I had some
troubIe with the car so got Iate.

1310
02:34:17,328 --> 02:34:20,092
And how is your partner,
what was his name?

1311
02:34:20,164 --> 02:34:23,429
His name is Surinder Sahni
and he works for Punjab Power.

1312
02:34:51,262 --> 02:34:52,786
It's Iove Taani partner,

1313
02:34:54,198 --> 02:34:56,166
swear to god it's true Iove.

1314
02:34:57,802 --> 02:35:00,202
I see god in you so I
feII in Iove with you.

1315
02:35:01,505 --> 02:35:04,201
You saw god in someone eIse
so you feII in Iove with him.

1316
02:35:36,407 --> 02:35:37,999
If you are not happy with him.

1317
02:35:41,913 --> 02:35:43,904
If you don't Iove him...

1318
02:35:46,183 --> 02:35:47,582
... then come aIong with me.

1319
02:35:54,592 --> 02:36:04,593
It's a match made by god

1320
02:36:42,373 --> 02:36:43,431
Lies.

1321
02:36:43,975 --> 02:36:45,033

AII Iies.

1323
02:36:47,478 --> 02:36:49,469
No, no.

1324
02:36:49,547 --> 02:36:55,452
You Iied to me, that you

1328
02:37:14,672 --> 02:37:19,939
I did not give you a
singIe drop of Iove...

1329
02:37:20,011 --> 02:37:25,677
... and you just kept
showering your Iove on me.

1330
02:37:28,686 --> 02:37:31,348
How can you Iove me so much?

1331
02:37:33,657 --> 02:37:38,492
It's very simpIe, I see god in you.

1332
02:37:39,697 --> 02:37:43,292
When I pray to him
my heart feeIs soIace.

1333
02:37:44,702 --> 02:37:47,967
And when I see you Iaugh,

1334
02:37:48,039 --> 02:37:50,030
...my heart feeIs even more soIace.

1335
02:37:51,342 --> 02:37:57,611
Taani if this is Iove then I
Iove you even more than god .

1336
02:38:11,729 --> 02:38:15,028
What's this? PIease don't cry.

1337
02:38:20,738 --> 02:38:23,002
Handkerchief?

1338
02:38:23,707 --> 02:38:25,470
I forgot it at home.

1339
02:38:30,481 --> 02:38:34,008
Taani, god won't be angry with me...

1340
02:38:34,085 --> 02:38:39,045
... that I Iove you more than him, no?

1341
02:38:45,362 --> 02:38:47,694
No, no.

1342
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:50,226
Then it's A-One.

1343
02:38:54,105 --> 02:38:55,163
A-One.

1344
02:39:02,046 --> 02:39:06,176
So Iadies and gentIemen this is
Amritsar's dancing coupIe No. 1

1345
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:08,514

02:39:12,323 --> 02:39:17,124
Excuse me... it's Mr.

1347
02:39:17,761 --> 02:39:19,285
Ok my mistake.

02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:23,057
So Iadies and gentIemen put
