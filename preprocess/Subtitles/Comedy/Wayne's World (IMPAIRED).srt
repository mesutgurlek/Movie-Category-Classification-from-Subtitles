211
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:34,760
Fine.

212
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:36,270
Say, I smell bacon.

213
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:38,272
Does anyone else
smell bacon?

214
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,274
Yeah, I
definitely smell

215
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:42,276
a pork product
of some type.

216
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:44,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know
what you're doing, Campbell.

Hey, what
are you up to?

221
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:55,957
I just pulled over
a tour bus

222
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,856
on its way to Chicago.

223
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:01,363
We had a tip there was
some drug smuggling going down.

224
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,863
We searched
the entire vehicle.

225
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:06,197
It was clean, so we proceeded
with body cavity searches.

226
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,326
No way.

227
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,803
Way! I inspected
12 individuals myself--

228
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,134
Inside and out.

229

and crullers stat!

233
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:21,849
We got to get him
to Rampart.

Excellent munchie post.

This is

before that night.

243
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:44,873
Why is it if a man kills
another man in battle

244
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,373
it's called heroic?

245
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,843
Yet if he kills a man
in the heat of passion

246
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:51,345
it's called murder?

247

Hello! What do you
think you're doing?

248

to talk to the camera.

two months ago.

That doesn't mean
we can't still go out.

to open your present?

What is it?

281
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,275
It's a gun rack.

00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,316

Let me ask you something.

433
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:50,394
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

434

Well, uh, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

435
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,908
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

436
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,910
Zantar is a gelatinous cube

in a medieval village.

you ascend
to a higher level.

440

Beauty part is you can't
get to the next level.

coughing up quarters.

just said riveting.

Well, I do
my own commercials.

447

I did not know that.

448

I don't mention the games
in the commercials

449
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,735

much faster than the advertising.

realize that?

Yeah, we were there.

There was this band--
Crucial Taunt--

They had this megababe
for a lead singer. Unreal!

to sell a show we don't own?

Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

That'd be privileged

In French,
she'd be called la renard.

01:01:06,717 --> 01:01:09,117
Do you want to go backstage?

1320
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:10,915
She's a psycho

1321
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:14,424
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

1322
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:15,890
Feed my Frankenstein

1323
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,552
Hungry for love

1324
01:01:17,628 --> 01:01:23,692
And it's feedin' time,
baby, whoa, whoa

1325
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,325
Oh, yeah

1326
01:01:25,402 --> 01:01:29,202
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein

1327
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:42,551
Where you going?

1328
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,882
Got a pass.

1329
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:45,387
- Yay!
- Backstage passes, yeah!

1330
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:46,889
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1331
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:48,720
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1332
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:52,558
Feed my Frankenstein

1333
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,565
Uh-oh. I think
we took a wrong turn,

1334
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,601
'cause we're outside now.

1335
01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:59,602
Whoa! Look!

1336
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:03,906
Is this Alice's limo?

1337
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,408
No. It belongs
to Frank Sharp,

1338
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:07,910
head of Sharp Records.

1339
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,411
Good friend of Alice's.

1340
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,414
Wow. That's, like, way bigger

1341
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,416
than a normal size car.

1342
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:16,078
Well, it has to be.
He drives everywhere.

1343
01:02:16,153 --> 01:02:17,586
Hates to fly.

1344
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:20,089
He's going across
the country right now

1345
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:23,092
to look for new acts
to sign to his label.

1346
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,752
Next stop is St. Louis.

1347
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:28,924
Then he'll come back through Chicago
on his way to Detroit.

1348
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:32,192
Thanks.

1349
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:38,040
You know,
for a security guard,

1350
01:02:38,108 --> 01:02:41,544
he had an awful lot of information,
don't you think?

1351
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:44,379
[ Cheering ]

1352
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:47,144
[ Cooper ]
Thank you, Milwaukee!

1353
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,558
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies.

1354
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:58,219
Sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry. No--

1355
01:02:58,295 --> 01:03:00,729
Oh, you got pass--
all right. Come on.

1356
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:02,231
Let us through,
please!

1357
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:03,891
Can't let you in.
Sorry.

1358
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:05,401
Please? Aw...

1359
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:09,731
Alice. Is this cool?

1360
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:11,570
Yeah. Come on in.

1361
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:13,234
Sorry to bother you,

1362
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,575
but we had to tell you
how much we enjoyed the show,

1363
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:18,080
didn't we, Garth?

1364
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:19,376
Y-Y-Y...

1365
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,644
Oh. Thanks.

1366
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,733
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

1367
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:24,064
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

1368
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:27,070
My name is Wayne,
and this is Garth.

1369
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:28,070
Ehhh...

1370
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,403
Nice to meet you guys.

1371
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:34,206
So do you...
come to Milwaukee often?

1372
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:37,912
Well, I'm a regular visitor here,

1373
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:40,849
but Milwaukee has certainly
had its share of visitors.

1374
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,510
The French missionaries
and explorers

1375
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:45,249
were coming here as early
as the late 1600s

1376
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:47,257
to trade with
the Native Americans.

1377
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,418
Isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?

1378
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:50,927
Yes, Pete, it is.

1379
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:53,020
Actually,
it's pronounced meeleewahkay,

1380
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:56,658
which is Algonquin
for the good land.

1381
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:58,531
I was not aware of that.

1382
01:03:58,603 --> 01:04:01,037
One of the most
interesting aspects of Milwaukee

1383
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:04,040
is the fact that it's
the only major American city

1384
01:04:04,108 --> 01:04:06,702
to have ever elected
three socialist mayors.

1385
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,507
Does this guy
know how to party or what?

1386
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,707
Huh? Huh?

1387
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:12,749
Oh.

1388
01:04:12,817 --> 01:04:16,446
O.K. Well, we got
to get going.

1389
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,512
No. Stick around.
Hang out with us.

1390
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:23,753
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay and
hang around with youse...

1391
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,395
with Alice Cooper.

1392
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,729
We're not worthy!

1393
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,564
We're not worthy!

1394
01:04:32,637 --> 01:04:34,537
We're not worthy!

1395
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,368
We're scum!

1396
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,498
We suck!

1397
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:41,978
Our first big show.

1398
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:43,980
We almost didn't make it.

1399
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:46,175
I really hope
Cassandra's watching.

1400
01:04:49,754 --> 01:04:52,484
Oh, yeah, perfect.
Whatever it costs--

1401
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:54,184
- How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

1402
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:55,657
Well, tonight's the night.

1403
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,024
A lot of people
in the Chicagoland area

1404
01:04:58,095 --> 01:04:59,892
will be watching the show.

1405
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:02,660
I already know
it's going to be a hit.

1406
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:05,133
I'll be in the booth.

1407
01:05:05,203 --> 01:05:07,603
Mr.Vanderhoff
will be your first guest.

1408
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:09,230
Oh, hi, boys.

1409
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:11,172
What the hell is this?

1410
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,802
Can we fly in
the sign, please?

1411
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:15,539
That's it.
Bring her down.

1412
01:05:15,613 --> 01:05:17,308
- Wha--
- Oh...look.

1413
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,939
Don't tense up.
You'll be great.

1414
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,211
Garth, have you
got a second?

1415
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,252
Uh...Wh...

1416
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,753
Simply read the cards.

1417
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:26,051
You're going to be
wonderful. Really.

1418
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:27,055
O.K.?

1419
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:30,154
Oh, Russell...

1420
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:32,162
can I borrow
your marker?

1421
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,165
I, uh...I need
to make some notes.

1422
01:05:36,567 --> 01:05:37,625
Good luck.

1423
01:05:38,736 --> 01:05:40,169
My guys.

1424
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:41,899
You're my guys!

1425
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:50,009
Your name
is pronounced Algar, right?

1426
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:51,673
O.K.

1427
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:53,410
Wayne!

1428
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:55,783
They'll be fine.

1429
01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:56,820
Good.

1430
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,615
- Stand by...
- This is it, honey.

1431
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:00,281
In 5...

1432
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:01,290
4...

1433
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,417
3...

1434
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:09,130
Wayne's World is brought to you
by Noah's Arcade.

1435
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,394
Party on, Wayne.

1436
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:12,527
Hey!

1437
01:06:12,603 --> 01:06:14,036
Wayne's World

1438
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:15,333
Wayne's World

1439
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,966
Party time

1440
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,532
Excellent

1441
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,046
It's Friday. It's 11:30.
It's time to party

1442
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:25,548
with your excellent host
Wayne Campbell,

1443
01:06:25,616 --> 01:06:28,608
and with him, as always,
is Garth.

1444
01:06:28,686 --> 01:06:31,621
Party on, Wayne,
and party on, Garth.

1445
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:34,157
Wayne's World

1446
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,293
O.K. Welcome
to Wayne's World.

1447
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:38,953
Party on, Garth.

1448
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,395
I guess.

1449
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,295
O.K. O.K.,
first of all,

1450
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:45,130
we'd like to take a moment here
on Wayne's World

1451
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,794
to welcome our sponsor.

1452
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:50,568
He's the owner of a fine chain
of Noah's Arcades--

1453
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:53,235
Noah Vanderhoff.
Nice name...

1454
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,243
not.

1455
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,973
Now, uh,
Mr.Vanderhoff...

1456
01:06:58,049 --> 01:06:59,641
He's using
the cards. Yes!

1457
01:06:59,717 --> 01:07:02,117
I told you
he'd fall in line.

1458
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:05,622
What is your most
popular video game right now?

1459
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:08,022
Uh, Desert Storm
Commando Warrior.

1460
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:10,117
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

1461
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:13,186
That would have to do with that
limited skirmish in the Middle East.

1462
01:07:13,264 --> 01:07:14,356
Yes.

1463
01:07:14,432 --> 01:07:16,161
What the hell's he doing?

1464
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:19,430
[ Wayne ] Aren't there long lines
for your more popular games?

1465
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:22,700
Well, at Noah's Arcade,
we like to say

1466
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:25,674
there's two of everything,
so there's never a line.

1467
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:26,937
Ha ha.

1468
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:29,775
O.K. Now, tell me, Noah,
I've always wanted to know--

1469
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:31,781
What is the difference
between Pac-Man

1470
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:33,680
and Ms.Pac-Man, really?

1471
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:36,948
Well, she has a bow on her head.

1472
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:37,953
That's it?

1473
01:07:38,022 --> 01:07:40,513
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1474
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:42,525
Get right
out of town.

1475
01:07:42,593 --> 01:07:43,525
No, that's it.

1476
01:07:43,594 --> 01:07:44,526
Heh heh.

1477
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:48,429
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1478
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:49,557

01:31:09,629 --> 01:31:10,721
It's excellent

1962
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,389
Wayne's World

1963
01:31:12,465 --> 01:31:13,659
Wayne's World

1964
01:31:13,733 --> 01:31:15,564

1966
01:31:22,142 --> 01:31:24,076
Excellent movie.
All right.

1967
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:25,577
Yeah. Good one.

1968
01:31:25,645 --> 01:31:28,580
Well, that's all the time
we have for our movie.

1969
01:31:28,648 --> 01:31:31,481
We hope you found it
entertaining,

1970
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:32,916
whimsical and yet relevant,

1971
01:31:32,986 --> 01:31:34,920
with an underlying
revisionist conceit

1972
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:37,513
that belied the film's
emotional attachments

1973
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,024
to the subject matter.

1974
01:31:40,093 --> 01:31:42,527
I just hope
you didn't think it sucked.

1975
01:31:42,595 --> 01:31:45,029
O.K. So thank you
for coming.

1976
01:31:45,098 --> 01:31:46,360
Good night and party on.

1977
01:31:46,432 --> 01:31:47,364
Party on, Wayne.

1978
01:31:47,433 --> 01:31:48,525
Party on, Garth.

1979
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:50,034

1981
01:31:51,437 --> 01:31:53,371
It's party time

1982
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:54,531
It's excellent

1983
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:56,040

It's excellent

1987
01:32:01,447 --> 01:32:04,041
Chicks go mental
when we go down the street

1988
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:09,715
It's Wayne and Garth
that they wanna meet

1989
01:32:13,459 --> 01:32:16,553
We're in the basement
playin' with our toys

1990
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:22,234
Oh, if you do not like it
you're a sphincter boy

1991
01:32:24,304 --> 01:32:25,566
Wayne's World

01:32:35,148 --> 01:32:37,013
It's excellent

1999
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:39,711
We might grow old,
we might get in a rut

2000
01:32:43,256 --> 01:32:46,191
Yeah, right, and monkeys
might fly out of our butts

2001
01:32:49,262 --> 01:32:52,026
The right to party is
a battle we have fought

2002
01:32:55,268 --> 01:32:58,704
So we'll surrender
and go Amish...not!

2003
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:01,531

It's excellent

2011
01:33:24,631 --> 01:33:27,566
Chicks go mental

2012
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:30,728
Chicks go mental

2013
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:33,567

Chicks go mental

2016
01:33:55,094 --> 01:33:57,028
You know,
I don't think

2017
01:33:57,096 --> 01:34:00,031
anyone's going to
tell us when to leave.

2018
01:34:00,099 --> 01:34:01,532
Yeah. Good call, Garth.

2019
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:04,536
I'll bet we're just
going to sit here,

2020
01:34:04,604 --> 01:34:06,037
and when they're finished,

2021
01:34:06,105 --> 01:34:07,538
they'll fade to black.

2022
01:34:11,611 --> 01:34:13,875
I can't believe
they did that.

2023
01:34:13,947 --> 01:34:15,859
I told ya.
