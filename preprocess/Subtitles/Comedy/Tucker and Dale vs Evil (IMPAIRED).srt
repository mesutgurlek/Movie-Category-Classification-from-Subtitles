1
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,901
(Man) Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

2
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:15,200
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

3
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:18,289
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

4
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,418
Press pass this!

5
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,799
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

6
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:27,348
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,686
- (Reporter whimpers)
- (Cameraman gasps)

8
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,398
(Cameraman screaming)

9
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:33,777
(Thud)

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,280
(Boy 1) Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
(Boy 2) Yeah, man, speed up.

11
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,537
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

12
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:02,166
- Holy shit!
- (Car horn)

13
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,461
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

14
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,006
You fucking assholes!

15
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,094
Vlfe are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

16
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,682
(Boy) Yeehaw!

17
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,562
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

18
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:18,029
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

19
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,367
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

20
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,414
- (In unison) Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,671
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

22
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,885
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

23
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,516
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

24
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:33,935
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

25
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:46,209
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,672
Hey, guys! Guys!

27
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,011
We forgot the beer!

28
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,764
(All shout) No!

29
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:34,301
(Hillbilly accent) Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

30
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,194
Can I help you?

31
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,909
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

32
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,790
Beer's in the back.

33
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:53,338
(Sniffs)

34
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,055
You see the way them kids looked?

35
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:05,737
(Customer) Read that list back to me.
(Shopkeeper) OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

36
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:09,035
hacksaw, baling hooks,

37
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:12,584
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

38
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,421
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

39
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,009
- (Shopkeeper) "crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

40
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:19,347
- lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

41
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,849
-hand drill...

42
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,146
(Gasps)

43
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:29,700
(Shopkeeper) -feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

44
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,330
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

45
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:36,798
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

46
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:47,402
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

47
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:53,203
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

48
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,379
There's nothing so special about them.

49
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,762
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

50
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,390
You know something, Dale?

51
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,895
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?

52
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:09,319
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,620
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation
home. That'll probably impress her.

54
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,335
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

55
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:20,799
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

56
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,013
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

57
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,977
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

58
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,439
more or less.

59
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,816
You got a damn good heart.

60
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,445
Yup.

61
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:34,993
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

62
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:37,038
What's the worst that could happen?

63
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,089
You know something?

64
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,139
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

65
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,560
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

66
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:53,070
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

67
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:54,656
It shows confidence.

68
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,912
Smile and laugh. OK.

69
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:59,958
- Do it.
- All right.

70
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,062
(Clanging)

71
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,660
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

72
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,164
(Laughs manically)

73
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:27,010
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

74
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,847
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

75
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,350
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

76
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,274
Get in the truck.

77
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:39,951
- (Dale) That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...
- (Girl whimpers)

78
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,120
(Engine starts)

79
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:52,976
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.

80
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,234
They hate my face!

81
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,153
Come on.

82
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,161
(J' Uptempo bluegrass)

83
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:09,050
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the Iadyfolk the way you can.

84
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,596
No one can. I mean, I...

85
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:15,770
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

86
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,528
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

87
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,115
No, I don't.

88
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,826
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

89
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:26,166
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

90
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:27,543
Mm-hm.

91
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,967
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

92
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,636
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

93
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:35,142
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

94
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:36,728
- (Siren)
- Oh, I got you.

95
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,985
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

96
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,988
All right, he's pulling over.

97
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:44,201
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

98
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:46,914
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

99
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,292
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

100
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,923
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

101
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,759
(Dale) He's out of his car?
(Tucker) He's coming.

102
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,554
- Tucker!
- Get it...

103
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,142
(Dale breathing heavily)

104
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,774
Yeah.

105
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,283
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

106
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,915
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- (Dale) Yeah.

107
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,000
Licence, please.

108
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:14,885
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

109
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:19,017
Temporary.

110
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,688
Where you two headed?

111
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,987
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

112
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,035
I sank every penny I had into it.

113
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,584
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up,
maybe do a little fishin'.

114
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,548
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

115
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,471
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

116
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:44,400
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

117
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,121
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

118
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,833
Oh, yes, sir.

119
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,671
See that you, uh...

120
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,262
get that fixed.

121
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,266
That was very helpful.

122
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,035
- Man, that was tense.
- (whispers) That dude's weird.

123
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,329
There he goes.

124
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,500
Bye!

125
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:18,257
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

126
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,264
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

127
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,560
Ah. Well...

128
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,066
(Grunts) Here's to the good life, huh?

129
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:31,449
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

130
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:50,569
(Dale) I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

131
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:53,409
(Tucker) I know, I know.
(Dale) Is that ours?

132
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,413
(Dale) Wow. And another one right there.

133
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:17,914
It's perfect!

135
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,795
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:24,678
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:27,934
- I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!
- (Laughs)

138
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,950
(Flies buzzing)

139
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,205
- N'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

140
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,251
(Both laugh)

141
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:54,234
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

142
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:57,031
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

143
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,246
Look at this.
Nlust have been a real news junkie, too.

144
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:12,311
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

145
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,609
- All right.
- Score!

146
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:19,617
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too. (Laughs)

147
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:23,375
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

148
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,965
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

149
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,218
You know something? (Sniffs)

150
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,642
Dreams really do come true.

151
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:33,936
- Look out!
- (Creaking)

152
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,361
- Whoa!
- (Tucker) Well, I guess we should fix that.

153
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,657
Yeah, that's a good idea.

154
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,206
You can get off me now.

155
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:47,796
If you have a reoccurring dream about
sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?

156
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,382
- (Both) Yes.
- Really?

157
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,592
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

158
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,099
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

159
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,394
(All) No!
(Boy 1) Chuck, no.

160
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,273
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

161
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,362
- (Boy 2) You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

162
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:04,579
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

163
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:12,969
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

164
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,437
It was 20 years ago today.

165
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:25,202
The Memorial Day Massacre.

166
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:30,670
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

167
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,425
they came out here to have a good time...

168
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:41,191
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

169
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,071
(J' Technotronic: Pump Up The Jam)

170
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,743
J' Pump it up
J' While your feet are stomping

171
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,747
J' And the jam is pumping...

172
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,835
(Whooping, cheering)

173
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,129
J' Pump it up a little more

174
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,633
J* Get the party going on the dance Hoof

175
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,138
- J' See, cos that's where the...
- (Music stops)

176
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,560
(Boy) Get another one! Come on!

177
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:02,399
(J' Country)
J' I'm gonna meet my maker

178
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:05,070
J' I ain't afraid to die

179
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:09,455
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

180
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,751
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

181
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,883
(All screaming)

182
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,799
(Shrieks)

183
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,042
Only one person lived to tell this story.

184
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,590
The rest of them just disappeared...

185
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,807
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

186
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:08,568
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

187
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,697
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

188
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:13,243
- I do. (Laughs)
- Yeah.

189
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:16,625
- All right.
- (Boy) I'm not getting naked.

190
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,379
(Insects chirping)

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,682
(Belches)

192
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,772
(Dale) Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

193
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:29,609
You take that. That's yours.

194
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:33,282
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

195
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:36,038
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,881
Do not even think about it.

197
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:43,385
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

198
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,598
- OW!
- (Tucker) Are you serious?

199
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,604
What'd I just say?

200
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:52,319
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

201
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,989
That was the last thing I said.

202
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:01,170
(Rustling)

203
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,297
Hello?

204
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,804
Is someone there?

205
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,807
Guys?

206
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,986
(Taps) Yargh!

207
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,908
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

208
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,955
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

209
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:21,459
No, it wasn't.

210
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:24,006
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

211
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,968
You totally freaked me out.

212
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,933
You know, you can drop the act now.

213
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:33,983
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

214
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,364
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

215
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:40,579
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

216
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,378
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

217
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,676
You and I, Allie...

218
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:51,391
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

219
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,523
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

220
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,367
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

221
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,211
Chad, you're drunk.

222
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,675
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.

223
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:11,764
OK, uh...

224
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,102
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

225
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,854
Why? Why stop?

226
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,570
We're perfect for each other.

227
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:24,330
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

228
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,417
Come on, Allie. Come on...

229
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,880
(Squealing, laughing)

230
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,761
(Girl) Oh, it's so cold!
(Boy) Here we go!

231
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,724
(Whooping)

232
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,602
What's that all about?

233
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,445
(Tucker) I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

234
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,657
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

235
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,579
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

236
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:49,338
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

237
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,009
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:56,183
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

239
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:58,772
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

240
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,651
- OK.
- Hush.

241
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:05,159
(Girl in distance)
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

242
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,707
(Whispers) Look.

243
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,093
Oh.

244
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,647
- Tucker!
- Shush!

245
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,816
(Gasps and screams)

246
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,277
(Both scream)

247
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,911
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

248
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,581
Me? What did I do?

249
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,879
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

250
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:37,346
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

251
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,059
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

252
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,152
(Dale) She didn't come up yet.

253
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,742
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

254
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:52,917
(Tucker) Hey! Lady?

255
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,758
(Dale shouts) Hey, lady!

256
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,681
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

257
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:06,445
(Dale, grunting)
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

258
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,740
(Tucker) Get her legs!

259
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:11,329
Oh! No!

260
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:14,334
- Hey, we got your friend!
- (Chuck) Oh, God!

261
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:17,966
- They got Allison! Come on!
- (Girls scream)

262
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,098
(Tucker) Hey!

263
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:25,021
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

264
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,904
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

265
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,535
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

266
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,999
- (Thud)
- Shit.

267
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,754
Chad! Chad!

268
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,968
(Panting) The hillbillies...

269
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,222
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

270
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:44,183
(Panting) They captured Allison!

271
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,372
Allie!

272
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:56,708
(Voice echoes)

273
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,150
(Dog whines)

274
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,666
(Gasps)

275
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,170
(Breathing heavily)

276
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,557
(Allison gasps)

277
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,024
(Hushed) Oh, God! No.

278
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:35,324
- (Sobs) No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

279
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,743
Please don't cut me open!

280
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,297
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

281
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,386
- (Breathing heavily)
- Doesn't like pancakes.

282
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:48,767
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

283
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,315
Pa... Pancakes?

284
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,574
Allison!

285
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,786
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

286
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:02,501
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

287
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,547
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

288
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:08,013
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one ofthe guys was...

289
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,974
Like...eating her face off.

290
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,022
That is so disgusting.

291
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,193
Not to sound too cliche,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

292
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,862
And just leave Allison with them?

293
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,867
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

294
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,248
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

295
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:26,380
Vvhat if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.

296
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,301
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

297
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,265
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

298
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:34,730
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

299
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:45,877
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

300
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,806
What is this place?

301
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:55,312
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

302
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:58,442
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

303
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,446
All right. Maybe I will.

304
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,290
I said maybe.

305
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:31,381
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

306
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,058
Wha-What am I doing here?

307
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,356
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

308
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:42,027
We||, me and Tucker...

309
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,365
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

310
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,118
We||...

311
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:51,963
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

312
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,885
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

313
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,849
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

314
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,354
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

315
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,858
I dove in and rescued you.

316
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:08,453
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

317
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:10,708
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

318
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,462
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

319
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:16,427
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

320
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:17,971
Where are my friends?

321
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:22,105
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

322
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,442
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

323
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,656
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis,

324
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:30,580
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

325
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,418
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

326
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:38,427
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

327
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,348
It's OK, I...

328
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,811
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

329
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:45,232
- Me neither.
- (Laughs) Yeah.

330
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:47,487
- (Laughs)
- (Growls)

331
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:51,913
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

332
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,083
You can just pet him round the nose.

333
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,253
- He's drooling.
- I know.

334
00:21:57,214 --> 00:22:01,304
Anymfay, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

335
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,436
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

336
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:09,028
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

337
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:13,746
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

338
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,459
But, uh...anyv\/ay...

339
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,384
you should relax and rest, OK?

340
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,930
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

341
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,642
Uh...

342
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,565
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

343
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:31,029
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

344
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:33,241
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

345
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:37,292
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

346
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:40,505
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

347
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,509
I'll be right in the little room here.

348
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:46,852
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:50,066
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

350
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,694
Do you like board games?

351
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,743
What kind do you have?

352
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,252
We got this one right here.
|t's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

353
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,136
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

354
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:06,973
No way, dude. You lost.

355
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,815
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

356
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:18,871
(Birdsong)

357
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:26,094
Goddamn Romeo.

358
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,184
(Sighs) Oh, well.

359
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,784
(Chainsaw starts, falters)

360
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,463
(Chainsaw starts)

361
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:46,175
(Caws)

362
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,802
Oh, Jesus.

363
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,346
(Chainsaw buzzing)

364
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,587
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

365
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,883
Run! Run for your lives!

366
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:10,262
Yargh! (Howls)

367
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:13,184
(Girls screaming)

368
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:19,614
- (Screaming)
- (Bees buzzing)

369
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,494
(Panting)

370
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:23,996
(Screaming)

371
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,068
(Screams)

372
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:42,074
(Shrieks)

373
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,161
(Groans)

374
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,500
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

375
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,130
(Hushed) One, two, three, four, five.

376
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,884
OK, shoot.

377
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,682
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

378
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,560
Oh, that's too easy. That's James Monroe.

379
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,237
God, you are right again. You are killing me.

380
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,491
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

381
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,497
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

382
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,213
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

383
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:36,638
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,766
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

385
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:42,567
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

386
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,951
Yeah? (Clears throat)

387
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,713
So, um, what is it that you study in college?

388
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,967
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

389
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,388
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

390
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:02,980
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

391
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,067
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

392
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,490
I-I have these stupid dreams.

393
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:10,119
Dreams are not stupid.

394
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:17,800
\N'ell, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

395
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,138
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

396
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,265
- Yeah.
- And I just...

397
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:24,688
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

398
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,234
No, don't! Don't!

399
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:30,325
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

400
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,666
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

401
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:37,548
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

402
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:39,092
Hey, hey.

403
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,721
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

404
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:44,059
I sawed into a bees' nest.

405
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,438
(Laughs) Why?

406
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,195
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

407
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,242
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

408
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,458
Yeah.

409
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:00,174
(Whimpers)
We came out here to work...

410
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:02,637
not sit around playing stupid board games!

411
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,601
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

412
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:08,189
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

413
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:11,906
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

414
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,825
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

415
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,206
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

416
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:20,129
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

417
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,052
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

418
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,262
Hi.

419
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,016
I saw your friend out there.

420
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:32,987
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

421
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:36,870
- I should go out there and find them...
- (Dale) No, no! That's... No!

422
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:40,585
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

423
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,884
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

424
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:47,306
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

425
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:48,851
Ain't that right, Tucker?

426
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,065
- (Sighs) Yeah.
- Yeah.

427
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:55,197
- (Tucker) Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

428
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,539
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

429
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,835
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

430
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:04,339
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anymfay.

431
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:07,470
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

432
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:13,524
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

433
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,747
(J' Eerie music)

434
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:24,462
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

435
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:29,722
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- (Sobs) I can't believe this is happening.

436
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:34,147
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

437
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,820
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

438
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:41,536
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

439
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:44,918
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

440
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,881
Survival of the fittest!

441
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:52,182
- (Chad laughs)
- What are you doing, man?

442
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:53,559
That's my whole face.

443
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:56,022
You have serious issues, you know that?

444
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:59,821
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

445
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,454
(Dale) And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?

446
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,499
(Tucker) Is it a triangle?
(Dale) Yeah.

447
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,670
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

448
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,219
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

449
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:12,973
- (Sighs) Dale.
- Yeah?

450
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,811
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

451
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,480
I know. You keep telling me that.

452
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:21,990
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish
her off real quick then we'll get back to work.

453
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:24,119
(Hushed) They're gonna kill her!

454
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:29,378
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

455
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,301
College kids!

456
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:38,271
- (Shouts) College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

457
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:41,861
- (Sighs) College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

458
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:45,160
- (Gasping)
- College kids!

459
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,746
(Dale) I don't see 'em.

460
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,709
(Tucker) They must have run off.

461
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:55,221
Well, hmm... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

462
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,515
All right. With what?

463
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,606
- N'ell, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

464
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:05,281
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

465
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,452
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

466
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,781
(\lVood chipper humming)

467
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,290
(Dale sings)

468
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,421
J' Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot

469
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,717
J' You think that girl is hot...

470
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,139
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

471
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,397
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

472
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,150
Whoa.

473
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,571
- What?
- Huh? What?

474
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:50,243
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

475
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,456
They should be by here any minute.

476
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,467
- What are you doing?
- Oh, l'm digging a shitter hole.

477
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:00,638
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

478
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,393
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

479
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,107
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

480
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:09,489
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

481
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:13,122
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

482
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,874
Oh.

483
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,047
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

484
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,466
That's a good rule.

485
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:22,054
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

486
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,141
Yeah.

487
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,614
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

488
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,205
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

489
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,749
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,549
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

491
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,616
(Boy) That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

492
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:55,327
We don't have much time.

493
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,918
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

494
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,966
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

495
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,146
I'm gonna just chill right here.

496
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,241
(Dale) OK, one more load and we're done.

497
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:19,667
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

498
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,674
Now!

499
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:25,886
Huh?

500
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,852
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

501
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,021
(Screaming)

502
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,440
Dale!

503
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,907
(Shrieks)

504
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:41,208
- (Screams) Oh, God!
- (Groans)

505
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,286
(Screaming)

506
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,969
(Screams)

507
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:14,689
(Chipper engine dies)

508
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:17,027
(Panting)

509
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,784
(Whimpers) Are you OK?

510
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,296
(Panting) Allison, say something!

511
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,680
- (Shouts) Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

512
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,892
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

513
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,400
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

514
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:42,952
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

515
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:45,456
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

516
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,964
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

517
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,717
What the hell happened to her?

518
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:53,848
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

519
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:55,726
Is that your blood?
What? No.

520
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,108
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

521
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,529
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

522
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,491
- Holy crap.
- I know!

523
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:04,785
Calm down. Don't cry.

524
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:05,871
- Calm down!
- OK.

525
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:08,293
- Get a hold of yourself!
- (Breathes deeply)

526
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:14,095
All right...
I know what this is.

527
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,142
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

528
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,230
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

529
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:23,112
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

530
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,785
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all ofthe sharp objects!

531
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,831
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

532
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:30,836
Yeah. Think about it.

533
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,802
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

534
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:39,435
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

535
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,776
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

536
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:44,696
Yeah, that's a good point.

537
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:47,284
OK, so what... what do we...

538
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,706
We go to the police?

539
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,501
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

540
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:55,341
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

541
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,637
(Laughs) That's a good idea, Dale.

542
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:01,937
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

543
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:05,319
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

544
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,699
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

545
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,493
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

546
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,708
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

547
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,967
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

548
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:21,141
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

549
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:22,978
(Sighs) So what the hell do we do?

550
00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:26,276
We gotta clean this mess up.

551
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,574
- Right now.
- OK.

552
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,586
- (Sobs)
- You shou|dn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

553
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:36,671
It's not good for you.

554
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:38,717
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

555
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:41,639
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

556
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,312
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

557
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,150
How are we gonna get outta here?

558
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,655
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

559
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:51,157
\N'ell, then let's walk.

560
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,412
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

561
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:56,334
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- W'll y'all just shut up?

562
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,714
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

563
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,511
We never shou|d've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

564
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:02,596
Chad!

565
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:09,652
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies,
you know that?

566
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:13,617
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

567
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,872
and everyone just freaks out.

568
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:19,337
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

569
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:23,386
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

570
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:27,436
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

571
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:31,779
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

572
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,328
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

573
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,876
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

574
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:44,260
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

575
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:47,517
maybe you deserve to die.

576
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:49,520
(Gasps)

577
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,652
That's fucked up.

578
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:57,536
- (Siren in distance)
- Shh. Y'all hear that?

579
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,291
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

580
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,921
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

581
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,218
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

582
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,269
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

583
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,398
Fuck.

584
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,998
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

585
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,544
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

586
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,299
- Oh, God! Look out!
- (Tyres screech)

587
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,552
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

588
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:28,847
They're dead!

589
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:30,308
They died!

590
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,144
(Sheriff) Slow down, now.

591
00:37:32,227 --> 00:37:34,440
- They killed them!
- OK.

592
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:40,368
Stay calm. \N'ell, why don't you kids climb in
the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

593
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,171
Those stupid fucks.

594
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,606
(Coughs, splutters) I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

595
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,905
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

596
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:03,914
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

597
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:07,712
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

598
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:08,923
- OK.
- All right?

599
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:13,057
- (Squelching)
- One. Two. Three!

600
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,476
Argh!

601
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,483
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

602
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,740
Get it off me. Not on the face!

603
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

604
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,877
- (Whimpers)
- You're OK, you're OK.

605
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:30,716
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

606
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:31,969
Get him over to the truck.

607
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,728
Oh, God. Oh, God.

608
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,982
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

609
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,826
(Siren burst)

610
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,457
Oh, shit.

611
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,596
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

612
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,353
You kids stay put.

613
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,360
I'll handle this.

614
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,327
(Dale) Hey.
(Tucker) Hello, Officer.

615
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,372
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

616
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:14,091
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

617
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,640
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

618
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:19,936
- minding our own business...
- Yup.

619
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:22,984
- making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

620
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,237
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

621
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:30,081
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

622
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:33,628
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

623
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:34,965
the woody right back there.

624
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:40,100
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

625
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:41,352
(Dale) Straight through.

626
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:44,274
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

627
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,780
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

628
00:39:55,921 --> 00:40:00,765
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

629
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:02,435
- No...
-Oh, no.

630
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:05,816
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

631
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:10,241
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

632
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,667
- What?
- You say you were just working,

633
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:20,886
when this...kid...ran up
and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?

634
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,975
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

635
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:28,860
And I think maybe they might be
trying to kill the girl that we have inside.

636
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:30,363
- What girl?
- You know what?

637
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,829
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

638
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,793
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

639
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,297
- (Laughs) That's...
- On accident.

640
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,425
On accident.

641
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:44,766
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

642
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:47,897
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- (Laughs) That's...

643
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:50,444
(Laughs manically)

644
00:40:52,322 --> 00:40:54,035
You better show me what you done with her.

645
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,249
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

646
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,879
(Tucker) Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

647
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,425
Wait, where is he going?

648
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:06,183
- No, don't go in there.
- (Tucker) Right this way, Sheriff.

649
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:12,319
- (Whimpers)
- (Chloe) What's he doing?

650
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:14,908
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

651
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:25,094
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

652
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,937
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

653
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:34,362
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

654
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,785
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

655
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,915
but you'd be lucky to get that.

656
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,172
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

657
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,225
We||, it's...
it's hard to say.

658
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,980
Looks can be deceiving.

659
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,399
- (Both) Oh, don't!
- (Wood creaks)

660
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,526
(Screams)

661
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:58,993
Sheriff! You OK?

662
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:01,540
(Screams)

663
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,042
- Oh, shit!
- (Screams)

664
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,756
(Tucker) Come on!
(Dale) What is going on?

665
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:09,095
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

666
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:10,682
(Tucker) He's gonna be fine.

667
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:11,977
- (Moaning)
- (Screaming)

668
00:42:16,652 --> 00:42:18,363
(Sheriff) Don't worry, I got it.

669
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,915
- (Radio crackles)
- It's Sher... Sher...

670
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,630
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

671
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:28,634
- Unlock the door!
- (All scream)

672
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:33,560
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

673
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:37,442
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

674
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:40,990
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

675
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:43,286
- (Arguing continues)
- (Kids screaming)

676
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:50,676
Unlock the fucking door!

677
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:54,558
(Tucker) If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

678
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:57,565
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

679
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:58,733
Heads up.

680
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,946
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

681
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,538
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

682
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,379
Don't do...

683
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,884
- (All scream)
- Jesus! Oh, God!

684
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,974
You've got to start being more careful!

685
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:21,027
(Gunfire continues)

686
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:24,700
(Dale) I don't think he understands!

687
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,288
(Dane) om

688
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,293
"You gotta take the safety off"?

689
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:34,886
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

690
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:36,348
- What?
- That's right!

691
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,813
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

692
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:44,572
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

693
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:47,702
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-Iujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

694
00:43:47,744 --> 00:43:51,085
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

695
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,671
We||, you know what, Tucker?

696
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:56,762
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

697
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,559
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

698
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,104
You don't like...

699
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:06,781
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

700
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:08,994
I like... I like it OK.

701
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:11,331
You know... I'm sorry.

702
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:15,214
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

703
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:18,971
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- (Gunfire)

704
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,435
- Cut it out!
- (Gunfire stops)

705
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:22,519
(Dog barking)

706
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:26,236
Tucker...

707
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,949
where's Jangers?

708
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:33,959
- Shit.
- Stay here.

709
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:36,130
Aah! Damn.

710
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,093
(Whimpers) Nuts...

711
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,310
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.
- (Jangers whines)

712
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,980
Oh, son of a bitch!

713
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:47,485
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

714
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:49,739
(Sniffs) We gotta do something.

715
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:53,371
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

716
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,129
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

717
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,185
(Grunts) Oh.

718
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:07,023
(Panting) All right.

719
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:10,196
- Cover me.
- Uh...

720
00:45:10,238 --> 00:45:12,366
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

721
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:17,334
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

722
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:19,088
- (Whoosh, thud)
- Whoa!

723
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:23,388
- (Hushed) Whoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

724
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,516
Now, you create a distraction.

725
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,898
I'm gonna go out the back door.

726
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,278
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

727
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,488
Try not to shoot me.

728
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:35,494
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

729
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:39,335
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

730
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:44,470
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

731
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:53,529
(Gunshots)

732
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:09,309
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

733
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:13,109
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks! (Fires nail gun)

734
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,246
- (Clicking)
- Shit!

735
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:20,915
(Screams)

736
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:31,185
Jesus, Dale. (Pants)
Take it easy.

737
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:32,313
Hey, hillbilly!

738
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:37,072
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

739
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:41,873
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

740
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:43,208
Then bring out the girl!

741
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:50,139
- (Chad) I'm gonna shoot your dog!
- (Jangers whines)

742
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,725
(Dale) I'm gonna get really mad!

743
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,311
(Sobs) I'll get really mad!

744
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,530
(Hushed) Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

745
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,996
(Chuckles nervously)

746
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,125
(Tucker) Oh!

747
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,506
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

748
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,441
(Whimpering)

749
00:47:23,328 --> 00:47:24,747
(Panting)

750
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:51,674
(Squeals)

751
00:47:58,103 --> 00:47:59,773
(Breathing heavily)

752
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,087
Oh, God. Please, no.

753
00:48:14,343 --> 00:48:16,305
(Creaking)

754
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,064
(Girl) Are we done yet?

755
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:24,530
(Chad) I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

756
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,118
All right...trap's set.

757
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:28,788
(Tucker moans)

758
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,668
- Hey...he's awake.
- (Tucker coughs)

759
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:37,680
(Strained)
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

760
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:40,309
What is the matter with us?

761
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,520
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

762
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:43,566
Wait. Stop...

763
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,161
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.

764
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:51,999
(Sniffing)

765
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:59,054
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

766
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:00,682
OK! Don't...

767
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:05,483
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

768
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:08,323
It's payback time, hillbilly.

769
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:13,832
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

770
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:15,753
I can get my cooler.

771
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,385
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

772
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:23,059
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

773
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:26,315
- (Whispers) This is for |\/like!
- No!

774
00:49:26,357 --> 00:49:28,277
- (Tucker screams)
- (Girls scream)

775
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:32,869
(Tucker cries) OW! You prick.

776
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:37,754
(Moans)

777
00:49:40,092 --> 00:49:41,554
- Dale?
- Allison.

778
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,225
How are you feelin'?

779
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,650
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

780
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:51,864
Wha...

781
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,370
What happ...

782
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:56,206
- What happened?
- Oh...

783
00:49:58,127 --> 00:49:59,296
Well, uh...

784
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:03,011
(Voice breaking) I can't...
I can't really say.

785
00:50:03,052 --> 00:50:04,139
Um...

786
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,812
It was so awful.

787
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:12,279
(Sobs) Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

788
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:15,076
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

789
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:17,414
It's good to cry sometimes.

790
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,501
It's OK, just...

791
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:21,254
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

792
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:23,091
(Sobbing)

793
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,225
There you go. It'll feel better.

794
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:32,693
Come on, just take a deep breath.

795
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:37,453
(Exhales deeply)

796
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,791
There we go. Now...

797
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:41,085
(Dale sighs)

798
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:42,587
Now tell me what happened.

799
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:47,264
Well...it's hard to say.

800
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,516
Um...

801
00:50:50,562 --> 00:50:51,814
Your friends...

802
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,654
Do some of your friends take medication?

803
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:59,245
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

804
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,170
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

805
00:51:04,254 --> 00:51:08,220
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

806
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:10,809
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

807
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,397
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

808
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:16,695
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

809
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:21,078
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

810
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,712
and then Todd was running at us, and...

811
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:29,803
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

812
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,142
At first I thought they were trying to kill you,

813
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:37,401
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

814
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:39,656
and now they're going after my dog...

815
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,200
(Sobs) ..Jangers.

816
00:51:41,283 --> 00:51:43,413
(Snorts) I guess they just like killing.

817
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:46,878
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

818
00:51:46,962 --> 00:51:48,674
- (Banging)
- Jesus, they're here!

819
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:51,929
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!

820
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:54,560
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

821
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:57,107
- (Chad) Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

822
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,569
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

823
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:02,741
- What? No, no.
-It's all just a big misunderstanding.

824
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:04,705
We'll clear it right up, OK?

825
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,794
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

826
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:13,387
Oh, my God.

827
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,517
- (Flies buzzing)
- (Crows cawing)

828
00:52:16,978 --> 00:52:18,356
(Gasps)

829
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,155
- Ugh!
- (Hushed) Allison!

830
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:23,741
(Breathes rapidly)

831
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,631
Oh!

832
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:44,531
Did you see them?

833
00:52:46,618 --> 00:52:48,956
- No.
- No?

834
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,926
That's from Tucker's shirt.

835
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:59,102
(Dale) What is that?

836
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,562
(Allison) Oh, my God!

837
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:03,359
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

838
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:05,029
(Gasps)

839
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,450
There's a note right there.

840
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:23,523
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

841
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:28,700
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

842
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,829
A few hours.

843
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:32,583
I don't understand what...

844
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,127
I gotta go help Tucker.

845
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,589
God damn it.

846
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:39,262
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

847
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:43,479
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

848
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,192
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

849
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,237
Oh, and why would they think that?

850
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,621
(Quietly) I... I don't know.

851
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,793
I think you do know.

852
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:59,384
We||, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

853
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,934
we just thought that you looked...

854
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,897
a little creepy.

855
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:09,112
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

856
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:11,115
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

857
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:13,369
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

858
00:54:14,204 --> 00:54:16,209
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

859
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,841
I'm really sorry.

860
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,677
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

861
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,561
(Sighs) I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

862
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,232
somebody'd end up dead.

863
00:54:29,192 --> 00:54:31,530
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

864
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:34,076
If you do see your friends...

865
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:36,956
tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.

866
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:40,672
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

867
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:41,924
Don't go there.

868
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:47,477
Oh, shit.

869
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,938
Tucker!

870
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:53,655
- Tucker, you cut there?
- (Voice echoes)

871
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:02,005
Tuck!

872
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,629
(Screams)

873
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:25,384
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

874
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:31,478
Tucker!

875
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,151
- (Tucker, faint) Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

876
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:37,031
Tucker?!

877
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,034
Yeah.

878
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:40,705
Tuck! Tucker!

879
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,045
- (Choked) Dale...
- Hey!

880
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:46,508
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

881
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:49,096
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

882
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,515
What?

883
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,978
(Dale) Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

884
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,480
I don't wanna die! Please!

885
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,406
(Whimpers) Oh, God! Tucker!

886
00:55:58,448 --> 00:55:59,867
Dale...

887
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,411
(Breathing heavily)

888
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:05,879
Oh. Oh... Oh...

889
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:08,091
I never thought I'd say this,

890
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,928
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

891
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:13,142
- (Laughs, wheezes)
- (Laughing) That's funny.

892
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:15,063
Whoa...

893
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:18,487
-Oh...
- Dale...

894
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:22,118
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

895
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:24,498
I know. Let's get you down from there.

896
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,626
- Wait!
- (\lVires Swish)

897
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:28,047
Sorry about that.

898
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,800
(Tucker) This vacation sucks.

899
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,014
(Chad, hushed) Come on, let's go.

900
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:37,856
(Owl hoots)

901
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:53,971
(Naomi, hushed) Look at this place.

902
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:59,440
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

903
00:57:01,904 --> 00:57:03,156
(Hushed) Allison!

904
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:04,742
- Allison!
- Chad?

905
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:07,623
- Chad?
- Shh!

906
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:08,875
What are you guys doing?

907
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,795
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

908
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:14,052
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

909
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:16,598
(Both) oh.

910
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,816
This place is really freaky.

911
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,530
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

912
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:26,743
They haven't done anything to me.

913
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:29,039
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

914
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:33,129
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

915
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:35,593
What? No, no. Chad...

916
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,681
Chad! Stop.

917
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,520
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

918
00:57:42,064 --> 00:57:45,655
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

919
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,574
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

920
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:52,208
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

921
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,254
You have no idea...

922
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:57,636
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

923
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,473
- Huh?
- No.

924
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:03,981
These freaks are evil...

925
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,823
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

926
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:10,035
OK, just relax, all right?

927
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:13,541
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

928
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,547
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

929
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:19,846
- while you guys have been terrorising them.
- But they started this!

930
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:22,976
By doing what? Saving my life?

931
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:27,902
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

932
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,615
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

933
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:32,578
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

934
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:36,961
You're falling in love with him?

935
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,341
No. W-What?

936
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,224
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

937
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:48,024
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

938
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,281
How could you love him?

939
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:55,288
Chad, please. You don't understand.

940
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,169
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

941
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,006
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

942
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,557
Hey! Let the girl go.

943
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:06,060
(Chad) Tcha!

944
00:59:07,396 --> 00:59:11,236
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

945
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:15,453
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and |et's talk this out, OK?

946
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:17,874
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

947
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:20,086
(Chuckles) You could have fooled me.

948
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:22,674
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

949
00:59:22,717 --> 00:59:25,681
Wait! How about I make some tea,

950
00:59:25,723 --> 00:59:28,603
and we all sit and talk this out?

951
00:59:28,644 --> 00:59:33,195
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

952
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,951
I'm gonna go get a beer.

953
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:39,708
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

954
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,962
In this chair.

955
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,632
(Allison) Dale, you...

956
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:46,388
you sit in this one.

957
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:56,408
OK, good. Now, um...

958
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:58,829
I'm gonna get the tea.

959
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,591
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

960
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:07,261
(Allison) it's Earl Grey.

961
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,433
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

962
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:16,529
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

963
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:23,083
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

964
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,210
OK?

965
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:27,884
OK.

966
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,431
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

967
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:34,397
and understand each other's perspective
before any progress can be made.

968
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:38,446
OK.

969
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:40,367
Chad, why don't you start?

970
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:45,794
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

971
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,591
A long time ago,

972
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:51,890
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

973
01:00:51,932 --> 01:00:53,643
This is important.

974
01:00:56,606 --> 01:01:00,489
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

975
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:05,207
It was 20 years ago.

976
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,043
The Memorial Day Massacre.

977
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:12,512
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

978
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:16,145
- (Screams)
- My mother ran for her life.

979
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:17,647
But they captured hen

980
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,626
My father was helpless...

981
01:01:28,668 --> 01:01:32,342
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

982
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:36,642
And they forced him to watch...

983
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,940
while they tortured hen

984
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:41,903
(Sizzling)

985
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,076
But my mom, she fought back...

986
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:47,121
(Muffled scream)

987
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,167
- ..and she escaped.
- (Howls)

988
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:52,673
But my father wasn't so lucky.

989
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:59,896
His body was never found.

990
01:02:07,243 --> 01:02:09,456
By the time I was born...

991
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:12,294
my mother was already institutionalised.

992
01:02:13,255 --> 01:02:16,594
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

993
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:25,821
OK. Um...

994
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:30,162
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

995
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,299
(Panting)

996
01:02:37,802 --> 01:02:39,054
(Squeals)

997
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,321
- (Hushed) No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

998
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:50,994
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

999
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:52,831
we come in, guns blazing.

1000
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:57,715
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

1001
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:13,119
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

1002
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:15,583
No!

1003
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,919
No way.

1004
01:03:16,962 --> 01:03:19,131
They're fucking trapped.

1005
01:03:19,173 --> 01:03:21,594
Oh...yeah.

1006
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:24,642
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

1007
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,193
It's your turn.

1008
01:03:30,404 --> 01:03:32,825
(Clears throat) OK, well...

1009
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:35,454
First of all...

1010
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:41,091
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

1011
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:43,429
That is awful.

1012
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:47,938
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

1013
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:51,945
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

1014
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,285
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

1015
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:59,919
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

1016
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,300
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

1017
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,220
(Dale) I just can't do it!

1018
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:09,438
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

1019
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,859
how do you feel?

1020
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:14,697
I feel better. I feel...
(Breathes deeply)

1021
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:16,910
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

1022
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:21,461
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

1023
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,089
(Door slams open)

1024
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,510
It's show time, freaks! (Screams)

1025
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:28,391
- (Allison) Jason! No!
- (Screams)

1026
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:31,855
Jesus Christ!

1027
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,243
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

1028
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:40,956
Chad, st... (Gasps)

1029
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:42,961
- Get him, Tucker!
- (Grunts)

1030
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,966
Dale!

1031
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,683
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

1032
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:53,188
- Oh, shit!
- (Dale) Whoa!

1033
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,484
- (Screaming)
- Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

1034
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:57,113
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

1035
01:04:57,155 --> 01:04:58,949
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

1036
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:01,663
Aargh!

1037
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,794
Aargh!

1038
01:05:04,878 --> 01:05:06,130
Stop, drop, and roll!

1039
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,553
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

1040
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:18,028
(Tucker) He's crackling like a log!

1041
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,364
Oh, that stinks.

1042
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:24,415
- Oh, shit!
- (Dale) I knew I shoulda moved that.

1043
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:26,796
(Breathing rapidly)

1044
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,969
(Dale) Allie, run!
(Tucker) Run!

1045
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,055
Come on, let's go!

1046
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:35,269
- (Grunts)
- Help me!

1047
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,358
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

1048
01:05:39,194 --> 01:05:40,613
(Screaming)

1049
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:42,951
- (Allison whimpers)
- (Tucker and Dale groan)

1050
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:49,172
My cabin.

1051
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:51,677
Your cabin.

1052
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,265
I'm a terrible therapist.

1053
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:57,437
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

1054
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:59,860
I thought you did a great job in there.

1055
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:02,029
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1056
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:06,079
(Dale) I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

1057
01:06:07,498 --> 01:06:09,209
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

1058
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:11,423
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

1059
01:06:12,383 --> 01:06:15,306
- (Grunts)
- (Blade scrapes)

1060
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,642
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

1061
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,480
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

1062
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:22,779
(Roars)

1063
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,824
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

1064
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:26,744
(Tucker) Get to the truck!

1065
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:29,081
(Dale) Tucker! Tucker!

1066
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:30,751
(Grunting)

1067
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:32,547
(Tucker) He's coming!

1068
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:37,139
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

1069
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,769
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

1070
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:41,773
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

1071
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:43,945
This is the only thing I got left.

1072
01:06:43,986 --> 01:06:45,197
(Engine starts)

1073
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:46,741
Go.

1074
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:55,216
(Laughs) Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

1075
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:56,802
- (Allison) Dale, look out!
- Huh?

1076
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:14,210
Jangers, not now, boy.

1077
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:17,259
(Chuckles) Jangers, hey!

1078
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:20,849
Whoa. Jangers!

1079
01:07:22,393 --> 01:07:23,562
Allie.

1080
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,983
Allison!

1081
01:07:27,236 --> 01:07:29,157
Jangers... Allison!

1082
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:31,368
She's gone.

1083
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:34,082
(Groans) What the hell... Tucker?

1084
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:40,637
(Pants) Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

1085
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,809
- He took her.
- (Sighs)

1086
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,730
I tried to stop him.

1087
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:49,279
- (Coughs)
- Whoa, take it easy.

1088
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:50,615
I tell you something, Dale.

1089
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:53,245
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

1090
01:07:53,328 --> 01:07:57,210
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

1091
01:07:58,629 --> 01:08:00,050
- Look at you.
- Nah.

1092
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:03,849
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

1093
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,019
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

1094
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:08,231
- That's not true.
- It is true!

1095
01:08:08,274 --> 01:08:11,029
I never should have even
came out here with you.

1096
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:13,242
Listen to me. (Whimpers)

1097
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,955
(Moans)

1098
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:18,209
Do you remember when we was kids...

1099
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:21,675
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

1100
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:23,720
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

1101
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:29,147
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

1102
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,528
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

1103
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:37,330
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

1104
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,293
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

1105
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:42,464
That always made me feel kinda funny.

1106
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,844
Yeah. We||, the thing is...

1107
01:08:46,263 --> 01:08:48,184
I didn't let you catch more.

1108
01:08:49,144 --> 01:08:51,565
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1109
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:53,653
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1110
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:59,038
What l'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1111
01:09:00,165 --> 01:09:02,544
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1112
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:07,263
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1113
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,479
You know, I think that she...

1114
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:14,484
really sees you for who you are.

1115
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,367
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1116
01:09:19,577 --> 01:09:20,872
you two can...

1117
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:24,086
(Grunts) date or something.

1118
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:28,220
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1119
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:30,056
I don't want any more negativity.

1120
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,937
- OK.
- Stop it!

1121
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:35,358
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1122
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,654
You're smart...

1123
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,201
and you're strong...

1124
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:43,583
and you're not as ugly as you think you are.

1125
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:47,798
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1126
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,555
- (Sighs) Life is short.
- I know.

1127
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:55,731
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1128
01:09:55,814 --> 01:09:58,569
She needs you now more than ever,

1129
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:03,037
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1130
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:07,002
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

1131
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:13,516
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1132
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:16,229
I'll be fine. Go.

1133
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,941
(Breathes deeply)

1134
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,704
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1135
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,335
- (Crunching)
- Oh, Jesus!

1136
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,047
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1137
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:31,717
OK.

1138
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:35,934
(Strained) That hurt very much!

1139
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:38,272
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1140
01:10:38,313 --> 01:10:39,774
Out through your mouth.

1141
01:10:39,816 --> 01:10:41,737
Go get her. Go get her.

1142
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,244
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

1143
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:48,374
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1144
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:52,006
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1145
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:53,551
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1146
01:10:55,304 --> 01:10:57,016
(Barking)

1147
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:16,720
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1148
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:20,436
OK. (Pants)
You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?

1149
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:23,609
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1150
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,655
More or less. OK, stay.

1151
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:32,292
What is the matter with you?

1152
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,755
(Laughing) What is the matter with me?

1153
01:11:34,797 --> 01:11:39,264
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1154
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:40,350
No.

1155
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,313
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1156
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,653
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1157
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:48,741
but you're gonna have to beg.

1158
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:50,829
Chad...

1159
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:53,959
(Whimpers)

1160
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,336
Oh!

1161
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:59,094
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1162
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,808
(Chuckles)
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1163
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,896
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1164
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:05,523
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1165
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:07,151
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1166
01:12:07,193 --> 01:12:08,529
Just stop, please!

1167
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:11,075
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1168
01:12:11,117 --> 01:12:13,163
I've only just begun.

1169
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:15,292
(Whimpers)

1170
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:18,298
(Banging)

1171
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:40,675
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1172
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:04,721
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1173
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:06,182
- (whispers) It's OK.
- Dale?

1174
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:07,936
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1175
01:13:07,978 --> 01:13:11,317
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1176
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:14,198
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1177
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:18,665
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1178
01:13:18,749 --> 01:13:20,460
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1179
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:22,923
Hang on.

1180
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:28,725
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1181
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:32,024
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anymfay, so...

1182
01:13:36,616 --> 01:13:38,244
(Microphone whistles)

1183
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:41,417
(Chad over PA) How sweet.

1184
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:46,301
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1185
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:47,679
What kind of knot is this?

1186
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,475
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1187
01:13:51,436 --> 01:13:54,191
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.

1188
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:56,404
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1189
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:57,866
(Microphone whistles)

1190
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,126
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1191
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,795
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1192
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:06,841
(Allison whimpers)

1193
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,055
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1194
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:13,060
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1195
01:14:13,102 --> 01:14:15,149
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1196
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:17,820
(Chainsaw buzzes)

1197
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:26,880
Oh, that is really too bad.

1198
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:31,472
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1199
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:32,891
(Allison screams)

1200
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,692
- Dale!
- (Roars)

1201
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,783
- (Crunch)
- (Screams)

1202
01:14:57,188 --> 01:14:59,526
- Dale!
- (Groaning)

1203
01:15:04,911 --> 01:15:06,330
Dale!

1204
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:20,567
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1205
01:15:21,777 --> 01:15:23,238
Bring it, frat bitch.

1206
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:50,374
- (Allison) Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1207
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:55,635
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1208
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,932
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1209
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:03,066
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1210
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,779
Put a couple boxes on there.

1211
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:09,411
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1212
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:11,498
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1213
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,089
- OK. OK. (Pants)
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1214
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:18,094
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1215
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:21,559
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1216
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,021
Nah! Shit...

1217
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:26,319
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1218
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,404
Or not.

1219
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,089
Oh, my God. Dale?

1220
01:16:37,131 --> 01:16:39,302
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1221
01:16:39,385 --> 01:16:41,264
(Breathing heavily)

1222
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:43,560
Look.

1223
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:45,689
- What?
- Something look familiar?

1224
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:49,489
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1225
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,828
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1226
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:56,042
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1227
01:16:56,084 --> 01:16:57,879
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1228
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:02,639
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1229
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,396
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1230
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:09,151
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1231
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,370
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1232
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,582
His father's body was never found.

1233
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:20,090
(Allison) I think we've just found him.

1234
01:17:20,173 --> 01:17:22,301
(Dale) Holy S-H-I-T.

1235
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:24,389
- (Chainsaw buzzes)
- (Dale) Jesus Christ!

1236
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,017
Chad!

1237
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,316
- Time to die, freak!
- (Dale) Wait!

1238
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:31,695
Just wait! Wait, wait!

1239
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:33,449
Wait, Chad! Wait!

1240
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:35,828
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1241
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,497
- No! Look!
- (Chainsaw idles)

1242
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:39,585
That's your real father.
Right there!

1243
01:17:40,795 --> 01:17:42,507
No. No!

1244
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:44,595
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1245
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,895
It can't be.

1246
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:54,072
They lied to me!

1247
01:17:55,574 --> 01:17:57,620
How could they?

1248
01:17:57,661 --> 01:17:59,582
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

1249
01:17:59,665 --> 01:18:01,460
There is no truth!

1250
01:18:02,128 --> 01:18:04,759
(Growls) Everything is a lie!

1251
01:18:08,557 --> 01:18:10,978
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1252
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,316
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

1253
01:18:13,358 --> 01:18:17,826
that causes an anaphylactic reaction
in rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1254
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:19,788
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1255
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:22,835
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1256
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:24,296
(Screams)

1257
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:31,727
Or not. (Sighs)

1258
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:41,580
(Indistinct chatter)

1259
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,293
(Cameraman) OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

1260
01:18:44,334 --> 01:18:47,591
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1261
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:50,180
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1262
01:18:53,686 --> 01:18:57,903
(Sighs) The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1263
01:18:57,944 --> 01:18:59,656
is still being unravelled.

1264
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:02,412
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1265
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:05,919
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1266
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:11,095
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1267
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:14,977
- The killings happened on the ....
- (Dale) Knock knock. Hey!

1268
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:19,903
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1269
01:19:20,613 --> 01:19:22,367
high on prescription medication.

1270
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,621
- Yeah, looks like it.
- (Chuckles)

1271
01:19:25,331 --> 01:19:27,167
They found my fingers.

1272
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:29,547
Check it out.

1273
01:19:29,588 --> 01:19:31,634
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1274
01:19:32,971 --> 01:19:35,183
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1275
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:37,437
Does that look funny to you?

1276
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:38,857
No. No, not really.

1277
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,824
That looks natural. It's good.

1278
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,785
By the way, I brought you something.

1279
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,914
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1280
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:48,542
OK, open them.

1281
01:19:49,544 --> 01:19:51,214
Oh...

1282
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,468
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1283
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,600
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1284
01:19:56,683 --> 01:19:58,312
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1285
01:19:58,353 --> 01:19:59,731
Look what else I got you.

1286
01:19:59,814 --> 01:20:02,569
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

1287
01:20:02,652 --> 01:20:04,656
- - There you go.

1288
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:07,037
Mmm. Mm!

1289
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:10,251
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1290
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:13,173
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

1291
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:14,550
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1292
01:20:15,302 --> 01:20:16,764
Did you ask her?

1293
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:22,233
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1294
01:20:22,274 --> 01:20:25,029
Oh.We||...

1295
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,490
(Sighs)

1296
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:30,122
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1297
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:31,208
Dale!

1298
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,381
(Sighs) You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1299
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:38,640
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1300
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:40,851
Except for...

1301
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:45,235
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1302
01:20:45,277 --> 01:20:46,320
we're goin' bowling.

1303
01:20:48,784 --> 01:20:51,414
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1304
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:55,255
(Laughing) OW.

1305
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:58,218
Whoo! Yes.

1306
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,728
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck. (Giggles)

1307
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:06,192
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1308
01:21:06,234 --> 01:21:09,532
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1309
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:12,413
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1310
01:21:12,455 --> 01:21:15,293
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1311
01:21:15,335 --> 01:21:17,882
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1312
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:20,803
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1313
01:21:20,887 --> 01:21:23,434
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1314
01:21:23,517 --> 01:21:24,728
Yeah.

1315
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,690
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1316
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,403
Hey.

1317
01:21:29,445 --> 01:21:32,159
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1318
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:36,668
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1319
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,797
but I got you a little something.

1320
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,345
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1321
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:43,682
I know. I wanted to.

1322
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,562
(Laughing) Oh, my gosh.

1323
01:21:46,604 --> 01:21:50,486
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1324
01:21:50,528 --> 01:21:52,114
It's a pink helmet.

1325
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:55,830
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1326
01:21:55,914 --> 01:21:57,875
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1327
01:21:57,917 --> 01:21:59,378
It's perfect.

1328
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,801
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1329
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:05,975
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1330
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:08,604
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1331
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:12,696
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1332
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:15,784
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1333
01:22:16,787 --> 01:22:18,916
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1334
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:21,671
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1335
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:26,305
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1336
01:22:26,347 --> 01:22:27,976
and I want to let you know that I...

1337
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,566
I feel the same way.

1338
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:35,865
- Really?
- Really.

1339
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:37,911
(Woman screams)

1340
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,623
- (Smack)
- BJ!

1341
01:22:41,293 --> 01:22:43,964
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1342
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,092
Hell, no.

1343
01:22:50,435 --> 01:22:51,479
Whatever.
