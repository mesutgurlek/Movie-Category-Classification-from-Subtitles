1
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:30,549
<i>Hey, you reached Doug.
Sorry, I missed your call.</i>

2
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,161
<i>Please leave a name and number
and I'll get back to you.</i>

3
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,791
<i>Hi, you've reached Dr. Stuart Price
with Prime Dentistry.</i>

4
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,945
<i>Please leave a message
after the...</i>

5
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,997
<i>Hey, it's Phil.
Leave me a message, or don't...</i>

6
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:57,268
<i>do me a favor,
don't text me, it's gay.</i>

7
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,224
Anything?

8
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,684
I tried them all. It keeps going
straight to voice mail.

9
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:04,593
Well, there has to be
an explanation.

10
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:07,235
Sweety, it's Vegas, you'll lose
track of time in those casinos...

11
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:09,730
there's no windows,
there's no clocks.

12
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,634
He's probably on a heater.

13
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:15,616
And you never walk away from the
table... when you're on a heater.

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,495
You do,
if you're getting married.

15
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,703
Hello?

16
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:21,880
Tracy, it's Phil.

17
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,640
Phil, where the hell
are you guys? I'm freaking out.

18
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,251
Yea, listen, uh...

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,559
we fucked up.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,527
What're you talking about?

21
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,666
The bachelor party,
the whole night, it...

22
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:42,247
it got outta control
and, uh...

23
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,044
we lost Doug.

24
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:48,083
- What?
- We can't find Doug.

25
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:52,019
What're you saying, Phil?
We're getting married in 5 hours.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,785
Yeah...

27
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,138
that's not gonna happen.

28
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:29,566
<i>~ I didn't know what you'd do!
- Right.</i>

29
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,066
Okeydoke.

30
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,709
Whoa, watch it pervert!

31
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,760
It's okay Alan,
he's just doing your inseam.

32
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,772
But he's getting very close
to my shaft.

33
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:44,912
All set.
You can change now.

34
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:48,045
Thanks, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

35
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,150
Alright, buddy.
We should get a move on.

36
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:54,599
You know, Doug.
I was thinking...

37
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:58,711
If you wanna go to Vegas without
me it's totally cool, you know.

38
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:00,505
- What're you talking about?
- Well...

39
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,194
Phil and Stu, they're your buddies
and it's your bachelor party and...

40
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:06,379
Come on, Alan...
those two love you.

41
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,244
I... I just don't want you to
feel like you have to hold back...

42
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:11,744
because your wife's
brother is there.

43
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,813
It's not like that...

44
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,294
It's not like that. I already
told you, Alan, okay?

45
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:23,385
We're just spending the night
in Vegas. It's no big deal.

46
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,022
Besides, you're not just...
my wife's brother,

47
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,115
you're my brother now.

48
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:34,325
I want you to know, Doug,
I'm... I'm a steel-trap.

49
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,446
Whatever happens tonight,

50
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,946
I will never, ever, ever,
speak a word of it.

51
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,033
Okay, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that's...

52
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,382
Seriously, I don't care
what happens.

53
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,282
I don't care
if we kill someone.

54
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,538
What?

55
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,895
You heard me.
It's Sin City.

56
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,131
I won't tell a soul.

57
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:57,002
Okay, I got it.

58
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,946
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

59
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:05,873
I love you so much.

60
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,334
No... Sid.

61
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,569
- Really?
- Come on. You're family now.

62
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,112
Are you sure?
I mean, you love this car.

63
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:22,306
Doug, it's just a car, just
make sure when you get there...

64
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,416
put some armor on the tires
so the sand doesn't seep in.

65
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:29,087
- Absolutely. That's easy.
- Oh, and, uh...

66
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,931
don't let Alan drive, because,
there's something wrong with him.

67
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,439
- Understood.
- And Phil either, I don't like him.

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,895
I will be the only one
driving this car. I promise.

69
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,129
Good.

70
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,389
Remember, what happens in Vegas,
stays... in Vegas.

71
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,397
Ahh... ha, ha.

72
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,317
Except for Herpes.
That shit'll come back with you.

73
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,778
<I>All right,
well, hold on...

74
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,568
hold on, I still need some
of your permission slips.

75
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,405
And 90 dollars for the field trip to
the Griffith observatory next weekend.

76
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:03,580
Pay now, or forever regret missing out
on this experience of a lifetime, guys.

77
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:05,740
- You're good. You got it.
- Thank you Mr. Wenneck.

78
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,951
Thank you, Wilson.
Thanks, Bobby.

79
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,318
- Do you have to park so close?
- Yeah, what's wrong?

80
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,330
I shouldn't be here.

81
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:37,801
Why is that Alan?

82
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:41,620
I'm not supposed to be
within 200 feet of a school.

83
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,777
- What?
- Or a Chuck E. Cheese.

84
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,180
- Hey, Mr. Wenneck.
- It's the weekend, Nick.

85
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,830
I don't know you,
you do not exist.

86
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,110
- Shit.
- Ha, ha, ha.

87
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,910
- Nice car.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:58,110
- I'm driving.
- Oh...

89
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:01,356
No chance, but... Don't step
on that, god. Watch the leather...

90
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:04,718
Will you shut up and drive before one
of these nerds ask me another question.

91
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:08,379
- Who's this?
- Alan... Tracy's brother.

92
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,015
- I met you like, four times.
- Oh, yeah, how you doin', man?

93
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,896
<i>- Don't forget your Rogaine.
- Rogaine, check.</i>

94
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:20,288
And don't forget to use it.

95
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,848
I can totally tell when you forget.
Your hair just looks thinner.

96
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,865
Using of the Rogaine... check.

97
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,913
And make sure to call me right when
you get to the hotel, not like that...

98
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:35,601
Conference in Phoenix. I had to wait
two hours for you to call me.

99
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:38,736
I was the keynote speaker.
I was late to the podium.

100
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,203
- Still...
- Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.

101
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,987
- What is the matter?
- I don't know.

102
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,680
I just know you're gonna go to a
strip club when you're out there.

103
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,965
Melissa, we're going to
Napa Valley.

104
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,268
I don't even think they have
strip clubs in wine country.

105
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,759
I'm sure if there is one,
Phil will sniff it out.

106
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,902
It's not gonna be like that.

107
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,987
Besides, you know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

108
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:08,119
I know, it's just, boys and their
bachelor parties. It's gross.

109
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,953
You're right. It is... gross.

110
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,162
- Not to mention it's pathetic.
- Hm'hm.

111
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,762
- Those places are filthy.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:18,061
And the worst part is...

113
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:23,143
that little girl... grinding and dry
humping the fucking stage up there.

114
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,191
- That's somebody's daughter up there.
- Somebody's daughter up there.

115
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:28,589
- I was just gonna say that.
- See?

116
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,632
I just wish your friends
were as mature as you.

117
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:34,096
They are mature, actually. You just
have to get to know them better.

118
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,775
<i>Paging Doctor Faggot.</i>

119
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,988
<i>Doctor Faggot.</i>

120
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:47,032
- I should go.
- That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.

121
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:52,387
Have a good weekend.
I'll miss you.

122
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,805
Whoa!
Road trip!

123
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:12,881
Hey, Vegas!
Vegas, baby.

124
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,885
Vegas.

125
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,992
Cheer up!

126
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,730
Come on, just 'till Barstow.
Everybody's passing us.

127
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,831
Absolutely not. I promised Sid,
I will be the only one driving this car.

128
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:32,327
- Besides you're drinking.
- Oh, what're you, a cop now?

129
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:34,428
Come on, you know I drive great
when I'm drunk.

130
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,675
That's true. Don't forget Phil was
always our designated drunk driver.

131
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,485
You wanna explain to them, Alan?

132
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:43,787
Guys, my dad loves this car more
than he loves me, so yeah.

133
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:45,114
Oh, whatever, look I left
my wife and my kid at home...

134
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,914
so I can go
with you guys to Vegas.

135
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,482
You know how difficult that was?

136
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,129
- That's really sweet, Phil.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,943
Dude, I was being sarcastic.
I fucking hate my life.

138
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,022
I may never go back.
I might just stay in Vegas.

139
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:56,166
Here we go.

140
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,194
You know what, Doug? You should
enjoy yourself, because...

141
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:01,085
come saturday you're gonna
start dying... a little bit...

142
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,285
everyday.

143
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,340
- Yeah...
- Alright.

144
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,278
That's why I managed to stay single
this whole time, you know.

145
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,701
- Oh really? That's why you're single?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,835
Cool. Good to know.

147
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,002
Am I alright over there, Alan?

148
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,980
- Yeah, you're good.
- Alright.

149
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,519
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God.

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,395
- That was awesome.
- That was not awesome!

151
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:26,001
- Yes.
- What's wrong with you.

152
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,752
That was insane.
We almost just died.

153
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,744
But you should've seen
your face, just classic.

154
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,344
That's funny.

155
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,556
It's not funny.

156
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:54,742
oh my, you've got
a sweet ride there.

157
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:56,942
Don't touch it.

158
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:03,108
Don't even look at it.
Go on. Get out. You heard me.

159
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,137
Don't look at me either.

160
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,740
<i>Yeah...
you better walk on.</i>

161
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:13,375
- He's actually kinda funny.
- Yeah, he means well.

162
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,542
<i>I'll hit an old man
in public.</i>

163
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,444
Is he all there...
like, mentally?

164
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:22,426
I think so, he's just an odd guy
and he's kinda weird.

165
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,057
- I mean, should we be worried?
- No.

166
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,557
- Alright.
- No.

167
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:30,495
Tracy did mention that we shouldn't
let him gamble or drink to much.

168
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:34,429
Jesus, he's like a gremlin.
Comes with instructions and shit.

169
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,710
And one water.

170
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,398
- All good with Melissa?
- Oh, yeah...

171
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,244
I told her we're 2 hours outside
the wine country, and she bought it.

172
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,731
Don't you think it's strange
that you've been in a relationship...

173
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:49,522
for 3 years and you still have
to lie, about going to Vegas.

174
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,622
Yeah, I do.
But, trust me...

175
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,167
- it's not worth the fight.
- Oh... so,

176
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:56,443
you can't go to Vegas,
but she can fuck a bellhop...

177
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,743
- on a Carnival cruise line.
- Hey.

178
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:04,961
Okay, first of all, he was
a bartender... and she was wasted.

179
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:09,014
And if you must know,
he didn't even come inside her.

180
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:12,422
- And you believe that?
- Uh... yeah I do believe that...

181
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:15,477
because she's grossed out
by semen.

182
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:17,817
That'll be thirty-two-fifty.

183
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,649
It's thirty-two-fifty,
I'll pay for it.

184
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:27,191
It says here we should work in teams.
Who wants to be my spotter?

185
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:31,538
I don't think you should be doing
too much gambling tonight, Alan.

186
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,744
Gambling? Who said anything
about gambling?

187
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,282
It's not gambling when you know
you're gonna win.

188
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:37,968
Counting cards
is a foolproof system.

189
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:40,417
- It's also illegal.
- It's not illegal.

190
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:45,121
It's frowned upon, like...
masturbating on an airplane.

191
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm pretty sure
that's illegal too.

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,127
Yeah, maybe after... 9/11,
where everybody gets too sensitive.

193
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,887
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.

194
00:12:57,024 --> 00:13:00,518
Either way, you gotta be super smart
to count cards, buddy, okay?

195
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,987
- Oh, really?
- It's not easy.

196
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:03,607
Okay, maybe we should
tell that to rain man...

197
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:07,005
because he practically bankrupted
a casino and he was a 'ratard'.

198
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,586
What?

199
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:11,150
He was a 'ratard'.

200
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,728
Retard.

201
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,044
Here we go.

202
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:58,778
- Hi, welcome to Caesar's.
- Hi.

203
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,413
- Checking in?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:04,730
- We have a reservation under Dr. Price.
- Okay, let me look that up for you.

205
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:10,220
Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist.
And don't try and get fancy.

206
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:14,796
- It's not fancy if it's true.
- He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.

207
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:18,009
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack,
you should still call 911.

208
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,668
We'll be sure to do that.

209
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,038
Can I ask you a question?
Do you know if the hotel...

210
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,316
- is pager-friendly?
- What do you mean?

211
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:27,816
- I'm not getting a sig' on my beeper.
- I'm not sure.

212
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:33,147
Is there a pay-phone bank?
Bunch of pay-phones? Business.

213
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:37,519
- Um... there's a phone in your room.
- That'll work.

214
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,713
Sir, I have you in a 2 bedroom suite
on the 12th floor, is that okay?

215
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,936
- Sounds perfect.
- Actually, I was wondering...

216
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,132
- if you have any villas available.
- Phil...

217
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,707
- we're not even gonna be in the room.
- Not necessary.

218
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,594
It's no big deal, we can
share beds, one night.

219
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:53,835
If we share beds,
I'm bunking with Phil.

220
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:56,222
- You good with that?
- No, I'm not good with that.

221
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:59,625
Guys, we're not sharing beds.
What're we 12 years olds?

222
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,795
Lisa, I appologize.
How much is the villa?

223
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:05,173
Well, we have one villa available,
and it's 42 hundred for the night.

224
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:07,364
- Is it awesome?
- It's pretty awesome.

225
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,874
We'll take it.

226
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,780
- Give her your credit card.
- I can't give her my credit card.

227
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:15,613
- We'll split it.
- Are you crazy? No, this is on us.

228
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,412
You don't get it.
Melissa checks my statements.

229
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:21,004
Well, we just need
a credit card on file.

230
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,997
We won't charge you anything
until you check out.

231
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,484
- So you can figure it out then.
- Perfect. That's Perfect.

232
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:26,584
Thank you, Lisa.

233
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,747
Then we'll deal with
it tomorrow, come on.

234
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,003
Fine.

235
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:33,688
- Can I ask you another question?
- Sure.

236
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,322
You probably get this a lot.
This isn't the real Caesar's Palace,

237
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:37,472
is it?

238
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:39,509
What do you mean?

239
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,778
Did... huh'um...

240
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:46,083
- did Caesar live here?
- Um... no.

241
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,062
I didn't think so.

242
00:15:57,298 --> 00:16:00,658
Holy shit.

243
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,623
This is Vegas.

244
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:07,380
Oh, my...
This place is enormous.

245
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,121
Now we're talking.

246
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,294
It's all one suite?

247
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,167
Thank you, guys.
Or should I say thank you, Stu.

248
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:18,559
You're welcome.
It's only because I love you.

249
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,207
Okay, ladies, pick a room.
Get dressed. Be ready in 30 minutes.

250
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:27,624
I just wish you could see this place,
because you, of all people...

251
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:32,718
would love it.
Yeah... it's so great.

252
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,253
Yeah... and there's no TV's,
no phones.

253
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:39,798
They just have this cute little
antique radios in all the rooms.

254
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,598
Yeah...

255
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,530
Well, um...

256
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:50,076
We met the... uh, proprietor.
What's his name? Um...

257
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:54,930
Ceasar... Palatche.
Yeah, like the salad.

258
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,227
Okay, well listen,
I gotta go...

259
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,029
because we're gonna hit
this wine tasting...

260
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,351
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I love you... okay.

261
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,923
Bye.

262
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,205
I rather not say anything.
It's so embarassing.

263
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,791
- Where's Alan?
- He... uh, he went downstairs.

264
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,035
He said he would grab
a few things.

265
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:16,022
Good, because I...
have something... to show you.

266
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,378
Oh, oh...

267
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,745
- What the hell is that?
- What'd you think it is?

268
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:25,260
If it's what I think it is.
I think it's a big fucking mistake.

269
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,741
I'm gonna proposed to Melissa
at your wedding. After the ceremony.

270
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:32,470
- Stuey, congratulations.
- Thank you, Doug.

271
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,471
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Yeah, it's my grandmother's.

272
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,186
She made it all the way through the
holocaust with that thing. It's legit.

273
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:41,452
I don't get it. Wait, have you not
listen to anything I've ever said?

274
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:45,272
Phil, we've been dating for 3 years.
It's time, it's how it works.

275
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,484
A, that is bullshit and B,
she is a complete bitch.

276
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,344
Hey, that's his fiance.

277
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:54,525
It's true. You know it's true.
She beats him.

278
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:57,093
That was twice
and I was outta line.

279
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:00,293
She's strong-willed...
and I respect that.

280
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:03,122
Wow, wow.
He's in denial.

281
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,351
Not to mention
she fucked a sailor.

282
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,418
Hey, he wasn't a sailor.
He was a bartender...

283
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,168
on a cruise ship.
You know that.

284
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,511
Guys, just...
I'm standing right here,

285
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:14,851
so I can hear everything
that you're saying.

286
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,025
Hey, guys, you ready
to let the dogs out?

287
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,485
What?
Do what?

288
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,211
Let the dogs out.
You know, like,

289
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,941
¶ who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? ¶

290
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,407
Who brought this guy along?

291
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,916
Yes, Alan, we're ready to let
the dogs out. Hey, congrats.

292
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,016
Thank you.

293
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:32,816
<i>¶ Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? Who? Who? ¶</i>

294
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:36,666
<i>- ¶ Who let the dogs out?

296
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,016
You're not really
wearing that, are you?

297
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:55,376
- Wearing what?
- The man purse.

298
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,791
You're actually gonna wear that,
or you guys just fuckin' with me?

299
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:02,410
It's where I keep all my things.
I get a lotta compliments on this.

300
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,686
Plus it's not a man purse.
It's called a satchel.

301
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,486
Indiana Jones wears one.

302
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:09,739
So does Joy Behar.

303
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,517
- We're going up, guys.
- Yeah, that's perfect.

304
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:16,287
Really?

305
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,644
We're going up?

306
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,591
I'm just saying
it's clearly marked, okay?

307
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:28,004
We're definitely not
supposed to be up here.

308
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,904
Oh, come on, Stu.
We're paying for a villa.

309
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,264
We can do
whatever the fuck we want.

310
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,819
- Yeah, but...
- Just wedge the door up.

311
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:34,742
Guys, come on up here.

312
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,242
Fine.

313
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,008
How the hell
did you find this place?

314
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,998
Don't worry about it.

315
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,598
Whoa...

316
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:48,042
- You alright?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,276
Look at the view up here.
You happy?

318
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,776
- This is great.
- Wow...

319
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,853
Are you kidding?

320
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:57,619
- Alan, how we're doing, buddy?
- Good.

321
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,674
What'd you got over there, Alan?

322
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,102
That's the Eiffel Tower.

323
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,398
Oh, oh...

324
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:08,224
- A little Jägermeister. Good idea.
- Good call. On the roof.

325
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:09,297
Um...

326
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,864
Now, this is good. I'd...
I like to make a toast.

327
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,876
To Doug and Tracy.
May tonight be...

328
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:20,027
but a minor speed-bump...

329
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,527
in an otherwise very long
and healthy marriage.

330
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:24,417
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

331
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:25,917
- Hm'hm.
- That was sweet.

332
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,514
- It's like college.
- Alright...

333
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,514
- I wanna talk about something.
- Alright.

334
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,458
- I wanted to...
- I like to...

335
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,958
I like to say something.

336
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:44,171
- That I prepared... tonight.
- Alright, Alan.

337
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,806
Hello.

338
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:54,993
How about that ride in. I guess
that's why they call it Sin City.

339
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:57,029
Ha-ha-ha.

340
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:01,668
You guys might not know this, but
I considered myself a bit of a loner.

341
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:05,931
I tend to think of myself
as a one-man wolf pack.

342
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:10,526
But when my sister brought Doug home,
I knew he was one of my own.

343
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,007
And my wolf pack,
it grew by one.

344
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,934
So, were the two of us, there
were two of us in the wolf pack.

345
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:23,235
I was alone at first in the pack,
and then Doug joined in later.

346
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:27,513
And six months ago, when
Doug introduced me to you guys...

347
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:30,521
I thought, "Wait a second.
Could it be...?"

348
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:35,580
And now I know for sure. I just
added two more guys to my wolf pack.

349
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,773
- Alright.
- Alright.

350
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:43,686
Four of us wolves. Running around
the desert together. In Las Vegas.

351
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,380
Looking for strippers
and cocaine.

352
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:50,187
- So tonight, I make a toast.
- Yes!

353
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:52,498
- What'd you got there?
- Whoa... Hold on... Whoa.

354
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,220
- What the fuck is this?
- What're you doing?

355
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,927
- What is that?
- Blood brothers.

356
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,468
- You know guy? Don't do that.
- God damn it.

357
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,868
- Alan, no, don't do it.
- No...

358
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,868
I'm not doing that.
Make him stop.

359
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,495
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.
Give me the knife. Slowly. Thank you.

360
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,223
- Thank you very much.
- You alright?

361
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:16,096
Are you okay?
Do you need a doctor?

362
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,898
- He's fine. He's good.
- You sure?

363
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,143
- I'm good.
- Perfect.

364
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:22,062
Alan, come here, buddy.
Get in here, crazy.

365
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:24,840
Alright.
To a night...

366
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:27,040
the four of us
will never forget.

367
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,690
Cheers.

368
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,519
What the fuck?

369
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,766
Control yourself, man. God damn.
Will you put on some pants?

370
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,746
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom.
- Alan, just calm down. It's me.

371
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:22,344
Phil, there is a tiger
in the bathroom.

372
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,893
What's going on?

373
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,801
There's a jungle cat
in the bathroom.

374
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:28,538
Okay, I'll check...
I'll check it out.

375
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,921
Be careful.
Don't go.

376
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,831
Holy fuck. He's not kidding.
There's a tiger in there.

377
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,829
- No, there isn't.
- Yeah.

378
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:41,382
That bitch is gigantic.

379
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:45,865
- You okay, buddy?
- No. I'm in so much pain right now.

380
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:49,459
God damn.
Look at this place.

381
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:55,303
I know. Phil, they have my credit
card downstairs. I'm so screwed.

382
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,718
How the hell did a tiger
get in the bathroom?

383
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,919
It almost killed me.

384
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,975
Hey bro, do you mind
putting on some pants?

385
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,875
I find it a little weird
I have to ask twice.

386
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:04,632
Pants, at a time like this?
I dont have any.

387
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,564
What the fuck
happened last night.

388
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:11,394
Hey, Phil,
am I missing a tooth?

389
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:14,894
Let's see, holy shit...

390
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,882
Oh, my god.

391
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:22,685
My lateral incisor, it's gone.

392
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:26,472
Okay, we just need to calm down.
We're fine. Everything's fine.

393
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,311
Alan, go wake up Doug.

394
00:26:28,312 --> 00:26:30,777
Let's just get some coffee
and get the fuck outta Nevada...

395
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:32,190
before house-keeping shows up.

396
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,238
What am I gonna tell Melissa?
I lost a tooth.

397
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,838
I have no idea
how it happened.

398
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,603
Alright, take it easy,
you freaking me out, man.

399
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:40,003
I got a massive headache.
Let's just calm down.

400
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:42,969
How am I supposed to calm down?
Look around you.

401
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,051
Hey, guys, he's not in there.

402
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,106
- Did you check all the rooms?
- Yeah, I looked everywhere.

403
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,690
- Plus his mattress is gone.
- Well, whatever...

404
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,960
He probably went to the pool to get
something to eat. I'll call his cell.

405
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,840
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.

406
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:11,235
Hello?

407
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:13,535
- Alan.
- Hey.

408
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,402
- It's Phil.
- Oh, hey Phil...

409
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,736
This is Doug's phone,
that's Doug's phone.

410
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,684
- No shit.
- Yeah.

411
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,449
What the fuck is that?

412
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,302
Who's fuckin' baby is that?

413
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:39,088
Alan, are you sure you didn't see
anyone else in the suite?

414
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,223
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here.

415
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,484
Check its collar or something.

416
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:45,812
Shh... shh...

417
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:47,312
It's okay, baby.

418
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:48,824
Stu, we don't have time
for this.

419
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,196
Let's go hook up with Doug.
We'll deal with the baby later.

420
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,680
Phil, we're not gonna
leave a baby in the room.

421
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,077
There's a fucking tiger
in the bathroom.

422
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:58,841
- It's not our baby.
- Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.

423
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,056
Alright, fine. We'll take it with us.
Can you at least find some pants?

424
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,896
Why can't we remember
a god damned thing...

425
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:14,096
from last night?

426
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,794
Because we obviously
had a great fucking time.

427
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:21,858
Why don't you just stop
worrying for one minute.

428
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,301
Be proud of yourself.

429
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,004
Oh, how cute.
What's his name?

430
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:34,888
Ben.

431
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:37,496
Carlos.

432
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,436
Carlos?

433
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,627
Hey, Phil, look.

434
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,654
He's jacking his little weenis.

435
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,597
Pull yourself together, man.

436
00:29:06,598 --> 00:29:08,383
Not at the table, Carlos.

437
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,135
I looked everywhere.

438
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:17,473
Gym, casino, front desk nobody
seen Doug. He's not here.

439
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,535
He's fine.
He's a grown man.

440
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:20,582
Seriously...

441
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,782
Stu, you gotta calm down.
Here, have some juice.

442
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,601
Okay, alright, listen...
let's just track this thing.

443
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,564
Alright, what's the last thing
we remember doing last night?

444
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,708
Well, the first thing was
we're on the roof...

445
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,008
and we're having
shots of Jäger.

446
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,995
And then we had dinner
at The Palm, right?

447
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:44,945
That's right.

448
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:47,991
Then we play crabs
at the Hard Rock and I think...

449
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,261
Doug was there.

450
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,001
- That sounds right.
- No, no, no, no, he definitely was.

451
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:54,802
You know what, guys? I don't
even remember going to dinner.

452
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:55,990
I know. What the fuck?

453
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:57,670
I don't think I've ever been
this hungover.

454
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,737
After the Hard Rock I blacked
out. It was like emptiness.

455
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:02,443
Okay...

456
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,444
We have him until 10 pm,
so that gives us...

457
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:06,927
a twelve hour window
where we could've lost him.

458
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,408
What is this?

459
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,230
Oh, my god.
That is my tooth.

460
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,039
Why do you have that?

461
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:15,423
- What else is in your pocket?
- No, it's a good thing.

462
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,577
No, no, check your pockets.
Check your pockets.

463
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,449
Do you have anything?

464
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,481
I have an ATM receipt
from The Bellagio.

465
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:29,191
11:05 for 800 dollars.
I am so fucked.

466
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:34,172
I have a valet ticket from Caesar's.
Looks like we got in at 5:15 am.

467
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,293
Holy, shit.
We drove last night?

468
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:39,474
Driving drunk.
Classic.

469
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:44,233
What's that on your arm?

470
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:46,607
What the fuck?

471
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:49,047
Jesus, Phil, you were
in the hospital last night.

472
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,856
- I guess so, yeah.
- You okay?

473
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:52,874
Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.

474
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,711
What the hell is going on?

475
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:57,411
Stu, Stu, this is a good thing.
We have a lead now.

476
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,489
Hey, Stu.
Watch this.

477
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,159
You ever seen a baby do that?

478
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,504
Alan...
not cool.

479
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,227
So... uh...

480
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:13,959
you sure you're qualified
to be taking care of that baby?

481
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,941
What're you talkin' about?
I found a baby before.

482
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:18,033
- You found a baby before?
- Yeah.

483
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,579
- Where?
- Coffee Bean.

484
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:23,391
- Wait.
- What?

485
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,659
Hey Phil, look, I don't think Doug
would want us to take the Mercedes.

486
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,881
Relax we'll be careful.

487
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:30,862
My dad is crazy about that car
and he left Doug in charge.

488
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:33,236
Alan... we got bigger
problems here.

489
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:36,136
Doug could be in hospital.
He could be hurt, okay?

490
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:38,003
Let's worry
about the car later,

491
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,486
Alright, guys...
check it out.

492
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,075
Is that the mattress
from Doug's room?

493
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:50,638
What the fuck?

494
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,732
Hey, what...
what's going on?

495
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:57,635
Some asshole threw his bed
off the window last night.

496
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,308
- No shit.
- Yeah.

497
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,295
Some guys
just can't handle Vegas.

498
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,824
It's gonna be okay, Stu.

499
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,498
How the hell
did we manage...

500
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:17,903
Here's your car, officers.

501
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,624
Oh, god.

502
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,672
Alright, everybody act cool,
and don't say a word.

503
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,672
Let's just get in and go.

504
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:26,872
Alright.

505
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,930
- Stu, you got a five?
- No.

506
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,217
I'll get you on the way back.

507
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,460
Thank you, sir.

508
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:37,756
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

509
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,713
You just nailed the baby.

510
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:42,379
Are my glasses okay?

511
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,909
Your glasses are fine, dick.

512
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,827
This is so illegal.

513
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:56,168
Can't you see the fun part
in anything?

514
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:59,268
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic
in a stolen police car...

515
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,313
With what is sure to be a
missing child in the back seat.

516
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,304
Which part of this is fun?

517
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,744
I think the cop car part
is pretty cool.

518
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:09,321
Thank you, Alan. It is cool.
Doug would love it.

519
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,458
Come on.

520
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:16,372
Check this out.

521
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:18,620
Oh, no, don't, Phil don't.
Don't do this.

522
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,920
Take it easy.

523
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,254
Just don't try to call
more attention to us.

524
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:22,554
Attention. Sorry.

525
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:24,944
<i>Attention, please.
Move outta the way.</i>

526
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:28,206
<i>I repeat.
Please disperse.</i>

527
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,667
Phil, I wanna get out.
I wanna get out, stop.

528
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,167
Phil, I wanna get out,
pull over.

529
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:34,941
<i>Ma'm, in the leopard dress...</i>

530
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:36,892
<i>you have an amazing rack.</i>

531
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,120
Get off the sidewalk.
Get off the sidewalk.

532
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,718
I should've been
a fuckin' cop.

533
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,018
Hey!

534
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:50,772
Look, I already told you.

535
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,130
You came in here with a mild
concussion, some bruised ribs.

536
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,079
No big deal.

537
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,492
Although none of you could
articulate, how it happened.

538
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,020
You remember
how many of us were here?

539
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:00,450
Uh...

540
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:03,131
I don't know.
I think it was just you guys.

541
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,415
Definitely no baby.

542
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,829
And one other guy.

543
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,333
That's our guy.
Was he okay?

544
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:11,724
Yep, he was fine. Just whacked
out of his mind. You all were.

545
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,203
Alright. Come forward.

546
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:16,133
And turn.

547
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:19,330
Alright, here we go.

548
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:21,196
And cough.

549
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,584
Cough.

550
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:26,393
Give me one more.

551
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,129
Alright.
Attaboy.

552
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,282
Okay, Felix, you can put
your robe on.

553
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,482
and... uh, the nurse
will be here in a minute.

554
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:36,656
I'll see you
after the weekend.

555
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,793
Fine, thank you,
thank you, doctor.

556
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:45,559
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have a surgery up on the 4th floor.

557
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:49,314
I know. We just need a couple
more minutes of your time.

558
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,885
Yeah, tuck it right in there.
I don't wanna resterilize.

559
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:58,144
Walk with me.

560
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:03,263
Okay, here we go.
Patient name Phil Wenneck.

561
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:05,794
2:45 am. arrival.

562
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:09,084
Minor concussion like I said.
Some bruising. Pretty standard.

563
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,166
Do you mind if I take a look.
I'm actually a doctor.

564
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,018
Yeah, you said that
several times last night.

565
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:15,018
But, really,
you're just a dentist.

566
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,688
Okay, this is interesting.

567
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:21,004
Your blood work
came in this morning.

568
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,775
Well?

569
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,281
They found a large amount
of Roophyllin in your system.

570
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:27,269
Rooph...

571
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,236
Roophyllin? Roofies?

572
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:31,236
Commonly known
as the "Date Rape Drug?"

573
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:32,165
What?

574
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,182
Are you saying
I was raped last night?

575
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:35,935
Actually...

576
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:43,527
I don't think so. But...
someone did slip you the drug.

577
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,595
I'm not surprised
you don't remember anything.

578
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,821
Doc, none of us can remember
anything from last night.

579
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:50,061
You remember?

580
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,174
Yeah, how could someone
drugged all of us?

581
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,255
Look, I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
By now the stuff is outta your system.

582
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,709
You're gonna be fine.
I have to go.

583
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,217
No, no, no, wait,
please doctor.

584
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:01,237
Is there anything else
like something...

585
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:04,255
we may have been talking about?
Or some place we were going?

586
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:06,971
Actually there was something.

587
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:09,400
You guys kept talking about
some wedding last night.

588
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,264
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug
is getting married tomorrow.

589
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,749
- You know what? I want the 100 back.
- No, no, no. Easy.

590
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,189
You kept talking about some
wedding that you just came from.

591
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,014
At the Best Little Chapel.

592
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:20,962
You guys kept saying how
sick the wedding was...

593
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:23,012
and getting all crazy
about it, okay?

594
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,176
I hope this helps, fellas.
I really have to leave.

595
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:28,045
Wait, do you know Best Little Chapel?
You know where that is?

596
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:31,546
I do. It's on the corner of...
"get a map' and 'fuck off".

597
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:35,031
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.

598
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:38,640
Figure it out yourself, okay?
You're big boys.

599
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,635
What about the baby?

600
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:54,107
Just leave him in the car.
We're only gonna be 5 minutes.

601
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:58,188
- We're not leaving a baby in the car.
- He'll be fine. I cracked the window.

602
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,105
- What if they don't remember us.
- Well, let's just find out.

603
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:11,823
- Excuse me sir.
- Oh, ha, ha, ha...

604
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,700
Look at these guys.
What happened? You miss me?

605
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:18,028
You miss Eddie. You want more
from me? Come here, my friend.

606
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,446
Look at this guy.
You fuckin' crazy.

607
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,139
What's going on, man?

608
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,203
Listen, I wanna tell you something.
I know some sick people in my life.

609
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:30,335
This guy is the craziest, wildest
bastard, I ever met in my life.

610
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,899
- Who, this guy?
- This guy is out of his mind.

611
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,701
What's going on, you fucking
crazy motherfucker?

612
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,734
I thought
he was gonna eat my dick.

613
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:39,854
What happened? No love for Eddie?
You don't hug me?

614
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:43,614
No, no, it's not that, Eddie.
It's just that...

615
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:45,106
We're having
a hard time remembering...

616
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:46,946
what happened here
last night.

617
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,567
Yeah, was there...
was there a wedding here?

618
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:49,969
You do weddings here?

619
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,710
You're cracking my balls, man.

620
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:54,900
Eddie, I mean, obviously
we were here last night and...

621
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,830
we're looking for a friend, Doug.
You remember him?

622
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:59,188
- Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey.
- Mh'hm. Yeah.

623
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,121
- You saw him?
- Of course.

624
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:04,868
Is there anything you can tell us about
what may have happened last night?

625
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,013
You don't remember nothing?

626
00:38:12,147 --> 00:38:14,088
Congratulations, Stu.
You've gotten married.

627
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:16,766
Ugh...
This can't be happening.

628
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,410
Oh, god.

629
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,010
Oh...

630
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,643
I tell you one thing. You looked
seriously happy here, man.

631
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:29,867
That's it.
My life is over.

632
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:31,017
Stu, it's okay.
Shit happens.

633
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,317
Come on, Melissa's not gonna
know anything about this.

634
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:35,023
This never happened.

635
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,586
- I'll take care of it.
- Come on, bring it here.

636
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:38,590
Hey, what's all that?

637
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:40,542
The high-roller package.
It's what you guys ordered.

638
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,042
I have coffee mugs.

639
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:45,014
You have baseball caps, huh?

640
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:48,673
And fancy calendars all
with pictures of Stu and Jade.

641
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,925
- Her name's Jade?
- Yeah, she's beautiful, man.

642
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:55,089
Clean. Very tight. Tits, like that.
But that's because she had a baby.

643
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,676
- That explains the baby.
- Oh, Carlos, Carlos. Great.

644
00:38:57,677 --> 00:39:00,708
Alright. Eddie, here's the deal.
We made a major mistake last night.

645
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,487
We need to get this
marriage annuled immediately.

646
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:04,513
- You do annulments?
- Of course I do annulments.

647
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:05,938
It breaks my heart and
gonna make me very sad.

648
00:39:05,939 --> 00:39:08,461
But it's not a problem. I'm gonna
make a very good price for you.

649
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:12,134
I can't do it with just him though.
I need the chick. I need both parties.

650
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:13,823
Not a problem.
That's great.

651
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:14,969
Isn't that great, Stu?

652
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,398
C'mon, buddy. And she probably
knows where Doug is.

653
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,060
- Awesome.
- Alright, alright.

654
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,729
Okay... uh...

655
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,698
We need her address. She must have
filled out some paperwork, right?

656
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:24,988
Of course.

657
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:27,834
Hey, excuse me.
What's the matter with you?

658
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,791
Go get the paperwork now.
I've spent my life waiting for you.

659
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:34,025
Come on, come on,
And get the bakhala, please.

660
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,345
Hey, Phil,
what about my dad's car?

661
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,524
I'm sure Doug has it.
We'll get it back.

662
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:45,389
Then I vote we torch the cop car
and all the shit with it.

663
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:49,552
Torch it?
Who are you?

664
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:53,525
I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a
guy who marries complete strangers.

665
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:58,092
This whole situation
is completely fucked.

666
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,664
- These mugs. This hat.
- Hey.

667
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:05,864
This car. It's all evidence
of a night that never happened.

668
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:08,216
That is why
we're torching all of it.

669
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm a
school teacher. I got a family.

670
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,524
Okay. I'm all for secrecy, but I'm
not gonna torch a fucking cop car.

671
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:14,877
Fine. I'll do it.

672
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:17,178
- Can I help?
- Yeah. Thanks.

673
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,414
- Shit. Is it Doug?
- I don't have it.

674
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,319
It's Doug... Doug.

675
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,815
- Ahh... it's Melissa.
- Don't answer it.

676
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:25,512
I have to.
She's called twice already.

677
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:27,712
- Alright, alright, talk to her.
- Hey, sweetheart.

678
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:28,835
How are you?

679
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:32,029
There you are. It's the
third time I'm trying you.

680
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,052
I know.
The receptions up here is crazy.

681
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:38,133
I think it's all the sequoia trees,
it blocks the signal.

682
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:39,633
Oh, I hate that.

683
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,263
So, how was it last night?

684
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,987
Oh, it was fun actually...

685
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:44,487
kinda quiet...
it was a good time.

686
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:45,937
That sounds nice.

687
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:49,937
We're in all kinds
of vino factoids.

688
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,051
It's so cool how they
breast-feed, you know.

689
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,951
So, listen... um...

690
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,920
We're gonna go for a tractor ride.
So I should probably get going.

691
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:02,706
- A tractor ride?
- So pretty.

692
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,774
Come on.
Get outta the car.

693
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,015
- What's that?
- They just started up the tractor.

694
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:09,064
I think it backfired.

695
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:10,138
Where the hell is he?

696
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:14,416
Hey, easy, easy, I think we're
looking for the same guy, okay?

697
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,298
Hey... what the hell, man?

698
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:20,076
What the fuck, Stu?
Is that a baby?

699
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,570
How could this be a baby?

700
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:23,170
We're at a winery,
they just got goats.

701
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,252
Where is he?

702
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:26,804
I... I don't know
who you're talking about.

703
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:29,557
Sir, could you please start the
tractor so we can get out of here?

704
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,760
I'm trying to
but we're fucking blocked.

705
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,132
Oh, my god. What the
hell is happening, Stu?

706
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,254
Hey, there's a baby on board!

707
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:37,837
Someone just said baby.

708
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,955
- Get outta the car.
- It's a baby goat.

709
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,148
Chinese guy, why you're making
trouble for my business, man.

710
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,592
- Go away from here now.
- Get outta the fuckin' car.

711
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,742
- Phil, he's got a gun.
- No shit he's gotta gun.

712
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,520
I gotta call you back. Bye.

713
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,643
- Shut your mouth.
- Fuck you.

714
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,756
- They shot Eddie.
- Fuck this shit.

715
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:55,757
Go, go, go.

716
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,857
Go!

717
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,807
Go, go, go, go!

718
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:07,916
- Fuck.
- Okay.

719
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:11,216
- Phew, serious shit.
- Who were those guys?

720
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:13,568
We'll be okay.
everything's okay, alright?

721
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:15,801
What the fuck is going on?

722
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:18,198
I have no idea.

723
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:26,646
Why don't you just let
that one go to voice mail?

724
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:31,859
That's a fake laugh,
by the way.

725
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:39,164
It's got... uh, Ted Danson and
Magnum P.I. and that jewish actor.

726
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,011
Shut up, Alan.
What room was it again?

727
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:43,311
825.

728
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:45,531
<i>I already checked with her.</i>

729
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:48,363
I found him.
I call you back.

730
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:50,789
Thank god.
He's with his father.

731
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,487
I was freakin' out.

732
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,428
I missed you, sweety.

733
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,713
Honey, I missed you.

734
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:04,993
What the hell happened
to you guys?

735
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:07,148
Actually, we were
hoping you could tell us.

736
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:08,610
What do you mean?
I got up this morning.

737
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:12,527
I went to get you guys some coffee,
and I came back and you were gone.

738
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:16,049
Why are you being so quiet?

739
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,315
Am I being quiet?

740
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:19,915
He's so cute.

741
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,878
I gotta feed Tyler.
Come inside, you guys.

742
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,803
Did you hear that?
The baby's name is Tyler.

743
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:30,635
I thought he looked more
like a Carlos too, buddy.

744
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:37,628
Okay, what's up.
You guys are acting weird.

745
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:41,092
- Look, it's Jade, right?
- Very funny, Phil.

746
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:43,113
Right, Jade. Uh.

747
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:44,906
Do you remember
our friend, Doug?

748
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,046
Are you kidding? He was
the best man in our wedding.

749
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:50,026
Exactly. We can't find him
and we got a little worried.

750
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,771
Oh, my god.
That is so Doug.

751
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,334
I'm gonna go clean him up.
It's alright. Daddy didn't mean it.

752
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,859
Oh, my god.

753
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,939
What the fuck, man?
You gotta hold it together.

754
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,965
Holy shit.

755
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:07,965
She is super hot, you should
be proud of yourself.

756
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:10,230
She is wearing
my grandmother's ring.

757
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,205
- What?
- The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.

758
00:44:12,206 --> 00:44:14,480
Remember my grandmother's
holocaust ring?

759
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:16,215
- Fuck.
- She's wearing it.

760
00:44:16,718 --> 00:44:18,915
I didn't know they gave out
rings at the holocaust.

761
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,789
- He's okay.
- Oh, good.

762
00:44:23,012 --> 00:44:25,054
- He was just hungry.
- Oh, that's good. Uh...

763
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:26,901
About last night. Um...

764
00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:29,101
Do you remember
the last time you saw Doug?

765
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:31,172
Uh... I haven't seen him
since the wedding.

766
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:32,766
The wedding. Okay.

767
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:34,971
And, uh...

768
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:38,871
- What time was that at?
- Well... it was um...

769
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:42,606
I guess it was around one.

770
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:44,706
Because I had to go back
to work and finish my shift.

771
00:44:44,707 --> 00:44:47,903
And then when I got out, I headed
over to the hotel with Tyler.

772
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:49,521
And was Doug there then?

773
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,343
I didn't see Doug.
You guys were passed out.

774
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:52,814
The room was a wreck.

775
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,814
So I just curled up
next to Stu.

776
00:44:54,815 --> 00:44:56,114
- Ah'ha.
- Right.

777
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:00,788
I got a question. Um...

778
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:04,053
You said when your shift ended.
Does that mean you're a nurse?

779
00:45:04,236 --> 00:45:06,673
Or a... blackjack dealer?

780
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:09,560
- You know this. I'm a stripper.
- Mh'hm.

781
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:11,423
Well, technically
I'm an escort,

782
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:13,823
but stripping is a great way
to meet the clients.

783
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:15,199
Smart.

784
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,415
Savvy.

785
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:19,378
But that's all in the past,
now that I married a doctor.

786
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:21,921
I'm just a dentist.

787
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,413
- Police. Freeze!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

788
00:45:25,414 --> 00:45:27,530
Shut that baby up.
Shut that baby up.

789
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:29,967
Okay.
Okay.

790
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:38,808
So, after we take the mugshot,
we bring'em on down here...

791
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,294
where they wait
to be interviewed...

792
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:42,294
by the arresting officers.

793
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:43,530
Trust me, kids.

794
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,930
You do not wanna be sitting
on these benches.

795
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:48,733
We call this place
"Loserville".

796
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:52,118
Follow me.
Alright.

797
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,525
Hello.

798
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:02,197
Hey Tracy, it's Phil.

799
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:04,201
Hey, Phil.
Where are you guys?

800
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,185
We are at the spa,
at the hotel.

801
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,123
Cool, I'm just getting some sun.
Is Doug around?

802
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:12,266
Of course he's around.
Why wouldn't he be around?

803
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:14,728
I mean, I'm just wondering
why you're calling me.

804
00:46:14,865 --> 00:46:16,164
Um...

805
00:46:16,165 --> 00:46:20,951
We made a deal, no talking
to girlfriends or wifes. So...

806
00:46:21,036 --> 00:46:23,165
We all call each other's.

807
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:25,637
- Okay. What's up?
- Um...

808
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:29,293
you are not gonna believe this. We
got comped an extra night at the hotel.

809
00:46:29,294 --> 00:46:30,230
You did?

810
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:33,427
Yeah. The suite...  It's ridiculous!
It's out of control!

811
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:37,436
It's with room service and a butler.
there is no words, so...

812
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:39,363
We figured to spent
the night here and then...

813
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,057
We're just gonna come back
totally relax in the morning.

814
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:45,179
You wanna stay an extra night?
But the wedding is tomorrow.

815
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,614
Yeah, that's why we're gonna
get up real early and...

816
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:49,209
We'll be back in plenty of time.

817
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,358
Okay, you sure that's a good idea?

818
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,551
Wenneck, Price, Garner, Room 3.

819
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:56,735
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
Talk to you later.

820
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,342
- Come on, come on. Chop, chop.
- Spin around, spin around.

821
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:08,451
- Wait a second.
- I'll go over it. I'll go over.

822
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:11,369
- Hold on, I need to get back down.
- You got it?

823
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,148
- Yeah.
- There we go.

824
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:22,695
Gentlemen.
We got some good news...

825
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,795
and we got some bad news.

826
00:47:24,796 --> 00:47:27,343
The good news is,
we found your Mercedes.

827
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:30,096
- Oh, that's great news.
- It's great, hm?

828
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,829
It's over in impound right now.

829
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:36,965
We picked it up at 5 am this morning.
Parked in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.

830
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:41,303
- Huh, that's weird.
- Yeah. It is weird.

831
00:47:41,545 --> 00:47:43,773
There's also a note.

832
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,415
It says, "couldn't find the meter,
but here's 4 bucks. "

833
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,163
The bad news is...

834
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:55,075
We can't get you in front of
a judge until Monday morning.

835
00:47:55,564 --> 00:47:57,174
Oh... uh...

836
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:59,684
Officer that's just impossible.

837
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,912
We need to be
in L.A tomorrow for a wedding.

838
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,750
You stole a police car.

839
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:07,235
We didn't steal anything.
Um... we found it.

840
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:09,551
Yeah, if anything, we deserve
a reward or something.

841
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:10,881
Like a trophy?

842
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:12,451
I see assholes
like you everyday.

843
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,351
Every fucking day.

844
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:17,647
Let's go to Vegas.
We all get drunk and get laid.

845
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:21,635
Let's steal a cop car, 'cause
it'll be really fucking funny.

846
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:22,937
You think
you gonna get away with it?

847
00:48:22,938 --> 00:48:24,037
Not up in here!

848
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,738
Not up in here!

849
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:27,938
- Oh.
- Uh...

850
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,346
Sir...

851
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:34,476
If I may... um, I'm assuming that
that squad car...

852
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:36,619
... belongs to one of you.
- Yeah.

853
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,964
Yeah. Look.
I'm not a cop.

854
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:41,432
I'm no hero.

855
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:43,415
I'm a school teacher.

856
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:47,449
But if one of my kids went
missing on a field trip...

857
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,474
That would look
really bad on me.

858
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,604
What're you getting at?

859
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:54,291
Yeah, Phil.
What're you getting at?

860
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:56,675
No one wants to look bad.

861
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,330
We gotta get to a wedding.

862
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:01,843
And you guys don't need people talking
about how some obnoxious tourist...

863
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:04,422
Borrowed his squad car last night.

864
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:05,937
Look, the point is,

865
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:09,537
I think we can work out a deal.
Discretely of course, ma'm.

866
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:11,914
What'd you say?

867
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:22,856
Let me ask you a question.

868
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:28,212
Do any of you gentlemen have a
heart conditon, or anything like that?

869
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:30,819
- Uh'uh.
- Nope.

870
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,629
Okay, kids. You're in
for a real treat today.

871
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,903
These gentlemen have kindly
volunteered to demonstrate...

872
00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:39,957
How a stun gun is used
to subdue a suspect.

873
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,496
- Wait a second...
- It's what?

874
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:44,421
Now, there's two ways
to use a stun gun.

875
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,116
Up close and personal.

876
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,532
- Or...
- What the fuck.

877
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,531
you can shoot it
from a distance. Now...

878
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:55,160
do I have any volunteers who wanna
come up here to do some shooting, huh?

879
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:57,705
How about you, young lady.
Come on up here.

880
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:58,804
Alright...

881
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,420
Let's go, handsome!
Come on.

882
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,785
Not you, fat Jesus.
Slide it on back.

883
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:04,391
You, pretty boy.

884
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,386
Alright, now...

885
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:09,752
It's real simple. All you gotta
do is point, aim and shoot.

886
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:12,352
- Alright?
- Okay...

887
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,230
You don't really wanna do this.

888
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,435
You can do this.
Just focus.

889
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:19,350
Don't listen to this maniac.
Let's think this thing through.

890
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:20,821
Finish him!

891
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,680
Right in the nuts.
That was beautiful.

892
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,183
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody.
- Alright. Good job.

893
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:37,123
Good job. Well done.
Good job. That was great.

894
00:50:37,353 --> 00:50:39,328
Hey, we got one more charge left.

895
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,318
Anybody wanna do
some shooting up here?

896
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:45,385
How about you, big man.
Come on up here.

897
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:05,527
Okay. Same instructions.
Just point, aim, and shoot.

898
00:51:09,622 --> 00:51:13,758
There you go. That's the stuff.
I like the intensity.

899
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:15,655
Eye the tiger. Good.

900
00:51:16,303 --> 00:51:21,077
You're holding 50.000 volts, little man.
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.

901
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:24,983
- Stop.
- In the face.

902
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:26,983
- In the face.
- Stop.

903
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,597
Oh, oh...
He's still up.

904
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,245
Alright, everybody relax.
Take it easy.

905
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,763
We've seen it before. He just
need a little extra charge.

906
00:51:39,372 --> 00:51:40,555
There we go.

907
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:45,431
Some of these big boys.
You gotta give them 2 shots.

908
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:48,164
Alright, kids. Who wants to
get their fingerprints done?

909
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:49,564
Come on. Let's go.

910
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:52,320
Fuck those guys.

911
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:53,763
Do you hear me?

912
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:56,544
That was bullshit. I'm telling
everybody we stole a cop car.

913
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:58,693
He let us go.
Who cares.

914
00:51:58,694 --> 00:52:02,436
I care. You can't just do that.
You can't just tase people.

915
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,875
Because you...
you think it's funny.

916
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:06,765
That's police brutality.

917
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:12,991
I'm getting a soda.
You guys want anything?

918
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:14,261
No.

919
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,431
That man doesn't shut up.
Jesus Christ.

920
00:52:23,512 --> 00:52:25,712
Alan, you okay?

921
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:29,110
I'm just worried.

922
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:32,202
What if something happened
to Doug. Something bad.

923
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:34,284
Oh, come on,
you can't think like that.

924
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,059
What if he's dead?

925
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:40,444
I can't afford to lose anybody close
to me again. It hurts too much.

926
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,030
I was so upset
when my grandpa died.

927
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,524
Oh. How did he die?

928
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,362
- World War II.
- Died in the battle?

929
00:52:47,658 --> 00:52:51,403
No, he was skiing in Vermont.
It just was during World War II.

930
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:55,165
Alan...
Doug is fine.

931
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,312
But why hasn't he called?

932
00:52:56,313 --> 00:52:58,382
I don't know,
but we're gonna figure it out.

933
00:52:59,077 --> 00:53:00,708
I'll tell you another thing.

934
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:03,408
6 to 1 odds,
our car is beat to shit.

935
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:05,153
- Stu, not now.
- No, seriously,

936
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:07,493
how much you wanna bet? It's like
fucked up, beyond all recognition...

937
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:08,582
That's enough, Stu.

938
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,682
Alan is seriously worried, okay?
Let's not freak him out anymore.

939
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:18,145
I'm sorry, Alan.
You know what?

940
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:22,277
We'll search the car for clues,
and... everything's gonna be okay.

941
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,585
Oh, shit.
I can't look at it.

942
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,858
I can't look.
I can't look.

943
00:53:31,486 --> 00:53:34,329
- Wow.
- Oh, thank god. Hey...

944
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,266
You see!

945
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:39,124
It's gonna be alright.

946
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,206
- Anything?
- I got a cigar.

947
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:51,569
Oh, I found... uh,
here some black shoes.

948
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,403
- Are they women shoes?
- I don't know.

949
00:53:54,404 --> 00:53:57,718
- Who's are those?
- That's a men's size 6.

950
00:53:57,737 --> 00:53:59,097
That's weird.

951
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:00,509
Oh, is this snake skin?

952
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,556
Oh, come on. Ooohhh...

953
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:04,917
- It's a used condom, Alan.
- Oh, God...

954
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:07,909
Get it outta the car.

955
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,004
Come on, Alan.
God-damn it!

956
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:12,017
I got that shit on me now.

957
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:14,395
Jesus Fucking Christ.

958
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:16,955
Get it out.
Fuck!

959
00:54:17,775 --> 00:54:19,854
Oh, my god.

960
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:21,533
All Right.
What the fuck, man?

961
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:23,933
We gotta get this shit
together, guys.

962
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:27,600
What was that?

963
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,264
It's in the trunk.

964
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:31,991
Doug's in the trunk.

965
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:33,904
No, shit.

966
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:35,004
Holy shit.

967
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:38,039
- Open it! Open it!
- Okay.

968
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,992
- Stop! Please stop.
- Stop!

969
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:50,992
- Okay.
- Stop! Stop!

970
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:56,955
Whoa... I'm with you.
I'm with you.

971
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,815
You gonna fuck on me?

972
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,992
Nobody's gonna fuck on you.

973
00:54:59,993 --> 00:55:01,085
We're on your side.

974
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:03,385
I hate Godzilla.
I hate him too.

975
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:05,189
I hate him.
He destroys cities.

976
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,827
Please.

977
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:10,910
This isn't your fault.
I'll get you some pants.

978
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:18,174
What the fuck was that?

979
00:55:20,348 --> 00:55:21,916
I've got internal bleeding.

980
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:24,165
Please call 911.

981
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:30,788
That's some fucked up shit.
Who was that guy? He's so mean.

982
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,019
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

983
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:40,390
Last night on the roof,
before we went out...

984
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:44,416
I slipped something
in our Jägermeister.

985
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,075
What?

986
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,633
I'm... I'm sorry.
I fuged up, guys.

987
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:50,924
You drugged us?

988
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:54,907
No, I... I didn't drug you.
I was told it was ecstasy.

989
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:57,656
Who told you it was ecstasy?

990
00:55:58,195 --> 00:56:00,319
The guy I bought it from
at the liquor store.

991
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,028
Why would you give us ecstasy?

992
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,692
Because I wanted everybody
to have a good time...

993
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,733
and I knew you guys
wouldn't take it.

994
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:07,033
It was just one hit each.

995
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:09,342
I used to do 3 hits at night.

996
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:12,759
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan.
It was roofies.

997
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,132
You think I knew that, Stu?

998
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:18,030
The guy I bought it from seemed like
he was a real straight shooter.

999
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:21,671
I'm sorry. You mean the drug dealer
at the liquor store wasn't a good guy?

1000
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:24,069
- Let's just calm down.
- You fucking calm down.

1001
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,185
He drugged us. I lost a tooth.
I married a whore.

1002
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:30,017
How dare you.
She's a nice lady.

1003
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:33,349
- You're such a fucking moron.
- Your language is offensive.

1004
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,879
Fuck you.

1005
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,194
Alright, let's just take
a deep breath, okay?

1006
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,405
Alright, seriously,
this is a good thing, guys.

1007
00:56:40,406 --> 00:56:42,164
At least not some stranger
drugged us...

1008
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,964
- for god knows what reason.
- Yeah...

1009
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:47,369
Yeah, you're right, Phil.
It's totally a good thing.

1010
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:50,047
We're so much better off now.

1011
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:54,209
Here's something, I would
like to remind you two of.

1012
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:58,876
Our best friend, Doug, is probably
face down in a ditch right now...

1013
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:01,970
With a meth head,
butt-fucking his corpse.

1014
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,029
- That's highly unlikely.
- It's true.

1015
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,597
That doesn't help.

1016
00:57:05,598 --> 00:57:07,597
Alright, let's get
our shit together, guys.

1017
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:11,782
Let's go back to the hotel and
I'm gonna make a couple calls...

1018
00:57:11,783 --> 00:57:13,828
Maybe Doug's back there.
Maybe he's asleep.

1019
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:15,994
Come on!
Let's go.

1020
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,616
Stu, a little help?

1021
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:20,474
Shut up.

1022
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:26,863
Oh, god.
Oh, god, are you okay?

1023
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,663
Alan, I'm sorry.

1024
00:57:39,563 --> 00:57:42,728
Wait, guys. Guys...
what about the tiger?

1025
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:44,997
- What if he got out?
- Oh, fuck...

1026
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:47,666
I keep forgetting about
the god damned tiger.

1027
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:50,748
How the fuck
did he get in there?

1028
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:53,614
I don't know.
Because I don't remember.

1029
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:56,152
Shh... Stu,
just keep it down.

1030
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:59,593
One of the side-effects of...
uh, roofies, is memory loss.

1031
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:04,013
You're literally
too stupid to insult.

1032
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,610
- Thank you.
- Hey!

1033
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:13,072
Hey, come on.

1034
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,298
Did we leave the music on?

1035
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:21,298
Hey.
Shh...

1036
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:24,435
Don't make any sudden moves.

1037
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,235
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

1038
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:31,508
Quiet, quiet!

1039
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:36,995
- Mike Tyson?
- Shh...

1040
00:58:37,175 --> 00:58:39,479
This is my favorite
part coming in right here.

1041
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:48,223
¶ I can feel it coming
through the air tonight. ¶

1042
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,517
The chorus line, guys.

1043
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:51,432
¶ Oh, Lord. ¶

1044
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:58,082
¶ 'Cause I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life. ¶

1045
00:58:58,083 --> 00:58:59,380
One more time, guys.

1046
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,915
¶ Oh, Lord. ¶

1047
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,868
Oh, Jesus.

1048
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:05,915
Oh, fuck.
Oh...

1049
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:07,887
Why did you do that?

1050
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:11,770
Mr. Tyson would like to know why
is his tiger in your bathroom.

1051
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:14,762
Hold on, hold on. That was
completely unnecessary.

1052
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:17,244
I... I'm a huge fan.
When you knocked out Holmes...

1053
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:18,575
... that was...
- Explain.

1054
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:20,368
Hey, look...

1055
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:23,151
We were drugged last night,
we have no memory of what happened.

1056
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:26,462
It's true. We got into all
kinds of trouble last night.

1057
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:28,326
And now we can't find our friend.

1058
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:31,658
And if you wanna kill us, just go ahead,
because I don't even care anymore.

1059
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:33,672
- Stu, what're you talking about?
- What? I don't care.

1060
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:35,815
Why the fuck would you
wanna steal his tiger?

1061
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:39,257
We tend to do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

1062
00:59:39,779 --> 00:59:41,453
I don't believe
this guy anymore.

1063
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:43,427
Wait a minute,
how did you guys find us?

1064
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:45,172
One of you dropped your jacket,

1065
00:59:45,174 --> 00:59:47,372
found it in the
tiger's cage this morning.

1066
00:59:47,373 --> 00:59:48,733
That's Doug's.

1067
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:50,248
- Yeah, Doug.
- Hm...

1068
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,299
His wallet and his
room keys in there.

1069
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,510
- That's our missing friend.
- I don't give a fuck.

1070
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,527
Whoa...
Did you guys see him?

1071
00:59:56,528 --> 00:59:58,499
- I was vast asleep.
- Yeah, because if he was up...

1072
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,294
this shit wouldn't've
gone down so smoothly.

1073
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:02,827
Maybe the tiger would
ate 'em there like Omar.

1074
01:00:02,828 --> 01:00:04,096
Respect.

1075
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:05,733
What...
what happened to Omar?

1076
01:00:05,734 --> 01:00:07,845
Don't worry about Omar.
He's not with us no more.

1077
01:00:07,846 --> 01:00:09,530
Okay...

1078
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,714
I know this is asking a lot,
but you think there's anyway...

1079
01:00:11,715 --> 01:00:13,741
that we could go to your house
and look around to see...

1080
01:00:13,742 --> 01:00:15,641
if there's any clues
of our friend?

1081
01:00:15,642 --> 01:00:19,339
Absolutely. How else you think we're
gonna get the tiger back anyway?

1082
01:00:20,122 --> 01:00:21,272
Come on, Champ.

1083
01:00:21,547 --> 01:00:22,759
What... I'm sorry?

1084
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:27,345
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.
You brought it here, you bring it back.

1085
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:30,213
What'd you think?
About 40 minutes?

1086
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,769
Don't make me come back for him.

1087
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,845
That was Mike Tyson.

1088
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:40,145
Yeah, no shit
that was Mike Tyson.

1089
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:42,306
I'm just saying,
he's still got it.

1090
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:46,911
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, my God.

1091
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:49,395
Fuck, where did he get him at?
Hey!

1092
01:00:55,658 --> 01:00:57,709
It does not seem fair.

1093
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,668
Rock, paper, scissors.
Nothing more fairer.

1094
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:02,295
Alan should do it.

1095
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:04,347
Alan took a punch
from Mike Tyson.

1096
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,147
Come on, for Doug.

1097
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:08,232
Why are you peppering the steak.

1098
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:10,032
You don't know
if tigers like pepper.

1099
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,679
Tigers love pepper.
They hate cinnamon.

1100
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:18,168
Phil, just do it.
You should do it.

1101
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:22,104
I would, but you lost.
It wouldn't be right.

1102
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:24,828
Okay, I jammed
5 roofies in there.

1103
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:27,128
Just go in there
and throw it to him.

1104
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:30,178
Fine.

1105
01:01:31,361 --> 01:01:33,235
Make sure
he eats the whole thing.

1106
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,835
Fuck.

1107
01:01:44,558 --> 01:01:46,074
Here, kitty.

1108
01:01:47,256 --> 01:01:51,111
Hey, sweety. It's okay.
Here's a little snack for you.

1109
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:54,318
Real important that you
to eat this, okay?

1110
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:57,641
Have a little...

1111
01:02:04,098 --> 01:02:05,383
What'd we do now?

1112
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,840
We wait.

1113
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:24,655
¶ What do tigers dream off when
they take a little tiger snooze. ¶

1114
01:02:24,656 --> 01:02:31,887
¶ Do they dream of mauling zebras or
Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit. ¶

1115
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:36,036
¶ Don't you worry, you pretty
striped-head we're gonna... ¶

1116
01:02:36,037 --> 01:02:39,188
¶ get you back to Tyson
and your cozy tiger bed. ¶

1117
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:42,680
¶ And then we're gonna
find our best friend Doug... ¶

1118
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:46,137
¶ and then we're gonna give
him a best friend hug. ¶

1119
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:53,685
¶ Doug, Doug, oh.. Doug,
Dougie-Doug, Doug. ¶

1120
01:02:54,999 --> 01:03:00,953
¶ But if he's been murdered
by crystal meth tweakers... ¶

1121
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:04,286
¶ well then we're
shit outta luck. ¶

1122
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,589
At the end
we're all gonna die.

1123
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,857
Watch it.

1124
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,809
That's his nose.

1125
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,658
Hey guys, when's the next
Haley's comet?

1126
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,148
- Who cares, man.
- Do you know, Stu?

1127
01:03:46,676 --> 01:03:49,869
I don't think it's for another
60 years or something.

1128
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,183
- It's not tonight, right?
- No. I don't think so.

1129
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:54,892
But you don't know for sure?

1130
01:03:54,893 --> 01:03:56,392
No.

1131
01:03:57,216 --> 01:03:59,715
I got this cousin Marcus who saw
one, he said it blew his mind.

1132
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:02,881
I wanna make sure I'll never ever
miss out on a Hailie's comet.

1133
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:05,332
So if you guys now
there's gonna be one...

1134
01:04:07,882 --> 01:04:09,932
Stop the car.
He's getting all excited,

1135
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:18,137
- Stop the car.
- We gotta get out.

1136
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:20,332
Get outta the car.

1137
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,032
Fuck.

1138
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:25,933
Look out.

1139
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:28,078
- Oh, my god.
- He's suppose be unconscious.

1140
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,205
Stu, Stu he got me.

1141
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:32,939
Oh, You got clawed.
You're bleeding.

1142
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:39,639
Oh, my god.

1143
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,139
Okay, okay, okay.

1144
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,320
- I can't do it.
- Get your fuckin' hand in there.

1145
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:55,751
- You're steering the car.
- I'm too nervous.

1146
01:04:55,752 --> 01:04:59,146
Alan, we need you, buddy.
It's your time to shine, okay?

1147
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:00,846
Okay, yeah.

1148
01:05:01,223 --> 01:05:02,504
My dad's gonna kill me.

1149
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:03,923
That's it.
That's good.

1150
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:06,635
Keep it straight.

1151
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:16,988
You're late.

1152
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:19,379
Whatever, man. We've been
pushin' the last mile.

1153
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:22,586
Come on in. Mike's got
something he wants to show you.

1154
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:30,194
He's outta control, man.
You gotta put it down.

1155
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:35,866
When we got back, we took a
look at the security cameras.

1156
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:36,942
Great.

1157
01:05:42,114 --> 01:05:45,620
- Oh, it's Doug.
- Oh, thank god he's alive.

1158
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:48,168
That's our buddy, that's...
that's who we've been missing.

1159
01:05:48,169 --> 01:05:50,426
- We're friends, that's great.
- We're all best friends.

1160
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:53,210
Why don't you just pay attention.
I don't have all night.

1161
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:54,678
Yeah, of course, of course.

1162
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:00,876
That's me. I'm on TV.

1163
01:06:01,105 --> 01:06:03,069
I've never been on TV before.

1164
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:06,972
Really?
Really, Alan?

1165
01:06:10,283 --> 01:06:11,857
Yeah, I... uh...

1166
01:06:13,283 --> 01:06:15,657
<i>You're gonna overflow
the pool, old man.</i>

1167
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,100
Should, maybe I...
should I wait outside?

1168
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,964
- I think that's a good idea.
- Yep.

1169
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:25,479
Don't touch anything
out there either.

1170
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:29,921
You know, he... he's not our good...
We don't know him that well.

1171
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:37,101
By the way, man, where did
you get that cop car from?

1172
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:40,064
We... uh, stole it
from these dumb-ass cops.

1173
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:42,809
Nice.
Nice.

1174
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,034
High five there.

1175
01:06:46,384 --> 01:06:48,567
That's nice.

1176
01:06:48,568 --> 01:06:51,108
You know I just have to say,
I've never seen...

1177
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:54,108
a more beautiful, elegant,
just regal creature.

1178
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:56,618
<i>- Check it out, Stu.
- Fuck this tiger.</i>

1179
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:58,907
Oh, my god.
It's awful.

1180
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:04,653
Who does shit like that, man?

1181
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:07,078
Someone who has a lot
of issues obviously.

1182
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,474
I'm a sick man.

1183
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,071
That's all we got.

1184
01:07:14,713 --> 01:07:18,395
This was,
hugely helpful, really.

1185
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:19,542
Because now we know...

1186
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:24,002
that our buddy Doug was with us
at 3:30 totally alive.

1187
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:26,264
Thanks again, champ.
And... uh...

1188
01:07:26,265 --> 01:07:29,907
again, we are... so sorry
we stole your tiger.

1189
01:07:29,908 --> 01:07:31,036
No, don't worry about it, man.

1190
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:33,936
Like you said, we all do
dumb shit when we're fucked up.

1191
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:38,747
I did say that.

1192
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:45,236
You know, everyone says
Mike Tyson is such a badass,

1193
01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:47,839
but... I think he's
kind of a sweetheart.

1194
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,810
Well, I think he's mean.

1195
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:51,250
Alright...

1196
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:53,950
I think it's officially
time we call Tracy.

1197
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:58,043
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says
something that make sense.

1198
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:00,026
I mean, we don't have much
of a choice. And who knows...

1199
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:01,129
maybe she's heard from Doug.

1200
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,842
That's what I've been
saying this whole time.

1201
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:06,836
We just need to be completely
honest and tell her everything.

1202
01:08:09,264 --> 01:08:10,770
We don't have
to tell her everything.

1203
01:08:10,771 --> 01:08:12,881
I mean, we can leave out
the stuff about me...

1204
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:14,981
marrying... a hooker.

1205
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:16,766
Just stay focus on Doug.

1206
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,050
What am I gonna tell my dad
about this car?

1207
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:21,077
Alan, relax. It's just
the inside. Come on

1208
01:08:21,078 --> 01:08:23,366
I got a guy in L.A
who's great with interior.

1209
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:37,473
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my god.

1210
01:08:41,596 --> 01:08:42,692
Are you guys okay?

1211
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:55,222
I know that guy.
That's the guy from the trunk.

1212
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:59,662
Get outta the car, please.

1213
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:03,176
Oh boy, look those are the guys
that shot Eddie.

1214
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:06,176
- Buddy, let's go.
- Okay,

1215
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:12,876
- Move.
- Alright, alright.

1216
01:09:12,877 --> 01:09:14,976
That's enough.
Ow..

1217
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:24,676
Take it easy, take it easy.

1218
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,565
I want my purse back,
assholes.

1219
01:09:31,073 --> 01:09:34,219
- What? Your purse?
- That's not a purse, it's a satchel.

1220
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,993
It's a purse, okay?

1221
01:09:35,994 --> 01:09:38,938
And you steal from wrong guy.

1222
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,101
Wait a second, wait a second.
We stole from you?

1223
01:09:42,102 --> 01:09:43,248
Okay, you know what?

1224
01:09:43,249 --> 01:09:46,738
We don't remember anything
that happened last night.

1225
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:48,915
So help us out a little here.

1226
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,617
Well, apparently, you guys met
at a crab table late last night.

1227
01:09:52,618 --> 01:09:55,917
You're on your real heater
when you played your hot streak.

1228
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:57,760
You ended up winning
just under 80 grand.

1229
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,694
No shit. 80 grand. Nice.

1230
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,816
That's good.

1231
01:10:01,074 --> 01:10:04,184
You put the chips in his purse,
and then you guys took off with it.

1232
01:10:04,185 --> 01:10:05,722
That doesn't sound like us.

1233
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:09,522
Mine had
80 thousand dollars inside.

1234
01:10:09,858 --> 01:10:12,017
And this one?
Nothing.

1235
01:10:12,018 --> 01:10:13,924
Hey, there's skittles
in there.

1236
01:10:17,771 --> 01:10:20,244
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child.

1237
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:22,355
He's funny because he's fat.

1238
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:25,737
Now look, this was obviously
a very simple misunderstanding.

1239
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,871
Alan picked up the wrong purse,
it's no big deal.

1240
01:10:28,872 --> 01:10:32,997
Hey, if it's no big deal,
why when I come after you guys...

1241
01:10:32,998 --> 01:10:36,897
he starts screaming like crazy,
and throw me in trunk, huh?

1242
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:38,324
What? I did that?

1243
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:42,259
Yeah, you said he was your lucky charm,
and you wanna take him home with you.

1244
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:46,446
- Lucky charm.
- Hey, that's just funny.

1245
01:10:47,187 --> 01:10:49,838
Oh... fuck you.

1246
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:55,377
If you want to see your friend again,
you get me my 80 grand.

1247
01:10:55,378 --> 01:10:56,769
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, our friend?

1248
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,495
- You have Doug?
- You mean some other friend?

1249
01:10:58,496 --> 01:10:59,995
What?

1250
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:02,737
- Doug.
- Doug.

1251
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,487
Chill out, Goatie.

1252
01:11:09,488 --> 01:11:11,124
Okay, okay,
alright, fine, fine.

1253
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,107
What do you want?

1254
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:15,729
Ah... not so good now.

1255
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,611
- Douchebag.
- What?

1256
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:20,663
Look, we're very sorry,
but this is an easy fix.

1257
01:11:20,664 --> 01:11:22,920
- Alan, where's his purse?
- I don't know.

1258
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:24,503
What'd you mean? You said it
was in the hotel room, right?

1259
01:11:24,504 --> 01:11:26,618
- Yeah, we can get it.
- We can get you your purse.

1260
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:28,710
You know what? We can even
write you check, right now.

1261
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:30,363
No check. Cash only.

1262
01:11:30,364 --> 01:11:32,086
He's a person in there.

1263
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,084
Boring.

1264
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:35,927
Take nap. Come on.

1265
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:38,987
- Wait, wai, wai, wait.
- You can't...

1266
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:42,591
You can't kidnap our friend.
Kidnapper!

1267
01:11:44,622 --> 01:11:46,813
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Stop.

1268
01:11:47,922 --> 01:11:50,013
Stop.
Run me over.

1269
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,413
- Okay.
- Whoa.

1270
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:58,991
Bring money to Big Rock
in Mojave Desert, at dawn.

1271
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:04,368
- What?
- Tooddle-loo, mothafucka...

1272
01:12:05,895 --> 01:12:08,343
At least take the bag
off his head.

1273
01:12:08,344 --> 01:12:09,943
Fuck!

1274
01:12:21,102 --> 01:12:22,470
Fuck, get outta here fucker.

1275
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:31,306
Guys, I'm telling you I looked
for it this morning before we left.

1276
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:32,540
It's not anywhere.

1277
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:34,716
Fuck.

1278
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:39,116
Stu, how much
you got in the bank?

1279
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:42,104
About 10 grand, maybe more.
I was gonna use it for the wedding.

1280
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:44,292
Well, you're already married.
So we're good there.

1281
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,344
Besides not for Melissa.
She's the worst.

1282
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:49,105
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex
with a pilot or somethin' like that.

1283
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:53,020
It was a bartender on a cruise.
What is wrong with you, people.

1284
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:56,590
Ooh, Alan, did you just eat
sofa pizza?

1285
01:12:56,591 --> 01:12:57,912
Yes.

1286
01:12:58,752 --> 01:13:00,873
What're we gonna do?
We are so fucked.

1287
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:03,044
Hey, guys...

1288
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:04,706
- You find it?
- Nope.

1289
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,645
But check this out.

1290
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:56,744
Change only.
Ten thousand

1291
01:14:00,962 --> 01:14:03,600
Hey... uh,
these seats taken?

1292
01:14:03,618 --> 01:14:04,805
No, feel free.

1293
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,258
All right!
Let's play some blackjack.

1294
01:14:33,915 --> 01:14:35,320
That's it.

1295
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:37,292
Shut up, Vincent.

1296
01:14:44,124 --> 01:14:45,306
I'll stay.

1297
01:14:45,307 --> 01:14:47,595
Oh, fuck you.
Fuck you.

1298
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,853
Splitting fives.

1299
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:57,729
Too many.

1300
01:15:01,717 --> 01:15:04,961
I don't even know you. But I'm
gonna tell you, that's dumb.

1301
01:15:07,062 --> 01:15:10,547
Hey, c'mon. He can't lose.
He can't lose.

1302
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:14,304
I think the pit boss
is watching him.

1303
01:15:31,012 --> 01:15:33,356
- Oh... oh. my God.
- Are you okay?

1304
01:15:33,377 --> 01:15:37,342
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous
when I gamble. I'm so silly.

1305
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:40,266
Hold on a... beet, okay?

1306
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:43,038
Let's just take it easy.
This is my wife.

1307
01:15:43,101 --> 01:15:45,058
Is it hurting?
Does it hurt?

1308
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:46,983
- Oh... ow...
- You alright?

1309
01:15:46,984 --> 01:15:48,810
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

1310
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:52,240
- I think you're fine. Let's go.
- Really? okay.

1311
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:57,043
Sorry. She's had a little
too much drink.

1312
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,411
Thanks, buddy.
That's for you.

1313
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:11,129
And 100, 200, 300, 400.

1314
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:14,908
Oh, with all of this,
that's 82,400.00 dollars.

1315
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:18,444
God damn it.
I don't fucking believe it.

1316
01:16:18,445 --> 01:16:21,131
- Alan, you're the man.
- You are too, Phil.

1317
01:16:21,692 --> 01:16:24,237
We should come back next week.
Take the whole city down.

1318
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,807
I'm free next week.

1319
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:29,388
Or we could just focus on
getting Doug back, right now.

1320
01:16:29,635 --> 01:16:31,336
Hey, you know what?
Next week is no good for me.

1321
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,986
The Jonas Brothers
are in town.

1322
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,767
But any week after that,
it's totally fine.

1323
01:16:35,768 --> 01:16:38,918
I think it's safe to say that our luck
has officially turned around, guys.

1324
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,747
We are back, baby.

1325
01:16:40,748 --> 01:16:42,461
We're fuckin' back.

1326
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:44,824
We're back.
Classic.

1327
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:48,454
¶ We are back.
Yes, we are back. ¶

1328
01:16:48,455 --> 01:16:51,032
¶ We are getting Doug back. ¶

1329
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:54,130
¶ And we're the 3 best friends
that anybody could have. ¶

1330
01:16:54,131 --> 01:17:00,437
¶ We're the 3 best friends
that anyone could have. ¶

1331
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:03,949
¶ And we'll never, ever, ever,
ever, ever, leave each other. ¶

1332
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,941
¶ We're the best 3 friend
that anybody could have. ¶

1333
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:11,884
¶ We're the 3 best friend
that anybody could have. ¶

1334
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:32,476
Now what?

1335
01:17:32,477 --> 01:17:33,635
Give him the signal.

1336
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:34,655
What signal.

1337
01:17:34,656 --> 01:17:36,751
Flash your lights.
Let him know it's on.

1338
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,560
What's on?

1339
01:17:38,561 --> 01:17:41,322
- The deal.
- Of course it's on.

1340
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,309
We just drove 30 miles into
the desert, he knows it's on.

1341
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:45,902
Phil, just do something.

1342
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:48,446
Fine.

1343
01:17:52,885 --> 01:17:53,979
See?

1344
01:17:54,063 --> 01:17:55,715
Alright, let's go.

1345
01:18:08,761 --> 01:18:11,383
That funny fat guy,
fall on face.

1346
01:18:11,384 --> 01:18:13,011
You okay?

1347
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:16,196
Alright, we got the money.
80 grand in cash.

1348
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:18,610
Throw it over.
Then I give you Doug.

1349
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,664
Um... I'm sorry.
First of all...

1350
01:18:20,665 --> 01:18:23,638
good morning, we didn't
catch your name last night.

1351
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:26,729
Mr. Chow.
Leslie Chow.

1352
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:29,732
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure,
my name's Stu. And...

1353
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:34,298
we would very much appreciate
an opportunity to see Doug...

1354
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:37,280
before we give you the money,
just to verify that he's okay.

1355
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:39,480
If that's...
if that's cool?

1356
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,065
Of course, Stu. That is cool.

1357
01:18:53,338 --> 01:18:54,403
Okay.

1358
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:59,369
See? He fine, now,
give me money or I shoot him...

1359
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:02,067
And I shoot
all you motherfuckers.

1360
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:06,028
And then we take it.
Your choice, bitches.

1361
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,440
- Give him the money, Stu.
- Okay.

1362
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:20,104
- It's all there.
- Let him go.

1363
01:19:23,527 --> 01:19:25,476
Alright, take it easy.

1364
01:19:26,673 --> 01:19:28,059
Ta-da.

1365
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:31,462
Is this some kinda a joke?
Who the hell is this?

1366
01:19:31,463 --> 01:19:32,721
That is not Doug.

1367
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:35,720
What're you talking about,
willies? That him.

1368
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:38,833
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
That's not our friend.

1369
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:41,508
The Doug we're looking
for is a white.

1370
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:45,885
I told you you had the
wrong guy, little boy.

1371
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:48,865
Damn, Alan. What the fuck
you got me into?

1372
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:49,962
You know him?

1373
01:19:49,963 --> 01:19:52,481
Yeah. This is the guy who sold
me the bad drugs. How you doin'?

1374
01:19:52,482 --> 01:19:54,668
I didn't sell you
no fuckin' bad drugs.

1375
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:57,861
Wait... he sold you
the roo... the roofilin?

1376
01:19:57,862 --> 01:19:59,761
Roofilin? What're you
talking about roofilin?...

1377
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,145
Who gives a shit!
Where is Doug?

1378
01:20:02,146 --> 01:20:03,875
I am Doug.

1379
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:07,149
- Your name is Doug?
- Yeah, yes, I'm Doug.

1380
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,591
His name is Doug too.
Classic mixed up.

1381
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:10,677
Come on.

1382
01:20:10,678 --> 01:20:13,535
Hey, Chow!
You gave us the wrong Doug.

1383
01:20:13,536 --> 01:20:16,296
- Not my problem.
- Look, fuck that shit.

1384
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:18,775
Now, you give us our 80 grand back
and take him with you.

1385
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:20,475
No. Come on, man.
I'll be your Doug.

1386
01:20:20,476 --> 01:20:23,841
Oh, yeah. Okay.
I take him back. Uh...

1387
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:27,187
right after you suck on
these little Chinese nuts.

1388
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:28,952
Oh, that's nasty.

1389
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:30,860
How that sound?

1390
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:34,449
So long, gay boys.

1391
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,832
Wait a second.

1392
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:38,083
He's a nasty
little motherfucker.

1393
01:20:38,152 --> 01:20:41,424
- Can you get us any ecstasy?
- I have no fucking ecstasy.

1394
01:20:41,862 --> 01:20:43,251
God-damn it!

1395
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,097
Gosh-darn it!

1396
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:46,145
Shit!

1397
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:47,560
Shoot!

1398
01:20:57,491 --> 01:20:58,700
Hello.

1399
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:00,133
Tracy, it's Phil.

1400
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:03,421
Phil, where the hell are
you guys. I'm freaking out.

1401
01:21:09,737 --> 01:21:11,761
Thanks for the lift
back to town.

1402
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,457
- I got a question for you.
- What's that?

1403
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:17,341
How did you wind up
in Chow's car?

1404
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:20,538
That crazy asshole
kidnapped me yesterday.

1405
01:21:20,539 --> 01:21:22,776
Okay, but why?
I mean, why you?

1406
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:26,719
Cuz he thought I was with you guys,
cuz we all hangin' over at the Bellagio.

1407
01:21:26,776 --> 01:21:28,673
What?
We were at the Bellagio?

1408
01:21:28,674 --> 01:21:30,503
Yeah. We were shooting crabs.
You don't remember?

1409
01:21:30,504 --> 01:21:34,728
No! No We don't remember.
Because some dick drug dealer...

1410
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:37,977
sold him roofilin
and told him it was ecstasy.

1411
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:40,220
Roofilin. There you go
with that word, roofilin.

1412
01:21:40,221 --> 01:21:42,520
Roofilin, what the hell
is a roofilin?

1413
01:21:42,521 --> 01:21:47,221
Wow... you are the world's
shittiest drug dealer.

1414
01:21:47,222 --> 01:21:53,188
Roofilin, for your information, is the
date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.

1415
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:56,491
Oh, shit, I must've mixed up
the bag, my fault, Alan.

1416
01:21:56,492 --> 01:21:59,912
Damn, Marsha's gonna be
pissed off with me on that one.

1417
01:21:59,913 --> 01:22:01,685
Whatever.

1418
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:03,883
It's funny, cuz just
the other day, me and my boy...

1419
01:22:03,884 --> 01:22:06,381
we was wonderin' why they
even call 'em roofies.

1420
01:22:06,382 --> 01:22:07,804
You know
what I'm talking about?

1421
01:22:07,805 --> 01:22:10,075
No... don't know
what you're talking about.

1422
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:12,240
Why not floories, right?
Cuz when you take 'em...

1423
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:15,858
you more likely to end up
on the floor than the roof.

1424
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:17,806
What about groundies?

1425
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:19,806
That's a good
new name for 'em.

1426
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:21,223
Or, how about rapies?

1427
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:24,390
- Wait, what'd you just say?
- Rapies.

1428
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:26,701
Not you, Doug,
what did you say before?

1429
01:22:26,702 --> 01:22:28,138
I said groundies.

1430
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:30,168
No, before that.
You said...

1431
01:22:30,169 --> 01:22:34,873
you're more likely to wind up
on the floor, than...

1432
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:36,761
- Phil!
- Listen, Trace,

1433
01:22:36,762 --> 01:22:38,161
I'm really sorry, I was...

1434
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,241
Hello?

1435
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:43,086
Tracy, it's Stu.

1436
01:22:43,087 --> 01:22:45,513
Stu, talk to me.
What's going on?

1437
01:22:45,514 --> 01:22:49,099
Uh, nothing, don't listen to Phil,
he's completely out of his mind.

1438
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,167
He's probably still
drunk from last night.

1439
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,480
Where's Doug?

1440
01:22:52,513 --> 01:22:56,429
He is... paying the bill. We just
had a delicious brunch and, uh...

1441
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,181
we're in a big hurry to get
back so we gotta get going.

1442
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,601
- Okay, we'll see you soon, bye.
- Stu?

1443
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:01,991
Stu!

1444
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:04,639
What the fuck, man?

1445
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,649
I know where Doug is.

1446
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:15,632
I don't know, man.
It just hit me.

1447
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:18,454
Do you remember when we saw Doug's
mattress impaled on that statue?

1448
01:23:18,455 --> 01:23:19,986
Yeah, it's because he
threw it out the window.

1449
01:23:19,987 --> 01:23:23,007
No, it's impossible, you can't
open windows in Vegas hotel.

1450
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,764
Then how did it get...

1451
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:26,134
Oh, my god!

1452
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,623
Wait, wait,
what's goin' on?

1453
01:23:28,624 --> 01:23:30,223
Doug was trying
to signal someone.

1454
01:23:30,224 --> 01:23:33,073
Holy shit.
How'd you figure that out?

1455
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:34,864
Doug made me realize it.

1456
01:23:34,865 --> 01:23:36,953
- Doug?
- Uh, not our Doug, black Doug.

1457
01:23:36,954 --> 01:23:39,754
- Hey, easy with that shit, c'mon.
- Sorry.

1458
01:23:39,755 --> 01:23:42,306
Okay, can someone tell me
where white Doug is?

1459
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:43,374
He's on the roof, Alan.

1460
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,828
Yes, he's on the roof, we must've
taken him up there on his mattress...

1461
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:48,790
as a prank,
so he'll wake up on the roof.

1462
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:50,619
Like that time in summer camp.
Remember when we moved...

1463
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,219
his sleeping bag out
in the jetty on the lake?

1464
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,700
Which was hillarious.

1465
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,888
This is not so funny now, though,
cuz we forgot where we put him.

1466
01:23:57,889 --> 01:23:59,985
You guys are fuckin' retarded.
You know that?

1467
01:23:59,986 --> 01:24:02,889
Holy shit. You think
he's still up there?

1468
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:04,516
There's only one way
to find out.

1469
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:11,681
Doug.

1470
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:13,425
- Doug.
- Doug.

1471
01:24:13,426 --> 01:24:15,381
Doug, you up here, buddy?

1472
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:20,387
Where you at, Doug?

1473
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:31,847
Hey, guys!
He's over here.

1474
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:35,376
Phil, we've found him,
he's over here.

1475
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:40,989
He's okay.

1476
01:24:41,084 --> 01:24:43,206
You're okay?

1477
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:45,863
Oh, my god, we gotta go, buddy.
Come on.

1478
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:48,423
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

1479
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,627
- He's alright.
- What the fuck is going on?

1480
01:24:52,628 --> 01:24:55,575
We can explain everything,
but right now we gotta go.

1481
01:24:55,576 --> 01:24:57,430
Hey, bud. You okay?

1482
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,469
No... not okay.

1483
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,089
You look good, you got
some color. I'm jealous.

1484
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:04,460
I'm getting married today.

1485
01:25:04,461 --> 01:25:08,109
Yes, you are, that's why you need
to focus and do everything we say.

1486
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,963
Because frankly, you're wasting
a little bit of time right now.

1487
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:13,766
You fucking asshole!

1488
01:25:14,815 --> 01:25:17,947
Oh, my skin burns,
my skin burns.

1489
01:25:18,957 --> 01:25:21,232
- It's okay.
- It's not your fault, Doug.

1490
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:24,753
Don't touch me. Shut up!
All of you shut up.

1491
01:25:25,702 --> 01:25:27,680
Just get me home.

1492
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,424
Just get me home.

1493
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,742
What about the one after that?

1494
01:25:33,847 --> 01:25:36,405
You cannot be serious.

1495
01:25:37,668 --> 01:25:41,355
Oh, god-damn it.
Every flight to L.A is booked.

1496
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:43,024
- What about into the Burbank?
- It's already sold out.

1497
01:25:43,025 --> 01:25:45,293
Fuck, we can't drive there.
The wedding starts...

1498
01:25:45,294 --> 01:25:47,561
- in 3 and a half hours.
- Alan, where's the car?

1499
01:25:47,562 --> 01:25:48,959
It's on its way.

1500
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,252
You know what?

1501
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:54,252
We can drive there.
We can make it, okay?

1502
01:25:57,143 --> 01:25:59,071
Just...
give me one second.

1503
01:25:59,207 --> 01:26:00,997
We will leave without you.

1504
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:07,335
- Is he missing a tooth?
- Yeah.

1505
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,684
- Hey.
- Hey.

1506
01:26:09,685 --> 01:26:12,218
Hey, thanks for helping out
last night, that was so awesome.

1507
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:13,719
Sure.

1508
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:17,204
Listen, Jade...
I...

1509
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:20,761
You don't have to say it.
I totally understand.

1510
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:23,549
This whole thing was...
stupid.

1511
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:24,849
Ohh...

1512
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:27,010
It was stupid, wasn't it?

1513
01:26:34,103 --> 01:26:35,322
This is yours.

1514
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:39,917
Oh, thank you. I can't believe I gave
my grandmother's holocaust ring...

1515
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:42,916
to someone I just met.
What was I thinking?

1516
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:45,767
- You were really fucked up.
- Clearly.

1517
01:26:46,867 --> 01:26:48,835
You did pull out
your own tooth.

1518
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:51,780
I pulled out my tooth?

1519
01:26:52,686 --> 01:26:54,885
Why did I
pull out my own tooth?

1520
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,894
Well, Alan bet you,
that you weren't...

1521
01:26:56,895 --> 01:26:59,609
a good enough dentist
to pull out your own tooth.

1522
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,496
O... kay... huh...
Of course he did.

1523
01:27:04,769 --> 01:27:06,005
You won.

1524
01:27:06,943 --> 01:27:09,910
Yeah, clearly... yeah.

1525
01:27:09,911 --> 01:27:12,592
That's victory, right there.

1526
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:13,694
It needs to go down.

1527
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,441
- Alan, it's good.
- No. Safety first.

1528
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:17,869
Alan, it's fine.
It's down.

1529
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:20,584
No, it isn't,
let's get it down first.

1530
01:27:22,426 --> 01:27:24,055
Don't mess the car up.

1531
01:27:24,056 --> 01:27:25,647
You're messing the car up.

1532
01:27:26,076 --> 01:27:27,584
What're you doing
next weekend?

1533
01:27:27,585 --> 01:27:29,658
I don't know.
Working. Why?

1534
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,306
Well. 'cause I was thinking,
maybe I was gonna come back...

1535
01:27:31,307 --> 01:27:33,006
and take you out to dinner
or something.

1536
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:35,597
Really? Like a date?

1537
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:40,108
Yeah, like a date. Only one
that I hope we all remember.

1538
01:27:41,096 --> 01:27:42,410
Sounds great.

1539
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,647
- Stu.
- Stu.

1540
01:27:47,648 --> 01:27:49,431
- Come on.
- Come on.

1541
01:27:51,158 --> 01:27:52,348
I gotta go.

1542
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:54,677
Okay. Bye.

1543
01:27:57,556 --> 01:27:59,261
- Bye.
- Bye.

1544
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:04,979
Alright, let's go.

1545
01:28:24,988 --> 01:28:27,817
At least the trip
wasn't a total disaster.

1546
01:28:27,818 --> 01:28:29,304
What makes you say that?

1547
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:32,054
When I woke up on the roof,
I happened to find...

1548
01:28:32,055 --> 01:28:35,441
80,000 dollars worth of
Bellagio chips in my pocket.

1549
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:37,393
Oh, my god.

1550
01:28:37,471 --> 01:28:40,411
Looks like we're going home
with some money, boys.

1551
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,141
Here he comes.
That's him.

1552
01:29:02,649 --> 01:29:05,902
- Hey, Victor.
- Hey, what's up, Alan?

1553
01:29:08,796 --> 01:29:11,662
- Whoa, look out!
- Oh, shit.

1554
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:19,084
- Thanks, Vic.
- Adios.

1555
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:21,780
- Who the hell was that guy?
- That's my buddy.

1556
01:29:57,124 --> 01:29:58,778
Hey.

1557
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:02,167
Sorry, map quest took us on a
really crazy route.

1558
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:26,347
- How's my hair?
- It's good.

1559
01:30:26,348 --> 01:30:28,539
Is it cool like Phil's?

1560
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:30,291
It's classic, Phil.

1561
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,263
She looks beautiful, man.

1562
01:30:44,476 --> 01:30:46,429
Sorry I'm late.

1563
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:48,181
Vegas.

1564
01:30:53,202 --> 01:30:57,151
Where were you?
And why are you so red?

1565
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:01,143
Honey, it's a... long story.

1566
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:07,772
We're gathered here today because of
the strength of love and of promises...

1567
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:10,740
All I know is...
I'm so sorry.

1568
01:31:11,546 --> 01:31:13,994
And I promise for as long
as we're married...

1569
01:31:13,995 --> 01:31:18,248
I'll never... ever... put you
through anything like this again.

1570
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,429
Can you forgive me?

1571
01:31:27,346 --> 01:31:30,919
Yeah. Uh-huh. So seductive.

1572
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,354
¶ I take you to the candy shop.
I let you lick the lollipop. ¶

1573
01:31:36,423 --> 01:31:39,147
¶ Go ahead, girl,
don't you stop. ¶

1574
01:31:39,148 --> 01:31:41,857
¶ Keep on going
until you hit the spot. ¶

1575
01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:44,004
¶ You can have it your way. ¶

1576
01:31:44,005 --> 01:31:48,739
¶ How do you want it? Gonna back that
thing up or should I push up on it? ¶

1577
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:51,666
¶ Break it down for you now,
baby it's simple. ¶

1578
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:54,647
¶ You be a nympho,
I be a nympho. ¶

1579
01:31:54,648 --> 01:31:58,098
¶ I got the magic stick.
I'm the love doctor. ¶

1580
01:32:07,553 --> 01:32:09,698
- Daddy!
- Hey, my man.

1581
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,328
Excuse me, but I'm expecting
my husband any minute.

1582
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:13,327
Very funny.

1583
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:16,563
Come here.
How was your soccer game?

1584
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:23,246
¶ Go ahead girl don't you stop, keep
on going until you hit the spot. ¶

1585
01:32:23,368 --> 01:32:26,174
¶ Fuckin' give it to me baby
nice and slow. ¶

1586
01:32:26,175 --> 01:32:29,432
¶ Climb on top ride it
like you're in a rodeo. ¶

1587
01:32:33,616 --> 01:32:35,522
Stu?
You avoiding me?

1588
01:32:35,523 --> 01:32:37,616
Hey, Melissa.

1589
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:40,659
Oh, my god.
What happened to your tooth?

1590
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:44,280
Have you met... Alan?
Tracy's brother.

1591
01:32:44,617 --> 01:32:46,364
Brother in...
Okay.

1592
01:32:46,365 --> 01:32:48,959
That is disgusting.
Why haven't you returned my calls?

1593
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,226
Well, there was a snafu
with it when we stopped...

1594
01:32:52,227 --> 01:32:53,964
I called that bed and
breakfast in Napa...

1595
01:32:53,965 --> 01:32:57,202
they said they had no record
of you even checking in.

1596
01:32:58,462 --> 01:33:00,210
That's because
we didn't go to Napa.

1597
01:33:00,211 --> 01:33:02,752
Stu, what the fuck
is going on?

1598
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:05,598
- We went to Las Vegas.
- Oh, really? Las Vegas?

1599
01:33:05,799 --> 01:33:07,558
Why would you go
to Las Vegas?

1600
01:33:07,559 --> 01:33:09,893
Because my best friend was getting
married and that's what guys do.

1601
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:10,852
- Really?
- Yeah?

1602
01:33:10,853 --> 01:33:12,202
- But that's not what you do!
- Really?

1603
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:16,749
Then why did I do it, huh?
Cause I did it. Riddle me that!

1604
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,639
Why did I do it?
You know sometimes I think...

1605
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,420
all you want me to do
is what you want me to do.

1606
01:33:21,421 --> 01:33:23,306
I'm sick of doing what you
want me to do all the time.

1607
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:25,158
I think in a healthy relationship,
sometimes the guy...

1608
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:26,567
should be able to do
what he wants to do.

1609
01:33:26,568 --> 01:33:28,466
That is now how this works!

1610
01:33:28,467 --> 01:33:32,918
Oh, good! Because whatever
this is, ain't workin' for me.

1611
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:34,286
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1612
01:33:34,287 --> 01:33:35,444
Since when?

1613
01:33:35,445 --> 01:33:39,176
Since you fucked that waiter
on your cruise last June.

1614
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:40,572
Boom!

1615
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,673
I thought it was a bartender.

1616
01:33:44,674 --> 01:33:48,297
Oh, you're right. I stand
corrected. It was a bartender.

1617
01:33:48,298 --> 01:33:50,084
You fucked a bartender.

1618
01:33:50,085 --> 01:33:51,480
You're an idiot.

1619
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:53,457
Yeah, you're, uhhh...

1620
01:33:53,895 --> 01:33:56,392
You're such a bad person.

1621
01:33:56,393 --> 01:33:59,146
Like all the way through
to your core.

1622
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:03,652
Alan, shall we dance?

1623
01:34:04,893 --> 01:34:06,350
Let's do this.

1624
01:34:06,693 --> 01:34:10,327
¶ Hey!
I'm gonna leave forever. ¶

1625
01:34:10,807 --> 01:34:14,045
¶I'm gonna learn
how to fly high. ¶

1626
01:34:14,924 --> 01:34:16,209
It was a real pleasure
meeting you.

1627
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,380
Fuck off.

1628
01:34:18,086 --> 01:34:19,930
I'm thinking about getting
my bartender's license.

1629
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:21,495
Suck my dick.

1630
01:34:21,858 --> 01:34:22,954
No, thank you.

1631
01:34:25,576 --> 01:34:31,300
¶ Remember, remember, remember,
remember my name, babe! ¶

1632
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,724
Dougie, I gotta tell you, man.
That was a gorgeous wedding.

1633
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:46,254
I'll give it 6 months.

1634
01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:47,709
You're a dick.

1635
01:34:48,589 --> 01:34:53,241
I don't know what to say. Thanks,
for the bachelor party, I guess?

1636
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:57,722
Yeah. I just wish we could
actually remember some of it.

1637
01:34:57,934 --> 01:34:59,838
Hey, guys. Look what I found.

1638
01:34:59,839 --> 01:35:01,622
Whoa, that's my camera.

1639
01:35:01,623 --> 01:35:03,747
Yeah, it was lodged
in the back seat of the car.

1640
01:35:03,748 --> 01:35:05,195
Are there photos on it?

1641
01:35:05,196 --> 01:35:07,515
Yeah, some of it is even
worse than we thought.

1642
01:35:07,516 --> 01:35:09,835
- No fuckin' way. Give me that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

1643
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:12,029
Wait, wai, wai, wai,
wai, wait.

1644
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,753
We look at these pictures
together, okay? One time.

1645
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,397
And then we delete
the evidences.

1646
01:35:22,445 --> 01:35:24,251
I say we delete it right now.

1647
01:35:24,252 --> 01:35:25,367
Are you nuts?

1648
01:35:25,368 --> 01:35:27,916
I wanna find out how I wound up
in the hospital. Is that in there?

1649
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:29,155
Yeah, it's in there.

1650
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,011
Guys, one time.

1651
01:35:32,012 --> 01:35:33,585
- Deal?
- Deal.

1652
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:42,862
- Oh, dear Lord!
- That is classic.
