Mr Jacks?

I was wondering if you'd made any decision
regarding the assistant manager's position.

39
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,753
Well, I'm still deciding, and right now,
it's between Stu and yourself.

00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,088
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

Well, I know he's new, but he's also
quite aggressive, and we like that.

42
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,659
You know, Stu's someone who's
not afraid to crunch the numbers

00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,599
and make the tough decisions.

making the tough decisions.

I'll let you know as soon as I decide. Okay?

46

In the meantime, take him through
our loan qualifying procedures,

Sure.

51

And maybe on your way back,
you could pick me up a turkey club?

-Could I get your approval on this?

-This is the loan we talked about before.
-The loan.

Exactly.

I gotta get a new one.

I did.

73
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,694

to my nerdy coin collection.

Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you

00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,644
of their intent to repossess your property
at 325 Brandon Street today.

But this is my home for 30 years.

126
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:32,020
And I make every payment
until the sickness took my eye.

127
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,159
I hope to have more money soon.
I just need a little more time. You...

128
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,596
I don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.

129
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,862
Please. Won't you try?

130
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,038
-Okay.
-Bless you.

131
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,438
Bless you!

132
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,545
CHRISTINE: We have
an elderly woman asking

133
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,114
for an extension on her mortgage payment.

134
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,718
She's on a fixed income,
and she's had some medical problems.

135
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,788
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

136
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,873
MR JACKS: Well, apparently,
we've already granted her two extensions.

137
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,942
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure,
we seize the trapped equity

138
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,480
and the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

139
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,777
We would have to
throw her out of her house.

140
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,579
It's a tough decision.

141
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,252
Your call.

142
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,275
I'll take care of it.

143
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,438
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

144
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,303
but another extension on the loan
is out of the question.

145
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,866
-What?
-I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

146
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,381
No, please, this is my home.
Where will I live?

147
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,447
You list your granddaughter as a reference.
Maybe you could stay with her.

148
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,145
I would not burden her.

149
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,318
And there are several fine assisted
living facilities for the elderly...

150
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:51,227
A nursing home? No, I would
never live in one of those places.

151
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,994
I'm really sorry.

152
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,523
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

153
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,864
and never have I begged for anything.

154
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,265
But now, I beg for you.

155
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,103

while visiting a graveyard?

or consort with those
who practise the black arts?

he didn't really know that much.

He makes a couple
of good guesses, then he...

00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,450
a harvest cake.

535
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,617
Is that something you would make on a farm?

No.

560
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,867
It's good. It's good.
In fact, Christine just got me

561
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,906
a 1929 Standing Liberty quarter at her bank.

562

-Really?
-Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

563
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,408
I just think the job of a bank
teller must be so difficult,

564
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:12,142
with all that counting and repetition.
It must get very tedious.

565
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,443
Yes, you're right,

566
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,714
-but I'm not a teller.
-Oh?

567
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,583
CLAY: Yeah, Mom, I told you.
Christine's a loan officer.

568
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,987
She handles all the loans
for small businesses and homes for her bank.

569
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,618
And she's up for this big
promotion, so... Right, Chris?

570
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,891
If I could close this one account that
I'm working on, it would really help.

571
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,058
That must be a very important loan.

572
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,967
It's the biggest that my branch
has ever handled.

573
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,231
And how did that come to you?

574
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,733
Well, I was reading
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

575
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,106
and came across
this medical supply company

576
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,613
that was looking to expand
but didn't have the liquidity.

577
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,581
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

578
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,414
for restructuring
some of their long-term debt.

579
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,080
Sounds like you've got
a lot going for you, Christine.

580
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:55,023
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

581
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,658
I suppose.

582
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,601
I don't see much of my mother.

583
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,865
-Why is that?
-Wow, Mom, that's... It's kind of personal.

584
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,030
TRUDY: I'm speaking to Christine.

585
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:18,645
Well, ever since my dad died,
she doesn't talk much.

586
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:25,487
She just stays on the farm
and keeps to herself because...

587
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,291
Because?

588
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,124
Because her husband died, Mom,
and she just wants to be by herself.

589
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,290
-Why don't...
-Because my mother's an alcoholic.

590
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,024
Oh.

591
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,026
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.

592
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,802
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

593
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,740
I have to say,
I find your honesty very refreshing.

594
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,979
My father had a drinking problem,
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

595
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:56,083
You've got backbone.

-Alicia.
-She was dreadful, Christine.

600
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,155
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

601
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,357

-They met on the Internet.

-CLAY: What is that,

603
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,658
-"They met on the Internet"?
-CHRISTINE: Really?

604
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,998
-What does that mean?
-Am I being too hard on him?

605
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,094
No, not at all.

606
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,535
-There you go. Thank you very much.
-CLAY: Thanks a lot...

607
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,267

some of that cake of yours.

<i>I'm sorry I'm calling so early,</i>

939
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:14,200
<i>but last night, I found some troubling</i>
<i>information about our friend Stu Rubin.</i>

940
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:17,934
<i>Apparently, he stole your</i>
<i>file on the McPherson loan</i>

941
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:21,379
<i>and then tried to broker</i>
<i>his own deal at First National.</i>

942
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,417
<i>I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.</i>

943
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:26,147
<i>And we wouldn't have either,</i>
<i>except that an hour ago,</i>

944
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,054
<i>he came by my house and tried</i>
<i>to pin the whole thing on you</i>.

945
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:34,653
<i>After I confronted him about</i>
<i>a few inconsistencies in his story,</i>

946
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:39,132
<i>he broke down crying and, well,</i>
<i>we won't be seeing him around any more</i>.

947
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,499
<i>So I just wanted you to know that,</i>
<i>come Monday morning</i>,

Hi. Good morning.

955
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:33,381
-I'm sorry, we're not open.
-I just... I just want this coat.

956
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:34,545
We're not open yet.

957
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:38,716
My boyfriend and I are
taking this really special trip this morning.

958
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,153
Please?

-Hey!
-Hey! Oh, man! Hi.

963
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,076
God, I'm so glad you're here.
So many things I wanna tell you.

964
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:58,338
Wait, there's something I wanna say

965
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:01,348
-while I have it straight in my head.
-Okay. Go ahead.

966
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,884
You never stopped believing in me.

967
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,414
Thank you for that.

968
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:12,250
And there's something else,
something that I couldn't admit to before.

969
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:17,864
I could have given Mrs Ganush
another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

970
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:23,562
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

971
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,549
You have such a good heart.

972
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,610
You're so beautiful right now.

973
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,724
-Do you like my new coat?
-I do. I really do.

974
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,454
-What happened to the old one, though?
-I threw it out.

975
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:49,222
-And I never want to see it again.
-Oh, no.

976
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:53,298
That's too bad, because I... Look
what I found. I found this in the car.

977
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:55,133
I thought...

978
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:58,071
And I thought maybe you could...

979
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,067
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

980
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,305
And I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

981
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:06,971
'cause the envelopes kind of look the same.
