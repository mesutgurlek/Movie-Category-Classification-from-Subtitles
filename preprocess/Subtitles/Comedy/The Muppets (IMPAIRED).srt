Oh, there you are!

He's the best friend
you could ever have.

Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

[Walter] Yeah. Race you home!

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,593
And, well, that night
sorta changed everything.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,712
It's The Muppet Show, with our very
special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,797
[Walter] I found them...

I was their number one fan.

You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?

00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,070
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,396
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,111
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool
you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,670
I can't believe you guys
have been dating for ten years.

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,274
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do
something special for this anniversary,

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,908
and she's always
wanted to see Los Angeles, so...

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from The Muppet Studios.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,673
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,594
- I can't do that, Walter.
- But, Gary...

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,830
Because... you're coming with us!

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,231
[gasps] Oh, Gary!

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,351
- But what about Mary?
- She's fine.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,672
- She said the more the merrier.
- I... I don't know what to say!

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,991
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,634
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,588
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.

90
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,512
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, buddy.

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,069
The Muppets haven't put
on a show together in years.

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,834
I don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours anymore.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,434
Nah, I think that's
just an Internet rumor.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,238
Like there's a country called Turkey.

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,913
Walter, how many times
do we have to go over this?

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,071
- Turkey is a very real country.
- Wow, Muppet Studios.

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,829
- Hey, great job, Carlos.
- Thanks.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,399
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

158
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,676
- Hi.
- I got you these.

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,310
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from
the dance number I was doing.

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,471
It's OK. They're really sweet.

161
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,234
You excited for our big trip to LA?
I have our list.

162
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,233
Me, too. [chuckles]

163
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,152
Oh, this is the
most romantic thing ever.

164
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
I've always dreamt
of seeing Los Angeles.

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,159
I know. Walter can't wait either.

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,197
You don't mind that he's coming, right?

167
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,316
No. No, of course not.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,677
As long as we can spend our anniversary
dinner together. That's all I ask.

169
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,470
Totally. It's gonna be the most
romantic anniversary dinner ever.

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,039
I love you so much.

171
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh.

172
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,069
- I love you, too.
- I'm gonna go check on Walter.

173
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,392

- [man] OK, they're gone!
- [all groaning]

198
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,275
[Walter] Hey, Gary, what should
we do first at Muppet Studio?

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,398
'Cause I was thinking that maybe we
could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...

200
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,635
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

201
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,075
The lines might be shorter
at Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun,

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,074
so maybe we should start there instead.
I just... I just can't wait!

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,998
[breaks squealing]

Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,991
The home of the Muppets!

[speaking foreign language]

209
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,196
What... What happened to this place?

00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,038
[sign creaking]

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,950
Where...?

212
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,079
- Where is everyone, Gary?
- I don't know, buddy. It's so...

213
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,073
OK, well, I guess you guys
are it for today.

214
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,994
[clears throat] Anyway, welcome
to the original Muppet Studio,

215
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,799
where dreams can come true.

216
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,110
[man speaking foreign language]

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,716
- Is this the Universal Studios?
- Yes, it is.

218
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,156
OK, now if you'll
just follow me, please.

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,957
OK. This used to be Kermit's office.

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,951
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,838
It's really the highlight of the tour.

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,678
You should see it sometime.

223
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,230
OK, this next building
is where they kept the rope

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,315
and the medium-gauge wire for the
productions. Let's go take a look.

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,159
- Come on, buddy.
- [woman speaking foreign language]

226
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,471
Wow!

227
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,872
Oh, boy.

228
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,751
Oh.

229
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,552
Whoa.

230
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,119
- [doorknob rattling]
- [gasps]

231
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,990
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,276
- Or so we've been "toad."
- [both laughing]

233
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,958
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've loved
the Muppets since I was a boy.

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,876
And what better way
to honor the Muppets

235
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,033
than to make this beautiful
studio a Muppet museum.

236
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,635
[gasps]

237
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,518
I think I'll call this room

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,831
the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,797
- Oh, that is lovely.
- Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,873
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

241
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Kermit signed 30 years ago,
that contains...

242
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,917
- The deed to this property.
- Exactly.

243
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,518
Now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.

244
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,478
If the Muppets can raise the
ten million dollars it would cost

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,035
to buy the building before
this contract expires,

246
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,317
- then they get their studio back.
- You know, if I didn't know better,

247
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,318
I'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.

248
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,432
Well, I hope so. Otherwise,
I just bored the audience half to death.

249
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,591
You mean half the audience
is still alive?

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,239
[laughing]

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,714
It's nice doing business with you.

252
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,872
- Yes, sir. Come on.
- Goodbye.

253
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,996
I love geriatric humor.

254
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,591
Gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,873
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- [sniffing]

256
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,675
And more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.

257
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,156
In two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground

258
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,551
and start drilling. Ah, those Muppets.

259
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,435
They think they're so funny.

260
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,633
Well, it looks like
the joke's about to be on them.

261
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,314
- Maniacal laugh.
- [laughs]

262
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,158
Maniacal laugh.

263
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,312
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.

264
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,955
- [gasps]
- Maniacal laugh.

265
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,272
[screaming]

266
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,192
- [Gary] Walter!
- [Mary] Walter?

267
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,588
- [Gary] Walter!
- [Mary] Walter!

268
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,272
[screaming continues]

269
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,236
[screaming continues]

270
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,673
Yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,115
[mocking] "There's oil
under this studio, see.

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,555
I'm gonna tear it to the ground, see.

273
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,996
- Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- People still talk like that?

274
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,878
Maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.

275
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,589
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.

276
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,990
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.

277
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,988
[Walter gasps] Stop the car!
I've got an idea!

278
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,158
[all] Mmm.

279
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,753
These are delicious!

280
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,717
- Great idea, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,272
[Gary] We've been doing this
for a long time.

282
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
I think maybe we should
call it a night.

283
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,195
- [Mary] Guys!
- We can't give up, Gary.

284
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,158
But it's getting really late. Maybe
we should just go back to the motel.

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,117
- Guys!
- It...

286
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,474
- What?
- What?

287
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,350
- Maybe he lives there.
- Oh. That's it.

288
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,348
So, what do we do now?

289
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,599
I don't see a doorbell,
and the house looks empty.

290
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,512
- Gary, throw me over.
- What?

291
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,990
- Gary, just throw me over already!
- OK.

292
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,675
- OK, here we go. OK...
- One, two, three.

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,869
- [cracking]
- [grunts]

294
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,439
- That's good.
- Sorry.

295
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,919
- No, it's good.
- Guys?

296
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,116
I think that's an electric fence.

297
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,599
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.

298
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,475
- OK, buddy, head down.
- [both] One, two, three!

299
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,952
[screaming]

300
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,716
- It's an electric fence.
- Yep.

301
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,669
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?

302
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,434
- [raspy] Throw me again.
- No, I don't...

303
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
I don't think that's a good idea.

304
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,154
- What kind of throw was that?
- I think there's somebody coming.

305
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,753
[man] Excuse me...

306
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,035
[choir vocalizing]

307
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,153
You OK? That was quite a tumble.

308
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,148
Oh. Look, look. I think...

309
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,276
Hey. Hey, Walter?

310
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,432
- Walter, you all right, buddy?
- Where am I?

311
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,270
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.

312
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,711
- Oh, jeez. Walter.
- No, no, no, no, no. You OK?

313
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,359
This... This is Kermit's house?

314
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,997
- Anyhow, how can I help you guys?
- [gasps]

315
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,919
Let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,

316
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,236
but my brother, Walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.

317
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,154
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Not now, 80's Robot.

318
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,834
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,228
- [Kermit] Good grief.
- New Coke?

320
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,675
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,438
Bummer.

322
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,919
- [Kermit] Watch out for the...
- Gag me with a spoon.

323
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,957
- [Kermit] Yeah, head for the door.
- Grody to the max.

324
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,759
- [banging]
- Ow.

325
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,553
Ow.

326
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,631
- I'm really sorry about that...
- [crashing]

327
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,949
...Walter. What were you saying?

328
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,669
- Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, is...
- Yes, yes, yes.

329
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,751
Oil baron Tex Richman,
the wealthy philanthropist.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,229
You know, he's about to buy
our old Muppet Show theater

331
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,356
and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?

332
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,717
- No! I mean...
- What Walter's trying to tell you

333
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,634
is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,756
- What?
- The only way to save the studio

335
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,190
is to raise ten million dollars.

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,397
Ten million dollars? That's impossible.

337
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,834
- But...
- The only way to raise

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,353
that kind of money would be to...

339
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,192
...would be to put on a show.

340
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,514
And I haven't seen the old gang
in a long, long time.

341
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,355
I guess people sort of forgot about us.

342

Mmm...

This is going to be

Well, I... I guess...

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,154
...we could try.

- Well, yeah, listen.

If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need some moral support.

Well, that's perfect.
We're experts at moral support.

- Yeah!
- Good. I guess if we're gonna go,

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,791
we better get going.
We got a lot of people to find.

Oh, great! But wait,
how do we find'em?

in a really long time, and I...

458
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,113
I just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back

459
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,517
if we all got together
and put on one last show.

A show? But I've spent years
building a solo career.

461
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,791
I have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.

462
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,709
Fozzie! What the heck
are you doing, hibernating?

463
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,070
Next show starts in 30 seconds.

464
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,110
We hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!

465
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,872
- [door slams]
- [shuddering]

466
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,679
- They terrify me. Let's go.
- Let's go.

467
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,838
- Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
- [Fozzie] Oh, thanks.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,355
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!

469
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,589
According to 80's Robot,

470
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,194
he's the richest plumbing magnate
in the Rust Belt.

471
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,359
You! Order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from Beijing.

472
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,432
- [man] Right away, sir.
- And, you, send the 28,000 tons

473
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,238
of Silly Putty back to Beijing.

474
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,913
- [man 2] You bet.
- Oh, and you?

475
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,429
A memo to the waterless
toilet department.

476
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,194
I don't care about the mess,
just keep trying.

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,638
- Hi, Gonzo.
- Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.

478
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,037
- We need to speak to you.
- All right. Have a seat.

479
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,151
Ah. Thank you!

480
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,757
- I think I'll stand.
- No, really, you should try one! Comfy.

481
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,353
It's our executive line of used toilets.

482
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,512
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.

483
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,158
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...

484
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,952
Don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.

485
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,509
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?

486
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,671
[clears throat]
Gonzo, it would appear...

487
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,353
Remember, evil oil baron.

488
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,034
Fozzie, I'm going
to get to that. Please!

489
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,236
- As I was trying to say...
- Evil oil baron.

490
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,517
- [buzzer sounds]
- OK, time's up. Thank you, guys.

491
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,470
Gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.

492
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,428
- We really need you.
- My answer is no. Good day!

493
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,675
Come on, guys. We should go.

494
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,792
I just want to say, when I was a kid,
I saw you recite Hamlet

495
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,633
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...

496
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,236
...it made me feel
like I could do anything.

497
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,392
Thank you. Yeah.

498
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,190
[clucking]

499
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,509
- Good try, Walter.
- [Gonzo] Hey, guys, up here!

500
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,557
- Ya-haa!
- Huh?

501
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,514
I've been wearing this under
my suit every single day for years!

502
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,073
Look out below!

503
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,878
- [yelling]
- [clucking]

504
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,793
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!

505
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,316
I can't see! Apollo 13!

506
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,919
- [clucking]
- [grunts]

507
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,157
Citizens of Earth,
the Great Gonzo is back.

508
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,716
I pledge never to hold a plunger again!

509
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,029
[beeping]

510
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,711
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!

511
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,998
- Run, guys!
- Run!

512
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,479
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!

513
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,518
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!

514
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,637
[coughing]

515
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,917
Wow! That was an
expensive looking explosion!

516
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,514
I can't believe we
had that in the budget.

517
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,439
[woman] So maybe if you
look inside yourself,

518
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,639
the person you should be
most angry at is you.

519
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,835
Is you.

520
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,675
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?

521
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,434
In control.

522
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,591
- Good.
- [Kermit whispering] Psst. Animal!

523
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,911
- [woman] Excellent.
- It's me, Kermit.

524
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,278
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!

525
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,477
Pardon us, please. Animal,
I need to talk to you for a second.

526
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,593
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.

527
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,318
- Animal drum?
- Yes!

528
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,476
- Please, sir.
- Drum! Drum, drum!

529
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,790
- Drum, drum, drum!
- OK, OK.

530
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,040
- In control.
- Good.

531
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,475
I'm Animal's court-appointed sponsor.

532
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,791
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.

533
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,996
- It's his trigger word.
- His trigger word?

534
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,509
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

535
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,750
but it's very important to these guys
that they get their drummer...

536
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,709
Gary!

537
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,518
It's my trigger word, too.

538
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,434
Jack, we talked about this on Tuesday.

539
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,830
Tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!

540
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,073
Oh, I don't think so!

541
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,154
Sorry.

542
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,072
- Let's go, Animal.
- Bye-bye!

543
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,312
- Animal, heel.
- Go, Animal! Be free, man!

544
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,149
But remember! No drumming!

545
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,074
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest
we save time and pick up

546
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,390
the rest of the Muppets using a montage?

547
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,676
[Kermit] Great idea, 80's Robot.

548
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,319
[# AC/DC: "Back in Black"]

549
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,392
We greatly appreciate
your financial support.

550
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,598
[80's Robot] Eighty-seven point three
miles to go. Eighty-seven point two...

551
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,478
[Kermit] 80's Robot,
do you have to do that?

552
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,312
...the secrets of the universe...

553
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,958
[screaming]

554
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,874
I guess we're in.

555
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,671
Welcome to this week's edition
of "Everything Stinks."

556
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,190
Whoa!

557
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,679
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.

558
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,114
Three, two, one.

559
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,679
[cackles]

560
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,713
Think we should've rented a bigger car?

561
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,396
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!

562
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,872
I wanna go with you! Oh, not again.

563
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,152
Wow. I can't believe
we're all back together.

564
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,878
Even all you guys
who weren't in the montage!

565
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,231
Yeah, how come you
didn't use me in the montage?

566
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,391
I thought my story
was pretty interesting.

567

- [snoring]
- Rowlf? Wanna get back together?

568
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,555
- OK.
- Good.

569
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,671
[chuckles] Classic.

570
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,592
Anyhow, looks like we got everybody,

571
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,910
so we can plan our telethon
and raise that ten million dollars.

572
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,798
- Well, not everybody.
- No, I think everybody's here.

573
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,188
- Where's...?
- All good!

574
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,634
- Miss...
- All done here!

575
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,233
- Piggy?
- [sighs]

576
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,113
Kermit, we're going
to get Miss Piggy, right?

577
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,470
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!

My Minitel tells me
she is in Paris, France.

580
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,312
Oh! Well, then we drive to France.

581
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,393
- You can't drive to France, Walter.
- Yeah. It's way too far.

582
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,312
Then maybe we should travel by map!

583
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,710
- Good idea, Fozzie.
- Yeah!

584

To Paris!

[man speaking French]

589
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,759
[Walter] Look at these ceilings!

590
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,473
[Fozzie] Yeah. They must
be very tall here.

591
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,359
- [Kermit] Yeah, very nice.
- [keyboard clacking]

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,593
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.

593
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,875
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?

594
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,759
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.

595
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,831
Urgent! Urgent!

596
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,877
- Is it urgent?
- Very. Yes.

597
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,511
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...

598
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,434
- ...early September.
- Early September?

599
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,158
That's like six months from now!

600
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,232
That's nothing. Once I waited
a whole year for September.

601
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,075
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.

602
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,958
You can't just pop in
without an appointment.

603
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,395
- OK, then.
- Thank you.

604
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,198
- [woman] All right.
- [Animal] Mean lady.

605
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
- Close the door on your way out.
- [Kermit] Thanks a lot.

606
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,950
- She wasn't very nice.
- [Kermit] Yeah.

607
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,113
Guys! Muppet Man!

608
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,590
- Yeah!
- That could work!

609
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,035
[knocking on door]

610
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,313

I have an appointment.

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,876
Oh, OK.

614
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,433
Um...

615
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,953
Will you wait here a moment?

616
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,759
[Miss Piggy] Decisions, decisions.

617
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,919
- Eeny, meeny, miny, mo. I choose you.

00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,479
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- [woman] Of course.

621
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,036
There's a... man here to see you.

622
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,589
He does have an appointment.

623
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,830
An appointment? That's weird.

624
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,718
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!

625
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,029
Right away. Sorry.

626
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
- Ahahaha.
- Remember, left foot, right foot.

627
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,349
Hello.

628
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,999
- Whoa.
- [crashing]

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,952
- What the...?
- [Fozzie] Sorry.

630
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,593
That looked expensive.

- So do you!

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,352
Please, have a seat.

634
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,159
Yes, we're going to have a seat now.

635
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,073
- No, no, no, don't sit down!
- Oh, sorry! Whoa!

Uh-oh.

- [Mary] You guys OK?
- [Gary] Is anyone hurt?

- Hello, Piggy.
- Kermie!

644
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,599
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,

Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,870
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!

647

I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!

- No, no, wait, wait!

Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.

651
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,993
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!

652
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,631
It's true, Piggy. And we need
to do The Muppet Show again.

653
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,835
We need you.

654
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,835
Oh.

655
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,999
Before I decide anything,
I need to talk with you, frog.

Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.

660
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,596
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.

661
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,955
You never intended to marry me.

662
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,951
Not even after I built us a house

663
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,793
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.

664
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,919
Well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?

665
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,311
Piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?

666
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,710
You know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.

667
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,236
I am who I am. Why can't
you accept that about me?

668
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,197
Look, this is not about you and me.

669
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,918
It's never about you and me, is it?

670
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,878
It's always we. We this, we that.

671
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,352
"We" need you. You can't even say,
"I need you," can you?

672
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,238
Piggy...

673
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,192
I'm sorry, Kermit,
but I have a life here.

674
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,319
A life I've made for myself.

675
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,315
Piggy!

676
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,674
Just remember, Kermit,
I cannot be replaced.

677

[door closes]

678
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,594
Kermit? What happened?
Where's Miss Piggy?

679
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,069
- She's not coming, Fozzie.
- [all gasp]

680
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,754
But, Kermit, we always worked together.

681
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,951
We can't do this without Miss Piggy.

682
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,076
No one will give us a show without her.

683
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,992
We'll be fine, Fozzie.

684
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,829
We'll be fine.

685
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,752
We just...

686
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,514
We'll just have to
come up with something else.

687
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,470
[sighs] Kermie.

688
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,391
[Kermit] OK, I've got an idea.
We need a pig that can sing.

689
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,836
[Fozzie] But, Kermit, who could
possibly replace Miss Piggy?

Hey, what's everybody so quiet about,
huh?

00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,759
- Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy.
- Come on, everybody.

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,595
Let's go pitch our telethon
and get the Muppets back on TV, OK?

- Awkward.

Listen, Kermit, I like you.

703
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,711
I remember you guys
from when I was a kid.

- [chatter]
- So I'm gonna shoot straight.

- You guys aren't famous anymore.
- [groans]

706

I wish she'd shot a little more curvy.

707
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,917
Take a look at this diagram
the research department drew up.

708
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,755
This circle represents
everything that's currently popular.

And this tiny speck is you guys.

710
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,990
So the answer's no.
It's not gonna happen.

Take a look at the shows that
are popular now. Punch Teacher.

I could make a difference.

I'd just like to say something.

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,717
I think kids are smarter and better
than all this junk, and if you...

719
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,717
Veronica, bad news. Punch Teacher
has stopped production.

720
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,632
It's being sued by the
Teachers Society of America.

721
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,918
- What's their problem?
- No idea. I just found out.

What are we supposed to do
with that 120-minute black hole

OK, Muppets.
You've got yourselves a show.

- All right!
- Oh, yes!

726
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,950
Thank you so much. You will not
be sorry, I promise, I promise!

00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,159
OK, enough! One, no more going nuts
in my office. These are new carpets.

- And two, you need a celebrity host.

OK. Whatever, whatever.
Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah!

- [man 2] You've missed a spot.

- I don't see it.
- Just a little lower!

- Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you...
- Yes.

Well, gentlemen. It appears
we have some competition

No singing in my office!

739
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,359
- Yes, sir.
- But, of course, it was all his fault.

740
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,670
- Mostly his fault.
- No matter.

741
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,317
Point is, that studio
and that oil belong to me.

Because those ones have tails.

- Thanks.

Yeah! Who cancelled

But don't worry. We'll be fine.

Wait. Kermit, don't say another word.

Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be
happy to help you rebuild the theater.

Honestly, it would be an honor
for all three of us.

- OK. Well, let's clean this place up!

765
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,273
Yeah!

768
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,356
You're the Muppets!
You do this to music!

Where's everybody been?

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,676
Celebrity... celebrity!

777
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,991
Hello! Yes. Could I speak
with President Carter, please?

778
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,590
He moved? Well, you don't happen to have
a number where I could reach... Hello?

779
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,478
Walter, I thought we were gonna
clean the balcony.

780
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,790
- Doing a great job, pal.
- [Walter] You're doing a great job.

781
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,911
- Wocka wocka.
- Hey, guys!

782
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,389
Look at these old photos I just found.

783
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,595
Oooh.

784
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,360
Can you believe that 80's
haircut I used to have?

785
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,715
I looked totally ridiculous!

786
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,190
Yes, it's Kermit. The frog.

787
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,590
Could you come to our celebrity
telethon this weekend?

788

Sure. Sure, I understand.

Oh, hey, Kermit.
Listen, have a great night,

798
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,753
and I just want you to know,
Walter and I are really good sewers,

799
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,150
so we'll have those costumes
ready for you in no time.

- Good. You two have a great night.
- OK. Thank you!

- Bye.
- [man] Kermit?

802
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,955
Gary, I was kind of hoping
that we could go to the beach tomorrow

803
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,395
- or see the Hollywood Sign.
- We'll have plenty of time

804
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,357
to do that stuff. It's just, right now,

805
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,069
I don't wanna leave Walter.
You know, he needs me.

I don't know, sweetheart,
he seems pretty happy.

- [Walter] Oh, OK.

809
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,312
[Fozzie] Now you.

810
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,875
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, good job!

811
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,635
Well, just one more day, OK?
And then I'm all yours.

812
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,792
Tell you what. Why don't you get
a head start on sightseeing tomorrow,

813
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,633
and then I'll be waiting
for you when you get back.

814
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,395
OK. Just...
don't forget about me.

815
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,788
Never.

816
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,678
Well, we're still on
for dinner Friday, right?

817
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,353
Yeah, of course.

- Oh, Walter!
- Oh, yes, Kermit.

819

Hey, listen, Walter,
I just wanna tell you

820
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,230
that none of this would have happened
without you, so thank you.

821
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,119
- Oh, well...
- And welcome aboard.

822
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,430
Night, everybody. Just sleep
anywhere you can find a spot.

- Yep.
- What's the weather

829
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,798
- supposed to be like tonight?
- I don't know. Why?

830
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,997
I just don't want it to rain
through the hole in the ceiling.

831
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,878
Stars sure are pretty, though.

832
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,549
We're gonna be OK, right?
We haven't done this in a long time,

833
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,111
and I really don't
wanna go back to Reno.

834
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,111
Don't worry, Fozzie. We'll be fine.

835
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,999
Look how we cleaned this place
up today, you know?

836
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,833
Same old team, all pulling together.

I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.

Good night, Fozzie.

00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,359
OK, gather round, troops! Everybody,
time to get this rehearsal going.

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,636
- Scooter, is everybody here?
- Almost everyone, chief.

842
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,792
- Yeah...
- Hey, anybody got any kerosene?

843
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,037

dresses out back and burn'em.

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,748
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

847
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,672
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.

848

Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.

- Yeah!

- Hiya!

There's only one Miss Piggy,
and she is moi.

855
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,675
Yeah, well, you ain't seen
the last of me! I'll be back!

856
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,711
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?

All right, all right, don't crowd me!

00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,190
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.

860
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,151
Piggy? You came back.

861
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,949

I'm here for them.

I'm catching the next plane
back to my life in Paris.

Uh... Oh, and if you like that one,
what's the bear capital of the world?

Hey guys, stop. Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut. What's the problem?

882
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,714
We can't keep time without
the drums, man! We need drums!

- Sorry, Animal.
- [grunting] No drums! No drums!

- [Animal] In control.

00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,471
- Hey, Walter?
- Oh. Yes, Kermit?

888
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,954
You think you might
wanna help us out here?

889
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,315
- Maybe do something in the show?
- [sighs]

890
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,074
Kermit, you know,
you've been so nice to me,

891
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,268
but I have to face the facts.
See, the Muppets are so talented...

Hey, guys, check it out! Fart shoes!

- Patent pending!
- And...

895
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,748
...I don't have any talent at all.

896
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,118
The truth is... [sighs]
I can't perform with you guys.

897
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,113
I feel like a phony just being here.

898
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,999
Walter, just because you haven't
found your talent yet,

899
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,994
doesn't mean you don't have one.
If you look inside yourself,

900
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,958
I'm sure you'll find something
that you're really good at.

901
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,837
OK, Kermit. I'll try.

902
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,117
[woman] Take my picture!

903
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,430
Welcome.
How many in your party? Two?

904
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,398
Uh... No, just the one.

905
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,313

All right, party of one, follow me.

again I'm on my own

and have a party for one

A party by myself

by myself and wait for you

One is the new two

916

I'm gonna make a fuss

# Tonight I'm gonna celebrate
with just the one of us

# I'm having a me party

919

# Haven't I seen me here before?

920
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,393
# A me party

921
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,471
# I'm the last one on the dance floor

922
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,950
- # Me party
- # A party just for moi

923
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,635
- # Me party
- # It's a solo Mardi Gras

924
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,475
# I'm having a me party
I'm such good company

925
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,155
- # A me party
- # I saved the last dance for me

926
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,991
[vocalizing]

# What happens at a me party
stays at a me party #

928
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,599
Excuse me, miss, are you
expecting anyone else?

929
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,228
Oh... no.

930
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,709
No, it's just me. Party of one.

931
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,638
- [bell dings]
- [man] Order up!

932
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,351
- OK, cue 17 is Fozzie's intro.
- Hey, Scooter? What's left?

933
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,715
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!

934
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,429
- Hm?
- Your duet. With Piggy.

935
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,709
[knocking softly]

936
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,711
[Miss Piggy singing
"(I've Had The) Time of My Life"]

937
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,313
- Miss Piggy?
- Hm?

938
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,351
We're all out front practicing our acts

939
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,028
and seems that everybody expects
you and I to do a duet, so...

940
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,875
Oh, that's so lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't.

941
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,591
No, no, you see, I'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.

942
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,552
Hola. [laughs]

943
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,551
OK, come on, rehearsing,
let's go. We gotta break it up.

944
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,029
- Excuse us.
- 'Scuse us.

945
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,952
Let's try that lift again, shall we?

946
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,680
[scoffs] The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?

947
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,553
- In three, two... Wait for me!
- [crashing]

948
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,789
Good grief.

949
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,633
Kermit! There you are. I've been
looking for you everywhere!

950
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,193
So nice to see you, Veronica.

951
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,271
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?

952
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,319
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to you
about that, you see, because...

953
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,672
Well, actually, I'm kind of a celebrity.

954
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,159
You? [scoffs]

955
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,117
No. Kermit, listen.

956
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,034
I will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.

957
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,117
I will rerun Benson if I have to.

958
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,198
Yeah, you see, the thing is, Veronica,

959
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,193
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!

960
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,839
Twelve hours!

961
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,318
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!

962
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,278
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us,

963
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,833
that theater is... is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...

964
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,990
...we humbly ask that you
give us back our studio.

965
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,317
It would certainly mean a lot to us.

966
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,351
Hmmm.

967
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,232
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.

968
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,755
[singing]

969
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,994
Correct!

970
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,429
The answer is no.

971
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,478
Well, you could've just said that.

972
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,517
- Contract.
- Contract.

973
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,715
Contract.

974
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,159
- Nicely done, sir.
- You see, Muppets,

975
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,231
according to this contract,

976
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,188
it's not just this studio
you lose the rights to tonight,

977
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,351
- it's the Muppet name itself.
- What?

978
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,115
And all characters
under the Muppet name.

979
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,352
Wait a second. What possible use
could you have for our names?

980
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,873
[beeping]

981
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,150
Told ya I'd be back.

982
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,396
Well, now I am...

983
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,194
...back.

984
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,195
And I see you've met Mr. Richman,
our new business partner.

985
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,549
The Moopets are a hard, cynical act
for a hard, cynical world.

986
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,989
Hey, Fozzie! I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

987
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,479
[laughing]

988
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,149
- Wocka wocka.
- You're relics, Muppets!

989
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,596
The world has moved on,
and no one cares about

990
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,709
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy,
Julie Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin',

991
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,509
singin'-and-dancin' act anymore!
You're dead!

992
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,911
- [gasps]
- And I just come to bury you.

993
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,389
Now, get out of my office.

994
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,073
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?

995
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,639
You said you were gonna talk to the man!

996
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,078
Guys! OK, so maybe
Kermit signed away the theater

997
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,949
and the Muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,

998
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,908
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?

999
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,795
Well, actually I
don't see how we can, Fozzie.

1000
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,154
- Huh?
- [man] What?

1001
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,958
Guys, the show's in six hours,

1002
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,750
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, I...

1003
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,751
I couldn't get us a celebrity host.

1004
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,990
- Oh, no!
- What?

1005
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,595
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.

1006
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,716
I'm sorry I dragged you guys
into this mess.

1007
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,751
Kermit?

1008
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,073
All right, listen up, you freaks!

1009
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,834
I didn't come 5,000 miles
to not be on TV.

1010
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,630
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.

1011
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,828
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.

1012
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,479
Let's move!

1013
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,869
[alarms blaring]

1014
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,235
- Hey!
- Hi.

1015
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,432
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was great.

1016
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,751
I went to Guinness Book
of World Records... alone.

1017
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,275
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not... solo.

1018
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,874
And then I ate lunch unaccompanied,

1019
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,231
and then I walked back here...
independently.

1020
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,153
Listen, I got you these.

1021
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,551
You know, to make up for the
other ones. The broken ones.

1022
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,312
Thanks, sweetie.

1023
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,433
Listen, Gary.

1024
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,797
I was just wondering what
the plan was for dinner tonight.

1025
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,393
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?

1026
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,279
OK. That's fine.

1027
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,677
That's just fine.
That's... that's perfect.

1028
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,236
I'm going to go for a walk.

1029
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,749
- Individually.
- [door opens]

1030
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,157
[whistling]

1031
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,431
[humming]

1032
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,352
- Walter, hey.
- [Walter] Gary.

1033
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,637
Oh, where have you been? I need you
to help me figure out a talent.

1034
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,313
A talent for what?

1035
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,473
For the show. Kermit asked me
to do an act in the show.

1036
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,359
I... I could be a Muppet.

1037
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,353
Wow. Wow, Walter, that's amazing.

1038
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,273
Yeah, but I need to
figure out if I have a talent.

1039
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,749
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something,

1040
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,434
but right now I actually...
I need your help.

1041
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,672
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something,

1042
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,276
and I don't know what, and I was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.

1043
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,555
Gary, I'd love to help you out,

1044
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,757
but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.

1045
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,957
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too.

1046
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,435
Yeah, but the whole reason we came here
was to see the Muppets.

1047
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,955
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here

1048
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,429
was to take a vacation where
I took Mary out to a fancy dinner

1049
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,272
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...

1050
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,309
- Walter, what day is today?
- Friday.

1051
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,392
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1052
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,109
This is bad.
Walter, this is really bad. I have to...

1053
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,999
- Mary? Mary!
- Wait.

1054
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,357
Gary, I need you.

1055
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,198
OK, is everybody ready?

1056
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,670
Commence Operation
Celebri-nap. Masks on!

1057
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,070
- Masks on!
- Except for moi.

1058
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,753
Nothing covers this beautiful face.

1059
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,317
- [gasps] No maskin'?
- No maskin'.

1060
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,911
[man] Check the door on Stage 28.

1061
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,514
- [man 2] I'm going over there now.
- [man on radio] She's done in makeup...

1062
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,797
[panting]

1063
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,352
I told you, I'm not done
putting on my balls!

1064
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,273
Oh, hey, Animal.

1065
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,595
What are you doin' here?

1066
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,878
Acting. Natural.

1067
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,229

01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

1220
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,189
for the Great Gonzo's
most amazing feat ever.

1221
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,637
- Head bowling.
- What? No!

1222
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,153
I have not signed off on this!

1223
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,595
- [laughing]
- Drumroll, please.

1224
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,668
- [dinging]
- And a one and a two and a three!

1225
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,798
Uh-oh. Uh... My fingers got stuck.

1226
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,474
All part of the act, folks. Stay tuned.

1227
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,755
[laughing]

1228
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,956
Please, make this end! Please!

1229
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,593
This is great. Call'em.

1230
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,479
- [telephone ringing]
- [all mumbling]

1231
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,312
[buzzing]

1232
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,916
Hello?

1233
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,231
You wanna give us some money?!
Uhhh...

1234
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,949
- Say yes!
- Yes! We will take that money!

1235
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,557
[laughing]
Hey, guys, we got us some money!

1236
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,794
Oh, yeah, tickets. Here we are.
Tickets. Thank you.

1237
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,714
Five dollars to show you your seat.
It's up there somewhere.

1238
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,792
- Help!
- OK, thank you, Gonzo.

1239
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,520
Thank you very much. Ladies and
gentlemen, we will see what happens with

1240
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,796
head bowling
a little later in the show.

1241
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,397
Up next is our furry funny man,
Mr. Fozzie Bear! Yay!

1242
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,995
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.

1243
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,913
Boy, did I go to
a bad seafood place last night.

1244
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,039
The catch of the day was salmonella.
Wocka wocka!

1245
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,237
- OK.
- Ah! That joke's like 50 years old!

1246
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,276
[laughing]

1247
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,192
[Fozzie] So how'bout
those shopping centers?

1248
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,794
You seen one,
you seen a mall! Take it.

1249
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,871
Make it stop!

1250
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,553
[laughing]

1251
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,840
- Wocka wocka wocka wocka!
- [Jack] Make it stop! No!

1252
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,310
- We're not a team! I'm not with him!
- What is happening?

1253
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,517
People are actually watching this?

1254
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,116
Deadly! Bring the car!

1255
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,159
What am I gonna do?

1256
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,435
- What am I gonna do?
- [knocking]

1257
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,273
Walter? Sixty seconds
till you're on, Walter.

1258
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,237
You ready?

1259
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,437
No. Yes, yes, yes...

1260
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,111
Whoopi Goldberg?

1261
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,953
Selena Gomez? And... hi there.

1262
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,952
Yeah, look, somebody said there
might be a career opportunity here,

1263
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,509
- something about saving a theater.
- Yes, yes, of course.

1264
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,274
I don't really know who you guys are.
My agent just told me to show up.

1265
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,708
- That's great.
- Are you one of the

1266
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,074
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

1267
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,993
Yes, I am, and let me
show you how you can help.

1268
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,630
And don't worry. It's just your
one shot to go on live TV

1269
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,916
before millions of people
to prove you have what it takes

1270
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,793
to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.

1271
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,200
Up next, folks, I am proud
to present a brand-new act

1272
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,158
to the show. Introducing Walter.

1273

- [screaming]
- [crashing]

1275
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,879
[Fozzie] That's not good.

1276
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,115
[clears throat] It appears that
Walter has stepped out, so it's...

1277
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,319
Well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.

1278
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,674
[applause]

1279
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,319
[vocalizing]

01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,470
- [laughing]
- [mumbling]

1281
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,437
Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!

1282
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,875
[vocalizing "Smells Like Teen Spirit"]

1283
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,751
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

1284
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,150
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!

1285
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,715
You're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!

1286
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,799
Ow!

1287
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,359
Careful around the ears!

1288
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,589
[groans]

1289
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,520
[high pitched]
Ah! That was hot!

1290
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,831
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?

1291
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,594
What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!

1292
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,870
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?

1293
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,873
[Kermit] Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!

1294
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,837
[applause]

1295
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,751
Nice work, everybody. [mumbles]
Chickens, you're up next!

1296
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,275
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this.

1297
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,190
And now I am
pleased and proud to present

1298
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,631
those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!

[applause]

1302
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,474
Let's hear it for Camilla
and her farmyard friends!

1303
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,952
No, I... I don't know
why I'm not hosting this.

1304
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,680
So remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal

1305
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,440
of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...

Oh, dear.

1308
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,834
[Kermit] Ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.

1309
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,798
We will get this sorted out
just as soon as we can. Scooter!

[crackling, sizzling]

1311
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,118
Well, that's that. Nice try, Muppets!

- [laughing]
- [growling]

1313
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,032
[Fozzie] Kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money

1314
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,355
with no electricity?

1315
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,750
[Kermit] All right,
calm down, everybody.

1316
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,353
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah.

1317
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,080
Well, we can't do the show
without power.

1318
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,152
- Anybody got any bright ideas?
- Not now, Fozzie.

1319

Ten-gauge gator grip.

1320
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,675
I love it when you talk shop.

Oh! [clears throat]

- # La la la la la la la
- # Mee mee mee mee

1325
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,640
[Tex] What? How'd they get
the power back?

1326
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,789
[grunts]

1327
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,871
We're gonna have to get up on that roof

1328
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,476
and shut'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!

1329
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,835
Bolt cutters.

1330
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,235
Deadly! You come with me.

1331
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
That's it.

1332
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,753
Hm.

1333
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,030

Deadly! What are you doing?

1336
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,952
Enough!

1337
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,636
Just because I have a terrifying name
and an evil English accent,

1338
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,837
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,

1339
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,869
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!

1340
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,794
Looks like it's I who
will have the last laugh!

1341
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,475
- What does that mean?
- It's an idiom, you idiot,

1342
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,474
because you cannot laugh!
Ha ha!

1343
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,153
- [thudding]
- Oopsie.

1344
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,878
[Deadly laughing]

1345
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,155
Deadly.

1346
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,392
Now that's a maniacal laugh for you!

1347
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,552
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd
you guys get here so fast?

1348
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,790
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.

1349
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,997
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed. I just...

1350
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,230
I realized you don't let
the most important person

1351
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,715
in your world slip away.

1352
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,957
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah?

1353
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,469
Could you do me a favor
and take over hosting duty?

1354
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,438
But, chief, I don't go onstage.

1355
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,149
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.

1356
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,878
Yeah, but, I...

1357
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,917
Ha... ha... ha...

1358
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,468
[knocking]

1359
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,474
Uh, Miss Piggy?

1360
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,832
[audience applauding]

1361
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,832
[stuttering]

1362
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,310
- You are all naked.
- [gasping]

1363
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,879
[Scooter] Well, sorta.

1364
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,555
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1365
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,792
please welcome, a real hero...

1366
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,919
[Miss Piggy] You saved it?
After all this time?

1367
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,072
Oh, Kermie.

1368
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,794
[clears throat] I guess I'm not
that good at saying this kind of stuff.

1369
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,110
- Yes, Kermie?
- Well...

1370
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,758
...over the last week,
I realized that...

1371
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,514

And maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.

Maybe you just need one person.

It's time for our song,
and if we don't raise the money tonight,

to be ashamed of. And you know why?

1509

Well, because thanks
to Walter here, we tried.

1510
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,795
And if we failed, we failed together,

1511
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,273
and to me, that's not failing at all.

1512

And I don't care what anybody says.

And I don't care if no one
believes in us, because I believe.

01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,877
- I believe in you.
- Huh?

1515

- Me?

- And you.
- [sighs]

You know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.

1518
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,159
It's each other. So I say, fine,

let's just start at the bottom
and work our way back up to the top.
