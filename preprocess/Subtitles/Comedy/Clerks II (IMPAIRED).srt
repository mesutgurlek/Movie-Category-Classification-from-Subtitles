00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,500
(<i>laughs</i>)

326
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,500
You know I'm 19, Randal.

327
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
You wouldn't work for me
last week, remember?

328
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,500
'Cause you said working
on my birthday

329
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,700
would help me build character.

330
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,200
(<i>sighs</i>)

331
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Well, at least you spelled
"cock" right this time.

332
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,700
Why the fuck are you
still getting rides

333
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
from your mother?

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,500
And even worse,

335
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
what the fuck are you
kissing her good-bye for?

336
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,700
What is she,
your fuckin' prom date?

337
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
You're not gonna bother me
today, Randal.

338
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm in too good a mood.

339
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Because your mom
slipped you the tongue?

340
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,900
No, because I just read online
that there's gonna be

341
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,000
a live-action
Transformers movie.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
And?

343
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Well... I mean, as you know,

344
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
my online handle
is Optimus Prime.

345
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
I know that.
I wish I didn't.

346
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Well, so not only is it awesome

347
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,700
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,

348
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,800
but I'm, like,
positioned or whatever

349
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,700
with the best possible
Net handle and e-mail address

350
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,400
for when the movie comes out.

351
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, you're gonna be rolling
in the pussy, man.

352
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,300
Don't be gross.

353
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Says the guy
who was just playing

354
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,600
tonsil hockey with his mother.

355
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,000
Mr. Dante!

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,400
Leave Elias alone, Randal!

357
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,900
Don't look at his wee-wee.

358
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Dude, the Transformers sucked.

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, no, they didn't.

360
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
They were more
than meets the eye.

361
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
(<i>scoffs</i>)

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,900
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

363
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
- about that or not.
- Ow.

365
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,900
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

366
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.

367
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks

368
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,800
that turn into...

369
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,900
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,

370
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,900
because my pastor says

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,600
that machines can turn
into other machines,

372
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,400
and it's not a sleight
against God.

373
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son

375
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,400
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,

376
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,600
and all we did to pay him back

377
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,800
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.

378
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
Nice shot.

379
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,500
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

380
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,800
I mean, I don't know,

381
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,000
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...

382
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,100
Well, okay...

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
Bible camp?!

384
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Since God created...

385
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,700
Since God created man,

386
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,000
and man created
the Transformers...

387
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
...the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

388
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,000
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.

389
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,200
They are an unholy curse

390
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.

391
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,700
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.

392
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,200
The first of the fallen,

393
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,600
the spoiler of virgins,

394
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,900
the master of abortions!

395
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,700
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

##

407
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Oh, what the fuck was that?

408
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
What?

409
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
That wave.

410
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
I saw Becky, so I waved.

411
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,800
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.

412
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
And?

413
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
And you've got to greet her

414
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,200
before she gets in here,
you fuckin' ass-kiss?

415
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,200
What's that all about?

416
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,700
It's called friendship.

417
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
She's your boss.

418
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,100
You can't be friends
with your boss.

419
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
No, you can't be friends
with your boss.

420
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,400
I like my boss.

421
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
I think there's
something going on

422
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,600
between you two.

423
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
You're crazy.

424
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
You spend an awful lot
of time talking to her.

425
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,900
I spend an awful lot of time
talking to you, too.

426
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,100
And I've always maintained

427
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,900
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,100
We're just friends.

429
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
That's what I keep telling you.

430
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
No, you idiot, me and Becks.

431
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
"Becks"?

432
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
I knew it.

433
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,600
You're fucking
around with the boss.

434
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,100
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancée.

435
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,300
Why would you want
to fuck around

436
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,900
with a chick your own age, man?

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
If you've got to sow
some of your wild oats,

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,600
there's all
these fine young chicks

439
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,400
that stop in here after school.

440
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,900
First off, I'm not cheating
on my fiancée.

441
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Secondly, if I was cheating
on my fiancée,

442
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,400
it wouldn't be with a teenager.

443
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Why not?

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,900
The best part of this job

445
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,400
is all the barely-legal pussy
that comes in here.

446
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
And they all look up to me,

447
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
'cause I've got
a driver's license.

448
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,300
It's awesome.
You're 33.

449
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,100
You show me one
33-year-old chick

450
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,500
who's as buck-wild in bed

451
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,300
as her 17-year-old
counterpart.

452
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100
17-year-olds
nowadays are crazy.

453
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,600
They're up for anything.

454
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,900
They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.

455
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh... my... God.

456
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,200
What?

457
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
Are you serious?

458
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.

459
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.

460
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,700
It's never my idea.

461
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
These young girls today
get all horned up,

462
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,500
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.

463
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!

464
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,400
You sound like my mom.

465
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,900
Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?

466
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
You never go ass to mouth.

467
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,100
You've never gone ass to mouth?

468
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
You never go ass to mouth.

469
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,100
I've never gone ass to mouth.

470
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
Not even once?

471
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Not even ever.

472
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
You're both so repressed.

473
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,300
All right, look,

474
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
I know you've given
a blow job, right?

475
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,300
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.

476
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,500
That's a yes.

477
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,700
And I know you've
gone down on chicks.

478
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,000
What's your point?

479
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Well,

480
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,300
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts

481
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,900
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?

482
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,500
That's just like going
ass to mouth.

483
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.

484
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800

646
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,600
Let me tell you something.

647
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away

648
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,900
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

649
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,400
on the logical closure point,

650
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,800
not the 25 endings
that followed.

651
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,300
What's the logical
closure point?

652
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,500
Yeah, friend,

653
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
enlighten us.

654
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,700
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

655
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,500
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

656
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
and Sam leans in the doorway

657
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,900
and gives him
that very fuckin' gay look.

658
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
ELIAS:
Not the <i>Rings, Randal.</i>

659
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,900
Say what you will about Jesus,

660
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,700
but leave the <i>Rings</i> out of this.

661
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,100
I am gonna kick your ass
back to the Shire

662
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
if you don't
shut your fuckin' mouth.

663
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,000
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

664
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,600
the little hobbits
to take a walk

665
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,200
so he could saunter
over to Frodo

666
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,600
and suck his fuckin' cock.

667
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
Now, <i>that</i> would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.

668
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,900
Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.

669
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,500
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

670
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,300
right before the credits roll,

671
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,000
Sam fucking flat-out bricks
in Frodo's mouth.

672
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
I swear...

673
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
Fuck you!

674
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,500
(<i>laughs</i>): I made fun of
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> so hard,

675
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,900
it made some super-geek puke
all over the counter.

676
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,400
Where do we keep
the mop and bucket

677
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,900
so I can have
Elias clean it up?

678
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,200
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.

679
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,700
We have cleaning products?

680
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,900
(<i>light jazz playing</i>
<i>over radio</i>)

681
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,100
Why does it smell so weird
in here?

682
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
Buh-bye.

683
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm on to you.

684
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
You know he's not
gonna make it here long

685
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,200
once you're not here to protect
him anymore, don't you?

686
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,600
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,

687
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
advocating ass to mouth.

688
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,600
I wasn't advocating it,
you big prude.

689
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,700
I just said it was fine
once in a while.

690
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Like you wouldn't do it
if Emma told you to.

691
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
(<i>scoffs</i>):
Christ, no!

692
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,500
Oh, I thought love
knew no bounds.

693
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,100
Ew. That came off
kind of catty, didn't it?

694
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
A little daytime soapish, yeah.

695
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,900
I don't know why I said that.

697
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,700
I actually kind of like Emma.

698
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,800
So do I.

699
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,900
So that's why
you're getting married!

700
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
I can't wait until
you get engaged,

701
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,400
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.

702
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,800
You're going to be waiting
a long time, sir.

703
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,300
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

704
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,500
You're the cold-hearted
ice princess

705
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,500
that doesn't believe
in marriage.

706
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,

707
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
but, yes, I do think

708
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.

709
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,600
To be loved?

710
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
To fuck as much as possible...

711
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,000
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.

712
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,100
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies

713
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,800
and greeting cards
is just propaganda

714
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,400
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

715
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,900
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.

716
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,300
You're such a sappy girl.

717
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,500
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

718
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,200
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?

719
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,600
In romantic love,

720
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,900
no.

721
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
Like, I love my parents.

722
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,700
I love my car.
I love you.

723
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,400
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,

724
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,200
"There's only one person
out there for me"?

725
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,900
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

726
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Odds are there's always going

727
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
to be someone who's
a better match for you

728
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,100
than the person
you end up marrying.

729
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
So based on your theory,

730
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

731
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.

732
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,100
Wait a second.

733
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,800
You don't think
I really love her?

734
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
(<i>sighs</i>):
I think...

735
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,200
you love what she represents.

736
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,700
Which is...?

737
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,900
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

738
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
the time of day
back in high school.

739
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
And years later,
after she's played the field

740
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,100
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

741
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,300
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...

742
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
Oh, my God,

743
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,400
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?

744
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Unconventional!

745
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,800
Ah, nice backpedal.

746
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,500
Thank you.
(<i>laughs</i>)

747
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
It took her a few years

748
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,600
to finally figure out
that thing

749
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,700
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

750
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,000
but she has to learn on her own,

751
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,400
and that's that guys
that look like you

752
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,500
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always

753
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
try harder than the pretty boy.

754
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,800
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?

755
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,800
(<i>laughs</i>):
No, you're a catch... kind of.

756
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,200
And Emma's a catch, too.

757
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,200
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...

758
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,800
she'll make all your decisions
for you.

759
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,700
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible

760
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,600
at making decisions.

761
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
So my last day
is all about you telling me

762
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,300
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?

763
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,500
(<i>laughs</i>)

764
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,300
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop

765
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,900
for, like, a decade,

766
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,200
and you've been here
for a year almost,

767
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,800
and since day one at both jobs,

768
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,500
all you've ever said
is how you needed

769
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,900
to get out
and start your life.

770
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,200
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,

771
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,800
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,

772
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

773
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"

774
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,700
that you actually went
and did something about it.

775
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,100
And I get it... it's...

776
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
she's your golden ticket, dude.

777
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,700
So, uh...

778
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,100
...what's that make you?

779
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,800
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

780
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,600
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.

781
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,900

Right around high noon...

785
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,000
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?

786
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,700
What is there to say?

787
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,600
Do you regret it?

788
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,400
Do you?

789
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.

790
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Yeah, you regret it...
you weren't the one

791
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
who got mayo in your cooch.

What do you want me to say?

794
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
We were drunk, you know?

795
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,300
It just kind of happened.

796
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
You're just lucky

797
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

798
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

799
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,700
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.

802
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,500
(<i>whispers</i>):
Yeah.

803
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.

804
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,700
That's my surprise?

805
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,200
No.

806
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,800
# Goodbye, horses... #

807
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Hey.

808
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,500
Oh.

809
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,700
So, um...

810
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,300
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?

811
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,400
Because at CarsToBots. com,

812
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
you can get an avatar

813
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,400
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.

814
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,900
Come on, man.

815
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,600
You know I only surf
Transformers sites

816
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,100
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

817
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,200
So what are you doing then?

818
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,700
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

819
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,800
Really?

820
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,300
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?

821
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,300
What?

822
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,100
Uh...

823
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,100
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.

824
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,900
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.

825
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,100
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?

826
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,900
A donkey show.

827
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,000
What's that?

828
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?

829
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,200
(<i>screeching</i>):
Oh, no!

830
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,300
Shh!

831
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,700
Jesus!

832
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,200
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.

833
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

834
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,900
(<i>muffled</i>):
Yes.

835
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,900
God.

836
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,200
That's bestiality, Randal.

837
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,300
At its finest, I hope.

838
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Who'd want to see
something like that?

839
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,800
Me, Dante, you.

840
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,400
I don't want to see
something like that.

841
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,300
Why would you want to see
something like that?

842
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,900
Because it's fucked up.

843
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,100
And I want to see

844
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,700
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

845
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,100
All right, here we go.

846
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,500
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

847
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,100
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,

848
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,000
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

849
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Taking it in the ass, that is."

850
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,700
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

851
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
Do they show pictures?

852
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,300
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

853
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
Really?

854
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,900
Ow.

855
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
Let me borrow your cellphone.

856
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Whoa.

857
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it

858
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,500
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.

859
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,700
This is an emergency.

860
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,500
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,

861
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,500
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.

862
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,300
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

863
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,600
In a non-gay way.

864
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Then give me your phone.

865
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,200
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.

866
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,700
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

867
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,100
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

868
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,600
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing

869
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,400
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.

870
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,800
Hello.

871
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,900
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

872
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,900
Tonight.

873
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
Okay.

874
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
I'm on hold.

875
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,300
Fingers crossed.

876
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,700
We should probably
cross dicks, too.

877
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
No.

878
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
BECKY:
Work, work, work.

879
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,500
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.

880
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,400
Hey, Becks.

881
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,100
Hey, Emma.

882
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,300
Great shirt.

883
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,800
Isn't it?
I love it.

884
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,100
What I love even more are these.

885
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
These came in early,

886
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,300
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.

887
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
And give you yours, of course.

888
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,600
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.

889
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,400
What is it?

890
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
Look, I know it's
three months away,

891
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,700
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

892
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,200
Well... yeah.

893
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,000
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

894
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,300
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

895
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,600
before we picked a date.

896
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Oh, him is so cute.

897
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Him thinking again, huh?

898
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,000
If we left anything
up to these jackals,

899
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,700
nothing would ever
get done, would it?

900
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm just teasing.

901
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,200
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

902
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,900
All right, I've got it.

903
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
I will see you then.

904
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,500
Thank you.

905
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,300
My friend, tonight,

906
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,900
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.

907
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,300
(<i>door moos electronically</i>)

908
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,900
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.

909
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?

910
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,900
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?

911
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,400
Strangely, no.

912
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

913
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
you've seen them all.

914
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,900
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics

915
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,600
of anything like that?

916
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.

917
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,100
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

918
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,600
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

919
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?

920
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,900
Ho-ly shit.

921
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,500
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

922
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,100
You're a virgin, aren't you?

923
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,900
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.

924
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh, yeah.

925
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,100
What's her name again?

926
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Myra Hodgkiss.

927
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,900
You made her up, didn't you?

928
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,600
That name sounds so made-up.

929
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,100
No.

930
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,500
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?

931
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.

932
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Come on!

933
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,400
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.

934
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,700
I let you smell my fingers

935
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,400
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister

936
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,100
in the office
that one time, didn't I?

937
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,700
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.

938
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.

939
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
Maybe you're all about the cock.

940
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,700
No, no, I like the pussy.

941
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,800
So come on.

942
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,200
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?

943
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,100
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

944
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,300
but she can't.

945
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,800
Why?

946
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,500
Jesus, Elias, come on.

947
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
You got to start
trusting me more.

948
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,000
Because once Dante's gone,

949
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,700
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

950
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,600
No, I'm not.

951
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,800
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?

952
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,300
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

953
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
So come on.

954
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,600
You got to start
trusting me more.

955
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
Open up and tell me shit.

956
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,600
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?

957
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
(<i>sighs</i>)

958
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.

959
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

960
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,800
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.

961
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,600
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

962
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,200
Duh.

963
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,800
You know
how every girl's parents

964
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,400
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

965
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,400
to keep them from having
premarital sex?

966
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Sure.

967
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,200
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.

968
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,900
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

969
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,700
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,

970
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,900
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

971
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,400
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants

972
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,400
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday

973
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,300
before we can have sex.

974
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,000
And Myra told you this?

975
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,100
Boyfriends and girlfriends

976
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,700
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.

977
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,800
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.

978
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,900
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?

979
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,400
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.

980
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,900
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?

981
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,900
Women.

982
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,100
I'll be right back.

983
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,900
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

984
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,100
Look who it is, Randal.

985
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Randal Graves.

986
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,600
You work here, too?

987
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,700
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

988
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...

989
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,900
Pickle Fucker.

990
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,000
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.

991
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,400
Nothing's changed.

992
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,

993
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,600
when you two aren't fighting

994
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,400
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,

995
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
you can still muster up
enough energy

996
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,700
to make fun of other people.

997
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,900
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,

998
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,700
so we can make fun of you.

999
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position

1000
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.

1001
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,400
32 and you're
flipping burgers?

1002
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop

1003
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,500
for, what, like, ten years?

1004
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,700
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.

1005
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
Who's an Internet millionaire?

1006
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,100
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

1007
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,500
We went to high school together.

1008
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,800
A few years ago,

1009
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,300
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

1010
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,900
of merchandise
you can buy online.

1011
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,400
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts.com.

1012
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,700
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

1013
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,200
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before

1014
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,200
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

1015
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,600
You see, freshman year,

1016
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

1017
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,400
what they called initiations.

1018
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,700
They'd stuff us into lockers

1019
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.

1020
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,600
But Lance here
got the worst of it.

1021
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
The seniors yanked
down his pants,

1022
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,300
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

1023
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,600
and made him walk ten feet.

1024
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,700
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

1025
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,900
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

1026
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Ew...

1027
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,500
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.

1028
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,700
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged

1029
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,300
after only four bites.

1030
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,200
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world

1031
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,900
who still remembers that,
Graves.

1032
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,700
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...

1033
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,700
Pickle Fucker.

1034
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest

1035
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,300
in building
the ultimate fan site

1036
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,700
for both <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
and <i>The Transformers?</i>

1037
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Because I'd moderate it
for free.

1038
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,800
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

1039
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,600
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

1040
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1041
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,600
Don't insult the guy.

1042
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,700
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.

1043
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,300
Thank you!

1044
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,600
I keep telling them that.

1045

Here, here's my e-mail address.

1046

Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.

Cool.

Okay, let's see.

1049
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,100
What do I want?

1050
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,100
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

1051
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,900
I'll get your order.

Well, that was fast.

1054

And fresh.

1055
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Thanks. Come again.

1056
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,900
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

1057
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,100
You know what?

1058
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Take mine.

1059
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,400
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?

1060
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,600
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

1061
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,200
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!

1062
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
You know,
I don't eat fast food.

1063
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,600
It's not good for you.

1064
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,500
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

1065
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,700
well, I just had
to see it for myself.

1066
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,600
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.

1067
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,100
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know

1068
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,300
that some things never change.

1069
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,900
