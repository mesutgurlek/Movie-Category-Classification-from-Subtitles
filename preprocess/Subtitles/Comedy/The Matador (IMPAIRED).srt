"They call my amigo

- Oh, please.

492
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Please. My handler...

493
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,080
...calls me a facilitator.

494
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
A facilitator of fatalities.

495
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
That's insane.

496
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,560
Think what you like.

497
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,280
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,

498
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,840
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.

499
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.

500
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,480
I sell aluminum siding
in Minneapolis.

501
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,800
- You actually kill people for a living?
- I do what I'm asked to do.

502
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,320
What makes sense to me.

503
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,160
For like, the Mob?

504
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,840
I tend to be hired
on the more kind of

505
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,440
anonymous high-paying jobs.

506
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,360
Oorporate gigs.

507
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Oorporate gigs?

508
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm a great helper
in getting deals closed.

509
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,320
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

510
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,880
- I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
- I don't believe you.

511
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,840
Oome on! Oorporate gigs.

512
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,680
- Think what you will.
- Ridiculous.

513
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,160
- Yes!
- Oorporate gigs.

514
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,520
Yes! My God...

515
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.

516
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,480
Uh-huh.

517
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
All right, see that guy over there?

518
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,280
- Fat man and little girl?
- Yeah.

519
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
Say I wanted him dead.

520
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,760
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.

521
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,960
- Right here.
- Right now? Oouldn't happen.

522
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,960
I know, but say that it could.

523
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
- Money's no object.
- OK.

524
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,280
- You sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

525
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

526
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,080
I want you to facilitate it.

527
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,920
OK, Danny.

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
All right, come with me.

529
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,240
- Huh?
- Let's go.

530
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,200
[Crowd] Olél

531
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Olél

532
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,760
Olél

533
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Olél

534
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,200
I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory
of assassinations.

535
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,000
Gotta pee?

536
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,560
Everyone's gotta pee.

537
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,000
Ah.

538
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,600
Now...

539
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,520
...ask me for a cigarette.

540
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,000
- What?
- Do it.

541
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Oan I have a cigarette, please?

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,360
Sure. But these things'll
kill ya, you know. [laughs]

543
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,720
Now, look around.

544
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
[Coughs]

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
They're scary.

546
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
- Yes and no.
- Why?

547
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,160
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women

548
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
coming and going
from the ladies' room.

549
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,440
That's good for us.

550
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,360
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.

551
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
They're only interested in us

552
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,720
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.

553
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,120
No one is watching
the men's room.

554
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
The gotta-pee theory.

555
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,840
You're catching on.

556
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,920
Now, escape routes.

557
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,440
- Escape routes?
- Don't wanna get caught, right?

558
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,880
Don't get caught, it sucks.

559
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,240
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

560
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,560
That's a traffic jam.

561
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,200
- Where else?
- You tell me.

562
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
OK, OK.

563
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,160
Uh, that door over there.

564
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,800
If it... if it weren't locked.

565
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,880
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together

566
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
I couldn't get a whiff
of her spring roll.

567
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,960
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.

568
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
Every lock can be broken.

569
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.

570
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,960
This looks like it's worth it.

571
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,880
[Julian] Uno cigarillos, por favor.

572
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,760
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

573
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
'Oause I wanna smoke.

574
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Gracias.

575
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,880
Oome over here.

576
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,560
Now do your shoelaces up.

577
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,760
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?

578
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,080
I think 2:00, Derrick.

579
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Let's go, Seymour.

580
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,280
[Cheering]

581
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
Holy shit!

582
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
[Chuckles]

583
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
[Crowd cheering]

584
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,880
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

585
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,640
You wanted to see
what I do, right?

586
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes.

587
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,520
Yes, I've been watching.

588
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,480
- But, you know...
- What? Show-and-tell is over.

589
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,720
The real deal is about to start.

590
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,680
- The real deal?
- Mm-hm.

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,520
Show-and-tell is for sissies.

592
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,280
But a sissy I'm not.

593
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,000
- Oome on!
- My God, fire!

594
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,360
- Oome on. It's a distraction.
- Are you crazy?

595
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,800
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.

596
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,920
Are you ready to finish
what we started?

597
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,640
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.

598
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,920
Baloney! Baloney!

599
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,280
The cops may have
gone towards the fire,

600
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,440
- but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
- Bodyguard?

601
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.

602
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,520
If they didn't, they'd ask you.

603
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
So I slit the guard's throat
in one move,

604
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,040
push him into the bathroom...

605
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,280
And now we're set up for the kill.

606
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,920
Where the hell
did you get the knife?

607
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,240
He's not peeing,
so it must be number dos.

608
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,600
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.

609
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,040
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Point made.

610
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
The point's made.
Let's get out of here...

611
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.

612
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,360
OK. Julian?

613
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm asking you to stop this!

614
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,120
No way, job's not done.

615
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,360
But this is not a job!

616
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,760
You said money was no object!

617
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,800
# Bingo was his name-o #

618
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
- This is want you wanted?
- No!

619
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
- You helped me.
- I didn't help you!

620
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,400
Oh, yes, you did!

621
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
- Oh, yes, you did!
- No! No, no.

622
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
Oh, God, no!

623
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,360
Oh! Disculpa me, por favor.

624
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,720
Lo siento.

625
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Fun, huh?

626
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,680
[Laughing]

627
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,640
Oome on. [laughing]

628
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,520
[Danny] Whoo-hoo!
That was incredible!

629
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,360
- You scared the hell out of me!
- You liked that. You did?

630
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,080
- I really bought it!
- What, that I'd stab a stranger?

631
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,720
[Laughing] I don't know.

632
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Just like that?
A complete stranger?

633
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,080
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.

634
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,960
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know.

635
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
- Psychopathic, not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

636
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,480
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?

637
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, yeah, but...

638
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,120
- Don't get the wrong impression.
- Huh?

639
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.

640
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,560
No, what you do is unsavory.

641
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,040
You know what they say.
You are what you do.

642
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
Gracias.

643
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,920
Gracias.

644
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Tell me...

645
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,440
...will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?

646
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,240
- What?
- Will Bean stay with you

647
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,480
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?

648
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
If she ever left me
I'd fall apart...

649
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,440
You're not answering my question.

650
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
To be quite honest...

651
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,400

the woman has left in her.

652

[Sighs] Hey.

653
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,840
Hey.

654
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,560

655
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,840
- Hey.
- Let's change the subject. Please.

656
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
- I agree.
- Something sunnier.

657
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,880
Sunnier.

658
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Absolutely.

659
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,640
There's something
I wanted to talk about.

660
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,440
- It's a favor, really.
- Sure.

661
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.

662
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,560
No, it's OK.

663
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,080
See, the thing is...

664
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,920
...I could use your help.

665
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Help in what?

666
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,120
I'm down here,

667
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,240
I finished my otherjob early,
so I let it be known.

668
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
You let it be known?

669
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,080
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.

670
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,280
- The powers that be?
- Yeah.

671
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,480
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.

672
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,840
An-anotherjob?

673
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Mm-hm.

675
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,440
The thing is, I could
really use your help.

00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
Oh! [laughs]

677

You're kidding right now.

678
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm as serious
as an erection problem.

679

- I mean, I...
- Gracias.

680
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,560
I can't help you, Julian.

681
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,960
You could.

682
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Well, I could, but I-I can't,

683
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm not gonna help
kill an innocent man.

684
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,040
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous.

685
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,280
- Just assisting.
- No!

686
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
- You'd just have to...
- No, no, no, no!

687
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

688
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,680
- Bup...
- You're being childish.

689

Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka...

690
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,240
- Not listening.
- Ohildish.

691
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you...

692
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,200
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
- All right. All right.

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,600
I won't tell you.

694
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,640
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

695
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,040
- Great.
- I won't say that

696
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,000
all you have to do
is trip on the street.

697
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,120
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Just trip in half an hour

698
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
- so his bodyguards look the other way.
- No way.

699
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,480
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.

700
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,080
- No.
- A lot of money. Oash.

701
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,080
- It could be interesting and fun.
- I said no.

702

He's a prick, a real prick!

703

who he is or what he did

704

or anything like that.

705

I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.

I'll... I'll leave.

- Ohange the subject.
- Good. You do it.

710

- Ohange it.
- You.

711
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,440
- Fine.
- OK.

712
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,280
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

713
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,960
Really. A cheerleader.

714
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,440
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

715
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,080
Seriously?

716
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,800
Mm-hm.

717
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,960
That's so funny.

718
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,960
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader...

719
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,320
Jesus Ohrist, Danny!
I'm fucking kidding!

720
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,360
I don't want to
talk about cheerleaders

721
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,880
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them!

722
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,160
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to!

723
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,480
There's nothing
to talk about!

724
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,800
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.

725
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, come...
Now, Julian...

726
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Oome on, what are you...
You're leaving?

727
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,080
I've got business to attend to.

728
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,080
- I really thought...
- Nothing.

729
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,560
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.

730
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,520
Bye, Danny.

731
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,840
Julian!

732
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,560
[Phil] So unfortunately,
I was right.

733
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,720
I finally got in touch with Alejandra

734
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,160
and she said her bosses are

735
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,480
leaning towards Cardenas
and his group,

736
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,920
and not us.

737
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
Now, things still might
break in our favor.

738
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,920
I mean, their first instinct
was to go with us,

739
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,960
but they're getting intense pressure

740
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
to sign with a Mexican company.

741
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm trying to get Antonio
so I can set up

742
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,240
one more meeting
with you guys tomorrow.

743
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,160
I'll call you
when I hear something.

744
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,920

It's not over yet.

Oome on, Danny,

749
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,520
I just want to say I'm sorry.

750

I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

But... I'm sorry.

I'm a mess! I'm a fucker! Ha!

have asked you to help me.

I infringed on your kindness,

but please...

756
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
...let me tell you I'm sorry.

Let me apologize.

how guilty I feel?

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,200
I don't know if they'll
let you back in.

809
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,880
And then what
are you gonna do?

810
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,120
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers

811
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
for suck-and-fuck sessions
behind the Old Navy store?

812
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,360
- Sounds delightful to me.
- Julian, do this job.

813
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,240
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.

814
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,720
How do you know?

815
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,560
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?

[Bell tolls]

823
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,560
We have a problem, Mr. Randy.

824
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,000
The problem is Julian Noble.

825
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,000
Seems he didn't
deliver the portfolio.

826
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,040
You know...

827
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,440
...it says it took 53 years

828
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,320
to paint this ceiling.

829
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,800
People are upset, Mr. Randy.

830

Mr. Stick is upset.

Mr. Stick knows?

832
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,720
Mr. Stick knows.

833
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,080
Well, he knows we can fix it.

834
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,120
I'm just the messenger.

835

But he knows we can fix it.

836

We always fix any problems.

837
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
You can't fix it with Noble.

Ladies.

839
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,680
All right. I'll replace him.

840
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,920
No.

841
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,280
Yes, you'll replace him,

842
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,720
but no.

843
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,080
Mr. Stick has asked
for other things.

844
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,040
No, it's ridiculous.

I know.

860
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,480
It's such a long time, really,
when you think about it.

861
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,360
Seems like yesterday, right?

862
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,840
Henry was alive...

863
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,640
...here.

864
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,400
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.

865
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,440
And they called me Hippo Hips

866
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,600
and Plate of Beans, the works.

867
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,080
And even though I did basketball

868
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,320
and... and chorus and...

869
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,080
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong...

870
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,280
...I never was.

871
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,560
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.

872
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,920
And I...

873
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,800
I always thought
I would believe them.

874
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,960
Until I met you.

875
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,920
You arrived in 12th grade...

876
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,080
...and you told me
that I was pretty.

877
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,920
And for the first time,
I believed it.

878
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,800
You told me that I was sexy.

879
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,320
You were sexy back there
on the dryer.

880
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,240
And when Henry died...

881
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,120
[crying]... you told me
to stay strong...

882
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,080
...and that we would
get through it.

883
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,400
And we did.

884
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,920
We did.

885
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,200
It's because you
never gave up on me.

886
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,440
I never could.

887

I never will.

How did you find me?

I found a whore
with a heart of gold once.

I've heard so much about you.

And me, you.

Oh...

There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.

[Chuckling] Danny...

I don't know.

I hope it's all right, my being here.

of the night. [chuckling]

- Yes, it's...
- Well...

933
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,760
I could sure use some coffee.

934
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,760
Just a cup.

935
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,680
Yes. All right.

936
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,280
Of course.
I could get coffee.

937
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,040
That'd be great.

938
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,800
- Or some whiskey?
- Even better.

939
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,760
- Mm.
- Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.

00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,280

Well, whiskey, at least.

942
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,360
This is really odd.

943
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,320
Really, really odd.

944
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,200
I could ask him to leave.

945
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,200
We just asked him to stay.

946
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,240
We could change our minds.

947
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,960
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

948
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,920
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

949
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,160
But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.

950
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,960
You said he was a nice guy.

951
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,480
He is. For an assassin,
he's... very nice.

952
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,920
Fuck.

953
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,480
Fuckity-fuck!

954
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,760
What? I'm allowed to curse.

955
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,520
Especially now.
If not now, when?

956
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,240
True.

957
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,000
This is the fucking perfect time

958
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,720
to be fucking cursing.

959
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,360
There's a fucking killer

960
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,280
standing in our
fucking living room.

961
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,000
Do you think he
would show me his gun?

962
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,120
[Bean] A toast, maybe?

963
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,840
To a stranger,

964
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,200
arriving in
the middle of the night.

965
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,720
Well, you're not a stranger.

966
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,600
Well, I'm pretty strange.

967
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,480
Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.

968
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,960
Far from it.

969
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,080
The toast really
should be to you, Danny.

970
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,560
And to you, Bean.

971
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,440
For your hospitality
and your warmth.

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,240
I never thought
I'd see you again, Julian.

975
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,360
I never thought
I'd see you again, Danny.

976
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,600
But, well...

977
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,040
...things, uh...

978
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,880
Things change.
They just change.

979
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,720
[Julian] Is that...?

980
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,800
- You saved it.
- I did.

981
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,800
You saved it.
I can't believe it.

982
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,200
- [Bean] He still talks about that.
- No, it's...

983
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,200
It touches me
that you kept it.

984
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,560
How could I not?

985
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,080
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

986
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,720
So Danny told you what I did?

987
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,880
Professionally?

988
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,160
Did you bring your gun?

989
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,400
Yes... as a matter of fact.

990
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,320
May I see it?

991
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,880
Really?

992
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,080
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's notjust...

993
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,440
- Here you go.
- OK.

994
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,920
Is that a.38?

995
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,600
Yes, it is.

996
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,040
You know your guns, Bean.

997
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,360
Yes, well...

998
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,040
My God.

999
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,880
You are a magnificent woman.

1000
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,240
Hm.

1001
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,440
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.

1002
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,120
Bean, tell me,

1003
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,080
did Danny tell you everything

1004
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,280
about our time
in Mexico together?

1005
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,280
Yes, I'm sure. Why?

1006
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,840
Oh.

1007
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,200
My God, you look great, Danny.

1008
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,880
[Laughing] Really great.

1009
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,280
- You do too, Julian.
- Oh, no.

1010
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,000
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning

1011
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,000
after the Navy left town.

1012
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,160
But you...

1013
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,520
Life's been good to you,
am I right?

1014
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,040
Pretty good, yeah.

1015
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,440
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?

1016
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,120
I do.

1017
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,360
So you got thatjob
you were in Mexico for?

1018
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,640
We did.

1019
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,600
And your luck?
It's better, right?

1020
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,600
No more trees in the kitchen?

1021
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,160
You told him about that?

1022
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,440
And you love Bean
more than ever.

1023
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,880
Mm. That I do.

1024
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,680
Then what more could you want?

1025
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,920
Here's a toast.

1026
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,400
To a man with respect again,

1027
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,960
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves

1028
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,760
and to me.

1029
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,800
What is the toast to you for?

1030
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,080
Toast to a dead man, Bean.

1031
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,440
Toast to a dead man.

1032
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,960
[Julian] Then about two months ago
I had this job in Manila.

1033
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,440
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.

1034
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,880
I like the hot climate.

1035
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,440
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.

1036
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,560
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.

1037
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,960
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what "burnt-out" meant at the time.

1038
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,840
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.

1039
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,360
[Julian] I was having panic attacks.

1040
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,560
I was completely
losing control of myself.

1041
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,920
I tried to counter this
with booze, of course,

1042
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,800
but nothing was working.

1043
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,920
I drank and drank and...

1044
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,400
...nothing.

1045
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,920
I was still feeling edgy,

1046
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,840
still feeling like
my head was going to explode.

1047
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,400
So...

1048
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
...I moved on
to my other usual diversions.

1049
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,240
A wonderful little
whorehouse I knew

1050
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,440
right off of Mabini Street.

1051
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,120
But that wasn't workin'either.

1052
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
And a good fuck usually does.

1053
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,680
Excuse my French.

1054
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,360
- Go on.
- So I had this assignment.

1055
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,000
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,

1056
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,720
someone doesn't
want him around.

1057
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,040
You know,
my usual type gig.

1058
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,040
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy

1059
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,720
always came to this sweaty little
outdoor market every Thursday

1060
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,040
to buy fruit.

1061
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,080
The guy liked his fruit.

1062
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,000
[Monkeys chattering]

1063
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,160
It was a simple plan.

1064
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,080
As he walks through the crowds
I bump into him

1065
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,280
and stab him.

1066
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,360
The thing was,
I was still a mess.

1067
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,520
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him,

1068
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,440
but I saw a little boy insteadl

1069
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,560
And it wasn't just any boy.

1070
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,040
It was me.

1071
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,080
Me, as a child!

1072
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,960
It was freaky shit, right?

1073
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,560
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.

1074
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,440
Still readied the knife,
still prepared for thejob.

1075
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,920
But...

1076
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,720
...I couldn't do it.

1077
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,160
I just couldn't do it.

1078
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,240
Then what happened?

1079
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,840
I woke up in a pile
of donkey shit.

1080
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,760
I fainted.

1081
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,400
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.

1082
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,760
[Donkeys braying]

1083
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,160
And since then,

1084
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,560
it's been extremely
hot and cold.

1085
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,760
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.

1086
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,680
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.

1087
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,600
Froze.

1088
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,240
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.

1089
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,920
[Sighs] Oouldn't finish the job.

1090
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,680
And that was that.

1091
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,240
And now it's just a matter of time.

1092
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,720
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?

1093
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,280
Like Mary Beth
in Human Resources?

1094
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,680
Oome on, this is...
this is insane.

1095
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,840
They're gonna kill you
for botching a job?

1096
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,040
Mm-hm.

1097
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,720
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,

1098
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,240
you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.

1099
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,080
You know,
I was a little burned out,

1100
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,640
and I'm a little messed up."

1101
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,960
I mean, can't you do that?
But...

1102
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,800
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.

1103
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,680
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.

1104
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,640
But certainly,
they have to see that.

1105
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,880
No, they don't.
They don't.

1106
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,400
I mean, I...

1107
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,800
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life

1108
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,520
and tipped me off to the plans.

1109
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,520
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

1110
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,560
And how did you end up here?

1111
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,240
In Denver?

1112
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,520
Hm.

1113
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,920
That's funny.

1114

the problem I shared
with Danny in Mexico,

1117

is that I don't have a home.

01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,480
She's lovely.

1135
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
[Danny] She's everything to me.

1136
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,200
You said that to me in Mexico.

1137
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,880
And I nodded and listened...

1138
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,560
...but now I see.

1139
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,080
I see.

1140
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,280
You were right.

1141
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,360
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?

1142
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,360
I told her about
our time together, yes.

1143
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,440
And where does that story end?

1144
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,400
She knows the last I heard of you

1145
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,120
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night

1146
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,120
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

1147
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,320
That's what you said?

1148
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,000
That I knocked and knocked.

1149
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,120
And you never answered?

1150
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,280
Yes.

1151
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,920
[Bean] Gentlemen.

1152
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,800
- I'm a bit drunk.
- [Julian chuckles]

1153
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,080
That's a nice place to be.

1154
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,960
Julian, you will stay
the night, of course?

1155
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, thank you, Bean.

1156
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,240
I promise I'll be
out of here tomorrow.

1157
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,160
Oh, let's not talk about that now.

1158
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,720
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest

1159
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,640
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.

1160
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,720
It's good, right?

1161
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,160
- Oh, it's very good.
- Hey...

1162
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,080
Oan I turn on your stereo?

1163
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,920
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,

1164
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,960
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?

1165
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,560
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?

1166
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,000
Is that OK?

1167
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,520
Oertainly. I guess.

I hope you approve, but...

1171
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,440
...I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.

1172
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,440
Julian, you have had
too much to drink.

1173

Bean.

1174
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,920
Please, may I have this dance?

I can't think about the headache
I'm gonna have.

[Both laughing]

1199

The only woman I ever loved.

1200
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,760
My mother.

1201
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,720
- What about your wife?
- Hm?

1202
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,880
- My wife?
- Danny told me that you were married

1203
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,800
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.

1204
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,960
Um...

1205

Oh, my God!

I can't believe this!

1207
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,520
I was never married.

1208
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,920
- I can't believe this!
- No car accident?

1209
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,320
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son

1210
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,680
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.

1211
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,960
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.

1212

No, no, no, no, no!

1213

You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!

1214
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,800
The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,

1215
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,000
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.

1216

Because... well, now we're friends.

Oh.

We are friends, aren't we?

1219
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,200
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?

1220
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,280
Yeah, are you even
a hit man, Julian?

Yeah, a facility fatalitator,
whatever the fuck you call yourself.

Yes, I am.

tell the truth when I can.

just roll over us
like the summer breeze.

Next we shall be
wife swapping. Ha!

Oome on.
I've gotta talk to you.

1248

What is it, Julian?
What do you want?

1249

We can't talk about it here.

- What?
- Oome on.

1251

[Danny] OK, Julian,
we're in your rent-a-car.

- What is it?
- The thing is, Danny...

01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,680
...the thing I didn't tell you,

1254
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,120
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,

1255
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,560
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.

1256
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,560
- Well, that's good.
- I know, I know.

1257
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,800
No, that's really good.
What is it?

1258
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,480
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does

1259
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,160
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.

1260
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,280
Is that how you stay in contact?
Oat-sitter ads?

1261
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,040
Yeah.

1262
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,840
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.

1263
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,040
- I'm so tired, Julian.
- Well, anyway,

1264
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,960
he contacted me four days ago

1265
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,400
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups

1266
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,360
and got me a reprieve.

1267
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,440
Well, like I said, that's...
that's... great news.

1268
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,640
The thing is...

1269
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,000
...he's asked me
to do one more job.

1270
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,080
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.

1271
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,320
Right.

1272
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,680
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.

1273
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,800
All right.

1274
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,200
What's the problem?

1275
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,720
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.

1276
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,080
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

1277
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,520
Because the job...

1278
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,520
...involves you.

1279
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,560
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.

1280
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,800
What do you think I'm saying?

1281
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,680
You know what
I think you're saying.

1282
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,440
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.

1283
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,000
Does somebody want me dead?

1284
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,160
- No.
- What's that?

1285
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,760
No one wants you dead, Danny.

1286
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,240
- Jesus!
- [Whimpering] You scared me!

1287
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,320
No. No...

1288
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,520
You were doing that...

1289
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,240
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.

1290
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,600
- What?
- I need your help.

1291
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,480
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.

1292
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,280
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.

1293
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,520
I'm a complete mess.

1294
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I don't know
if I can do this job by myself.

1295
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,920
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.

1296
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
- I don't know colleagues.
- You must!

1297
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,040
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you.

1298
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,320
I know you're not
the ideal candidate...

1299
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,800
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.

1300
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,480
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?

1301
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,240
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!

1302
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,640
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?

1303
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,120
Oan be.

1304
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,560
- Oh... I'm going to sleep.
- Danny, come on.

1305
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,760
You don't even need
a second person.

1306
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,800
Haven't you done these things yourself?

1307
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,800
Some jobs are better
with two men.

1308
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,160
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,

1309
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,560
and... and unprepared.

1310
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,040
And unqualified and uninterested!

1311
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,440
Now I'm gonna go to bed.

1312
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,720
I'm in a very dangerous position here.

1313
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

1314
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,640
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.

1315
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,560
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.

1316
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,400
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.

1317
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,360
Huh? I can't do that.

1318
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,840
Yeah.

1319
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,880
Danny! Danny, please!

1320
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,400
I need your help!

1321
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,520
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.

1322
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,080
Which would you rather? Hm?

1323
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,080
Look,

1324
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,720
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

1325
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,160
Free and clear, Danny!

1326
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,000
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island

1327
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,280
with beautiful Greeks.

1328
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,800
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

1329
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,120
- I can't.
- Oh, damn it, Danny!

And...

1333
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,400
- Oh...
- And what?

1334
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,840

01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,560
You owe me.

1337
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,800
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?

1338
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,200
Today. The horse races.

1339
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,520
- Today?
- Yeah, Arizona.

1340
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,000
No, that couldn't happen.

1341
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,480
Sorry, no choice.

1342
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,720
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

1343
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,000
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.

1344
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,720
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?

1345
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,440
Well, I-I don't know.

1346
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,360
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.

1347
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,560
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.

1348
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,120
How will you do that, Julian?

1349
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,560
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.

1350
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,480
Plenty of time
to catch the 2:30 back.

1351
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,200
- We do?
- Mm-hm.

1352
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,360
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.

1353
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,840
Now, chop-chop.

1354
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,800
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.

1355
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,640
We've gotta get
this road on the show. Eh?

1356

I was a mess back there.

You helped me.

You helped me a lot.

I think I can handle
the deviant Julian.

1453
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,320
I can handle the lying Julian.

1454
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,840
I can even handle
the killing Julian.

1455
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,360
I just don't know if I can
handle the humble pie Julian.

...no problem.

You said it yourself.

I owed you.

I know it's late,

Yeah.

you would regret it instantly

1492

I know you don't.

You're not that type of person.

no longer on the hit list.

on the hit list,

wanted you to do this job.
