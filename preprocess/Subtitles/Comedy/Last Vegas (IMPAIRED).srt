Hundred dollars
says Paddy will not come.

313
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,668
No, no, he's got to come.

more times than I can count.

- Ah.

a bathrobe convention.

Well, the three of us are, uh,

a permanent scowl.

- I don't!

or we move in.

You show up out of nowhere,

You know what?

- Oh, Paddy, Billy Gher--?

Billy, we want him to come,
of course.

344

But then he--
You know, he's got a big

- important thing he has to do.
- Of course.

He always has something important.

347

That's the problem.
It's always about him, him, him.

things to do.

They're everywhere.

that's all I see: Sophie!

don't you think?

I'm leaving this apartment,

but leave my hat out of this, okay?

- The stairs. Paddy.

You got to come.

373
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,598
You got to come
to Vegas with us.

- Please, Paddy.
- Okay. Okay.

Okay! All right, I'll go!

I'll go! I'm going!
I'm going, okay?

- I got to pack.

So Billy was so busy,

381
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,414
he couldn't spend the weekend with
his three oldest friends in the world.

382
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,669
Typical.

383

Once a selfish bastard,
always a selfish bastard.

Never, never changes.

385

You know, that's the thing
about him, he's just the way he is.

386
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,888
What was so important that
he couldn't spend it with us?

387
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,093
So important?

388
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,304
I agree with everything
you've said, Paddy.

391
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,438
He didn't even call.

392
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,350
You know, he-- A disappointment.
He didn't...

393
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,860
He didn't even call.
All I can say is, if I ever,

394
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,363
ever run into that son of a bitch
again, that prick, I'll...

403

and take all my damn pills.

00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,277
And I'm sure
this young lady can help you.

616
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,187
See you back here.

617
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,949
DIANA: Ah, this is
the one, this is the one.

618
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,702
Okay, so put a dollar down.

619
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,113
- I don't gamble.
- Oh, this is not gambling.

620
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,452
This, my friend, is a sure thing.

621
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,995
- Yeah, but it's throwing money away.
- Come on, Paddy, give me a dollar.

622
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,171
- Perfect, we're in.

Come on.

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,593
Oh, congratulations!
Five dollars off the buffet.

626
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,382
Yes, we did it.

627
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,553
Our lives are changed forever,
Paddy. Can you feel it?

628
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,938
All right, Paddy, you just won
five dollars off the buffet.

629
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,065
- What are you gonna do first?
- Go to the buffet.

630
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,067
He's going to the buffet,
ladies and gentlemen,

631
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,728
the man is going to the buffet.
Yay!

632
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,114
Paddy, Paddy, Paddy, uh, uh,
the good news is that this hotel

633
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,991
actually does have rooms.

634
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,823
The bad news is that
none are available.

635
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,243
Don't tell Billy, please.

636
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,872
I don't give a flying fart about Billy.
Where am I gonna sleep?

637
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,249
Well, they said
they might have some after 6.

638
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,001
So here's the deal:

639
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,333
Lisa wants me
to check out the chapel.

640
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,839
Heh, she's got you on a short leash,
doesn't she?

641
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,592
- Kids these days.
- Well, would Mrs. Don Rickles

642
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,423
happen to know
where the chapel is?

643
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,463
I do, and I will show you.

644
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,007
- That's okay, that's fine, I'll find it--
- No, no, no, shh.

Sort of. I emptied out

I was a tax attorney.

Um, I raised a daughter on my own.

Her father was an asshole
of epic proportions,

I found myself downsized
and empty-nested,

752
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,420
and I asked myself,

"What do you really want to do
with your life, Diana Boyle?"

was sing.

758

00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,762
Bloody Mary, please.
Extra bloody.

1232
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,227
Sophie wouldn't want me hanging
around the apartment in my bathrobe.

1233
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,861
- No, she wou--
- Shut up.

1234
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,900
So I'm not gonna do that anymore,
and I'm having a Bloody Mary.

1235
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,946
I used to like Bloody Marys.
Maybe I'll like them again.

1236
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,541
I'm gonna ask you something.

1237
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,833
Do you love this Lisa girl
the way I loved Sophie?

1238
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,923
She's a wonderful person,
really great human being.

1239
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,013
Well, that's great. I'll vote for her
when she runs for Congress.

1240
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,887
Billy, you're gonna
be 70 years old.

1241
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,851
Tomorrow you're marrying
a 31-year-old woman

1242
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,560
who you proposed to at a funeral.

1243
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,855
Now, I don't give
a flying crap about you,

1244
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,066
but if I did, I gotta tell you,
I see a few red flags.

1245
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,866
Tomorrow I'm gonna ask you again if
you love her. I expect a better answer.

1246
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,944
SAM: He left his room.
ARCHIE: Ha, ha.

1247
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,121
(ALL LAUGH)

1248
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,032
PADDY: Hey.
- Hey.

1249
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,371
SAM:
The old gang.

1250
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,877
We're throwing a party tonight.

1251
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,333
SAM:
Yeah, that's the spirit. Yeah, a party.

1252
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,089
- Happy day!
- Excuse me.

1253
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,836
- Oh, crap.
- I, um...

1254
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,594
I just wanted to, uh, apologize
for, uh-- For last night.

1255
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,009
Uh, I was way out
of line, and, um,

1256
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:24,139
you know, I had too much to drink,
and I am just really, really sorry.

1257
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,604
I throw myself at your mercy.

1258
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,986
LONNIE: I was just downloading Dean
on who you guys were.

1259
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:34,491
He didn't know that you were
the heads of four very influential

1260
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,242
East Coast families.

1261
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,824
DEAN:
Yeah, I had-- I had no idea.

1262
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,739
Well, I wouldn't expect
a dickhead like you

1263
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,500
to know about
legends like us.

1264
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,706
- I-- I'm a dickhead.
- Knuckles.

1265
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,088
Knuckles.

1266
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,794
Knuckles, get the guy
out of my sight.

1267
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,177
Yeah. You know, you're a dumb
little shit, you know that?

1268
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,059
- Oh, no, please.
- You don't know who these guys are?

1269
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,472
Archie Aces,
Billy Bones,

1270
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,231
- Sammy the...
- The accountant.

1271
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,767
- Yeah, the accountant.
- Ugh.

1272
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,904
Sammy the Stove, they call me.
I cook the books.

1273
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,440
I'm just-- I'm sorry.

1274
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,028
What do we care
about your sorrys?

1275
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,990
No, I know, I know, I know.
I don't give a damn about my sorrys.

1276
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,529
Just please...

1277
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,039
Shut up, shut up.
Just go get us some ice water.

1278
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,792
When that's done, you come back,
you do some other things for us.

1279
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,579
Maybe Knuckles here
will let you wash his balls.

1280
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,045
Sorry, that was weird.

1281
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,553
- Four ice waters?
- Go.

1282
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,842
PADDY: What was that all about?
- I-- You were great.

1283
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,806
I-- Maybe I overdid it.

1284
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,603
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1285
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,141
I, uh,
obviously misread you guys.

1286
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,900
You guys sold the shit out of that.

1287
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,527
So, what do you guys want me to do?

1288
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,530
Nothing. No, today,
you take the afternoon off,

1289
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,566
have another drink, go to the spa.

1290
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,155
Save your energy. It's gonna
be a big night for you tonight.

1291
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,535
You got some thinking to do.

1292
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,989
And we got some recruiting to do.

1293
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,578
Yeah. We need to recruit
some talent, gentlemen.

1294
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,915
Yeah, I want the A-list.
B-- The double-D list.

1295
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,500
That is the A-list, actually.

1296
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,300
(PADDY CLEARS THROAT)

1297
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:24,594
I like this one, although,
is she throwing up or crying?

1298
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,136
LONNIE:
Definitely throwing up.

1299
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,774
By 6.

1300
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,735
By 6?

1301
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:10,847
My turn.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

1303
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,778
Yeah, now we're talking.

1304
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,999
Yeah.

1305
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,335
- These two, these two.
SAM: Yeah, that-- Yeah.

1306
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,720
There you go.
Oh, here, here!

1307
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,300
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1308
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,633
Hi. Oh, thanks.

1309

1310
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,020
It's really gonna be great.
Party tonight.

1311
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,852
Yeah, thanks. Oh, thanks.

1312
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,608
MINISTER: If we were
able to, I would release...

1313
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,522
I told you to put those
in one and two.

1314
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,361
Okay. Oh, no.

1315
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,151
- Take those back. I'm sorry.
- Where to?

1316
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,788
Here we go. Let's do it.
Wait, are you--?

- Ha, ha.
- So sad.

You're right.

1329

Ay, ay.

1331
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,937
Okay, one personal question.

1332
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,896
Why haven't you ever
gotten married until now?

1333
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,484
Well, Why should I?

1334
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,991
I get to do everything I want to do
whenever I want to.

1335

I mean, what's wrong with that?

1336
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,950
There's no mention of love?

1337
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,907
No, no, no, I'm--
I'm not the falling-in-love type.

1338
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,960
Okay.

1339
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:40,793
Truth is, there was only one girl
in my entire life

1340
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,208
that I fell in love with.

1341
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,876
I let her get away.

1342
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,886
Who was that?

1343
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,600
You shouldn't have used up
your one personal question.

1344
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:56,559
- Oh, you are holding on so tight.
- Ha, ha.

1345
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,396
Oh, Mr. Big-Shot,
I know where I'm taking you.

MAN: Take a seat, please.
- You have got to be kidding.

1347
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,867
What's the matter, princess?
Scared of heights?

1348
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,998
Yes, the princess
is scared of heights.

1349
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,785
Well, I won't think less of you
if you throw up or cry.

1350
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,671
Actually, I might if you cry.
Please don't cry.

1351
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,503
- I won't cry.
- Billy,

1352
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,340
I think I have to ask you
one more personal question.

1353
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:28,503
Whoa!

1354
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,055
What?

1355
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,426
You're getting married tomorrow.

1356

What are you doing here with me?

1357
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,522
Well, you know
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1358
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:42,730
- What are you doing here with me?
- Oh, see, I do have an answer.

1359
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,816
I...like you.

1360
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:49,324
I liked you from the moment
that I saw you.

1361
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,530
None of which matters
if you love Lisa.

1362
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,740
Do you?

1363
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,579
(WHIRRING)

1364
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,366
What's--? No, no. No, no.
Oh, no, no. No!

1365
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:02,288
No! No! No!

01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,426
I knew you would like it.

1369
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,762
Oh, yeah, no, I love it, I love it!
It's great.

1370
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,768
Oh, good, because it goes
up and down three more times.

1371
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,101
Oh, it-- it's-- What? Aah!

1372
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,525
For a minute there, I thought
you were trying to kill me.

1373
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,560
Well, you wouldn't answer
my personal questions,

1374
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,607
so I thought I needed to scare
the answers out of you.

1375
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,153
All right, well, Paddy and I, right?
When we were kids,

1376
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,539
we were in love
with the same girl.

1377
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,079
Sophie.

1378
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,916
She's the one who got away?

1379
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,621
Yeah.

1380
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,383
First, you know,
it was just two best friends

1381
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,886
competing for the same girl,

1382
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,053
but as we got older, it got

saw me first.

she belonged with Paddy.

when we were kids and it stuck.

Oh, right. Paddy!
It's so great to finally meet you.

1696
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,516
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Billy's told me so much.

1697
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,025
Why did you throw him in the pool?

1698
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,152
Ah, that's just an old game
from the neighborhood.

1699
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,188
Listen, dear.
Can I tell you something?

1700
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,323
- Yeah.
- Fifty years ago,

1701
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,576
Billy did something for me

1702
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,613
that allowed me to marry
the only woman I ever loved.

1703
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:47,702
And now it's my chance
to return the favor.

1704
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,165
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- He's not in love with you.

1705
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,164
He likes you.
I know he likes you a whole lot,

1706
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,174
but he doesn't love you
like the way that he should.

1707
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,169
I can't let him marry you.
