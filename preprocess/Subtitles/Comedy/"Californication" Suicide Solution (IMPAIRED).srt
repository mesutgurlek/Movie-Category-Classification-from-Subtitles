I used to love that place
when I was a kid.

327

I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about right now,

328

but I have some very good news.

329

Eddie Nero wants to sit down.

330
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,050
Why?

331
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,919
Why? Because he wants to
play you, dumbass, in the movie.

332
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:17,554
No, I hate that fuck,

When in doubt,
call in the Bad Lieutenant.

loves to show his dong.

Got to love that in a Thespian.

338

You're gonna have a good time.
Come on. Here we go.

341
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,602
Will there be
alcoholic beverages?

342
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,138
Most def. Most def.
As many as you like.

343
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:38,609
And I'm sure there will be
kind words and flattery.

344
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:40,477
Can we stop
at In-n-Out on the way?

Yes, Hank.
We can stop at In-n-Out.

We all do.

351
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,777
So is there a script?

352
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,879
- Fuck no.

Ish.

a sizeable boner when I'm done.

about you, Moody?

No, what's that?

You're handsome.

A handsome man
comes with a price.

It's a burden.
