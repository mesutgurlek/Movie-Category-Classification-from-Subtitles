It's beautiful.

So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,607
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

[Sighs] Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,650
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,854
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,488
You better believe they did...
every single one of them.

Mm-hmm. You did good.

No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

18
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,488
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

with the great schools
and the amazing view...

so much space?

we're talking about.

They deserve the best.

We still have to name them.

You want to name
all of them right now?

this half Marlin Junior...

to be Marlin Junior.

Well, they... I'm mixed up.

161
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,673
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

162
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,605
None of them were walking,
so forget that I...

163
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,299
None of them were walking,
so forget that I...

164
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,502
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

165
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,773
- Whoa!
- All right, you kids!

166
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,873
Ooh, where'd you go?

167
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,419
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?

168
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,354
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

169
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,480
[Squishing]

170

[Cries]

172
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,055
That's where I would play.

173
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,456
[Laughing]

174
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,795
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

175
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,357
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

176
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,369
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

177
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,837
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

178
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,305
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

179
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,401
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

180
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,536
but you can't really tell.

181
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,949
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

182
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,351
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

183
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,251
- Ah-choo!
- I'm obnoxious.

184
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,684
...Oh...

185
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,586
...Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones...

186
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,717
...Let's name
the zones of the open sea...

KIDS: Mr. Ray!

188
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,854

- You better stay with me.

189

...Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic...

190

...All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see...

191
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,700
Huh. I wonder where
my class has gone?

192
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,536
ALL: We're under here!

193
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,578
Oh, there you are.

194
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,875
Climb aboard, explorers.

195
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,446
...Oh, knowledge
exploring...

196
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,809
...Is, oh, so lyrical...

...When you think thoughts
that are empirical...

198

Dad, you can go now.

199
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,678
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

200
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,486
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

201
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,391
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

202
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,894
An anemon-none.

203
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,931
A nemenem-menome.

204
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,967
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

205
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,960
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

206
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,761
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

207
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,772
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

208
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,477
NEMO: Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

209
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,468
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

210
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,774
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

211
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,816
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

212
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,443
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

213
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:21,621
JIMMY: Aw, man!

214
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,452
JIMMY: Aw, man!

215
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,490
Bye, Nemo!

216
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,819
Bye, Dad!

217
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,621
Bye, son!

218
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,627
Be safe.

219
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,030
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

220
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,595
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

221
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,796
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

222
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,998
They got to grow up...
The drop off?

223
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,936
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

224
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,480
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

225
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,707
Hey, Marty, calm down.

226
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,908
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

227
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,486
Pony boy?

228
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,523
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

229
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,512
Pity.

230
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,587

Sandy Plankton saw one.

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,465
He said it was called a butt.

I'm going to touch the butt.

OK.

Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

My dad says it's not safe.

- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

279
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,863
You were about
to swim into open water.

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,403
No, I wasn't...

- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

No, I wasn't.

284
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,243
This does not
concern you, kids...

285
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,571
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

286
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,772
You know you can't swim well.

287
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,747
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

288
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,717
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

289
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,311
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

290
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,856
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

291

Clearly, you're not ready...

292

Clearly, you're not ready...

293
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,417
and you're not coming back
until you are.

294
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,654
You think
you can do these things...

295
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,627
but you just can't, Nemo!

296

I hate you.

00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,498
...There's...

298
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,368
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

299
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,599
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

300
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,675
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

301
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,767
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

302
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,711
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

303
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,544
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

304
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,413
MR. RAY: I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

305
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,420
MARLIN: I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

306
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,012
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

307
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:45,558
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

308
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

What do you think you're doing?

312
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,499
You'll get stuck out there...

313
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,801
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

314
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,704
Get back here!

315
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,744
I said get back here now!

316
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,750
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

317
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,581

00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,917
- You know, alone.
- Uh-huh.

961
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,954
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.

962
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,456
But I don't
want you... with me.

963
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,686
- Huh?
- Am I...

964
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,818
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

965
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,798
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.

966
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,323
I just can't afford
any more delays...

967
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,494
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

968
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,003
Sometimes it's a good thing.

969
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,375
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

970
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,538
You mean you don't like me?

971
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,442
No, of course I like you.

972
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,947
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

973
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,416
It's a complicated emotion.

974
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,920
- Ohh!
- Don't cry. I like you.

975
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,516
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

976
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,527
Um... I don't remember.
Were you?

977
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,496
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...

978
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,031
Do you guys know
how I can get to...

979
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,593
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

980
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,226
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

981
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,404
[Sniffles] Mm-hmm.

982
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,667
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

983
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,401
So what are we?
Take a guess.

984
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,602
DORY: Oh, oh.
I've seen one of those.

985
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,770
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

986
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,814
- Wait, wait, um...
- It's a swordfish!

987
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,717
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

988
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,775
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

989
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,443
Where's the butter?

990
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,747
Ooh! It's on
the tip of my tongue!

991
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,788
- [Coughs] Lobster.
- Saw that!

992
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,687
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

993
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,393
- Clam!
- Close enough!

994
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,655
...Oh, it's a whale
of a tale...

995
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,318
...I'll tell you, lad...

996
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,361
They're good.

997
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,590
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

998
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,859
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

999
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,935
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- I'm serious!

1000
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,970
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, blah!

1001
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,432
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!"

1002
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,802
Thank you.

1003
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,502
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

1004
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,679
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

1005
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:28,974
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

1006
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,975
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

1007
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:35,412
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

1008
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,645
I bet that's frustrating.

1009
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:37,982
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

1010
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,984
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

1011
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,622
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

1012
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,727
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

1013
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,565
Well, I'm helping you.

1014
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,759
Wait right here.

1015
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,662
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

1016
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,237
No, no. He's a good guy.

1017
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,472
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

1018
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,530
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

1019
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,473
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1020
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,907
Sydney? Oh, sure!
[Choir sings]

1021
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,702
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

1022
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,475
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

1023
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,880
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

1024
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,419
[Gasps]

1025
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,681
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

1026
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,687
You want to follow the E.A.C.

1027
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,519
That's the East
Australian Current.

1028
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,956
Big current.
Can't miss it.

1029
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,396
It's in... that direction.

1030
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,954
And then you follow that
for about...

1031
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,828
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

1032
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,958
About three leagues?

1033
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,964
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

1034
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,603
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

1035
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,765
Dory, you did it!

1036
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,671
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

1037
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,937
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

1038
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,708
LEADER: Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

1039
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,751
DORY: Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

1040
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,650
LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

1041
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,491
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

1042
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,015
DORY: Trench...
through it, not over it.

1043
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,860
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

1044
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,657
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

1045
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,531
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

1046
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,968
Whoa.

1047
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,139
DORY: Nice trench.

1048
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,311
DORY: Hello!
[Echoing]

1049
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,510
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

1050
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,419
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

1051
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,410
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

1052
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,922
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

1053
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,686
Are you looking at this thing?

1054
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,351
It's got death
written all over it.

1055
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,952
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

1056
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,457
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

1057
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,568
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

1058
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,399
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

1059
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,369
Look! Something shiny!

1060
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:35,928
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

1061
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:42,813
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

1062
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,543
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

1063
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,880
Exactly. And look at that...
there's the current.

1064
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,614
We should be there in no time.

1065
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,519
Hey, little guy.

1066
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,387
You wanted to go
through the trench.

1067
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,460
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

1068
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,586
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

1069
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,890
Come here, little Squishy.

[Zap] Ow!

1072

- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

1073
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,701
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

1074
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,933
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

1075
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,502
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

1076
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,545
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

1077
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,943
It did.
It's just that...

1078
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,746
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hold still.

1079
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,407
I live in this anemone...

1080
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,382
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

1081
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,511
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1082

It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

1083

But now we know, don't we...

1084
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,550
that we don't want
to touch these again.

it was just a little one.

00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,646
But we're having fun
at the same time.

Just be careful.

The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

Yeah.

You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

1149

He's not looking for me.

1150

He's scared of the ocean.

He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

Keep on him.

lead to the ocean, kid.

you tried to get out?

Uh-huh!

you'll see a rotating fan.

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,517
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

1273
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,783
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1274
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,791
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1275
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,485
So give me some fin.

1276
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,789
Noggin. [Clunk]

1277
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,386
- Dude.
- Dude.

1278
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,692
Oh... intro.

1279
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,664
Jellyman, offspring.

1280
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,703
Offspring, Jellyman.

1281
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,432
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1282
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,634
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1283
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,939
- You rock, dude!
- Ow.

1284
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,813
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1285
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,578
The little dudes
are just eggs.

1286
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,449
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1287
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,680
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1288
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,984
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1289
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,556
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1290
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,528
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1291
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,688
Well, you never really know.

1292
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,290
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1293
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,506
[Laughter]

1294
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,734
Hey, look, everybody.

1295
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,570
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1296
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,611
DORY: Go on. Jump on him!

1297
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,772
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1298
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,873
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1299
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,918
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1300
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,748
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1301
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,755
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1302
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,518
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1303
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,957
DORY: Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1304
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:31,550
So, where are you going?

1305
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,397
You see, my son was taken.

1306
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,922
My son was taken away from me.

1307
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,467
- No way.
- What happened?

1308
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,594
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1309
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,366
ALL: Aww! Please?

1310
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,407
Please?

1311
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,011
[Sighs] Well, OK.

1312
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,845
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1313
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,882
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1314
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,508
And my son Nemo...

1315
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,519
See, he was mad at me.

1316
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,986
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1317
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,589
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1318
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,715
I don't know.

1319
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,760
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1320
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,695
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1321
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,459
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1322
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,330
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1323
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,596
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1324
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,468
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1325
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:18,700
...three ferocious sharks.

1326
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,799
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1327
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,377
Golly, that's amazing.

1328
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,844
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1329
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,676
...straight down
into the dark.

1330
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,340
It's wicked dark down there.

1331
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,849
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1332
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,613
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1333
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,483
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1334
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,489
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1335
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,751
And then he has
to blast his way...

1336
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,520
So, these two little fish
have been...

1337
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,030
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1338
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,498
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1339
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,863
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1340
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,435
...in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1341
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,436
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1342
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,369
...till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1343
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:54,376
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1344
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,680
GULLS: Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1345
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:06,882
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1346
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,685
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1347
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:12,284
Would you just shut up?!

1348
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,730
You're rats with wings!

1349
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,322
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1350
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,593
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1351
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,635
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1352
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:23,535
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1353
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,664
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1354
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,332
Whoooa...

1355
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,501
Hyah!

1356
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:28,908
Mine?

1357
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,412
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1358
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,744
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1359

1361
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,398
Is he doing OK?

1362
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:48,693
Is he doing OK?

1363
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,858
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...

1364
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,835
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1367
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,269
Gill?

1368
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,412
Gill?

1369
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,884
Hey, Sharkbait.

1370
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,380
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1371
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,549
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1372
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,321
I was so ready
to get out...

1373
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,896
so ready to taste that ocean...

1374
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,601
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1375
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:28,503
Nothing should be worth that.

1376
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,698
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1377
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,502
[Panting]

1378
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,548
All right.
Hey, hey, hey...

- What the...
- Aaah!

1380
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,747
That's one way to pull a tooth.
[Chuckles]

1381
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,878
Huh. Darn kids.

1382
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,924
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1383
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,619
NIGEL: Hey, psst!

1384
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,661
PEACH: Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1385
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,424
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1386
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,500
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1387
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,760
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1388
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,803
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1389
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,499
- looking for you.
- My father? Really?

1390
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:08,634
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish...

1391
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,305
Sharks? That can't be him.

1392
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,780
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1393
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,249
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1394
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,842
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1395
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,548
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1396
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,851
I heard he took on three.

1397
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,757
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1398
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,853
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1399
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,364
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1400
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,626
Really?

1401
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,531
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1402
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,604
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1403
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,832
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1404
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,705
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1405
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,506
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1406
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,775
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1407
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,942
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1408
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,616
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1409
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,915
- Wow!
- What a good daddy!

1410
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,651
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1427
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,825
Sharkbait, you did it!

1428
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:34,693
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1429
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,492
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1430
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,426
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1431
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,661
before Darla gets here.

1432
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,499
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1433
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,371
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1434
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,602
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1435
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,513
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1436
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,571
Think dirty thoughts.

1437
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,774
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1438
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,444
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1439
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,577
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!

1440
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,522
All right, we're here, dudes!

1441
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,690
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1442
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,358
MARLIN:
Where? I don't see it!

1443
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,698
DORY: Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1444
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,830
MARLIN:
The swirling vortex of terror?

1445
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,374
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1446
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,402
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1447
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,778
Do you have your exit buddy?

1448
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,974
Yes!

1449
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:32,847
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1450
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:36,550
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1451
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:40,463
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1452
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,466
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1453
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,560
Remember...
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1454
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,695
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1455
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,900
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1456
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,510
Say the first thing again.

1457
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,808
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1458
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:01,873
[Screaming]

1459
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:05,545
- Whoa!
- Wahoo!

1460
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,623
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1461

[Laughing]

1462
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,954
Whoo!

1463
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,655
That was... fun!

1464
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,889
I actually enjoyed that.

1465
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,659
Hey, look, turtles!

1466
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,668
CRUSH: Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1467
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,500
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1468
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,699
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1469
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,834
No worries, man!

1470
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,912
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1471
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,640
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1472
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,876
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1473
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,008
SQUIRT:
See ya later, dudes!

1474
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,851
DORY: Bye, everyone!

1475
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,445
Nemo would have loved this.

1476
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,686
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1477
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,420
How old are you?

1478
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,589
CRUSH: 150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1479
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:53,635
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1480
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,794
Whoa.

1481
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,301
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1482
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,379
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1483
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,884
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1484
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,750
...Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming...

1485
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:13,880
Dory...

1486
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,924
[Dory humming]

1487
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,495
MARLIN:
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1488
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,331
DORY:
How about we play a game?

1489
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:28,494
MARLIN: OK.

1490
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,596
DORY: OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1491
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:32,969
and it's small...

1492
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,506
- It's me.
- Right!

1493
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,944
It's orange and small...

1494
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,482
It's me.

1495
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,448
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1496
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,486
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1497
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,579
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1498
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,781
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1499
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,451
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1500
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,391
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1501
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,792
That means
we've passed it before...

1502
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,464
and that means
we're going in circles...

1503
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:56,795
and that means
we're not going straight!

1504
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,924
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1505
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,627
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1506
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,728
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1507
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,501
Take a deep breath.
[Inhales]

1508
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,440
[Exhaling]

1509
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:07,877
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1510
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,674
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1511
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,713
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1512
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,417
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1513
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,908
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1514
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,510
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1515
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:23,854
Nope. Nada.

1516
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,427
[Gasps]

1517
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,396
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...

1518
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,920
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1519
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,658
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1520
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,961
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1521
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:34,999
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1522
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,668
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1523
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,536
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1524
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,542
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1525
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,511
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1526
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,707
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1527
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,750
Dory, you don't
fully understand...

1528
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,786
Come on. Trust me on this.

1529

- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.

1537
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,739
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1538
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,749
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1539
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,842
so can you help us out?

1540
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:27,548
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1541

Dory, I'm a little fella.

I don't think
that's a little fella.

DORY: Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

1544
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,731
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1545
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,896
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1546
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:48,375
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1547
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,810
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1548
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,448
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1549
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,416
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1550
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,786
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1551
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,381
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1552
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,549
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1553
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,717
- Maybe a different dialect.

1554
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,887
- Moooohhhmmooo...
- Dory!

1555
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:10,397
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1556
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:10,700
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1557
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,565
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1558
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:13,930
Wooooooo...

1559
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,930
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1560
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,567
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1561
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,437
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1562
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,669
It doesn't sound orca.

1563
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,574
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1564
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,943
- Oooooo!
- Ohh!

1565
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:26,749
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1566
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,909
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1567
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,952
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1568
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,652
- KRILL: Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

- Aah!
- Aah!

1572
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:48,499
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1573
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:52,540
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1574
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:55,577
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1575
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,612
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1576
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,544
I am ashamed.
