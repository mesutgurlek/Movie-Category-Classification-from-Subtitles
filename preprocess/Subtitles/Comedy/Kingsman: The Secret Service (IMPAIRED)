00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,426
(shouting in Arabic)

3
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,394
(gunfire)
(both yell)

4
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,070
(people screaming)

5
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,638
(men shouting)

6
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,778
(gunfire, men shouting)

7
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,827
(gunfire, shouting continue)

8
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,698
MAN (over radio):
This is Zero One Alpha.

9
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
We have secured Falcon.

10
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,869
I say again, we have
secured Falcon.

11
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,237
(guns cocking)

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,357
MAN 2 (over radio):
Grenade! Sir, get back!

13
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,892
(shouting)

14
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:07,934
(explosion thunders)

15
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,306
Shit.

16
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,308
Fucking missed it.

17
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,311
How did I fucking miss it?

18
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,880
Merlin...

19
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,316
I apologize for putting you
in this position.

20
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,418
You trained him well.

21
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,888
James...

22
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,891
training is over.

23
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,462
Welcome to Kingsman...

24
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,930
Lancelot.

25
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,331
Sir.

26
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,403
I'll deal with this mess...

27
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,306
personally.

28
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>I very much regret
that your husband's bravery</i>

29
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,847
<i>can't be publicly celebrated.</i>

30
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,248
I hope you understand.

31
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,750
WOMAN:
How can I understand?

32
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,252
He won't tell me anything.

33
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,755
I-I didn't even know he
wasn't with his squad.

34
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,823
I'm so sorry,
I can't say more.

35
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,461
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor.

36
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,898
And if you look closely
on the back, there's a number.

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,901
And as a more concrete
gesture of our gratitude,

38
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,470
we'd like to offer you, um...

39
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,472
Let's call it a favor.

40
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,609
The nature of it is your choice.
Just tell the operator,

41
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,446
"Oxfords not brogues,"
and then I'll know it's you.

42
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,617
I don't want your help.

43
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,820
(sobbing):
I want my husband back.

44
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,391
(man sighs)

45
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,995
What's your name,
young man?

46
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,530
Eggsy.

47
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,898
Hello, Eggsy.

48
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,702
Can I see that?

49
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,343
You take care of this, Eggsy.

50
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,012
All right?

51
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,917
And take care of your mum, too.

52
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,671
¶ ¶

53
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,526
So sorry,
Professor Arnold.

54
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,561
Just a tiny bit more.

55
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,298
Oh, for God's sakes,
just rip it off.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,933
I'm under very
strict instructions

57
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,035
not to hurt you.

58
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,936
Look, you've made a mistake.

59
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,938
I'm a university lecturer.

60
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,040
I've got no money.

61
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,975
This isn't about money.

62
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,077
Our boss just wants
to talk to you.

63
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,346
Am I meant
to find that reassuring?

64
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,581
He'll be here soon.
He'll explain.

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,917
Do you like whiskey?

66
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,754
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.

67
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,889
Mm.

68
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,724
Honestly,
this whiskey,

69
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,059
it's amazing.

70
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,493
You will shit.

71
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,495
(rhythmic knocking)

72
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,435
¶ ¶

73
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,850
I suppose asking to borrow a cup
of sugar is a step too far.

74
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,389
(silenced gunshots)

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,093
(grunts)

76
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,095
(yells)

77
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,641
Professor Arnold...

78
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,477
I'm here to take you home.

79
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,067
(door closes in distance,
footsteps approach)

80
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,978
(body thuds, tray clatters)

81
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,920
Hmm.

82
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,456
1962 Dalmore.

83
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,692
It'd be a sin
to spill any.

84
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,061
Don't you think?

85
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,863
(rhythmic tapping on glass)

86
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,676
¶ ¶

87
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,527
(clinking footsteps)

88
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,637
Can you hold these? Please?

89
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,819
Thank you.

90
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,494
Everything is clean.

91
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,531
(laughs)

92
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,602
My kind of welcome.

93
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,172
Mmm!

94
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,640
(exhales)

95
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,612
(speaking with lisp):
No stomach for violence.

96
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,781
I mean, literally.
I see one drop of blood,

97
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,783
that is me done.

98
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,785
I'm like... (retches)
projectile.

99
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:10,021
Listen, I'm so sorry

100
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,991
you had to witness all
this unpleasantness,

101
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,527
due to our uninvited guest.

102
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,963
But I promise you, by
the time I've found out

103
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,965
who he works for,

104
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,536
<i>you and I will be
the best of friends.</i>

105
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,978
To the shop, please.

106
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,235
Arthur's in
the dining room, sir.

107
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,847
Arthur.

108
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,115
Galahad.

109
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,217
The others were
beginning to wonder

110
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,220
if we were going to have
a double toast.

111
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,658
ARTHUR:
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to say

112
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,027
it's been 17 years
since we last

113
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,563
had occasion to use
this decanter.

114
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,164
Lancelot...

115
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,100
was an outstanding agent
and a true Kingsman.

116
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,236
He will be sorely missed.

117
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,939
To Lancelot.

118
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,141
OTHERS:
To Lancelot.

119
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,913
ARTHUR:
I intend to start
the selection process

120
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,016
for Lancelot's replacement
tomorrow.

121
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,885
I want each of you

122
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,722
to propose a candidate
and have them report to UKHQ

123
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,991
no later than 9:00 p.m. GMT.

124
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,326
Thank you.

125
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,862
ARTHUR:
Merlin.

126
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,599
Come in.

127
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,735
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

128
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,638
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

129
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

130
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,077
Uganda, 2012.

131
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,245
Synthetic cathinones.

132
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,047
They put it in
the water supply

133
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,016
of a guerilla
army base... rage,

134
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,852
cannibalism,
multiple fatalities.

135
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,122
Chechnya, 2013.

136
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,991
Insurgents turned
on one another.

137
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,659
Indisputably, the work
of our mercenaries,

138
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,028
but no trace
of any chemicals of any kind.

139
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,196
So what happened to Lancelot?

140
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,665
He tracked them
to this property

141
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,233
in Argentina.

142
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,901
While he had them
under surveillance,

143
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,803
he became aware
they'd effected a kidnapping.

144
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,339
So he executed a solo
rescue mission,

145
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,009
which failed.

146
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,244
This is his last transmission.

147
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,715
Who is he?
Some climate-change
doomsayer,

148
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,250
expounds something
called Gaia theory

149
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,252
about the world healing itself
or some such.

150
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,821
But what's curious is

151
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,156
he's not actually missing.

152
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,158
This is Professor Arnold...

153
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,161
at Imperial College
this morning.

154
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,031
ARTHUR:
It's all yours.

155
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,432
And don't forget your
membership proposal.

156
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,401
Try picking

157
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,770
a more suitable
candidate this time.

158
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:15,340
17 years, and still evolving
with the times remains

159
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,442
an entirely
foreign concept to you.

160
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,177
Need I remind you
I wouldn't be here

161
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,079
if it weren't
for that young man?

162
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,849
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them. More so.

163
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,119
But he wasn't exactly
one of us, was he?

164
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,255
Let's face it, Galahad,

165
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,817
your little experiment failed.

166
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,761
With respect, Arthur,
you're a snob.

167
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:37,996
With respect?

168
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,965
The world is changing.

169
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,369
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

170
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,683
WOMAN:
Eggsy?

171
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,129
Eggsy, come here.

172
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,263
REPORTER:
...impact of global warming...

173
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,099
WOMAN: Got any Rizla, babe?
No.

174
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,200
Why don't you do
your mum a favor,

175
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,234
go down to the shop
and get some?

176
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,936
Get them yourself.
Oi.

177
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,905
What have I said to you about
speaking to Dean like that?

178
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,173
EGGSY:
Three's a crowd, isn't it?

179
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,508
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

180
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,010
I'll tell you what.

181
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,879
Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas,

182
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,948
get yourself some sweets...
and while you're gone,

183
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,517
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.

184
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,985
(baby crying)

185
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,288
MOTHER:
Thanks, babe.

186
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,059
Come here.

187
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,894
(crying continues)

188
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,529
(Eggsy speaks gently)

189
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,966
There we go.

190
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,100
Is that better?

191
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,116
MAN:
<i>If Dean treats your mum</i>
<i>so bad,</i>

192
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,417
<i>why don't she leave him?</i>

193
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,386
Low self-esteem,
that's her problem.

194
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,488
Fuck off. Why would she
have low self-esteem?

195
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,923
Eggsy's mum is well fit.

196
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,224
(laughter)
No offense, bruv.

197
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,993
It's all right.

198
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,229
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.

199
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,565
Are you mental, cuz?
He'd just get that lot

200
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,127
to do you and then pretend
he knew nothing...

201
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,003
...about it.

202
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,404
MAN:
Oi!

203
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,173
You think you can chat shit
about us

204
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,275
and we won't do nothing
just 'cause our guvnor's

205
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,442
banging Eggsy's mum?

206
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,510
Pretty much, yeah.

207
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,845
Bruv, just leave it.

208
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,446
Let's just go, man.

209
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,248
It's not worth it.
You boys

210
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,217
have outstayed your welcome.

211
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,318
Leave.

212
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,221
What?

213
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,357
I'm sorry about that, bruv.

214
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:49,894
Yeah.

215
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,263
Mug.

216
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,866
They weren't fucking
worth it, boys.

217
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,969
It's freezing.

218
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,504
Why are we walking?

219
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,005
You jacked
his fucking car keys, bruv?

220
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,473
Yeah.

221
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,542
Now we're gonna nick his car.
(alarm chirps)

222
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,910
Fucking...
Shit.

223
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,912
Move, bruv!

224
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,615
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

225
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,218
Hold on, boys.

226
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,887
(whooping laughter)

227
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,956
Hey, that's my fucking car!

228
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,591
Hey! Hey!

229
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,527
Eggsy, I swear,
you want to fucking stop it!

230
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,928
You're a fucking dead man!

231
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,363
Stop it!

232
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,998
(whooping)
(shouting)

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,300
I'm gonna fuckin' have ya!

234
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,135
(laughter continues)

235
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,604
Come on.

236
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,607
Floor it, Eggsy!

237
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,369
(engine revving)
Floor it!

238
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,878
Wanker!
(laughing)

239
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,480
Yeah, yeah, Dean, look, it's me.

240
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,282
Eggsy just stole
my fucking car, yeah.

241
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,417
Yeah, I've come out the pub,
he's done about 15 doughnuts

242
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,119
in my fucking face,
and he's drove off.

243
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,454
(sirens approaching)

244
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,322
No, I can't have it!
He's disrespecting me,

245
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,358
and that means
he's disrespecting you.

246
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,526
Oh, hold up! What the...

247
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,100
(laughing)

248
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,609
(horns honking)

249
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,677
(tires squealing)

250
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,145
Come on, Eggsy!

251
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,468
(groans)

252
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,750
Dickhead.

253
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,674
Foxes are vermin, cuz.

254
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,208
Should've driven it over.

255
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,476
Should've done a lot of things.

256
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,011
I'll sort this.

257
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,212
Get out of the car.
(thunder rumbling)

258
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,648
I said,
get out of the fucking car!

259
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,530
(siren wailing)
(engine revving)

POLICEMAN (voice-over):
<i>Eggsy, there is no such thing</i>

261
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,727
<i>as honor amongst thieves.</i>

262
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,697
Now, you can start giving me
some names

263
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,732
of the boys you were with,

264
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,500
or you go down.

265
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,669
It's up to you.

266
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,505
I want to exercise my right
to a phone call.

267
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,640
(sighs)

268
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,743
Well...

269
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,478
I hope it's to your mum,

270
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,348
to tell her you're gonna be
18 months late for your dinner.

271
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,653
(door opens)

272
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,155

275

RECEPTIONIST:
Customer Complaints,
how may I help you?

276
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,151
Um... my name's Eggsy Unwin.

277
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,786
Sorry, Gary Unwin.

278
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,655
And I'm up shit creek.

279
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,057
I'm in Holborn police station,

280
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,258
and my mum said
to call this number

281
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,593
if ever I needed help and...

282
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,728
I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.

283
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,398
Wait! Wait!

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,366
Oxfords not brogues?

285
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,437
Your complaint has been
duly noted,

286
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,173

lost you as a loyal customer.

288
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,682
(phone ringing)

289
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,154
Yeah.

290
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,556
You what?

291
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,458
I...

292
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,193
Yeah.

293
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,296
Yes, I totally understand.

294
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,265

295
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,341
¶ ¶

296
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,117
Eggsy.

297
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,785
Would you like a lift home?

298
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,720
Who are you?

299
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,422
The man who got you released.

300
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,757
That ain't an answer.

301
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,793
A little gratitude
would be nice.

302
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,396
My name is Harry Hart,

303
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,697
and I gave you that medal.

304
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,301
Your father saved my life.

305
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,572
EGGSY:
<i>So before you was a tailor,</i>

306
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,739
<i>was you in the army?</i>

307
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,374
Like an officer?

308
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,376
Not quite.

309
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,345
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?

310
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,647
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.

311
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,350
But my dad saved
your life, yeah?

312
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,586
The day your father died,

313
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,454
I missed something.

314
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,224
And if it weren't
for his courage,

315
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,293
my mistake would have cost
the lives of every man present.

316
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,262
So I owe him.

317
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,533
Your father was a brave man.

318
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,734
A good man.

319
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,137
And having read your files,

320
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,338
I think he'd be
bitterly disappointed

321
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,539
in the choices you've made.

322
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,907
You can't talk
to me like that.

323
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,477
Huge IQ, great performance
at primary school...

324
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,346
and it all went tits up.

325
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,249
Drugs, petty crime,
never had a job.

326
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,384
Oh, you think there's a lot of
jobs going around here, do you?

327
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,652
Doesn't explain why
you gave up your hobbies.

328
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,522
First prize,
regional Under-10s gymnastics

329
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,157
two years in a row.

330
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,359
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.

331
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,561
Yeah, well, when you grow up
around someone like my stepdad,

332
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,929
you pick up new hobbies
pretty quick.

333
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,531
Of course.
Always someone else's fault.

334
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,901
Who's to blame
for you quitting the Marines?

335
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,269
You were halfway
through training,

336
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,436
doing brilliantly,
but you gave up.

337
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,672
Because my mum went mental.

338
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,275
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.

339
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,278
Didn't want me being cannon
fodder for snobs like you!

340
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,813
Judging people like me
from your ivory towers

341
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,249
with no thought about
why we do what we do.

342
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,817
We ain't got much choice.

343
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,586
You get me?

344
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,255
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses,

345
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,924
we'd do just as well as you.

346
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,293
If not better.
YOUNG MAN: What the fuck

347
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,255
you doing here?
You taking the piss?

348
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,231
Some more examples of young men

349
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,832
who simply need
a silver suppository?

350
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,235
No, they're exceptions. Come on.
Nonsense.

351
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,403
We haven't finished our drinks.

352
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,504
After you nicked his car,

353
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,939
Dean says you're fair game.

354
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,640
He don't give a shit
what your mum says.

355
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,202
HARRY:
Um, listen, boys.

356
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,378
I've had
a rather emotional day,

357
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,314
so whatever your beef
with Eggsy is,

358
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,849
and I'm sure it's well-founded,

359
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,818
I'd appreciate it enormously

360
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,920
if you could just leave us
in peace

361
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,556
until I finish this lovely pint
of Guinness.

362
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,961
You should
get out of the way, Granddad,

363
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,362
or you'll get hurt and all.

364
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,897
He ain't joking.
You should go.

365
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,298
(sighing):
Hmm...

366
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,433
(smacks lips)

367
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,006
Excuse me. Excuse me.

368
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,441
If you're looking
for another rent boy,

369
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,543
they're on the corner
of Smith Street.

370
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,877
(young men snickering)

371
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,849
Manners...

372
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,253
...maketh...

373
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,490
...man.

374
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,799
Do you know what that means?

375
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,737
Then let me teach you a lesson.

376
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,046
Are we going to stand

377
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,481
around here all day,

378
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,649
or are we going to fight?

379
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,922
(grunting)

380
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,570
(bellowing)

381
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,851
(groans)

382
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,377
(groaning)

383
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,462
You fucking dirty,

384
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,496
fucking dirty...!

385
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,065
(gun clicks)

386
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,535
(silenced shot)

387
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,584
(glassware clattering)

388
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,123
(Harry sighs)

389
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,935
(Harry exhales)

390
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,605
Sorry about that.

391
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,742
Needed to let off
a little steam.

392
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:01,145
I heard yesterday
a friend of mine died.

393
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,881
He knew your father,
too, actually.

394
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,885
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

395
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,154
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.

396
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,956
No, please, I won't
say nothing.

397
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,491
I swear...
If there's one thing I can do,

398
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,759
it's keep my mouth shut.

399
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,427
You won't tell a soul?
Ask the Feds.

400
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,396
I've never grassed anyone up.
Is that a promise?

401
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,597
On my life!

402
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,865
(anxious panting)

403
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,770
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

404
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,438
You're right about the snobs.

405
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,040
But there, too,
there are exceptions.

406
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,009
Best of luck with everything.

407
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,560
ANCHOR: In celebrity news,
the Richmond Valentine movie

408
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,128
premiered in Hollywood
last night.

409
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,931
The story of the Internet
billionaire's rise to power

410
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,201
is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.

411
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,537
One notable absence
from the red carpet

412
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,206
was Iggy Azalea,
still missing three days

413
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,508
after she failed to appear
at her Oakland concert.

414
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,976
No ransom has been demanded.

415
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,945
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...

416
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,713
(shouting)

417
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,115
No, please, don't hurt him!
Fuck off!

418
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,116
Don't hurt him!
Get the fuck away with you!

419
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,517
Shut the fuck up!

420
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,454
Who was with you
in that fucking pub?

421
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,556
I want to know the name
of the geezer you was with!

422
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,491
I wasn't with no one!
Who was it?

423
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:21,959
I don't know what
you're on about.
Who was it?

424
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,461
I don't know who
you're fucking on about!

425
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,695
Fucking tell me his name!

426
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,597
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

427
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,599
(screaming)

428
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,867
(Dean shouts)

429
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,102
DEAN:
You listen to me!

430
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,637
I want to know
who you was with in that pub.

431
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,839
Do you understand?

432
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,240
I want to know his fucking name!

433
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,008
Because, I swear,

434
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,844
I'll rip your head off.

435
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,712
Tell me!
I don't know what you're fucking
on about!

436
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,013
DEAN:
Tell me!

437
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,216
Just tell him, Eggsy!
Fuck off!

438
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,585
Fuck off, Michelle!
I could kill you right now,

439
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,987
and no one in the whole world
will notice!

440
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,722
HARRY (through speaker):
But I would.

441
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,057
I have enough evidence

442
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,992
on your activities
to have you locked up

443
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,061
for the rest of your life,
Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.

444
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,196
What the fuck?!
So I suggest

445
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,131
you leave the boy alone,
or I shall be forced

446
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,667
to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.

447
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,135
(panting)
Eggsy,

448
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,838
meet me at the tailor
I told you about.

449
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,108
What the fuck's going on here?

450
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,677
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!

451
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,179
Hey, we got a racer!
Come here.

452
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,580
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

453
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,815
(shouting angrily)
Eggsy, you fucking...

454
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:18,883
Come here, son!

455
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,297
You wanker!

456
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,066
I'll have you, son!

457
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,016
¶ ¶

458
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,593
I've never met
a tailor before,

459
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,662
but I know you ain't one.

460
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,200
Come with me.

461
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,945
Come on in.

462
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,017
What do you see?

463
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,987
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

464
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:35,759
I see a young man
with potential.

465
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,162
A young man who is loyal,

466
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,364
who can do as he's asked,

467
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:44,234
and who wants to do
something good with his life.

468
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,604
Did you see the film
<i>Trading Places?</i>

469
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,672
No.

470
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,641
How about<i> Nikita?</i>

471
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,011
<i>Pretty Woman?</i>

472
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,613
All right.

473
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,348
My point is, that the lack
of a silver spoon

474
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,983
has set you on a certain path,

475
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,618
but you needn't stay on it.

476
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,953
If you're prepared
to adapt and learn,

477
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,255
you can transform.

478
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,817
Oh, like in <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

479
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,195
Well, you're full of surprises.

480
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:14,398
Yes, like<i> My Fair Lady.</i>

481
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,266
Only, in this case,

482
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,669
I'm offering you the opportunity
to become a Kingsman.

483
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,671
A tailor?

484
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,306
A Kingsman agent.

485
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,142
Like a spy?

486
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,644
Of sorts.

487
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,178
(scoffs)

488
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,648
Interested?

489
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,210
You think I've got
anything to lose?

490
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,289
(clicking, whirring)

491
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,891
Since 1849,

492
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,292
Kingsman tailors have clothed

493
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,695
the world's most
powerful individuals.

494
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,764
By 1919,
a great number of them

495
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,167
had lost their heirs
to World War I.

496
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,070
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited,

497
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,305
and a lot of powerful men

498
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,208
with a desire to preserve peace
and protect life.

499
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,344
Our founders realized
that they could channel

500
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,347
that wealth and influence
for the greater good.

501
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,417
And so began our other venture.

502
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,787
An independent, international
intelligence agency

503
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,723
operating at the highest
level of discretion.

504
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,359
Above the politics
and bureaucracy

505
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,194
that undermine the integrity

506
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,197
of government-run
spy organizations.

507
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,332
The suit is a modern
gentleman's armor,

508
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,735
and the Kingsman agents

509
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,904
are the new knights.

510
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,406
EGGSY: How deep does
this fucking thing go?

511
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,774
HARRY:
Deep enough.

512
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,791

513
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,511
¶ ¶

514
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,054
Shit, we're late.

515
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,140
¶ ¶

516
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,847
Your father had
the same look on his face.

517
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,785
As did I.

518
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,888
Come on.

519
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,924
Galahad.

520
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,125
My code name.

521
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,060
Late again, sir.

522
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,328
Good luck.

523
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,297
In you go.

524
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,803
MERLIN:
Fall in.

525
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:18,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Merlin.

526
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,983
You are about to embark
on what is probably

527
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,052
the most dangerous
job interview in the world.

528
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,055
One of you,
and only one of you,

529
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,091
will become the next Lancelot.

530
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,595
Can anybody tell me
what this is?

531
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,096
Yes?

532
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,198
Body bag, sir.

533
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,465
Correct.

534
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,567
Charlie, isn't it?

535
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,968
Yes, sir.

536
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,403
Good.

537
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,338
In a moment, you will each
collect a body bag.

538
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,207
You will write your name
on that bag.

539
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:46,977
You will write the details of
your next of kin on that bag.

540
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,512
This represents
your acknowledgment of the risks

541
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,247
that you're about to face

542
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,884
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.

543
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,485
Which, incidentally,
if you break,

544
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,954
will result in you

545
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,423
and your next of kin being

546
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,458
in that bag.

547
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,963
Is that understood?

548
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,297
Excellent.

549
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,132
Fall out.

550
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,274
Roxanne.

551
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,976
But call me Roxy.

552
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,244
I'm Eggsy.

553
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,246
"Eggy"?

554
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,914
No, "Eggsy."
Eggy?

555
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,116
And where did they dig you up?

556
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,483
You know we're not allowed
to discuss

557
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,619
who proposed us.
No need to bite his head off.

558
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:31,121
Charlie's only making
conversation, right, Charlie?

559
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,056
Hm.
I'm Digby.

560
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,992
Digby.

561
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,460
Eggy, this is Rufus.

562
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,428
Rufus, Eggy.

563
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,233
So, Eggy, are you
Oxford or Cambridge?

564
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,468
Neither.

565
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,003
Saint Andrews?
Durham?

566
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,071
No, wait, I think
we may have met.

567
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,340
Did you serve me
at the McDonald's

568
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,675
in Winchester service station?

569
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,543
No, but if I had,

570
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,479
I'd have given you an extra
helping of secret sauce.

571
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,147
It's definitely Saint Andrews.

572
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,249
(snickering)

573
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,550
Just ignore them.

574
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,685
You need a pen?

575
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,553
Cheers.
Amelia, isn't it?

576
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,622
Amelia, Eggsy.

577
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,157
Hi, Eggsy.

578
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,159
Don't take any notice
of those guys.

579
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,028
ROXY:
That's what I told him.

580
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,531
It's just scare tactics.

581
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,433
Classic Army technique.

582
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,935
No one's gonna die.

583
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,002
(men snickering)

584
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,073
Shame.

585
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,575
VALENTINE:
Great.

586
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,444
You don't know,
the CIA don't know.

587
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,947
Nobody knows who this guy is?

588
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,415
Fine.

589
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,417
Seriously, it's fine.

590
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,319
Well, it's not really fine,

591
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,254
but it's not why I'm here.

592
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,256
(chuckles)
Hell, man, you know me.

593
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,058
Money's not my issue.

594
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,160
I could've retired
straight out of MIT,

595
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,462
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.

596
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,532
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet.

597
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,200
I wanted to.

598
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,402
Climate change research,
lobbying,

599
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,338
years of study,
billions of dollars,

600
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
and you know why I quit?

601
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,742
Because the last time I checked,

602
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,278
the planet was still fucked.

603
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,348
Hence, my epiphany.

604
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,984
Money won't solve this.

605
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:10,187
Those idiots
who call themselves politicians

606
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,621
have buried their heads
in the sand

607
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,524
and stood for nothing
but reelection.

608
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,626
So I spent the last two years

609
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:20,030
trying to find a real solution.

610
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,666
And I found it.

611
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,736
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place,

612
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:28,238
I suggest you open
your fucking ears,

613
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,140
because I'm about
to tell it to you.

614
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,342
PRESIDENT:
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

615
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,344
I'm still listening.

616
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:38,281
VALENTINE:
As long as you agree
to all my terms.

617
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,228

Listen to me.

Loo snorkels?
Showerheads!

Showerheads?!
She's right.

Go! Fucking go!

Congratulations

on completing your first task.

638
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,305
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

639
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,907
For those of you
who are still confused,

640
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,341
if you can get a breathing tube

641
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,643
around a U-bend of a toilet,

642
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,311
you have an unlimited
air supply.

643
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,947
Simple physics,
worth remembering.

644
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:27,484
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

645
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,919
He's probably seen
enough of them.

646
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,688
Yeah, you can all wipe
those smirks off your faces.

647
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,356
Because as far as I'm concerned,

648
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,692
every single one of you
has failed.

649
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,196
You all forgot the most
important thing...

650
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,231
Teamwork.

651
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,881
So much for classic
Army technique.

652
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,686
Thirty-five.

That's it. That's it.
(chuckles)

655
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,896
Hello.

656
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,698
Can I help you?

657
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,401
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

658
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,770
(chuckling):
Oh... Really?

659
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,872
Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.

660
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,507
(choking)

661
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,509
My colleague died
trying to rescue you,

662
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,411
and I'm sure you saw
how well trained he was,

663
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,380
so I suggest you tell me
who kidnapped you

664
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,648
and why they let you go.

665
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,750
I have no idea
what you're talking...

666
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,453
I'm not supposed to say it,
but it was... (screaming)

667
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,255
Oh, for God's sake,
I've barely touched you.

668
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,023
Oh, man up!
(explosion)

669
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,902
(beeping)

670
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,438
(explosion)

671
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,906
(tires screech)

672
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,445
VALENTINE: Fuck that guy,
whoever he is. I'm gonna...

673
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,582
He made me kill
Professor Arnold.

674
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:06,916
I goddamn loved
Professor Arnold.

675
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,618
Well, the good news is

676
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,687
we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.

677
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,822
You know what's not good news?

678
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,724
(imitates British accent):
"My colleague died!"

679
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,359
That's what he said!

680
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,662
This is an organization,
and they're all over us.

681
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:19,829
Whoever you spoke to...

682
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,464
I told you, I made contact

683
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,301
with the KGB, MI6,
Mossad and Beijing.

684
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,902
They all insist
he wasn't one of theirs.

685
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,937
Beijing.

686
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,307
So freaky how there's
no recognizable name

687
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,709
for the Chinese secret service.

688
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,911
Now, that's what you
call a secret, right?

689
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,714
You know what?
Fuck it.

690
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,849
We need to speed things up.

691
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,451
Bring the product
release forward.

692
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,353
We're only halfway
into production,

693
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,821
and speeding it
will cost a fortune.

694
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,389
I look like I give a fuck?

695
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,425
Just get it done.

696
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:54,631
As some of you
will have learned last night,

697
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:58,335
teamwork is paramount
here at Kingsman.

698
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,938
We're here to enhance your
skills, test you to the limit.

699
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,941
Which is why
you're gonna pick a puppy.

700
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:05,943
(dogs whimpering softly)

701
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,877
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

702
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,113
You will care for it,
you will teach it,

703
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:13,116
and by the time it's fully
trained, so will you be.

704
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,952
Those of you who are
still here, that is.

705
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,021
Do you understand?

706
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,456
Choose your puppy.

707
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,760
EGGSY:
A poodle?

708
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:24,961
ROXY:
What?

709
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,796
They're gun dogs.

710
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,631
Oldest working breed.

711
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,533
Easy to train.

712
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,535
(whimpering softly)

713
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,136
A pug?

714
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,739
It's a bulldog, innit?

715
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,609
It'll get bigger though,
won't it?

716
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,682
Shit.

717
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,517
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

718
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,954
His MRI shows
no signs of concussion.

719
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:54,124
No direct
brain trauma at all.

720
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,626
How much longer
can he be out?

721
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:57,961
That's the million-dollar
question.

722
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,063
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

723
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,664
What about Harry's footage?

724
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,967
It didn't stream to
his home terminal.

725
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:05,969
Encrypted and uncrackable.

726
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,772
If and when he comes around,
you might want to have a word

727
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,673
with him about
sharing his password.

728
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,509
Is he gonna be all right?

729
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,412
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

730
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,013
But there's hope, okay?

731
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,549
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

732
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,684
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.

733
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,992
(dogs barking)
Fuck!

734
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,760
Come on, come on, come on!

735
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:31,828
J.B., come on!

736
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,830
Come on!

737
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,063
(J.B. growling)

738
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,134
I'm not coming last
'cause of you.

739
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,669
J.B., I'll shoot you!

740
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,571
Goddamn you,
I'll fucking shoot you!

741
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,533
(whimpering)
Merlin said
we're not allowed to hold you.

742
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,977
Bollocks.

743
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,999
¶ ¶

744
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,487
(J.B. barking)

745
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,554
Water!

746
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,490
(panting)

747
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,691
(laughter)

748
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,526
Come on, then!
Eggsy, forget it!

749
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,127
Oh, what's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?

750
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,597
Seriously, you'll get thrown
out, and it's just not worth it.

751
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,098
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!

752
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,700
Do it.
Come on, you pleb.

753
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,101
Charlie, fuck off!

754
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,836
Aw...

755
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,071
Yeah, go on, walk away.

756
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,139
Dickhead.

757
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,675
Come on, J.B.

758
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:53,877
Come on, good boy.

759
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,090
(beeps)

760
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,725
MERLIN:
<i>You have exactly one hour</i>

761
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,026
<i>to complete the test,</i>

762
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,761
starting now.

763
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:15,665
CHARLIE:
<i>New target, 800 meters.</i>

764
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,634
<i>You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here,</i>

765
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:19,769
lingering like
some big steaming shit

766
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,838
that just won't flush.
Roger that.

767
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,106
Target identified.

768
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,041
And how about
you shut the fuck up?

769
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,143
Positive discrimination,
that's what it is.

770
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,046
It's like those fucking state
school kids who get into Oxford

771
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,949
on "C" grades 'cause their mum
is a one-legged lesbian.

772
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,784
You don't know fuck all
about my grades.

773
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,119
Oh, forgive me, I'm sure
you're highly educated.

774
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,121
Fire when ready.

775
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,189
(gasps)

776
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,351
EGGSY: How's that
for positive discrimination?

777
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,906
I want to thank you both
for listening,

778
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,842
and I really, really appreciate
you traveling all this way,

779
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,277
Your Royal Highness.

780
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,246
And you, too,
Prime Minister.

781
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,349
I think this is quite brilliant.

782
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,851
It's absolutely brilliant.

783
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,086
(chuckles)

784
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,956
You are completely crazy.

785
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,966
(princess continues,
speaking Swedish)

786
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:27,303
Don't touch...
Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

787
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,005
But you've got
a big role to play

788
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,174
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.

789
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,042
You're popular,
inspirational,

790
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,378
and you have the power
to galvanize the people.

791
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,381
Now, whether
you're on board or not,

792
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:40,216
I'm going to have to insist

793
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:43,286
on getting you somewhere
I can ensure your safety.

794
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,022
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?

795
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:49,892
Well, I think it's about time
that a politician did something

796
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,296
that, uh...
actually made a difference.

797
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,732
Too true.

798
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:56,734
What...?

799
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,034
Take her away.

800
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:01,104
(speaking Swedish)

801
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:02,739
Drink?

802
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,141
Why not?

803
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,648
Don't worry. No harm
will come to the princess.

804
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,316
Well, I'm a republican anyway,

805
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,119
so it...
it really doesn't matter.

806
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,687
(both laugh)

807
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,022
Release the princess!

808
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,266
(screams)

809
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,903
(groans)

810
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,222
(screams)

811
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,914
(gasps)

812
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:53,790
Okay, you're done.

813
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,725
Not so bad, right?

814
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,827
Hardly felt a thing.

815
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,796
Welcome aboard.

816
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,731
Pleasure is all mine.

817
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,013
(Valentine laughs)

818
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,038
Ever heard of knocking?

819
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,474
Only when I'm casing
a place to rob.

820
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,210
Merlin said
you wanted to see me.

821
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,344
(barks)

822
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:16,346
I hope J.B.'s training

823
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,480
is going as well as yours is.

824
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:18,815
Sit.

825
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,019
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

826
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:26,989
Your test results were even
better than I could've hoped.

827
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,258
(knocking on door)

828
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,960
Come in.

829
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,464
Oh...

830
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,467
Eggsy, I need to have
a private conversation.

831
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:38,868
You're dismissed.

832
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,503
Nonsense.
Let him observe.

833
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,739
Might learn a thing or two.

834
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,040
As you wish.

835
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,942
Take a look at this.

836
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,944
HARRY:
Oh, for God's sake, I've barely
touched you. Oh, man up!

837
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,946
(explosion over video)
Fucking hell!

838
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,982
That is rank, Harry.

839
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,450
You blew up his head?

840
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:56,185
It's a bit much, innit?

841
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,154
Actually, the explosion
was caused

842
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,922
by an implant in his neck.

843
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,024
Here, under the scar.

844
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,427
HARRY: Did my hardware pick up
the signal that triggered it?

845
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,329
Fortunately, yes.

846
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,031
Unfortunately, the IP address
I traced it to is registered

847
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,166
to the Valentine Corporation.

848
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,034
HARRY:
That's not much of a lead.

849
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,936
He has millions
of employees worldwide.

850
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,498
EGGSY: That Richmond
Valentine is a genius.

851
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,779
Did you not see
his announcement today?

852
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:25,081
No.

853
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,216
(tapping keys on tablet)

854
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:31,187
We each spend on average
$2,000 a year

855
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,456
on cell phone
and Internet usage.

856
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,993
It gives me great pleasure
to announce

857
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,428
those days are over.

858
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,065
As of tomorrow,
every man, woman and child

859
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,934
can claim a free SIM card,

860
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:49,172
compatible with any cell phone,
any computer,

861
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:53,409
and utilize my communications
network for free.

862
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:58,347
Free calls, free Internet
for everyone.

863
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,949
Forever.

864
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,217
(applause)

865
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,101
HARRY: Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.

866
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:22,138
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a tête-à-tête.

867
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,944
He's having a gala dinner
next week.

868
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,412
I'll get you an invitation.

869
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:31,180
You need to be careful, though.

870
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,449
Since you've been out, hundreds
of VIPs have gone missing.

871
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,918
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

872
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,088
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.

873
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,870
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

874
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,104
What, don't like heights?

875
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,405
Yeah, it's okay.

876
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,541
I've done it before,
which is probably why,

877
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,176
come to think of it.

878
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,312
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

879
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,014
You're top of the class.

880
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,317
MERLIN (over speakers):
Listen up.

881
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,619
Your mission is to land
in the target

882
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:11,287
without the radar detecting you.

883
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,389
If I read you on the radar
or you miss the target,

884
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,224
you go home.

885
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,747
Is that understood?

886
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:22,668
<i>Drop zone coming up,
20 seconds.</i>

887
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,401
We got to go.

888
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,479
Eggsy, I really don't
think I can do this.

889
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,047
Of course you can't.

890
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,249
Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?

891
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:45,254
(beep)

892
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,657
Come on!
(whooping, laughing)

893
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,659
Eggsy! Eggsy, wait!
Hang on!

894
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,228
Roxy, just stop fucking about!

895
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,665
Follow me, yeah?

896
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,709
(whooping)

897
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:12,114
Come on!

898
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,150
(over radio):
Roxy, it's now or never.

899
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:16,118
Jump!

900
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,420
(Roxy gasps)

901
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,963
(whooping)

902
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,271
(laughing)

903
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:36,672
EGGSY: Good girl, Rox,
I'm glad you made it!

904
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,407
(whooping)
Yes!

905
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,376
(laughing, whooping)

906
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,516
Yeah!
Please!

907
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,989
Yeah!

908
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,457
Come on!

909
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,759
(laughter, whooping continue)

910
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,228
MERLIN:
My, my, you're all
very cheerful.

911
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,497
Did you really think it was
gonna be that straightforward?

912
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,133
Any idiot can read
a heads-up display.

913
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,501
A Kingsman agent
needs to be able

914
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,137
to solve problems
under pressure.

915
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:11,741
Like what to do when one of
your group has no parachute.

916
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,242
(chuckles)

917
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,011
ROXY: What? No parachute?!
EGGSY: Shit!

918
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,245
Who?!

919
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,413
Fuck!

920
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:18,581
Which one?

921
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,016
RUFUS:
What do we do?!

922
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,584
MERLIN:
I told you. Aim for the target.

923
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:23,285
Come in under the radar.

924
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,287
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

925
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:28,724
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target,

926
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,027
please know I'll be
very impressed.

927
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,829
RUFUS: Fuck!
ROXY: Oh, shit!

928
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,187
Everybody listen,
I've got a plan!

929
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,538
Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.

930
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,806
(panting)

931
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,442
Rufus, come on!

932
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:47,510
Oh, fuck!

933
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,345
EGGSY:
Rufus!

934
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,746
Oh, shit! I can't!

935
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,485
Fuck!
(sighs)

936
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,087
Oh, thank God.

937
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,849
EGGSY:
Rufus, you wanker!

938
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,491
Shit, we're an odd number now!

939
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,660
Quick, make a circle!

940
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,822
CHARLIE: Fuck, he's right!
Boys, let's do it.

941
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,402
We pull our cords one by one!

942
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,703
When we know who's fucked,

943
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,665
the person on their right
grabs them.

944
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,575
ROXY:
Okay, Eggsy.

945
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,110
MERLIN:
Good plan, Eggsy.

946
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:23,212
You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.

947
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,313
Me first!

948
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,683
Oh, fuck!

949
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,151
(laughs):
Yes!

950
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,186
(screams)

951
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:33,456
Okay, me next.

952
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,193
See you on the ground, boys.

953
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:40,863
(Roxy screams)

954
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:41,865
Now me.

955
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,290
Fuck!
(panting)

956
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,869
Roxy, no matter what happens
now, I've got you, all right?

957
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,280
(panting)
Okay, Eggsy.

958
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,349
Yours first, okay?
Yep.

959
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,493
(alarm beeping)

960
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,497
Oh, shit!

961
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,267
(screams)

962
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,405
Shit!

963
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,408
(gasping)
Shit!

964
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,844
(screaming)
Rox!

965
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,816
Fuck.

966
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,151
(screams)

967
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,287
(both grunt)

968
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,256
(both panting)

969
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,662
(both laughing)

970
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,501
Hugo, Digby.

971
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,571
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.

972
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:57,840
Rufus, you opened too soon.

973
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,542
You were all over the radar.

974
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,624
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.

975
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,714
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.

976
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,583
You set a new record.

977
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:09,218
Opening at 300 feet,

978
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,452
that's pretty ballsy.

979
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,321
Well done for completing
another task.

980
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,523
Fall out.
Sorry, sir.

981
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,926
But why the fuck did you
choose me as the gimp?

982
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,861
Am I the expendable candidate?
No, no, no.

983
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,462
You don't talk to me like that.

984
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,830
You have a complaint,
you come here

985
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,365
and you whisper it in my ear.

986
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:32,808
You need to take that chip
off your shoulder.

987
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,596
¶ ¶

988
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,302
(knocks)

989
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,907
Mr. DeVere.

990
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,508
It's a pleasure to meet you.

991
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,776
I'm awfully sorry.

992
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:09,345
I seem to have my
dates muddled up.

993
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,546
Oh, no, no, no.

994
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,781
I canceled the gala
because of you.

995
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:15,985
Anybody willing to donate that
much deserves their own dinner.

996
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,319
Come in.

997
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,755
Thank you.

998
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,959
Gotta admit, I was really
intrigued to meet you.

999
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,961
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.

1000
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,630
I don't doubt it.

1001
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,666
And, obviously, I had my people
look into your affairs,

1002
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,434
and that's some
pretty old money you're from.

1003
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,569
How'd your folks make it?

1004
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,471
Property, mostly.

1005
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:37,373
Property and the markets.

1006
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,541
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.

1007
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:42,011
Ah, look, I'm just into finding
out what caliber person you are.

1008
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:43,345
I'm sure you understand that.

1009
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:44,813
I most certainly do.

1010
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:45,815
Hope you're hungry.

1011
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,750
I'm famished.
Good.

1012
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,351
VALENTINE:
Grab a seat.

1013
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:50,986
(clinking footsteps)

1014
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,828
¶ ¶

1015
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,807
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

1016
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,008
Great choice!

1017
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,077
But nothing beats
two cheeseburgers

1018
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,745
with secret sauce.

1019
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,480
Goes great
with this '45 Lafite.

1020
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,748
A classic pairing.

1021
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,317
And may I suggest Twinkies and

1022
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,085
a 1937 Château d'Yquem
for pudding?

1023
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:25,421
I like it.

1024
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,655
So...

1025
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,924
you want to donate
to my foundation.

1026
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:31,460
You are aware that
I wound things down

1027
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:32,661
in that area, right?

1028
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,096
Climate change is a threat

1029
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,931
which affects us all,
Mr. Valentine.

1030
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,933
And you're one of
the few powerful men

1031
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,768
who seems to share my concerns.

1032
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,037
No, I shut things down because
I wasn't getting anywhere.

1033
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,641
Every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing.

1034
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,042
That carbon emissions
are a red herring

1035
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,911
and that we're past
the point of no return,

1036
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,846
no matter what
remedial actions we take.

1037
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,948
(laughs)
Oh, you know your shit.

1038
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,550
I sometimes envy
the blissful ignorance

1039
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:58,787
of those less well-versed
in the... shit.

1040
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,923
As Professor Arnold always said,

1041
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,891
"Humankind is the only virus

1042
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,893
"cursed to live with the
horrifying knowledge

1043
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:07,463
of its host's
fragile mortality."

1044
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:11,100
You know, not a lot of
people knew about him.

1045
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,369
(exhales)

1046
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:16,372
You like spy movies,
Mr. DeVere?

1047
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,907
¶ ¶

1048
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:22,444
Nowadays they're all a
little serious for my taste.

1049
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,046
But the old ones...

1050
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,081
marvelous.

1051
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,017
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.

1052
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,419
The old Bond movies!

1053
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:31,820
(chuckles): Oh, man!

1054
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:36,024
Oh, when I was a kid,
that was my dream job:

1055
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:37,893
gentleman spy.

1056
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,895
I always felt
the old Bond films

1057
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,997
were only as good
as the villain.

1058
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,099
As a child,
I rather fancied a future

1059
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,535
as a colorful megalomaniac.

1060
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:51,673
What a shame
we both had to grow up.

1061
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,177
(laughs softly)

1062
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,546
Bon appétit.

1063
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,684
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

1064
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,586
I'll have my people
get in touch with yours,

1065
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,988
and it's all good.

1066
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,792
And thank you for
such a... happy meal.

1067
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:10,993
(laughs softly)

1068
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,099
Well, want me to follow him?

1069
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,569
Nah. I put a nano tracker
gel in the wine.

1070
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,204
We'll know his every move

1071
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:24,206
for the next 24 hours.

1072
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,009
Finally find out
who he works for.

1073
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:29,745
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.

1074
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,213
All I got was this

1075
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:34,016
on the way in.

1076
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,620
South Glade Mission Church

1077
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,189
is a hate group
based in Kentucky.

1078
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:42,758
FBI have been
monitoring them for years.

1079
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,827
But you think Valentine
is a supporter?

1080
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:46,595
No evidence yet
of a direct connection,

1081
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,964
but I'll keep looking.

1082
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,233
Oh, by the way,
our ever-growing list

1083
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,535
of missing persons now includes

1084
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:55,904
Scandinavian royalty.

1085
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:58,240
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

1086
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:02,945
TILDE:
Just let me out...

1087
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:05,647
you psycho!
I told you,
you're free to go

1088
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,051
any time you want, as long
as you agree to my conditions.

1089
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:10,919
I don't agree,

1090
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:13,989
and I am never, ever
going to agree!

1091
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,524
Tough shit.

1092
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:16,825
Bitch.

1093
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,727
MAN (in distance):
Let me out! ...open up.

1094
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:21,063
I want to speak
to the British consul!

Tonight, in London.

1118
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,982
Who's this?

1119
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,984
Your target.
Your mission

1120
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,653
is to use your NLP training

1121
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,755
to win over the individual
in the photograph

1122

And when I say "win over,"

1124
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,226
I do mean in the biblical sense.

1125
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,627
Easy.

1126
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:28,263
Posh girls love
a bit of rough.

1127

We'll see
about that, yeah?

1128
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,635
We certainly will.

Hi. Sorry, I just had
to come over and say,

1131
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,643
amazing eyes.

1132
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:43,312
Are you wearing color contacts?

1133
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:44,947
No! (laughs)

CHARLIE: You so are.
ROXY: Oh, my God, negging!

00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,584
That's hilarious.

1136
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:50,652
I haven't heard anyone
try that since the noughties.

1137
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:51,887
Excuse me?

1138
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,122
Negging.
Saying something negative

1139
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,992
to a pretty girl in order to
undermine her social value.

1140
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:59,161
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

1141
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:01,096
Absurdly basic,

1142
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,065
neuro-linguistic
programming technique.

01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,100
Is it just me, or does
this champagne taste
a little bit funny?

1144
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,602
It's an acquired taste, mate.

1145
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,003
I think
it's just cheap.

1146
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,304
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.

1147
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:10,872
You know, if you're
into seduction techniques,

1148
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,874
this guy is textbook.
See what he just did?

1149
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:13,909
It's called an opinion opener.

1150
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,077
He got you talking

1151
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,979
with a neutral question,
got all of us

1152
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:18,714
involved in the conversation,
so that you

1153
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,949
craved individual attention.
No, I'm just saying

1154
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,618
the champagne tastes rank.

1155
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,386
Lady Sophie Montague-Herring,
phone call for you

1156
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,321
at reception.
Be right back.

1157
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,257
We'll see you in a bit, yeah?
ROXY: See you in a bit.

1158
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,226
Budge up, Rox.
I'm feeling a bit rough.

1159
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,694
Are you all right?
No.

1160
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,162
MAN:
Sorry to eavesdrop, but,

1161
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,064
you know, there's
a much easier way to guarantee

1162
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,833
getting someone home.

1163
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:40,268
Rohypnol.

1164
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,372
Or even something stronger.

1165
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:46,375
(conversation and music
slows and distorts)

1166
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,758
(slurred):
Who the fuck are you?

1167
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,860
Where am I?

1168
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,330
This knife...

1169
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,332
can save your life, eh?

1170
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,036
(train whistle blowing)

1171
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:15,804
Fuck!

1172
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:19,074
My employer's got
two questions for you, Eggsy:

1173
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,109
What the fuck is Kingsman,

1174
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,844
and who's Harry Hart?

1175
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,946
I don't know
who the fuck that is!

1176
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,948
Shit!
Oh, Eggsy, I just killed

1177
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,785
two of your friends for giving
me the same bullshit answer!

1178
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,219
Fuck!

1179
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,322
Just cut
the fucking ropes, please!

1180
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:35,390
MAN:
Hey, Eggsy!

1181
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:36,992
Is Kingsman worth dying for?

1182
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,727
(gasping):
F...

1183
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:41,430
Fuck you...!

1184
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,340
(whoosh)

1185
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,242
(whirring)

1186
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:56,244
Congratulations.

1187
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,526
Bloody well done.

1188
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:01,083
How'd the others do?

1189
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,318
Roxy passed with flying colors.

1190
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,886
Charlie's up next.

1191
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,121
Want to watch?

1192
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,990
Yeah, all right.

1193
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,027
Oh, fuck.

1194
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,795
Is Kingsman
really worth dying for?

1195
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,163
No, it fucking isn't!

1196
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,965
Shit, I'll tell you
what you want. Please!

1197
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,767
(panting):
Chester King is Arthur.

1198
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,969
Arthur's head of a spy agency...
It's called Kingsman.

1199
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:22,838
Get me out of here!
Thank you, Charlie.

1200
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,906
Much appreciated.
Come on!

1201
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,775
That wasn't the fucking deal!

1202
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:28,777
(screaming):
Fuck...!

1203
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,512
Oh, fuck!

1204
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:32,380
(whoosh)

1205
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,182
(whirring)

1206
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:36,051
(panting)

1207
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:38,787
I had such
high hopes for you.

1208
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,455
You're a bloody disgrace.

1209
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,023
Arthur, I'm sorry.

1210
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:44,126
At least untie me.

1211
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,794
Untie yourself.

1212
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,765
Arthur... Arthur, please.

1213
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:53,535
CHARLIE: I'm the fucking son
of the... shit!

1214
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:56,171
(shouting):
Anyone? Hello?

1215
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,974
Galahad, Percival,
congratulations.

1216
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:00,876
Your candidates
have reached the final stage

1217
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,110
of the testing process.

1218
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,512
As tradition allows,

1219
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:05,847
you now have 24 hours
to spend with them.

1220
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,249
Eggsy...

1221
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,785
you should know your
father reached this point.

1222
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,253
From now on,

1223
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:13,215
there are no safety nets,
understood?

1224
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,494
Good. Dismissed.

1225
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,430
(echoing over speakers):
Charlie,

1226
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,032
time to go home.

1227
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,468
CHARLIE:
Fuck you!

1228
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,430
Fucking Dad's
gonna hear about this!

1229
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:31,339
EGGSY (voice-over):
<i>"To pee</i>

1230
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,541
or not to pee?"

1231
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,042
That was the headline
the day after

1232
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:35,911
I defused a dirty bomb

1233
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,479
in Paris.

1234
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,314
EGGSY: "Germany - 1,
England - 5."

1235
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,882
Missed that game.

1236
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,384
I was breaking up
an undercover spy ring

1237
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,219
at the Pentagon.

1238
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:50,492
My first mission.

1239
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,360
Foiled the assassination

1240
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,895
of Margaret Thatcher.

1241
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,230
Not everybody'd thank you
for that one.

1242
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,531
The point is, Eggsy,

1243
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,400
nobody thanked me
for any of them.

1244
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:00,602
Front page news
on all these occasions

1245
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:02,170
was celebrity nonsense.

1246
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,172
Because it's the
nature of Kingsman

1247
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,208
that our achievements
remain secret.

1248
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,510
A gentleman's name should
appear in the newspaper

1249
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,345
only three times:
when he's born,

1250
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,614
when he marries,
and when he dies.

1251
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:16,084
And we are,
first and foremost, gentlemen.

1252
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,619
That's me fucked, then.

1253
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,855
Well, it's like
Charlie said...

1254
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,957
I'm just a pleb.
Nonsense.
Being a gentleman

1255
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,426
has nothing to do with the
circumstances of one's birth.

1256
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:27,262
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.

1257
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,931
Yeah, but how?

1258
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,399
All right, first lesson.

1259
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,501
You should have asked me
before you

1260
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,003
took a seat.

1261
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,504
Second lesson.

1262
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,907
How to make a proper martini.

1263
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,010
Yes, Harry.

1264
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,512
(quiet electrical buzzing)

1265
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,114
Goddamn it!

1266
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:47,582
This fucking hurts!

1267
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:50,585
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.

1268
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,953
What's wrong
with a simple switch?

1269
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:54,322
A simple switch?!

1270
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,458
This is an extremely
dangerous machine.

1271
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,660
It should only be
operated by someone

1272
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:01,429
as responsible
and sane as me.

1273
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:05,133
Bad shit can happen if this
falls into the wrong hands.

1274
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,168
Whoa! (gasps)

1275
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,037
We done here? Shit!

1276
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,006
No. Now this one.

1277
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,008
For the test at the church.

1278
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,176
This one just has
a short range.

1279
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,578
A simple switch will do.

1280
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,152
So are you gonna teach me
how to talk proper,

1281
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:25,520
like in<i> My Fair Lady?</i>

1282
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:27,188
Don't be absurd.

1283
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,091
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

1284
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,260
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.

1285
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,329
As Hemingway said,
"There is nothing noble

1286
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,698
"in being superior
to your fellow man.

1287
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,535
True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

1288
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,206
<i>Now...</i>

1289
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,642
the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

1290
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,644
By which I mean,
a bespoke suit.

1291
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,179
Never off the peg.

1292
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,714
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.

1293
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,215
So let's get you measured,

1294
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:55,984
and then, whether
you get the job

1295
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:58,386
or not, you'll have
a lasting and...

1296
01:05:58,388 --> 01:06:01,356
useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

1297
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:02,691
I'm so sorry, sir,

1298
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:05,060
but a gentleman is
completing his fitting.

1299
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:07,429
Fitting room two is available.

1300
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,264
One does
not use fitting room two

1301
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:11,733
when one is popping
one's cherry.

1302
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:14,035
Perhaps I'll show you
fitting room three

1303
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,337
while we wait.

1304
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:27,115
So we going up or down?

1305
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:29,150
Neither.

1306
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,418
This it?

1307
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,020
Of course not.

1308
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,688
Pull the hook on your left.

1309
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,592
(clicking, whirring)

1310
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:41,763
Ah, yes.

1311
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:44,466
Very, very nice.

1312
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,237
Now, you're going to
need a pair of shoes

1313
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,405
to go with your suit.

1314
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,574
An Oxford is any formal shoe

1315
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,476
with open lacing.

1316
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,712
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.

1317
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,180
"Oxfords, not brogues."

1318
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,782
Words to live by, Eggsy.

1319
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,283
Words to live by.

1320
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:03,685
Try a pair.

1321
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,287
Your weapon scores are
excellent, by the way.

1322
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:07,389
(clicks tongue)

1323
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,690
These you're familiar with.

1324
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,592
And this is
our standard-issue pistol.

1325
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,560
It's quite unique.
As you'll see, it also

1326
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:13,762
fires a shotgun cartridge

1327
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,064
for use in messy
close-range situations.

1328
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,766
How do they feel?
Yeah, good.

1329
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:19,167
Now do your very
best impersonation

1330
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,249
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

1331
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,573
No, Eggsy.

1332
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,713
That is sick.

1333
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,481
In the old days,
they had a phone

1334
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,716
in the heel, as well.
How do I get it back in?

1335
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,518
Well, it's coated in one of

1336
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,454
the fastest-acting neurotoxins
known to man, so...

1337
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:40,822
very carefully.

1338
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,361
Now, I've had
a lot of fun with this.

1339
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:49,230
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

1340
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,698
A poison...

1341
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,567
Harmless when ingested,
but at a time

1342
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,469
convenient to you,

1343
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:57,238
can be... remotely activated.

1344
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,573
Primed.

1345
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:01,109
Lethal.

1346
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,278
And what about these?

1347
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,446
What do these do?

1348
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,748
Electrocute you?
Don't be ridiculous.

1349
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,850
It's a hand grenade.
Shut up.

1350
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,386
You want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

1351
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:13,488
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand,

1352
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,256
but a Kingsman wears it
on whichever hand

1353
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,691
happens to be dominant.

1354
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,259
Touch the contact
behind the ring,

1355
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,541
it delivers 50,000 volts.

1356
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:22,797
And what about them?

1357
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,866
What makes them so special?
Nothing.

1358
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,802
That technology's caught up
with the spy world.

1359
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,839
Put it back, Eggsy.

1360
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,476
TAILOR:
<i>Ah, perfect timing.</i>

1361
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,112
Gentleman's just finished.

1362
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,851
Mr. DeVere!

1363
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,254
What a coincidence!

1364
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:49,624
You are totally
the reason I am here.

1365
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,160
When you left my house,
I was thirsting

1366
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:54,863
for that dope-ass
smoking jacket you had on,

1367
01:08:54,865 --> 01:08:56,631
and since I'm going
to Royal Ascot,

1368
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,800
and apparently you need one
of these penguin suits...

1369
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,468
here I am.

1370
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,203
What are you doing here?

1371
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:03,805
What's up, man?

1372
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,906
Richmond Valentine.

1373
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:06,508
This is my new valet.

1374
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,476
I was just introducing him
to my tailor.

1375
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,611
Another coincidence.

1376
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:11,412
So am I.

1377
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,314
Have you had any chance to
think further on my proposal?

1378
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,883
Most definitely.

1379
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:17,919
My people will be getting
in touch with you very soon.

1380
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,155
I guarantee it.

1381
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:21,823
A word of advice:

1382
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,626
Ascot requires top hat.

1383
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:27,195
I might suggest Lock & Co.

1384
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:28,563
Hatters.

1385
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:29,864
St. James's.

1386
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:31,766
"Lox," as in smoked fish?

1387
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,669
As in "locked up."

1388
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:35,937
Oh.

1389
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,705
(chuckles)

1390
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:40,808
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

1391
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,311
You all talk so funny.

1392
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:51,920
Gentlemen, would you
look after him, please?

1393
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:07,335
Now, this...

1394
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,571
is a dope-ass top hat.

1395
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,273
Gazelle!

1396
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:13,741
Let's go ascoting.

1397
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,612
VALENTINE (over speaker):
Your hat looks fine, Gazelle.

1398
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,981
Come on, don't make me late
for the queen.

1399
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:22,250
Come on, Gazelle,

1400
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:23,484
we're gonna be late.

1401
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,286
How far is Ascot?

1402
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:26,688
How far?

1403
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:31,993
Merlin said you wanted
to see me, sir?

1404
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,962
Sit down.

1405
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,465
(J.B. panting loudly)

1406
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,568
(J.B. barking)
Pretty dog.

1407
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,471
What's his name?
J.B.

1408
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,773
As in James Bond?
No.

1409
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:47,575
Jason Bourne?

1410
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,711
No. Jack Bauer.

1411
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,379
Oh!

1412
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:52,747
Bravo.

1413
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,582
It pains me
to admit it, Eggsy,

1414
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:57,652
but I think that one day
you might be as good a spy

1415
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:59,454
as any of them.

1416
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:06,728
Take it.

1417
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,898
(J.B. panting)

1418
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,970
Shoot the dog.

1419
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:17,939
¶ ¶

1420
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:23,945
This weapon is live.

1421
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,284
Shoot the dog.

1422
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:04,686
(sighs)

1423
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,321
(chuckles softly)

1424
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,922
Give me the gun.

1425
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,498
(gunshot in distance)

1426
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,968
At least the girl's got balls.

1427
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,707
Get out.

1428
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:28,409
I knew you couldn't make it.

1429
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:33,815
Go home.

1430
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,450
Merlin,

1431
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:37,452
send in Roxy, please.

1432
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:38,454
(Eggsy panting)

1433
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:02,377
Welcome...

1434
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,612
to Kingsman...

1435
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,047
Lancelot.

1436
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,521
¶ ¶

1437
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,605
(door opens in distance)
Mom?

1438
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,073
Eggsy!

1439
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,775
Oh, God, where have you been?

1440
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:35,410
I've been so worried about you.

1441
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:37,412
(kisses)

1442
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:40,114
Oh, my days,
look how big you've grown.

1443
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,956
Where is he?
I'm fine.

1444
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,792
Eggsy, please, please,
just don't get involved.

1445
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,860
Ma, I should never
have left you on your own.

1446
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:54,862
This stops right now.

1447
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,998
I'll be right back.
Eggsy...

1448
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,067
(indistinct chatter)

1449
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,836
Oi! Dean!

1450
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:04,705
Oh, Mugsy.
So you're back.

1451
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,741
What, you gone
and nicked a fucking taxi now?

1452
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,209
Yeah. Can I have a word

1453
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:09,877
about my mum's black eye?

1454
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,847
You want to have a word with me?
You get out of that cab,

1455
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:15,049
I'll knock you straight
back down on your fucking arse.

1456
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,784
(raspy laugh)

1457
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,153
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1458
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:21,989
Go on, lads.

1459
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,591
There'll be two hits:

1460
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:25,760
me hitting him;
him hitting the floor.

1461
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:26,894
Come on, then,

1462
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,696
you prick, let's see

1463
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:30,631
what you got, eh?
Want a bit of me?

1464
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,033
What are you doing?
What the fuck?

1465
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:33,601
Get out of the fucking car!
No, no! Come on!

1466
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,736
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you mug!

1467
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,004
Go on!
You got no bollocks!

1468
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:39,907
Come on, bruv,
he hit my fucking mum!

1469
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,510
Come back when you've
grown a pair! Mugsy!

1470
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:43,811
(panting)

1471
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,234
HARRY:
You throw away

1472
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:08,269
your biggest opportunity

1473
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,638
over a fucking dog.

1474
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,808
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1475
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,577
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.

1476
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:17,778
Yes, I did.

1477
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:22,016
And Mr. Pickle here
reminds me of that

1478
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,185
every time I take a shit.

1479
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:28,589
You shot your dog
and had it stuffed?

1480
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:29,924
You fucking freak.

1481
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:31,626
No, I shot my dog, and then

1482
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:33,761
I brought him home
and continued to care for him

1483
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,863
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1484
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,031
What?!

1485
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:40,167
It was a blank, Eggsy.

1486
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:42,837
It was a fucking blank.

1487
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:44,839
Remember Amelia?
Yeah.

1488
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,541
She didn't drown.

1489
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,143
She works in our tech department
in Berlin; she's fine.

1490
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:50,878
Limits must be tested.
A Kingsman

1491
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,614
only condones the risking
of a life to save another.

1492
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:56,317
Like my dad saved your life even
though your fuck-up cost his.

1493
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:58,879
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?

1494
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,756
Can't you see that
everything I've done

1495
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,624
has been about trying
to repay him?

1496
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,229
(quiet beeping)

1497
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,098
MERLIN:
Harry, listen to this.

1498
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,067
Valentine's at last
saying something of note.

1499
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,770
VALENTINE (over speaker):
Know what I love
about pen and paper?

1500
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:18,739
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1501
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,209
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.

1502
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:25,146
We... have total coverall.

1503
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:27,848
Like when all your numbers
in bingo are crossed out.

1504
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,150
GAZELLE:
Bingo?

1505
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:30,685
Bingo. The game.

1506
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:32,687
You have played
bingo, right?

1507
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,249
Do I look like
I play bingo?

1508
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,626
Point is...

1509
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:40,194
if our tests go well

1510
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,762
(over speaker):
at the church tomorrow,

1511
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,864
we are good to go.

1512
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:46,634
South Glade Mission Church.

1513
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:49,637
Merlin, get the plane ready.
(over radio): Will do.

1514
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,272
Harry, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna do ev...

1515
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,307
You should be.
You just stay right there.

1516
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:54,942
I'll sort this mess out
when I get back.

1517
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:03,150
CHURCH LEADER:
And I say to you, bear witness!

1518
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,853
(congregation shouting)
Watch the news.

1519
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,122
MAN: You preach!
Watch the news... AIDS!

1520
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,124
MAN 2: That's right!
Floods!

1521
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,193
The blood of the innocent
spilled!

1522
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:15,096
And yet,
there are those who doubt

1523
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:17,665
this is the wrath of God.

1524
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,200
(shouting)

1525
01:17:19,202 --> 01:17:23,037
Our filthy government
condones sodomy,

1526
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,705
divorce...

1527
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,207
abortion...

1528
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:28,743
and yet, some still doubt

1529
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,345
this is the work
of the Antichrist!

1530
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:34,348
(people shouting)
You do not have to be a Jew,

1531
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:35,950
a nigger, a whore,

1532
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:38,052
Praise the Lord! Amen!
Or a atheistic,

1533
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:40,888
science-lovin'

1534
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,723
MERLIN (over radio):
Charming sermon.

1535
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,692
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1536
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,060
CHURCH LEADER:
So, my friends,

1537
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,695
although he is a just God,

1538
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,230
he is justly

1539
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:50,297
(distant):
a vengeful one,

1540
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,333
and there can be
no turning back

1541
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,035
(over speaker):
from the Almighty...

1542
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:55,870
You sure we're out of range?

1543
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,772
We're over a thousand feet away.
What's wrong?

1544
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:59,140
What if the calculations
are wrong?

1545
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:00,841
You just have to trust me.

1546
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:01,976
(church leader continues)

1547
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,311
...Jew, nigger, fag-lovers,

1548
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,681
and the Devil is burning them

1549
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:07,948
for all eternity!

1550
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,216
Would you excuse me?

1551
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,918
Where are you going?

1552
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,788
Hey. What's your problem?

1553
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,323
I'm a Catholic whore

1554
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:18,426
currently enjoying
congress out of wedlock

1555
01:18:18,428 --> 01:18:20,361
with my black,
Jewish boyfriend

1556
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:23,164
who works in a military
abortion clinic.

1557
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,199
So, hail Satan,

1558
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,268
and have a lovely
afternoon, madam.

1559
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,837
CHURCH LEADER: ...he may,
in fact, use us...

1560
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:32,173
VALENTINE:
Oh, shit. He's leaving.

1561
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,908
I'm starting the test now.

1562
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,310
Let's hope enough of these
freaks have our SIM cards.

1563
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:38,879
(church leader continues
over speaker)

1564
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,015
CHURCH LEADER:
Might I ask you to sit down,

1565
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:43,350
my friend!
WOMAN: Just leave this church!

1566
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:45,853
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!

1567
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:48,255
(angry shouting continues)

1568
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,824
WOMAN:
Satan cannot save you now!

1569
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:51,759
You will eat your babies!

1570
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,762
You will drown
in the blood of the Lord!

1571
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:58,899
(high-pitched whirring)
He will not save you!

1572
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:01,802
(whirring growing louder)

1573
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,071
Holy fuck!

01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,439
(shouting, screaming)

1575
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,741
Aw, shit, I can't watch this.

1576
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,023

HARRY:
What did you do to me?

1610
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:15,155
I had no control.

1611
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,324
I killed all those people.

1612
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:20,494
I wanted to.

1613
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,695
Clever, isn't it?

1614
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:24,331
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave

01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,467
that triggers
the centers of aggression

and switches off inhibitors.

Transmitted through your nasty,

Do you know what
this is like?

It's like those

Now I'm gonna tell you my
whole plan, and then I'm gonna

1621
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,154
come up with some absurd and
convoluted way to kill you,

1622
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:49,690
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

Sounds good to me.

(gasping quietly)

1628
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,311
VALENTINE:
Is he dead?

1629
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,714
That tends to happen when you
shoot someone in the head.

1630
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,583
It feels good, right?
No, no,
it does not feel good.

1631
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:18,585
It feels fucking awful.
What?! You just killed

1632
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:20,087
how many people in that church?

1633
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:22,089
This is one guy.
No, no, no,

1634
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,658
they killed each other.

1635
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:28,262
Okay, send out
the countdown clock.

1636
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:29,696
This party starts...

1637
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:31,065
tomorrow.

1642
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:06,800
Arthur?

1643
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,704
Are you there?

1644
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:13,240
(over speaker):
Sadly, I am.

1645
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,609
Assemble the Kingsmen.

1646
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:18,779
(panting)

1647
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:22,783
HARRY:
<i>Can't you see that</i>
<i>everything I've done</i>

1648
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,486
<i>has been about
trying to repay him?</i>

1649
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:30,124

HARRY:
<i>I see a young man</i>
<i>with potential,</i>

1652
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,844
<i>who wants to do something good

(tires screech)

1655
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,529
Arthur,

1656
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:10,264
Harry's dead.

1657
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:11,632
Galahad...

1658
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:12,933
is dead.

1659
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:15,802
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.

1660
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:18,305
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.

1661
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:21,175
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?

1662
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,944
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.

1663
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:25,646
If they all go homicidal
at the same time, then...

1664
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:27,181
Indeed.

1665
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:29,216
And thanks to
Galahad's recordings,

1666
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,451
we have Valentine's confession.

1667
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,453
The intelligence
has been passed on

1668
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:35,289
to the relevant authorities.

1669
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,890
Our work is complete,

1670
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,693
and a most distinguished
legacy for our fallen friend,

1671
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,828
it is, too.

1672
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,564
And that's it?

1673
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,799
Come and sit down, boy.

1674
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:50,771
This...

1675
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:54,841
is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy,

1676
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:58,612
and we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1677
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:02,282
Galahad was very
fond of you.

1678
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,954
And on this occasion,
I think it's acceptable

1679
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,555
for us...

1680
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,357
to bend the rules a little.

1681
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,927
Are these all Kingsmen?

1682
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,863
ARTHUR: Yes,
they're, uh, founder members.

1683
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:19,766
I want you to join
me in a toast.

1684
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:24,004
To Galahad.

1685
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:26,306
To Galahad.

1686
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:33,447
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.

1687
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:35,015
Why now?

1688
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:36,783
You're very good, Eggsy.

1689
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:40,587
Perhaps I will make you my
proposal for Galahad's position.

1690
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:43,790
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye

1691
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:46,493
on certain political matters.

1692
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:49,863
Can you guess...

1693
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:51,598
(quiet electronic whirr)

1694
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,367
...what this is?

1695
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:55,469
I don't have to;
Harry showed me.

1696
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:56,903
You click it, I die.

1697
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:58,972
I thought that brandy tasted
a bit shit.

1698
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,407
(chuckles)

1699
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:01,675
Bravo.

1700
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:04,278
Valentine won you over...

1701
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,646
somehow.

1702
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,748
Once he explained, I understood.

1703
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,783
VALENTINE:
<i>When you get a virus,</i>

1704
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,351
you get a fever.

1705
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:13,820
That's the human body
raising its core temperature

1706
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:15,622
to kill the virus.

1707
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,958
Planet Earth works
the same way.

1708
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,327
Global warming is the fever.

1709
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,863
Mankind is the virus.

1710
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:25,565
We're making our planet sick.

1711
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:28,035
A cull is our only hope.

1712
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:30,537
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves,

1713
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,473
there's only one
of two ways this can go.

1714
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:37,544
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1715
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:39,913
Either way...
ARTHUR:<i> The result</i>

1716
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,682
is the same.

1717
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:43,583
The virus dies.

1718
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:45,786
So Valentine's gonna take care

1719
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:47,954
of the population problem
himself.

1720
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:50,791
Well, if we don't do
something, nature will.

1721
01:28:50,793 --> 01:28:52,626
Sometimes a culling
is the only way

1722
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:55,629
to ensure that this
species survives.

1723
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:57,531
And history will see Valentine

1724
01:28:57,533 --> 01:29:00,534
as the man who saved
humanity from extinction.

1725
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:03,537
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1726
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,539
All his rich mates,
they get to live,

1727
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,107
and anyone he thinks
is worth saving,

1728
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,608
he's keeping them safe,

1729
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,610
whether they agree
with him or not.

1730
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:12,879
And you... Eggsy.

1731
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:15,582
In Harry's honor,

1732
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:19,553
I am inviting you
to be part of a new world.

1733
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:24,591
It's time to make your decision.

1734
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,567
I'd rather be with Harry.

1735
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:34,968
Thanks.

1736
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,770
So be it.

1737
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:49,816
(panting)

1738
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,084
(grunts)

1739
01:29:51,086 --> 01:29:52,652
(groans)

1740
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:56,757
The problem with us
common types is...

1741
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:58,892
that we're light-fingered.

1742
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:01,561
Kingsman's taught me
a lot, but...

1743
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:02,763
sleight of hand...

1744
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:05,132
Yes, they're, uh,
founder members.

1745
01:30:05,134 --> 01:30:06,933
(panting)

1746
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:09,069
...I had that down already.

1747
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:10,971
(continues panting)

1748
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:14,074
You dirty little

1749
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:16,676
fucking... prick.

1750
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,433
(electronic chime)

1751
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:52,712
It's okay, Lancelot.
Put it down.

1752
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,481
It's verified.

1753
01:30:57,219 --> 01:30:58,852
Arthur's phone is
receiving update texts

1754
01:30:58,854 --> 01:31:00,954
about getting to safety...
We don't have a lot of time.

1755
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,189
What are you gonna do?

1756
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:04,090
Question is,
what are we gonna do?

1757
01:31:04,092 --> 01:31:07,561
God knows who's in Valentine's
pocket and who's not.

1758
01:31:07,563 --> 01:31:09,963
We have no choice.

1759
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,732
We're gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1760
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:17,604
Follow me.

1761
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:20,040
¶ ¶

1762
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:37,858
What the fuck is this?

1763
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,893
I have no idea.

1764
01:31:39,895 --> 01:31:41,895
What you're playing with

1765
01:31:41,897 --> 01:31:43,830
is a prototype personal
trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1766
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,832
It was developed
as part of Reagan's

1767
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:47,267
Star Wars project.

1768
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:50,237
It's pretty basic,
but... it should still work.

1769
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,939
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.

1770
01:31:52,941 --> 01:31:55,041
We're gonna break the
chain, stop the signal.

1771
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:57,677
It'll take him a couple
of hours to reroute it,

1772
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,813
which buys us enough time

1773
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:02,816
for you to get me into
Valentine's mainframe so I can

1774
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:04,050
shut it down.

1775
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:05,619
Lancelot,

1776
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,153
you're gonna be using it.

1777
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:09,256
Get into your halo suit.

1778
01:32:10,626 --> 01:32:12,592
¶ ¶

1779
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,568
PILOT (over radio):
<i>Swedish Prime Minister,</i>

1780
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,936
<i>requesting permission to land.</i>

1781
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:31,077
MAN (over radio):
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1782
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:35,282
Please.

1783
01:32:35,284 --> 01:32:36,983
Thank you.

1784
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:38,051
VALENTINE: So, how many more
are we expecting?

1785
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,053
GAZELLE:
Not many.

1786
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:40,654
Most have their own bunkers.

1787
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:44,090
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.

1788
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:46,726
WOMAN:
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1789
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,728
MERLIN:
<i>It seems the implant</i>

1790
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,730
can emit some kind
of counter signal

1791
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,566
to ensure the wearer
remains unaffected

1792
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:54,167
by the waves from
the SIM cards.

1793
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:55,669
The waves that turn everyone

1794
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:57,671
into a psycho killer.
Quite.

1795
01:32:57,673 --> 01:32:59,606
But what he probably
didn't tell anyone

1796
01:32:59,608 --> 01:33:03,343
is it can also super-heat their
soft tissue at his command.

1797
01:33:03,345 --> 01:33:05,612
Valentine selected
his chosen few

1798
01:33:05,614 --> 01:33:08,782
to get the countdown warning,
but he had to be sure

1799
01:33:08,784 --> 01:33:11,217
they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.

1800
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:13,320
How does this help us
right now?

1801
01:33:13,322 --> 01:33:14,988
It doesn't.

1802
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,790
Roxy! Here we go!

1803
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:18,758
¶ ¶

1804
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:33,306
MERLIN: The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.

1805
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:37,744
When you reach the edge of
the atmosphere, they'll explode.

1806
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,179
You'll need to deploy your
missile just before that, okay?

1807
01:33:39,181 --> 01:33:40,981
The edge of the atmosphere.

1808
01:33:40,983 --> 01:33:42,315
Once you've deployed,

1809
01:33:42,317 --> 01:33:44,718
you'll need to release
for descent fast.

1810
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,119
Good luck.

1811
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:51,224
You can do this, okay?
Yeah.

1812
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:54,127
Eggsy, come on!
Time is not our friend.

1813
01:33:55,664 --> 01:33:57,697
(breathing anxiously)

1814
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:00,000

1815
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,675
(anxious breathing continues)

1816
01:34:15,751 --> 01:34:17,884
MERLIN:
<i>You're getting in</i>
<i>on Arthur's invitation.</i>

1817
01:34:17,886 --> 01:34:20,086
You're gonna need to blend in.

1818
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:23,223
I'm supposed to be Arthur?
His invitation's in his phone.

1819
01:34:23,225 --> 01:34:24,658
Give them this.

1820
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,026
Give his real name:
Chester King.

1821
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:27,160
What about you?

1822
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:28,862
I'm your pilot...
I'm gonna stay here.

1823
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,363
Is that gonna fit me?

1824
01:34:30,365 --> 01:34:31,965
A bespoke suit...

1825
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,733
always fits.

1826
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:35,735
Just be grateful
Harry had it made for you.

1827
01:34:35,737 --> 01:34:37,671
Get dressed.

1828
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:38,872
What the fuck's wrong with them?

1829
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:41,174
I don't know.

1830
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:43,143
Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.

1831
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:44,377
Give me the mic.

1832
01:34:46,982 --> 01:34:48,848
Hey-oh!

1833
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,250
Everybody, listen up!

1834
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:51,951
Hello, hello!

1835
01:34:51,953 --> 01:34:54,087
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

1836
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:57,257
I just want to remind you
that today

1837
01:34:57,259 --> 01:34:59,893
is a day of celebration.

1838
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:04,264
We must put aside
all thoughts of death

1839
01:35:04,266 --> 01:35:06,199
and focus on birth.

1840
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,803
The birth of a new age.

1841
01:35:09,805 --> 01:35:15,442
<i>We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.</i>

1842
01:35:15,444 --> 01:35:18,011
<i>We should honor
their sacrifice...</i>

1843
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:20,146
Has she got my number to
call me back? I got a new phone.

1844
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:23,450
VALENTINE: <i>...and their roles
in saving the human race.</i>

01:35:23,452 --> 01:35:25,719
(indistinct conversations)
(cameras clicking)

1846
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:30,790
<i>We must put aside
doubt and guilt.</i>

1847
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:35,929
You are the chosen people.

1848
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:38,865
When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark

1849
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:41,735
is Noah the bad guy?
GROUP: No!

1850
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,870
Is God the bad guy?

1851
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,904
GROUP:
No!

1852
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,239
How about the animals marching

1853
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:48,041
two by two?
No!

1854
01:35:48,043 --> 01:35:49,142
Of course not!

1855
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:50,276
(laughs)

1856
01:35:50,278 --> 01:35:51,478
Yeah, that's it!

1857
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:55,782
Let's turn those frowns
upside down.

1858
01:35:55,784 --> 01:35:57,484
Eat, drink

1859
01:35:57,486 --> 01:36:02,355
and party...!

1860
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:04,958
And I will see you all
in the new age.

1862
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,951
EGGSY (over radio):
Rox, It's me.

1863
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,120
How's the view?

1864
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:37,892
Hideous.

1865
01:36:37,893 --> 01:36:39,125
Mine's pretty sweet.

1866
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:40,860
They made you
one of these suits yet?

1867
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:42,195
(over radio):
No, not yet.

1868
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:44,531
You've got something
to look forward to then.

1869
01:36:44,533 --> 01:36:46,366
We're coming up
on Valentine's base.

1870
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:48,935
Gotta go.

1871
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:50,904
Good luck.

1872
01:36:57,245 --> 01:36:58,812
Looking good, Eggsy.

1873
01:37:00,882 --> 01:37:04,217
Feeling good, Merlin.

1874
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,157
MERLIN (over radio):
<i>This is November-</i>
<i>2-4-7-Charlie-Kilo,</i>

1875
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,126
requesting permission to land.

1876
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:19,232
MAN (over radio):
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1877
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:24,370
Fuck me.

1878
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:25,652
Mm-hmm.

1879
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:39,986

1880
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:52,932
MERLIN:
<i>Eggsy,</i>

1881
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:54,267
we're on.

1882
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,116
Chester King.

1883
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:13,086
Mr. King, welcome.

1884
01:38:13,088 --> 01:38:15,255
I'm sure you've
adhered to Valentine's

1885
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:17,323
strict no-weapons policy,
but if you don't object...

1886
01:38:17,325 --> 01:38:18,892
Of course.

1887
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:20,426
Thank you.

1888
01:38:20,428 --> 01:38:23,196
Do you have any luggage?

1889
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,597
Congratulations, Mycroft,

1890
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:27,200
you just graduated
from my pilot to my valet.

1891
01:38:27,202 --> 01:38:28,668
You cheeky...

1892
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:30,236
Understood?

1893
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,604
Good.

1894
01:38:31,606 --> 01:38:33,306
Thank you.

MERLIN (over earpiece): Eggsy,
find a laptop, get me online.

1898
01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:04,470
The clock is ticking.

1899
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:07,974
And remember, try to blend in.

1900
01:39:07,976 --> 01:39:10,977
Would sir care for a drink?

1901
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:12,412
Martini.

1902
01:39:12,414 --> 01:39:14,647
Gin, not vodka, obviously.

1903
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,316
Stirred for ten seconds

an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1905
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,086
Thank you.

1906
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:25,024
Merlin, are you clocking this?

1907
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,125
Yes, I am.

1908
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,627
Stay focused.

1909
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:30,096
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1910
01:39:30,098 --> 01:39:31,731
(over radio):
Yes, Merlin.

1911
01:39:31,733 --> 01:39:35,568
MERLIN:
Eggsy, get me online now.

1912
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:38,604
EGGSY:
Yep, I'm on it.

1913
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:40,707
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1914
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:43,009
Those balloons won't last
much longer.

1915
01:39:43,011 --> 01:39:44,344
Prepare to engage missile.

1916
01:39:45,413 --> 01:39:47,280

Long live society.

1921
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,133
Amen to that.

How'd you get online?
I couldn't.

1925
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,073
Oh, well,
it's a closed network, you see.

1926
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:16,595
Pre-authorized
connections only.
Ah.

1927
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:21,014
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1928
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:22,348
EGGSY:
Do you have the correct time?

1929
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,416
I think I'm still
in my last time zone.

1930
01:40:23,418 --> 01:40:25,284
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let's see now.

MERLIN:
Eggsy, I'm in.

1933
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:41,701
Get your arse
back to the plane, now.

1934
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,069
On my way.
Lancelot, good luck!

1935
01:40:43,071 --> 01:40:44,103
Firing in three,

1936
01:40:44,105 --> 01:40:45,571

1937
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,075
(gasps)

1938
01:40:52,814 --> 01:40:54,280
Nice and slow.

1939
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:55,481
Fuck are you doing here?

1940
01:40:55,483 --> 01:40:58,151
Well, my family
were invited, obviously.

1941
01:40:58,153 --> 01:40:59,652
Now, get the fuck up.
Slowly.

1942
01:40:59,654 --> 01:41:00,787
MERLIN:
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1943
01:41:00,789 --> 01:41:02,755
Lancelot, hurry up and fire!

1944
01:41:02,757 --> 01:41:04,624
That other balloon
is gonna blow!

1945
01:41:04,626 --> 01:41:06,459
Yes, Merlin.
I've nearly got it.

1946
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:07,627
Give me a second!

1947
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:12,532
Valentine!
I've caught a fucking spy!

1948
01:41:12,534 --> 01:41:13,699
V-Glass, zoom.

1949
01:41:13,701 --> 01:41:15,535
Oh, fuck!

1950
01:41:15,537 --> 01:41:17,617
It's that young valet.
(zapping, grunting)

1951
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,108
Son of a bitch.

1952
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,590
ROXY:
Got it!

1953
01:41:25,146 --> 01:41:26,479
(people shouting, murmuring)

1954
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:30,750
(screaming)

1955
01:41:32,821 --> 01:41:34,253
VALENTINE:
Oh, shit.

1956
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:35,755
Sound the alarm!

1957
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:38,658
I'm not taking any chances.

1958
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,393
Okay, you send out
the two-minute warning.

1959
01:41:40,395 --> 01:41:42,955
I'm starting the override.
All right, let's do this.

1960
01:41:44,232 --> 01:41:47,233
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Countdown initiated.

1961
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:50,470
(automatic gunfire)

1962
01:41:55,577 --> 01:41:57,297
You see him?
Right here.

1963
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:01,514
(gasping)

1964
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:07,720
MERLIN:
Eggsy, take a left.

1965
01:42:07,722 --> 01:42:09,188
Two guards, up ahead.

1966
01:42:14,796 --> 01:42:16,329
(groaning)

1967
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:22,702
Lancelot, release now!

1968
01:42:22,704 --> 01:42:25,338
(groans)

1969
01:42:33,448 --> 01:42:34,647
MERLIN:
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead,</i>
<i>then right.</i>

1970
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:36,382
There's two more.

1971
01:42:40,688 --> 01:42:41,687
All right,
everybody on your feet!

1972
01:42:41,689 --> 01:42:44,257
Countdown to V-day!

1973
01:42:44,259 --> 01:42:45,858
Welcome in the new age!

1974
01:42:54,269 --> 01:42:55,301
Aah! Flat spin!

1975
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:03,376
(men shouting)

1976
01:43:09,617 --> 01:43:12,417
MERLIN:
Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow tunnel!

1977
01:43:21,362 --> 01:43:23,329
(Roxy screaming)
VALENTINE:<i> Here we go!</i>

1978
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:24,463

1987
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,880
one!

1988
01:43:43,685 --> 01:43:46,385
MERLIN:
Nice!

1989
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:47,420
(over radio):
Well done, both of you.

1990
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:49,222
It's not working!

1991
01:43:49,224 --> 01:43:50,456
It's supposed to be working!

1992
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:52,138
What the fuck?
(stammers)

1993
01:43:54,996 --> 01:43:56,996
(panting)

1994
01:43:56,998 --> 01:43:58,798
EGGSY (over radio):
Yes!

1995
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,233
Well done, Rox. Good girl.

1996
01:44:03,605 --> 01:44:05,705
We've lost one of
our satellites.

1997
01:44:10,778 --> 01:44:12,378
(computer beeping)

1998
01:44:15,683 --> 01:44:18,451
Oh, no, no.
There's no way

1999
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:19,518
I can hack past that.

2000
01:44:24,492 --> 01:44:25,992
What's going on?

2001
01:44:25,994 --> 01:44:28,361
Is there a problem?

2002
01:44:28,363 --> 01:44:30,763
Come on,
there's no need for guns.

2003
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,431
I'm just a pilot.

2004
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:35,701
(gun clicks)
Fuck.

2005
01:44:35,703 --> 01:44:37,303
Merlin!
(gunshots)

2006
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,805
Get in here!

2007
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:47,280
Come on!

2008
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,616
Let's get the fuck out of here!

2009
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,451
We can't.

2010
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:53,719
I can't get
into Valentine's machine.

2011
01:44:53,721 --> 01:44:55,755
He's got biometric security.

2012
01:44:55,757 --> 01:44:58,024
You're gonna have
to get in there

2013
01:44:58,026 --> 01:44:59,892
and make sure his hand
never touches that desk.

2014
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:02,361
Are you taking the fucking piss?

2015
01:45:02,363 --> 01:45:03,663
I'm afraid not.

2016
01:45:03,665 --> 01:45:05,431
(sighs)

2017
01:45:05,433 --> 01:45:07,800
Let's have that then.

2018
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:08,968
Uh-uh.

2019
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:10,670
This is mine.

2020
01:45:10,672 --> 01:45:11,837
I'll show you yours.

2021
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:31,490
Good choice.

2022
01:45:33,761 --> 01:45:35,728
VALENTINE:
How long to re-link
the satellite chain?

2023
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:37,363
It'll take an hour,
maybe two.

2024
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:39,598
Bullshit! Just bring
these two closer together.

2025
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,866
But that's not yours.

2026
01:45:45,606 --> 01:45:47,840
V-Glass, call E-man.

2027
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:48,908
(beeping)

2028
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:50,543
E, it's V.

2029
01:45:50,545 --> 01:45:52,545
Listen, man, I got
a little hiccup on this end.

2030
01:45:52,547 --> 01:45:53,813
I need to piggyback.

2031
01:45:53,815 --> 01:45:55,081
One of my satellites
just went down,

2032
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:57,043
but it's right next
to one of yours.

2033
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,585
You read my mind.

2034
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:02,355
How long before
you make that happen?

2035
01:46:05,093 --> 01:46:06,792
Go.

2036
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,651
All right,
we should be coming back online.

2037
01:46:14,936 --> 01:46:16,369
Ten percent.

2038
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:20,406
Oh, shit!

2039
01:46:20,408 --> 01:46:22,375
Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.

2040
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:24,543
(over radio):
He's going to reconnect
the chain.

2041
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:25,945
It's going to take him
no time at all.

2042
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:27,947
It's at 20 percent.

2043
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,466
Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got

2044
01:46:47,468 --> 01:46:48,567
a present for you.

2045
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:50,536
Get a move on!

2046
01:47:01,849 --> 01:47:03,482
(screaming)

2047
01:47:22,804 --> 01:47:24,103
Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?

2048
01:47:24,105 --> 01:47:26,071
Not yet, but he will be soon.

2049
01:47:26,073 --> 01:47:27,840
Good.

2050
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:41,921
Merlin, I'm fucked.

2051
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,101
As am I.

2052
01:47:56,103 --> 01:47:57,470
They're coming at me
from both sides.

2053
01:47:57,472 --> 01:47:58,737
I'm out of options.

2054
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:00,906
Rox, Rox, I need a favor.

2055
01:48:00,908 --> 01:48:02,775
Call my mum.

2056
01:48:02,777 --> 01:48:04,777
Tell her to lock herself
away from Dean.

2057
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,512
(over radio):
<i>And the baby...</i>

2058
01:48:06,514 --> 01:48:08,013
<i>and...</i>

2059
01:48:08,015 --> 01:48:09,055
tell her I love her.

2060
01:48:17,959 --> 01:48:19,158
Oh, for fuck's sake.

2061
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:26,765
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?

2062
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:29,702
Any chance you can turn them on?

2063
01:48:32,874 --> 01:48:34,173
All right.

2064
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:35,708
My turn to play, Valentine.

2065
01:48:45,253 --> 01:48:46,719
Oh, oh, no!

2066
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:48,053
No, no, what the fuck is he...

2067
01:48:48,055 --> 01:48:49,055
I can't stop this.

2068
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,195
(sighs)

2069
01:49:02,236 --> 01:49:03,602
Yes, please.

2070
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,274
No!

MERLIN:
Oh, my God!

2074
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:09,335
That is fucking spectacular!

Merlin, you're a fucking genius!

WOMAN:
What the fuck is
happening out there?

2078
01:50:19,046 --> 01:50:20,846
Aren't you that princess

2079
01:50:20,848 --> 01:50:22,648
who went missing?
Can you get me out?

2080
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:24,283
If I do,
will you give me a kiss?

2081
01:50:24,285 --> 01:50:25,818
I've always wanted
to kiss a princess.

2082
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,820
If you get me out right now,

2083
01:50:27,822 --> 01:50:29,922
I'll give you more
than just a kiss.

2084

VALENTINE (over speakers):
You motherfucker.

2085
01:50:31,692 --> 01:50:33,192
Did you really think
I was stupid enough

2086
01:50:33,194 --> 01:50:36,729
to implant one of those things
in my own head?

2087
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:38,764
What are you, fucking crazy?

2088
01:50:38,766 --> 01:50:41,934
All those innocent people
killed, and for what?

2089
01:50:41,936 --> 01:50:46,372
You didn't stop shit!

2090
01:50:46,374 --> 01:50:47,940
Yeah, fine,
I've locked the door.

2091
01:50:47,942 --> 01:50:49,775
What do you want me to do now?
As I said,

2092
01:50:49,777 --> 01:50:50,809
put your daughter
in the bathroom

2093
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:52,011
and throw away the key.

2094
01:50:52,013 --> 01:50:55,247
VALENTINE:
It's still happening!

2095
01:50:55,249 --> 01:50:56,415
You're fucking insane.

2096
01:50:56,417 --> 01:50:57,977
ROXY:
Just do it.

MERLIN:
Eggsy, the signal's started!

Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now!

2105
01:51:29,216 --> 01:51:30,849
Sorry, love.

2106
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,351
Gotta save the world.

2107
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:35,921
If you save the world,
we can do it in the asshole.
