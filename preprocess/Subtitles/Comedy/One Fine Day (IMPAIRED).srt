here's Maggie's doctor's number

167
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,739
and the number of
a really good baby-sitter

168
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,811
who can help you out tomorrow.

169
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,480
She's got a walk-on part
on a soap today.

170
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,149
And there's one last thing.
This is really important.

171
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,525
My neighbor was
supposed to take Maggie

172
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,730
to the Westside Montessori School
for me this morning.

173
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,487
Okay? She lives
in my building.

174
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,323
- Jack. Jack?
- Upp. Hupp!

This is her number.

176

Okay.

177
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,203
Her name is Melanie Parker.

178
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,331
Now, if you want her to take
Maggie to school for you...

179
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,335
If you want her to take
Maggie to school for you,

180
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,584
bring Maggie to her house

181
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,877
before 8:00 so you don't miss them.

182
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,295
If not,
call Mel and let her know

183
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,005
that you don't need her
to take Maggie.

184
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,674
Jack, okay?
I'm gonna miss my plane.

185
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,343
I don't think this
is a very good idea.

186
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,677
Maybe I should just
cancel my honeymoon.

187
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,442
Don't cancel your honeymoon.
Give me these.

188

- You sure?
- Yep.

189

Okay. Those are
the telephone numbers.

190
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,975

- Bye, baby!

that both our kids

The first lady.

We're thinking about
doing a piece on her.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,123
No. You're insulted
because I said

00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,292
that I had a presentation
and that you don't work.

There's nobody in there!

it was the first boat.

you had one in 15 minutes.

And then you watch them
for me later on today

I'm not stupid.

- What do you say?
- You're stupid.

You're welcome, sweetheart.

You were saying?

408
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,766
Well, uh, uh... I was saying

409
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,893
that maybe we could
just help each other,

410

help each other out today.

Hey.

00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,323
Looks like you missed the boat.

414
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,200
I guess we did.

415
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,327
Hmm.

416
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,664
I really don't need your help,

417
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,249
but if I did, you would be

418
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,043
the very last person
I would turn to.

419

at 8:30 this morning.

Now they are spending
the day with you.

00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,011
God. I am going
to be so late.

424
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,221
I have such a day.
Oh! A bus!

425
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,306
Mom...

426
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,724
Those aren't toys.

427
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,602
Mom. It's just
a phone. Mom!

428
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,021
Don't be like that
when you grow up.

429
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,193
She... She, um...

430
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,237
She just drops off, uh,

431
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,116
a bag of cookies and tells me
to keep them for a week.

432
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,702
And how do you feel
about the cookies, Jack?

433
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,912
Love the cookies.

434
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,623
I have a big problem
with the, uh...

435
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,875
Cookie maker?

436
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
That's right.

437
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,171
Because the cookie maker
thinks that all I am interested in

438
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
or all that I am
capable of handling,

439
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,760
uh, with respect to
the cookie question,

440
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,720
is the...

441
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,597
- The frosting?
- The...

442
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,974
Exactly.

443
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,860
Now, just because the frosting
is my specialty

444
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,854
doesn't mean
that I can't do more.

445
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,231
I have many layers to me,

446
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,691
and they're not
all vanilla, either.

447
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,944
I have chocolate in me.

448
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,737
I have a deep,
dark chocolate...

449
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,405
I'm still hungry, Daddy.

450
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,866
Uh, don't...
I'm so...

451
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,159
Doc Martin and I are finishing.

452
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,536
But what about the cookies?

453
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,912
Just a little while. Okay?

454
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,584
Uh, it's just...
I... I am...

455
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,504
I'm sick of angry,
resentful... Uh...

456
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,216
Fish

457
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,134
who, uh, think that you

458
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,262
that, that, that you owe them,

459
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,806
but who won't trust you
for a second

460
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,932
to do anything for them.

461
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,496
There are other fish
in the sea, Jack.

462
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,435
Yes. I know. It's just I...

463
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,354
I wish I could find a fish

464
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,606
who wasn't afraid of
my dark chocolate layer.

465
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,442
And, well, she'd have
to love my cookie, too.

466
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,194
You know, I think, I think

467
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,905
that my ex cookie maker

468
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,700
has turned me off
to fish entirely.

469
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,829
I met a real piece
of work this morning.

470
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,747
Tell me about her, Jack.

471
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,584
This fish was a fox.

472
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,419
She had her own cookie, too.

473
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,462
But what a female dog.

474
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,507
She shoved her fish in my face.

475
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,092
In front of the cookie?

476
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,137
What's she doing with
another fish, anyway?

477
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,638
Is she AC/DC?

478
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,683
What're you talking about?

479
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,145
Fish with other fish
in front of cookies.

480
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,522

481
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,900

482
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,570
Oh.

483
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,821

485

486
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,919
- After you. I insist.
- No, after you.

487
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,337
I insist more.

488
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,927
You can't make any noise
in the office.

489
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,429
I have a really
important meeting. Okay?

490
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,764
Oh!

491
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,057
Ohh!

492
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,684
Don't touch that.

493
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,769
It's empty.

494
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,937
Sammy, I'm really late,

495
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,522
and I don't need you
spilling anything right now.

496
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,108
Whee-ha! Whoo! Whoo!

497
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,736
Please don't do that now.

498
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Why not?

499
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,532
Because I want you
to practice being super-quiet.

500
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,078
Okay, now, you stay next to me.

501
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,580
Got your dino?
Don't you start any noises, okay?

Just 5 minutes.

506
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,216
Please don't give me
a hard time now, Evelyn.

507
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm 20 minutes late.

508
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,344
25 minutes late.
Mr. Leland,

509
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,789
as you might expect,
is displeased.

510
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,972
What are those?

511
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,181
The Haskell blueprints.

512
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,809
Rob Wilding got them in
3 weeks ahead of schedule.

513
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,977
He did?

514
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,312
Why would you bring
a child here?

515
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
Remember when Sally Hanson
brought her kid here

516
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,149
with the poison sumac?

517
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,485
Mr. Leland just smelled
the calamine lotion

518
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
and had to take
the rest of the day off.

519
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,613
He does not have
poison anything, Evelyn.

520
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,698
He's not even sick.

521
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,408
He just missed
his field trip is all.

522
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,742
I don't think so.

523
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,911
5 minutes. Please?

524
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,788
And I would be doing this because?

525
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,916
Of our sense of solidarity?

526
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,127
You know, we're both women,

527
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,461
and this is a tough office

528

would you ask Miss Parker
to come in here, please?

to pick it up for this meeting,

There's something I'd like
to show you. Evelyn,

566
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,850
would you bring in
the Haskell blueprint...

Also, would you check
if my amoxicillin prescription

still has refills available?

That's a good idea.

baby-sit Sammy later on,

- Get back in there.

814
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,370
You're going to give me an ulcer.
I can feel it.

815
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,164
It's like I swallowed
a car battery.

816
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,332
Why couldn't you get 2 sources?

817
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,856
Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story?

818
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,418
Know how close we came
to getting fired on that?

819
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,836
I almost got the Pulitzer prize.

821

LEW: It's real simple, Jack.

822
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,926
Management doesn't want
to clean up after you...

823
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:51,969
Not now!

824
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,304
I'm a good reporter, Lew.

825
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,472
No.

826
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,599
You are a great reporter,

827
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,225
but sometimes you
just get too excited,

828
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,435
and then you get me
too excited.

829
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,937
And now I've given you
enough rope to hang us both.

830
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,398
And, Jack, nobody almost
gets a Pulitzer prize.

831
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,564
- WOMAN: Jack...
- One second.

832
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,567
They're not going to fire me.

833
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,943

Then they asked me

835
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,721
to have lunch with Frank Burroughs.

836
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,781

Frank Burroughs?

838
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,742
"Frankly Speaking" is
a very popular column.

839
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,826
Hey, Dad?

840
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,953
Frank Burroughs is a pompous, arrogant,
humorless asshole.

841
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,622
Who's won the Pulitzer prize.

842
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,457
You know something, Lew?

843
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,958
I'm not going to lose
my job, all right?

844
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,168
I got alimony and shrink bills,

845
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,420
- I got college loans to repay...
- Daddy...

846
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,256
One second.
I have a plumbing situation.

847
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,967
Now, Manny has been my guy
all year long...

848
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,010
One second, darling.

849
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,345
I played bridge
with his mother.

850
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,972
I took his niece
to Cirque de Soleil...

851
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,015
Just one second.

852
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,975
I had to sit through
him playing Tevye

853
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,020
in dinner theater,
Lew. Dinner theater!

854
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,731
Jack, I gave you this column,

855
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,108
and I love you like a son,

856
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,651
but I can't cover for you anymore.

857
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,152
Now, you've got
less than 6 hours

858
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,029
to that press conference
and no other leads.

859
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,989
We've gotta get Feldstein
back on the record

860
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,658
or find another reliable source

861
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,201
to confirm this whole goddamn thing.

862
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,120
Otherwise, we're printing a retraction.

863
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,664
And I guarantee you, Jack,
it'll be your last.

864
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,499
Fine. If you need me,

865
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,209
I'm at a different
number today.

867
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,003
To find Manny.

868

- Yeah?

Listen, um...

872
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,511
I really wanted
to say something.

873

Go ahead.

00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,515
you haven't dated
for quite a while.

Right.

Hi, Maggie.

990

that you weren't going to bring him here.

And then I almost lost my mind

1005
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,329

a bag like that?

give you any more trouble,

1009
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,305
first go to the teacher.

1010

If she doesn't help,
call me on the mobile.

call 911.

Thanks for doing that.

1016

Sure.
It's hard enough being a kid.

1017

It is excellent.

1018
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,911
And you would know.

1019
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,539
- What about?
- Nothing.

1020
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,665

used to say to me?

that you were gay?

1026
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,842
- I'm not gay.
- Then why did she advise you

on how guys wanna be loved?
Taxi!

1028

Maybe she was hoping
I'd meet a woman like that someday.

1029

talking about?

You're blaming your Peter Pan complex
on your mother.

1034
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,566
- What Peter Pan complex?
- The one you're so proud of.

- You got any friends?
- I don't have time.

That's because of

Yes, there is, and you have it.

00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,178
The sanitation commissioner?

1139
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,263
Lieberman?

1140
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:02,764
Metro!

1141
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,142
How do we get a hold
of Lieberman?

1142
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,186
Lieberman's in Barbados.

1143
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,105
The sanitation commissioner
is in Barbados?

1144
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,440
LEW: In the middle
of a garbage scandal.

1145
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,275
Maybe the mayor
wanted him out of town.

1146
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,901
Metro!

1147
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,278
What?

1148
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,488
LEW: What's Lieberman
doing in Barbados?

1149
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,617
He's there with
his new girlfriend.

1150
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,370
Which leaves his very angry wife.

1151
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,455
LEW: Bingo!

1152
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,290
I'm in the lobby.
I'll be right up.

1153
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,250
Hup. Here we go.

Yeah?

Jack, it's Melanie Parker.

1158
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,346
We have a major problem
with our kids.

1159
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,805
They're okay,
but they can't stay there.

1160
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,766
- They have to be picked up right now.
- Okay.

1161
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,142
- Can you do it?
- Me? Now?

1162
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,519
I would definitely jeopardize
my career and by extension

1163
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,355
my entire life
if I picked them up now.

1164
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,773
Well, I would definitely
jeopardize my career

1165
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:53,857
and by extension

1166
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,026
my entire life
if I picked them up now.

1167

But your press conference
isn't until 5:00, right?

1168
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,364
My presentation is at 2:00.

1169
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,157
I've got to see this lady
Elaine Lieberman

1170
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,325
about some information I need.

1171
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,451
Couldn't you do that
on the phone?

1172
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,786
- Yeah. I...
- Great.

1173
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,579
Is there anybody else
you could call?

1174
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,040
I wouldn't be asking you
if there were anyone else I could call.

1175
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,249
Yeah.

1176
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,959
Look, how about
if I watch them both

1177
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,295
from, say, 3:00 until
your press conference ends

1178
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,548
if you'll watch them both
from now until 3:00?

1179
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,467
You're asking me for help?

1180
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,052
It would appear that way,
wouldn't it?

1181
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,220
I'll agree if you say,

1182
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,222
"Jack, please be my knight
in shining armor."

1183
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,475
Jack, don't be a shithead.
Go rescue our kids.

1184
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,311
This is hard for you, isn't it?

1185
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,979
Are you agreeing or not?

1186
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,439
You know, you're not
the only one with a day.

1187
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,565
I've got a day, too.

1188
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,692
Sorry.
I'll meet you and the kids

1189
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,986
in my office lobby at
Rockefeller Center at 3:15.

Fine.

1191
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,951
Marla, tell Celia

1192
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,661
to get Elaine Lieberman's
home number

1193
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,496
and call me on my cell phone.

1194

1196
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,042
What?

1197
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:55,085
I forgot to tell you

1198
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,170
that Sammy is allergic
to shellfish and dander,

1199
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,756
and, also, he's not allowed
to watch commercial TV,

1200
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:00,924
and no matter what he says,

1201
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,218
he has to hold your hand
when he crosses the street.

1202
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,554
Oh, and, also,
if you go to the playground,

1203
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,888
I like to check the sandbox first.

1204
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,723
You never know
what people throw in there.

1205
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,434
And also, uh...

1206
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,852
Okay. Bye.

1207
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,023
Fine.

1209

You'll look at me

00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:29,494
And then you'll know our love was

1211

You're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for

1215
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,227
Will open wide

1216
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,149
And you'll be proud to have me

1217
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,401
Right by your side

(RINGING)

1219
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,863
- JACK: Hello.
- Hi. It's me.

1220
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:05,947
Me who?

1221
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,949
- You have the kids?
- What kids?

1222
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,618
You didn't pick up the kids?

1223
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,828
Aah! Hi!

1224
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,371
Oh, you mean those kids.

1225
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,037
Look, I was just calling...

1226
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,042
You just wanted to call
and check up on me

1227
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,335
because you don't really trust me.

1228
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,837
Sammy! Sammy, no.
Put the gun down.

1229
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,173
And you only asked me
to watch Sammy

1230
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,508
out of sheer desperation.

1231
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,635
Part of you would feel safer

1232
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,346
with him at the 9th Street
Drop-in Center with L.S.D.

1233
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,430
Isn't that true?

1234
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,683
No, that is not true.
I only wanted to warn you

1235
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,852
that Sammy can get into trouble

1236
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:38,563
faster than you can
make most women smile.

1237
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,190
Are you flirting with me?

1238
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,484
Would you please

1239
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,944
just really pay attention to him?

1240
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,904
I won't let him
out of my sight.

1241
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,031
Sammy!
Hey, guns aren't toys.

1242
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,241
It's not loaded.

1243
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,450
Good-bye.

1244
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,291
Sammy, how long have your
mom and dad been divorced?

1245
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,376
I don't know.

1246
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,627
It doesn't matter, really,

1247
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,337
'cause she said
she'll always love him.

1248
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,922
- Yeah? Hey, what's that?
- Marble.

1249
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,340
That's a marble.
That's what that is.

1250
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,675
You get to see your dad a lot?
Come here.

1251
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,718
Pretty much, usually.

1252
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,887
He has a different schedule
than a lot of other dads.

1253
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:11,930
He's a drummer.

1254
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,432
His favorite thing to do
is watch me play soccer.

1255
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,518
He's probably coming today,

1256
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,603
and he's taking me fishing
this whole summer,

1257
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,231
just us,
and maybe Mom will come, too.

1258
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,483
- Your dad's a drummer, huh?
- Yep.

1259
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,402
- Sounds like a great guy, Sammy.
- He is.

1260
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,244
Kurt, Jake,
you remember Melanie Parker.

1261
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,412
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1262
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,830
Nice to see you.

1263
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,291
Well,

1264
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,667
voila.

1265
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,326
I love this.

1266
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,328
- This is... What is that?
- A vaulted...

1267
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,455
A vaulted pediment.
Vaulted pediment.

1268
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,040
- I love that.
- Yeah?

1269
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,794
But I need to see this with cars.

1270
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
You don't need cars, Dad.
Just use your imagination.

1271
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,257
My imagination?

1272
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,593
I have to see it with the cars.

1273
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,312
Cars.

1274
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,938
Ahem.

1275
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,440
See?

1276
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,241
She's quite a little discovery.

1277
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,910
Yes, she is.

1278
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,580
Why don't you join us
for drinks this evening?

1279
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,417
- Oh.
- Let's say 5:30 at the 21.

1280
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,379
I... Oh. I don't know if I can.

1281
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,089
We'll talk about this project.

1282
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,173
From what I've seen,

1283
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,697
you could bring
a great deal to this.

1284
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,933
I'll be there.

1285
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,685
Terrific.

1286
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,269
That's great.

1287
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,564
Hi. This is Jack Taylor
of the Daily News.

1288
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,525
- I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman...
- Quit trying to be like my dad.

1289
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,652
- Am not.
- Am, too. Daddy?

1290
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,695
Yeah?

1291
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,363
Who's that man on the bus?

1292
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,031
- What? Who's what?
- Who's that man?

1293
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,408
It says, "Frankly Speaking."

1294
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,702
Very important.
Elaine Lieberman.

1295
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,786
Here we go.

Rosa, Rosa, Rosa,

1298
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,625
could you just try
to speak English?

1299
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,086
Okay.

1300
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,797
- Hello?
- Hello?

1301
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,633
Right. Okay, all right, uh, uh, uh...
I need to...

1302
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,219
? Donde esta, Sefnora Lieberman?

- Okay?

1307
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,645
Okay. Bye-bye.

1308
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,480
No. No, no, no.

1309
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,648
Uh...

1310
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,483
(RINGING)

1311
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,527
Hola.
La casa de la Senora Lieberman.

1312
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,570
Listen to me. Listen.

1313
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,030
I need to find Mrs. Lieberman.

1314
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,699
- Okay.
- Okay.

1315
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,535
If I don't find her,
I could lose my job.

1316
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,371
If you don't understand,
say, "Okay."

1317
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,498
Okay.

1318
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,751
Okay. Bye-bye. Gracias.

1319
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:28,877
Bye-bye.

1320
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,589
Give me the marble.
It's my dad's.

1321
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,631
Give it!

1322
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:34,966
It's my dad's marble.

1323
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,801
Uh, no, uh, Rosa?

1324
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,512
Uh, no, Rosa, it's...

1325
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,681
No, no, no, no.
Don't hang up.

1326
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,510
- Do you speak Spanish by any chance?
- What do you need?

1327
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,519
Ok. Great.
Her name is Rosa Lopez.

1328
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,938
Her boss is Elaine Lieberman.

1329
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,273
I need to know where she is.

1330
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,316
I'm Jack Taylor.

1331
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,942
I'm a reporter for the Daily News.

Elaine is her boss.

1334
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,864
No, no, no, no.

1335
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,117
Tell her Elaine wants to speak to me
very badly, too. Very badly.

1342
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:09,793
MAGGIE: So give me it!

1343
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:10,919
- So?
- So, give it.

1344
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,462
- No.
- Yes!

1345

Guys, hey, guys. Guys!

1346
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,131
What are you doing?

1347
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,633
MAGGIE: Give me it.

1348
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,302
- Guys, what are you doing?
- Mr. Taylor.

- Take turns.
- Mr. Taylor!

1350

Senora Lopez says
that Mrs. Lieberman

1351
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,891
is at the Elizabeth Arden salon

1352
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,726
for her spring spa day.

1353
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,019
Spring spa day?
Elizabeth Arden? Excellent.

1354
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,479
Dad! Hee hee hee.

1355
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,398
What?
You guys are being a...

1356
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,900
Oh, man.

1357
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,153
- You're so stupid.
- Am not.

1358
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,697
Are so.
You ruined my dad's marble.

1359
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,991
He's not gonna want it
with your snot all over it.

1360
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,244
Yes, I will.
I'll just wash it off.

1361
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,537
You're gonna be fine.

1362
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,996
The doctor's just gonna
pop that thing

1363
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,164
right out of there.

1364
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:49,833
How come you couldn't do it?

1365
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:50,917
Well, you know,

1366
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,001
that's a little nose,
big marble.

1367
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,044
But, see, the doctor,

1368
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,504
he's gonna have this clamp thing

1369
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,257
that's gonna come up and
just yank it right out,

1370
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,551
and you are gonna be fine.

1371
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,885
You've just gotta
not worry about it,

1372
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,554
and you've gotta
not think about it.

1373
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,264
You've gotta think
about something else.

1374
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,182
You've gotta think about...

1375
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,892
Hello, Sammy.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

1377
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,161
(YAWNING) Hello?

1378
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,539
Hi, sexy, I miss you.

1379
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,040
Look, whoever you are,

1380
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,043
this isn't Jack's phone anymore.

1381
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,546
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1382
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,172
No. Who are you?

1383
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,175
This is Celia.
I'm a friend of Jack's,

1384
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,719
and who's this?

1385
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,762
Absolutely nobody.

1386
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,556
Whatever.
Could you please tell him

1387
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,558
that Kristen just
called from the Bahamas

1388
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,226
- to let him know her number there?
- Uh-huh.

1389
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,728
And this is very important.

1390
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,187
Elaine Lieberman will only be

1391
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,189
at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

1392
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,692
So if you could
pass on those messages,

1393
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,569
we'd both appreciate it.

1394

1395

if I don't have you guys
in the lobby

1396

by 3:15 on the dot.

1397
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,534
SAMMY: I don't think she'll kill ya.

1398
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,744
She's not like that, really.

1399
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,912
She isn't?

1400
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,538
No. She just acts tough and mean

1401
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,457
'cause she'd rather
be safe than sorry.

1402
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,625
What does that mean?

1403
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,792
She just says it a lot

1404
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,438
when men try to open
her door and stuff.

1405
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,754
Yeah?

1406
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,548
Whup! Excuse us!

1407
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:23,051
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

1408
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,559
- Hi.
- Hi, you guys!

1409
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,269
Hey, hey.

1410
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,731
Um, your friend, uh, Celia called

1411
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,107
to tell you... Sammy!

1412
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,442
It's okay, only an escalator.

1413
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,278
That Kristen called you
from the Bahamas

1414
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,447
and also that Elaine Lew...

1415
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,531
Lieberman.

1416
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,617
...will be at Elizabeth Arden's
until 3:30.

1417
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,743
Great.

1418
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,413
Thank you so much for
watching Sammy, really.

1419
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,957
You saved my life.

1420
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,041
Was he any trouble?

1421
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,459
No. Not at all.

1422
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,669
Good.

1423
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,338
So, everything worked out great.

1424
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,798
I was sure you were

1425
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,282
going to either
show up 3 hours late

1426
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,467
or not at all.

1427
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,970
Guess what?
I'm not like every other man you know.

1428
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,574
No. I realize that.
I was just kidding.

1429
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,598
No, you weren't, but...

1430
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,476
Guess what? I'm not like
every other woman you know.

1431
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,061
- Really?
- Yeah.

1432
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,398
You probably think
I'm a real control freak,

1433
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,108
and I'm not at all.

1434
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,651
Well, I mean, I do like things

1435
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,861
the way I like them,
but who doesn't?

1436
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,488
And, anyway, in my life,

1437
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,157
I'm the only one who ever
does anything, so, uh,

1438
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,325
what does it matter?

1439
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,368
Maybe you should let somebody

1440
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,203
help you out
every once in a while.

1441
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,122
Definitely not.

1442
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,165
I've got all of these little balls
up in the air,

1443
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,042
and if somebody else
caught one from me,

1444
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,377
I'd drop them all.

1445
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,160
But you're not a control freak.

1446
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,548
No. I'm a single working mother.

1447
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,008
Okay. I have more work to do

1448
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,092
than time to do it.

1449
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,094
So before you and I
get into yet another

1450
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,054
lengthy and exhausting thing,

1451
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,973
I have a career to save, okay?

1452
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,850
Do you have any instructions
for me before you...

1453
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,060
No, no.
I trust you completely.

1454
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,563
I don't suppose
you could, um...

1455
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,982
you could switch your thing

1456
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,775
from 5:00 to, say, 4:30?

1457
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,152
Because I just found out

1458
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,695
that I have a new thing at 5:30.

1459
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,863
Can't switch my thing.

1460
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,448
I'll switch mine.
No problem.

1461

at the soccer game?

1462

- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, Jack!

1463
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,787
Thanks again, Jack.

1464
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,164
You're welcome.

1465
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,251
I realize it's difficult,

1466
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,047
what with, uh...
Celia, Kristen, Elaine.

1467

I know your name, Mel.

1468

So what did you guys
do with Jack?

1469
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,469
Quit kicking me, Maggie.

1470
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,222
I wasn't going to say
anything about. (SNIFFS)

1471
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,015

Secret about me and Jack.

1482
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,244
Hmm.

1483
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,497
Does it have anything
to do with feelings?

1484
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:41,999
What do you mean?

1485
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,835
You know, feelings,
like being scared

1486
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:48,214
or hurt or happy and excited.

1487
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,883
You know,
those are all feelings.

1488
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,136
Definitely about feelings, then.

1489
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,138
Yeah. Definitely.

1490
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,264
Hee hee.

1491
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,558
Switch.

1492
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,686
Mm-hmm.

1493
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,772
Sorry, Mom.

1494
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,440
That's okay, honey.

1495
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,322
So, what'd you get?

1496
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,158
Frozen hot chocolate.

1497
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,826
Mmm! Yum.

1498
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,077
You like chocolate?

1499
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,453
I love chocolate.

1500
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,038
Daddy told Dr. Martin this morning

1501
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,624
that he's got deep dark chocolate
inside of him.

1502
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,501
Really?

1503
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,919
MAGGIE: And that
he'd like to meet a fish

1504
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,797
who wasn't afraid
of his dark chocolate layer.

1505
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,551
I think I'm beginning
to guess the secret.

1506
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,511
Are you mad?

1507
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:36,637
Not really.

1508
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,056
I think he should have
talked about it with me, though.

1509
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,267
He was afraid you'd hate him.

1510
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,686
Of course I wouldn't hate him.

1511
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,730
Honestly, that is so silly.

1512

Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1513

Uh, you don't understand.
This is an emergency.

1514
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,362
I don't interrupt Mrs. Lieberman

1515

You make eyes at me like that,

1520
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,705
I make you pot roast.

Oh, excuse me.

Hello, Mrs. Keffner.
Let me get your robe.

Hi. I'm looking
for Elaine Lieberman.

00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,167
- She just left.
- JACK: Thank you.

- Jack!
- Yep?

1536

- Is that you?
- Yeah.

- Who?

what a small world?

1542
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,305
I know.
I just spent the whole afternoon

1543
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,473
with your grandson.

1544
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,350
Yeah.
He's cute, but he's a handful.

1545
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,601
I'm just trying to catch up
with Elaine Lieberman.

1546
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:06,769

about my daughter,

1548
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,272
and it's something
that you may suspect.

1549
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,596
She can make you want to scream

1550
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,691
like you're having a body wax.

1551
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,858
I mean, she's that frustrating.

1552
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:13,943
Yeah.

1553
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,987
Inside, Jack, she's mush.

1554
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,113
Mush.

1555
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,240
So you scream all you want,

1556
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,158
but just don't
run away too soon.

and... and... and he is pretty
cocky most of the time,

1873
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,219
and he does seem to have

1874

somewhat of a cavalier attitude,

you have with Mr. Taylor, miss,

but it's quite clear

1878

you know nothing about politics

is that if I had
a few minutes more,

01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,911
That's a blatant fabrication,
Mr. Taylor!

1906
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,580
We both know that no such
canceled check exists.

You know something?
You're right. I'm confused.

1908
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,459
There would be no check,

This is dated March 15th
of this year.

1915
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:56,306
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.

just a coincidence.

01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,845
Mommy, can we go
to the soccer game now?

1936
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,972
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Yeah, boy. Come here.

1937
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,057
I really am so sorry
about Maggie.

1938
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,767
I don't even want to think
about what could've happened.

1939
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,644
I don't want to think
about it either.

1940
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:43,728
When I do think about it,

1941
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,397
I can't believe that
I was issued shellfish

1942
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,316
and dander warnings,
sandbox alerts.

1943
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,484
You even laughed in my face

1944
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,987
- when I showed up at your office on time.
- I know.

1945
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:54,030
And then you lost my daughter.

1946
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,365
I know.
It was the worst thing

1947
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,075
I could've ever done.
I really am so, so very sorry.

1948
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,578
So someone else is
the irresponsible one,

1949
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,121
- aren't they?
- Yes, they are.

1950
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,873
I would like to hear you say that,

1951
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,249
say it for your kind.

1952
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,709
My kind?

1953
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,544
The ones with all the balls
in the air.

1954
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,254
That's the least you could do.

1955
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,755
Of course I'll say it, Jack.

1956
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,008
I was the irresponsible one.

1957
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,342
- Great.
- Taxi!

1958
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,094
Now say
"I can't do everything on my own."

1959
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,179
Why?

1960
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,263
Because with one sentence

1961
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:21,016
you'll restore my faith
in women again.

1962
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,436
Of course I'll say it
for you, Jack.

1963
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,896
We're never going
to get a cab, you know.

1964
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,189
You can't say it.

1965
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,876
Sure, I can,
just as long as you realize

1966
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,983
that it won't be true.

1967
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,027
I'm waiting.

1968
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,445
Okay. I can't do
everything alone.

1969
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,779
There. Great.

1970
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,948
Even though my daily activities
year after year

1971
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,450
immediately contradict
what I just said.

1972
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,493
Oh, unbelievable!

1973
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,120
You made me grovel for no reason.

1974
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,580
You groveled for great reason.

1975
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,166
You are an arrogant ball juggler, baby.

1976
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,002
First of all,
don't call me baby.

1977
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,463
Secondly, if you don't
want your balls juggled,

1978
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,547
don't throw them in my face.

1979
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:53,673
I threw them in your face?

1980
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,278
Yes, you did,
starting off this morning

1981
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,052
when you thrust
your stupid column at me

1982
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,261
as some sort of lame excuse

1983
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:00,222
for my son missing his field trip.

1984
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,140
Balls in my face.

1985
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,184
Ho ho ho!
Big Jack reporter

1986
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,853
can't possibly concentrate
on mundane details

1987
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,647
like picking up the phone to say,

1988
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,565
"Thanks anyway,
but I won't be needing you

1989
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,400
"to take my daughter
to school today and then..."

1990
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,485
That's not quite how it happened.

1991
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,487
You have to ask
who I can only assume

1992
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:17,113
is one of your many girlfriends

1993
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,782
if she's wearing her panties

1994
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,952
as loud as you can.
Balls in my face.

1995
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,746
And now in the midst
of my obvious remorse,

1996
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,373
you make me grovel?

1997
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:27,999
First of all... First of all,

1998
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,501
I thrust my column in your face

1999
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,461
because I thought
you were the most beautiful woman

2000
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,630
that I've ever seen
in my entire life,

2001
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,382
and I want...

2002
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,263
I wanted to make a good impression.

2003
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,185
Now, I forgot to
call you this morning

2004
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,437
because I, as opposed to you,

2005
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,314
am not used to doing
everything on my own.

2006
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:52,440
So I slipped up there.

2007
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:53,566
As for the panties,

2008
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:56,111
that remark was to my editor Lew,

2009
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:59,030
simply to piss you off.

2010
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,681
MAGGIE: Come on, Dad.
I've got a taxi.

2011
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,203
Can we go?

2012
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,209
Hey. We got the cab.

2013
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,505
(HORN HONKS)

2014
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,716
I think my dad likes your mom.

2015
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,759
Maybe my mom likes him back.

2016
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,885
Men like you

2017
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,095
have made me the woman I am.

2018
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,972
All the women I know like you

2019
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,058
have made me think
all women are like you.

2020
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,810
Oh, my God.
I almost forgot.

2021
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,396
I've got a meeting,
drinks with clients.

2022
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,940
5:25. You're never
going to make it.

2023
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,693
Mom, it's the last game
of the season.

2024
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,611
It's for the championship, Mom,

2025
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,739
and the coach said
every kid has to play

2026
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,532
or they don't get a trophy.

2027
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,367
Even the losers get a trophy,

2028
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,745
but you don't get a trophy
if you don't play.

2029
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,279
It's on the way.
We'll make it.

2030
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,206
Let go of it.

2031
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,419
I can't let go of it.
It's my job. Hold this.

2032
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,715
MELANIE: Could we go
to the 21 Club instead?

2033
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,425
21 West 52nd Street,

2034
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:04,721
and don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.

2035
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:08,266
You can't make a left
at this hour.

2036
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,895
I...I... I know I can do this.

2037
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,356
No, don't take Broadway.

2038
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,815
It's bound to be a mess.

2039
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,859
Try 6th Avenue,

2040
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,402
but not until after 23rd

2041
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,154
because of the construction.

2042
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,531
JACK: French-fried eyeballs
floating in a bowl of...

2043
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,909
MAGGIE: Snot.
JACK: Snot.

2044
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,651
JACK: Here we go.

2045
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,612
Uh, why don't you hold the cab,

2046
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,280
and if I'm not
back in 15 minutes,

2047
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,907
just go on ahead without me.

2048
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,325
You're going to take longer
than 15 minutes.

2049
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,828
I can do this.
Okay, baby.

2050
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,123
Mommy, what if you don't come

2051
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,666
and Daddy doesn't come?

2052
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,918
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm going to be there.

2053
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,294
You are the most
important thing to me

2054
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,838
in the entire world.

2055
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,548
Your job is.

2056
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,550
No, you are,

2057
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,553
but I have to do this now.

2058
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,430
Sammy, I know I've
dragged you places

2059
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:29,514
and left you places,

2060
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,224
and I've been
a crazy person today,

2061
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,976
but it's going
to be better tomorrow.

2062
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,145
I promise I won't take
longer than 15 minutes

2063
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,148
in there, okay? Okay? Huh?

2064
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,612
Hey, Sammy, come here.

2065
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,531
Don't worry about it.
She'll make it, okay?

2066
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,855
Let's get you ready for soccer.

2067
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,367
Grab me that bag.

2068
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,581
Hello.
How are you?

2069
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,583
Hi. I see my party.

2070
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,877
MR. LELAND: Oh, here she is.

2071
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,337
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?

2072
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,464
Oh, I'll just have some water.

2073
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,257
Nonsense.
We're way ahead of you.

2074
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,800
You have some catching up to do.

2075
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,221
MR. LELAND: She'll have a dry
vodka martini straight up.

2076
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,604
Hey, what are you
thinking about, kiddo?

2077
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:22,150
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.

2078
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,318
Yeah.

2079
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,444
(MEOW)

2080
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,156
Mommy hopes he can come, too.

2081
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,240
Last night...

2082
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:31,951
Last night

2083
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,328
my mom thought I was asleep,

2084
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,704
but I really wasn't

2085
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,207
and I heard her say
over and over again,

2086
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,416
"Please let Eddie come.

2087
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,044
"Please let Eddie come."

2088
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,129
(MEOW)

2089
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,631
Eddie?
Who's Eddie?

2090
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,466
Eddie's my dad.

2091
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:51,262
I hope he comes, too,
there, kiddo.

2092
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,764
We were just discussing plans

2093
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,182
for a sort of upscale

2094
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,017
amusement complex for adults.

2095
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,645
You know, with food
and games and rides.

2096
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:59,771
No rides, Dad.

2097
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,855
After drinks,

2098
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,732
we wanted to take
a drive to Stanford.

2099
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:03,983
SON: We were hoping
to take a look

2100
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,402
at a kind of a bad version
of what we have in mind.

2101
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,321
But before we head out,

2102
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,156
Melanie, maybe you could toss out

2103
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,116
a few ideas,
just off the top of your head.

2104
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,452
Uh...

2105
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:17,372
Well, uh,

2106
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,708
adult amusement complexes,
up until now,

2107
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,502
have been somewhat cheesy,

2108
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:26,297
usually attached
to popular video stores.

2109
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,051
What I'm thinking of
is something

2110
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,344
a bit more exciting.

2111
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,428
YATES SR.: Hmm.

2112
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,472
A drawing might help,
don't you think?

2113
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,308
Uh... I...

2114
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,557
YATES JR.: I love drawings.

2115
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:39,561
I don't have a...

2116
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,354
Oh. Here you go.

2117
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,897
Oh, okay.

2118
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,274
Um...

2119
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,152
Um, let's see.

2120
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,072
Uh, something like...

2121
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,700
Uh...

2122
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,829
Um...

2123
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,751
Isn't that the little lost boy

2124
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:04,919
from this morning?

2125
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:06,296
What?

2126
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,340
Uh, with, you know...

2127
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,218
Um...

2128
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:32,238
You know, I can't do this now.

2129
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:37,702
And I can't go with you
to Stanford now either.

2130
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,330
Yes, Mr. Leland,
that is the little lost boy

2131
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,040
from this morning,
only he's not lost.

2132
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,166
He's my son.

2133
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,085
I have a child

2134
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,796
and he has a soccer game
in 20 minutes.

2135
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,442
If he's late,
he doesn't get the trophy.

2136
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,591
And because I'm in here with you,

2137
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,135
he's probably going to be late,

2138
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,762
but what gets to me
more than anything

2139
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,096
is instead of crying about it,

2140
01:22:57,181 --> 01:23:00,350
he's out there
with a big old smile

2141
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,060
blowing fish faces at us.

2142
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:08,483
Gentlemen, if you're smart,
you'll want me as much

2143
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,942
for my dedication and ability

2144
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,028
as for the fact that I am going
to ditch you right now

2145
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,447
and I am going to run
like hell across town

2146
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,451
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most

2147
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,617
is him.

2148
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,119
And, Mr. Leland,
your real grounds for firing me

2149
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,164
should be if I were
to stay here with you.

2150
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,128
I like her.

2151
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,254
A lot.

2152
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,968
Well, I probably lost my job,

2153
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,845
but at least we still have 10 minutes

2154
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:38,971
to get to the game.

2155
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,807
Hey, short cut!
Short cut!

2156

In spite of everything, Jack,

2157
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:45,269
I want you to know that
I do sincerely apologize

2158
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,354
for losing Maggie.

2159
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,690
That's all right.
Same thing happened to me this morning.

2160
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,566
You lost Maggie this morning?

2161
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,985
Yeah, she wandered off
after the office cat.

2162
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,320
It might've been helpful

2163
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,864
if you'd mentioned
her tendency to wander.

2164
01:23:56,949 --> 01:24:00,076
It might've been helpful...
Here we go. Up here...

2165
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,287
If you had mentioned
Sammy's tendency

2166
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,456
to stick things up his nose.

2167
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,541
He didn't!

2168
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,126
Oh, yeah. Way up there.

2169
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,461
In fact, I had to use
this plier-type thing.

It's called an alligator,

Okay!

2173
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,470
Here we go.
Come on.

we'd make it.

2175
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:27,270
Any other catastrophes?

MAGGIE: Lois Lane ate
the class fish.

2177

2178
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,734
Sorry, Sammy.

2179
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,068
Lois Lane?

2180
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,448
Come on.
We got to hurry up.

2181
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,409
I got to go to the bathroom.

2182
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,702
I'll take you.

2183

Why don't I take her?

2184
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,218
So, Maggie,
you know that lady Celia

2185
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:00,762

No way.

She wants to be, but she isn't.

01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:01,839
I'm sure he did.

2416
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,715
Is he really
a rock 'n' roll drummer?

2417
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,680
Yeah. He's touring with
Springsteen this summer.

2418
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:07,928
- Really?
- Yeah.

2419
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,847
Springsteen?

2420
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,014
Wow.

2421
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,438
I'm beating around the bush
here a little bit,

2422
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:19,042
and there's something
I got to ask you.

2423
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,566
Yes?

2424
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:22,359
Why did you

2425
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,571
spend the entire day
flirting with me if you

2426
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,406
were thinking about getting
back with your ex-husband?

2427
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,074
What?

2428
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:32,286
I spent the whole day
disliking you intensely.

2429
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,204
You were flirting with me.

2430
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,290
You even told the kids
you wanted to ask me out.

2431
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:37,458
I never told them that.

2432
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,751
Yes, you did.
That was your big secret.

2433
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,795
- Heh heh.
- They told me.

2434
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,922
It was all about you and me
and going somewhere

2435
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,007
and feelings.

2436
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,176
You were going to ask me out.

2437
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,803
Okay. The big secret was about
Sammy getting my marble

2438
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:50,846
stuck up his nose,

2439
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,223
and I never once even thought
about asking you out.

2440
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,766
I am so sure.

2441
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:57,144
I don't know why
I would even want to.

2442
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,812
You said you thought I was
the most beautiful woman

2443
01:36:58,897 --> 01:36:59,855
you'd ever seen.

2444
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,191
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack,

2445
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,193
and you know it.

2446
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:07,070
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer, and you said...

2447
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,156
And you wanted me

2448
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,116
ever since the 9th Street
Drop-in Center

2449
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:13,160
when you saw me
putting my watch on Maggie.

2450
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,203
For someone who is

2451
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:16,330
so totally disinterested
in the other person,

2452
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,207
you sure do remember
every single minute detail.

2453
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,292
You remember better than I do.

2454
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:21,376
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

2455
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,461
No, I don't.

2456
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:23,504
What would you do
if I kissed you right now?

2457
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,588
You're not gonna
kiss me right now.

2458
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,131
What would you do if I did?

2459
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:28,675
Do you wanna kiss me right now?

2460
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,719
I wouldn't have mentioned it
if I didn't.

2461
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,933
Fine.

2462
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,112
You're just

2463
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,615
reeling me in, aren't you?

2464
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,285
You're like Roy Scheider

2465
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,120
in the end of Jaws.

2466
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,164
The minute I open my mouth,

2467
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:01,625
you're gonna drop
a big bomb in there.

2468
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,586
Then you're gonna wear
a set of my teeth

2469
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:05,837
around your neck.

2470
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:08,840
So you're admitting
you're a big shark.

2471
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,471
I am admitting that I am

2472
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:17,474
scared of getting close
to anyone again.

2473
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:21,562
I'm just as scared as you are.

2474
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:31,154
(WHISPERING) Don't bite.
(WHISPERING) I won't.

2475
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,579
Hmm.

2476
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,296
Mommy.

2477
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,380
What?

2478
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,048
Can you fast-forward for us?

2479
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,175
That mean lady's on,
and we hate that part.

2480
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:54,222
Sweetheart, you know
how to use the fast-forward.

2481
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,221
The remote's broken.

2482
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:58,390
- And she's stealing Toto.
- (VCR FAST-FORWARDS)

2483
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,018
There, she's gone. Okay?

2484
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,146
This is the color part.
You love this part.

2485
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,339
- Wait.
- Yeah. Okay.

2486
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:32,799
No. Let's do this right.

2487
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:35,302
Let me go in and freshen up

2488
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,803
so I feel a little more
like a woman

2489
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:38,722
and not a den mommy.

2490
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,600
Ok? Um, why don't you go in and...

2491
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,226
Go sit over there,

2492
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,313
and close your eyes,
lay your head back,

2493
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,065
and anticipate my return?

2494
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:51,610
Okay.

2495
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,571
Or you can go in and watch
The Wizard of Oz

2496
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:56,156
and wait for me to come back.
