seven years old

387

when I was walking past her room

388

and she was on her bed reading
to her sister, Sharon,

what a Mary Poppins was.

399

But then she gave me
one of your books,

400
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,399
and, oh, by gosh, my imagination
caught on fire.

ever since, as you know.

he's made to his kids.

408

No matter how long it takes
for him to make it come true.

409
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
Now, you've kept me
dangling all this time.

410
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,484
But now, I gotcha.

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,679
"Gotcha," indeed.

412
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,599
Mr. Disney, if you have "dangled,"

413
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,279
it is at the end of a rope you
have fashioned for yourself.

414
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,239
I was perfectly clear
when you approached me 20 years ago

415
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,599
that she wasn't for sale.
And I was clear again

416
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,679
when you approached me
the following year

417
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,119
and clear again when you
approached me every annum

418
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,799
for the subsequent 18 years,

419
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,279
and quite honestly,
I feel corralled.

420
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,119
Oh, now, Pam, the last thing I want
to do is make you feel as though...

421
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,279
Would you mind? My name
is "Mrs. Travers." I do...

422
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,799
See, I promised them, Pam.
Now, that's a fact.

423
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,959
You got kids?

424
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,439
No. Well, not precisely.

425
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,439
I have never, and absolutely never,

426
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,959
gone back on a promise I made
to either one of my daughters.

427
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,639
Now, that's what being "Daddy"
is all about, right?

428
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,679
Is it?

429
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,319
See, our motion picture is not
just gonna make my kids happy.

430
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,959
It's gonna make
all kids happy. Adults, too.

431
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,119
Because my guys are
gonna do things with it

432
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,799
that are revolutionary, Pam.
Revolutionary!

only lived inside your head,

well, you are gonna be able
to meet her, speak to her.

- When?
- In your books.

No, those aren't songs.
They're recitations.

She's not a giddy woman.
She's doesn't jig about.

452
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,199
I mean, singing is frivolous.

453
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,839
It's wholly unnecessary in a
governess, an educatress.

454
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,879
No, it would simply ruin it.

I do have a question
about it, actually.

1524
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,560
How in the world does Mr. Disney propose
to train all the penguins to dance?

1525
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,799
I've heard about his
implausibly-leaved trees.

1526
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,679
So, I presume he does have some
insane penguin-wrangling scheme.

1527
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,928
But it does seem a little
far-fetched, even for him.

1528
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,289
Can you train a penguin to dance?

01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,648
I almost forgot, turn it around.

1620
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,361
"Walt Disney."

1621
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,599
Hyperactive behavior
and deficiencies in concentration.

1622
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,007
It explains everything.

1623
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,888
Thank you, Mrs.

1624
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,999
DOLLY: She acted like an angry
person a lot of the time.

1625
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,119
TOMMIE: Mmm-hmm.

1626
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,319
So, she's come and gone, huh?

1627
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,159
Yeah, her flight
left 10 minutes ago.

1628
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,319
Beverly Hills Hotel,
private limousine.

1629
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:38,330
First-class plane ticket
back to England for...

1630
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,888
Wait. "Goff"?

1631
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,639
Who is... Who is Helen Goff?

1632
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,559
That's her. That's her real name.

1633
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,519
She acts so hoity-toity British,

1634
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,563
and she's really an Aussie.

1635
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,402
Then who is Travers?

1636
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,571
I've been talking to
the wrong person?

1637
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,926
He's gone.

1638
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,687
No, no, no. You mustn't.

1639
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,851
Let her go, Margaret.

1640
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,082
I dropped the pears.

1641
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1642
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,039
Helen, dear girl...

1643
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,210
You promised you
would fix everything.

1644
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,850
Hello, house.

1645
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,325
(SIGHS)

1646
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,209
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1647
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,646
(GASPS)

1648
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,847
(GROANS SOFTLY)

1649
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,200
Oh, dear God!

1650
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,239
It was one heck of a
job getting a seat

1651
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,011
on the very next flight,
let me tell you.

1652
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,799
Mrs. Travers,

1653
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,561
(CHUCKLES) I could sure use a nice
pot of English tea about now.

1654
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,205
Here we are.

1655
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,165
Allow me.

1656
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,519
Milk in first, remember?

1657
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,722
Yeah, I remember.

1658
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,839
And a spoonful of sugar?

1659
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,485
NO, I think I'll have whisky.

1660
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,521
Oh.

1661
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,480
Ooh.

1662
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,611
That's okay.

1663
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,320
(CHUCKLING)
Well, when in Rome...

1664
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,961
Thank you.

1665
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,839
You've come to change my mind,
haven't you?

1666
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,279
To beat me into submission.

1667
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,679
No. No.

1668
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,169
I've come because you misjudged me.

1669
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,361
(SCOFFS)

1670
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,359
How do I misjudge you?

1671
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,839
You look at me

1672
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,159
and you see some kind
of Hollywood King Midas.

1673
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,039
You think I've built an empire,
and I want your Mary Poppins

1674
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,919
as just another brick
in my kingdom.

1675
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,963
And don't you?

1676
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,839
Now, if that was all it was,

1677
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,119
would I have suckered up
to a cranky, stubborn dame

1678
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,399
like you for 20 years?

1679
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,841
No, I would have
saved myself an ulcer.

1680
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,130
No... You, uh...

1681
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,479
You expected me to disappoint you,

1682
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,205
and so you made sure I did.

1683
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,723
Well, I think life disappoints you,
Mrs. Travers.

1684
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,519
I think it's done that a lot, and I
think Mary Poppins is the only person

1685
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,165
in your life who hasn't.

1686
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,319
Mary Poppins isn't real.

1687
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,959
That's not true. No, no, no.

1688
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,959
She's as real as can
be to my daughters.

1689
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,288
And to thousands
of other kids. Adults, too.

1690
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,843
She's been there as a nighttime
comfort to a heck of a lot of people.

1691
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,519
Well, where is she
when I need her, hmm?

1692
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,039
I open the door to Mary Poppins,

1693
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,450
and who should be standing there,
but Walt Disney?

1694
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,759
(SIGHS)

1695
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,849
Mrs. Travers, I'm sorry.

1696
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,159
I'd hoped this would have been
a magical experience,

1697
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,719
for you and for all of us,
but I've let you down.

1698
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,999
And, in doing so,

1699
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,211
I've broken a 20-year-old
promise I made to my daughters.

1700
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,519
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out why

1701
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,883
this has been so
hard for you and I.

1702
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,009
And, well... (SIGHS)

1703
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,447
You see,
I have my own Mr. Banks.

1704
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,039
Mine had a mustache.

1705
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,404
So, it is not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

1706
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,799
(CHUCKLES) No, no.

1707
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,279
But it is true that
you created yourself

1708
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,130
in someone else's, yes?

1709
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,679
Have you ever been
to Kansas City, Mrs. Travers?

1710
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,405
Do you know Missouri at all?

1711
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,639
I can't say I do.

1712
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,879
Well, it's mighty cold
there in the winters.

1713
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,519
Bitter cold.

1714
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,559
And my dad, Elias Disney,

1715
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,759
he owned a newspaper
delivery route there.

1716
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,119
A thousand papers, twice daily.

1717
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,607
A morning and an evening edition.

1718
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,959
And Dad was a tough businessman.

1719
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,639
He was a "save a penny
any way you can" type of fella.

1720
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,759
So he wouldn't employ
delivery boys.

1721
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,090
No, no, no. He used me
and my big brother Roy.

1722
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,119
I was, uh...
I was eight back then.

1723
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,765
Just eight years old.

1724
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,002
And, like I said,
winters are harsh.

1725
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,759
And old Elias, well,
he didn't believe in new shoes,

1726
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,439
until the old ones
were worn through.

1727
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,959
Honestly, Mrs. Travers,

1728
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,559
the snowdrifts, sometimes they
were up over my head.

1729
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,570
And we'd push through that
snow like it was molasses.

1730
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,719
The cold and wet seeping through

1731
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,127
our clothes and our shoes.

1732
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,159
Skin peeling from our faces.

1733
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,879
Sometimes I'd find myself
sunk down in that snow,

1734
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,079
just waking up,

1735
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,567
because I must have passed out
or something, I don't know.

1736
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,439
And then it was time for school,

1737
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,079
and I was too cold or wet

1738
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,039
to figure out equations and things.

1739
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,999
And then it was right back
out in the snow again

1740
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,804
to get home just before dark.

1741
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,479
Mother would feed us dinner.

1742
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,599
And then it was time
to go right back out

1743
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,531
and do it again for
the evening edition.

1744
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,599
"You had best be quick there, Walt."
"You'd better get those newspapers up

1745
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,119
"on that porch
and under that storm door.

1746
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,039
"Poppa's gonna lose
his temper again

1747
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,403
"and show you the buckle
end of his belt, boy."

1748
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,999
I don't... I don't tell you this
to make you sad,

1749
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,279
Mrs. Travers.

1750
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,879
I don't. I love my life.
I think it's a miracle.

1751
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,959
And I loved my dad. He was a...
He was a wonderful man.

1752
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,559
But rare is the day

1753
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,239
when I don't think about
that eight-year-old boy

1754
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,599
delivering newspapers in the snow,

1755
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,691
and old Elias Disney
with that strap in his fist.

1756
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,845
And I am just so tired.

1757
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,531
Mrs. Travers,

1758
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,609
I'm tired of remembering
it that way.

1759
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,559
Aren't you tired, too,
Mrs. Travers?

1760
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,439
Now we all have our sad tales,

1761
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,439
but don't you want
to finish the story?

1762
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,919
Let it all go and have a life

1763
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,169
that isn't dictated by the past?

1764
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,879
It's not the children
she comes to save.

1765
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,445
It's their father.

1766
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,241
It's your father.

1767
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,851
Travers Goff.

1768
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,959
I don't know what you think
you know about me, Walter...

1769
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,919
You must have loved and admired
him a lot to take his name.

1770
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,999
I...

1771
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,959
It's him this is all about,
isn't it?

1772
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,889
All of it, everything.

1773
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,279
Forgiveness, Mrs. Travers.

1774
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,919
It's what I learned
from your books.
