00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,988
Your breakfast, sir.

3
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,800
Pork bellies.

4
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,638
I have a hunch something very exciting
is going to happen

5
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,473
in the pork belly market this morning.

6
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,323
Will Miss Penelope be dining
with you this evening, sir?

7
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,076
Yes. Yes, she will.

-Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
-Morning, Folsey.

00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,637
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,162
When do we sell?

21
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,665
I just cannot believe
how stupid these scientists are.

"The eternal question."

23
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,586
There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

24
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,131
I don't care
about heredity versus environment.

25
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,383
In fact, I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

26
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,594
I care about how much money
we can get for our pork bellies.

27
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,513
Winthorpe put in a sell order
for 76 and a quarter.

28
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,891
His charts say
that's as high as it's gonna go.

29
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,810
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

30
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,938
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see ifWinthorpe's right.

31
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,319
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I saywe sell now.

32
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,279
Just anotherfew seconds.

33
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,115
The market's closing.
We won't get the order in.

34
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:35,347
Wejust made an extra $347,000.

35
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,350
Get me Winthorpe.

36
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,770
Well, of course I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

37
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:46,107
Oh, yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

38
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,485
I'll see you at the club.

40
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,517
Morning, Mr. Duke.

41
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,020
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

42
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,065
Vietnam did this to me,
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

43
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,694
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?
Yeah, how're you doing?

44
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,195
Spare a poorwar veteran
some change?

45
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,530
I'm on my knees for life.

46
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,699
I have no money to give you.

47
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:40,704
Please, anything. A quarter.
Anything, just a couple of dollars.

48
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,750
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

49
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,838
I don't care what it is.
Smoked ham, anything. Some crackers.

50
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,091
Thanks a lot.
How'd you like a stump up your ass?

51
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,884
Stay out of here!

52
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,720
You got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

53
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,560

56
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,279
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

57
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,657
Wrong. Quite wrong. Untrue.

58
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,411
They've given this genetics fellow
the Nobel Prize.

59

The man doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

60

Randolph. We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orangejuice

61
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,712
and you're talking to me
about human nature.

62

Money isn't everything, Mortimer.

63
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,090
Oh, grow up.

64
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,259
Mother always said you were g

65

We need a fourth for squash today,

what have you got for us?

Well, it's that time ofthe month again.

Payroll checks for our employees,
which require your signatures.

And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

86
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,265
We seem to be paying some
of our employees an awful lot of money.

87
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,059
Can't get around
the old minimum wage, Mortimer.

How is Penelope?

00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,430
Neverforget
she's our grandniece, Winthorpe.

00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,307
You'd better make
an honestwoman of her.

00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,892
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.

101

Actually, the wedding invitations
go out this week.

Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

Don'tworry about this, Winthorpe.

It's got nothing to do with environment.

With his genes,
you could put Winthorpe anywhere

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,604
and he's gonna come out on top.

you never go back, baby.

about con men
pretending to be blind and crippled.

since I stepped on that landmine

in Vietcong back in '72.
Itwas rough, very painful.

You were in Nam? So were we. Where?

126

I was in Sang Bang, Dang Gong.

basically a lot of places, a lot of places.

What unitwere you in?

129

Yeah, itwas real hush-hush.

133
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,683
I was Agent Orange.
Thatwas my name, Agent Orange.

134

Special Agent Orange, thatwas me.

00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,353
Airborne, huh?

136
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,866
I can see! I can see!

137
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,868
I have... I have legs.

138
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,747
I have... Oh shit, look at this.
Man! I can walk.

139
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,083
Jesus, praise Jesus.

140
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,879
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe... Thank you.

141
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,214
I just don't knowwhat to do. It's...

142
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,052
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

143
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,596
This is too much. I can't believe it.

144
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,848
You're beautiful.
Listen, I can't thank you.

145
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,225
First Moses, now this. God, Jesus...

Oh, baby, look at me.

I'm so happy. Oh, God.
Look at me, this is too much.

What a happy day. What a happy day!

149
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,236
Really, I appreciate it, y'all.
Okay now. All right. Look at this.

150
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,240
I can walk. I don't knowwhat to say.
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

151
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,786
You're beautiful,
both ofyou all, the two ofyou.

152
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,046
How're you doing?

153
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,931
-Oh, I'm sorry about that, man.
-Stop, thief.

154
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,642
-Help, help!
-What are you talking about, man?

155
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,396
Don't shoot. Take it, take it.
Please don't kill me. I'm getting married.

There's absolutely nothing wrong
with him, I can prove it.

Are we talking
about a wager, Randolph?

203
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,929
I suppose you think Winthorpe,
say if he were to lose hisjob,

204
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,932
would resort to holding up people

No, I don't thinkjust losing hisjob

What do you think? You crazy?

Get up there.

May I suggest using
a night stick, Officer?

Get out of here.

Hey, look, man, I ain't falling
forthe same trick twice, all right?

Whatyou gonna do, get me in the car
and have me arrested for stealing it?

322
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,725
Why should we do that, Mr. Valentine?

323
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,227
We're the ones who bailed you out.

324

Say, man, who are y'all?
Whaty'all wantwith me?

We want to help you, Mr. Valentine.

Excuse me.

This is a practical joke, right, bro?

334

Then these dudes are
a couple offaggots then, huh?

335
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,387
Well, what's my next move, man?

336

Thank you, you've been helpful.

337
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,230
What about the police and the payroll?

338
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,691
We've had
the charges dropped, Mr. Valentine.

339

You're a free man, Valentine.

340

We can stop right now
and you can walk out on us forever.

No. No, I believe I can hang out
with you fellas for a little while.

Randy, that's like Randy Jackson
from the Jackson 5, right?

00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,311
-Yes. Yes, I suppose so.
-Yeah, yeah.

How you doing?

Hey, Randy, Morty.
This is nice. I like this.

-Billy Ray.

William, this is Coleman.
He'll look afteryour day-to-day needs.

Can I relieve you ofthose, sir?

You get a glass, I'll give you a sip, man.

-Perhaps your coat, sir?
-Yes, this is my coat.

356
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,603
Coleman is here to take care ofyou.
He is your servant.

-May I take it?
-Get out of here, man.

Valentine very badlywants
to take a hot bath

359
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,735
and to get into something comfortable.

You see, man, I knew
you all was faggots, man.

You'll be Jacuzzi nobody.

364
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,958
It's a whirlpool bath, sir.
I think you'll enjoy it.

Bubbles, man.
Say, man, when I was growing up,

367
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:07,679
we want a Jacuzzi,
we had to fart in the tub. This is bad.

-What's he doing in there?
-He's singing, sir.

370
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,029
They're very musical people,
aren't they?

-What shall I do with his clothes, sir?
-Send them to the laundry.

to wear back to the ghetto

after I've won our bet.

374
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,667
Well, William, what do you think?

375
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,293
I like it, Randy. It's very nice.

376
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,462
I like the way you have the mirrors
and stuff hooked up overthere.

377
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,130
It's very pretty. I like that.
I like that mirror.

-I don't think he understands, Randolph.
-Oh, but, Morty, I do understand.

-William.
-Yes.

-This is your home.
-Right.

381

It belongs to you.

Yeah, all this is mine. I like my home.
It's very nice.

I have very nice taste in houses.

is yours now.

-Yeah, my own personal shit.
-You understand?

This is mine. Yeah, I like that.

00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,153
Yeah, you knowwhat I like most
about my place, Randy?

389
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,572
The curtains, man. Look at the curtains.

390
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,365
It's beautiful the way
I got this place set up, man.

This is something else. I like it.
The cabinets and whatnot.

392

Beautiful. I suppose you're gonna
just give me this TV set forfree, Randy?

393

-That's right.
-Everything in here is mine, huh?

394

-Oh, I guess the stereo's mine free too?
-Absolutely.

395

This is too much for me, man.

You know, I can really dig this, Randy.
You knowwhy?

This kind ofthing happens to me
everyweek.

This is your house.

These are your personal possessions.

400
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,267
You will only be stealing from yourself.

401

Look, firstyou throw
my ass in jail, right?

402
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,188

and start running some garbage to me

about this is my house,
this is my personal rug.

404

And then you go and tell me
this is my personal slave too.

I understand how you feel, William,
but the fact remains, all this is yours.

I can do what I want
with this stuff, right?

409
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,205
This is my vase here, right?

410
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,541
This is Billy Ray's vase, right?
I own this vase.

Hey, man, I'm sorry about that.

414
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,178
Perfectly all right, William,
itwas your vase.

415
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,807
That's a cheap vase, man.
Thatwas a fake, right?

416
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,727
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

417
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,646
But I seem to remember

418

we estimated its value
at $50,000 forthe insurance company.

in the Heritage Club.

Something that has never raised
its vile head

alive to see this.

totally preposterous. This is insane.

No, wait, I'm not a thief.

I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

618
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,168
Don't say it, Louis.

619
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:49,717
Come on, baby, just a dime bag.
I'll do all those things you like.

620
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,682
You lying, filthy, disgusting creep.

621
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:01,479
Todd was right aboutyou. I neverwant
to see you again as long as I live.

622
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,453
Grand! Great! Thanks a lot.

623
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,916
Itwas ajoke.
Yourfriend said itwould getyou off.

624
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,877
You mean,
someone told you to do this to me?

625
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,004
Yeah, and he paid me
a hundred bucks, too.

626
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,673
He's right overthere.

627
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,261
So let me get this straight,

628
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,972
I'm gonna give you $20 forthe cab,

629
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,432
and you're gonna give me $50
when we get to your house?

630
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,686
That is correct.
My butler, Coleman, will give you $50,

631
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,647
and drive you anywhere in the city
you wish to go.

632
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,608
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

633
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,360
You know, ifyou're hustling me...

634
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,780
Hustling you? Hustling you?

635
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,452
You don't think they give these
tojust anyone, do you?

636
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,541
I can charge goods and services
in over 86 countries around the world.

637
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,962
Yeah? Well, I don't take credit cards.

638
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,433
You'll see what a mistake all this was.

639
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,028
Yes?

640
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,448
Coleman, could you please let me in?
I'm having trouble with my key.

641
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,533
Who are you? What do you want?

642
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,911
Coleman, just unchain the door
and let me in. I'm in no mood forjokes.

643
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:45,332
Coleman? There's no Coleman here.
You've made a mistake.

644
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,134
Excuse me, for a moment.

645
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,764
Coleman! Let me in!

646
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,977
Ifyou don't go away,
I shall be forced to call the police.

647
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:23,454
Hello. I'll be making a cash withdrawal
forthe amount of $500.

648
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,707
Well, in fact, we'll make it $1,000.

649
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,591
Excuse me.

650
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,813
I'm sorry, Mr. Winthorpe,
but the IRS has frozen your accounts.

651
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,981
What are you talking about?
You know me.

652
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,192
You're a heroin dealer, Mr. Winthorpe.

653
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,321
Itwasn't heroin, itwas angel dust, PCP,
and I never even had my hands on it.

654
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:01,659
Regardless, it's not the kind of business
we want here at First National.

655
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,913
May I see your credit cards please?

656
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,337
-I've been ordered to repossess them.
-What?

657
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,298
Now, wait a minute,
what am I supposed to live on?

658
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,634
I mean, what's going to happen to me?

659
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,761
Roger.

660
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,610
Why is someone deliberately trying
to ruin my life?

661
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,780
Tell you what.
Forget about the $50, okay?

662
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,449
I'm just real tired. I'm going home.

663
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,621
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

664
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,375
I have been framed.
You can'tjust leave me here.

665
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,044
I've got enough problems, Louis.

666
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,508
Come on, come on.

667
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,138
Listen! Wait! Wait.

668
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:10,144
I have over $150,000 in that bank.

669
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,690
Butyou don't care
because you helped them do this to me.

670
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,658
Get offyour knees, Louis.

671
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,335
Give me your hand.

672
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,590
Soft hands.

673
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,134
And a manicure.

674
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,846
You haven't done a hard day's work
in your life, have you?

675
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,936
I'm gonna regret this, but...

676
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,232
Come on. Get in.

677
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,836
I'm going to get to the bottom ofthis.
This is about a grave, grave mistake.

678
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,257
Hey, that lookjust like
the dude that had me busted.

679
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,967
Sir?

680
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,595
Right there,
he looked just like the mother...

681
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,140
I mean, he looksjust like
the gentleman that had me busted.

682
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,685
To whom are you referring, sir?

683
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,062
Right there. The dude right overthere.

684
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,233
-Right overthere.
-That's my car.

685
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,946
Coleman! Coleman, that's my car!

686
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,616
That's my car! That's my driver.

687
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,541
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

688
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,044
You don'twant to be late
foryourfirst day atwork, sir.

689
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,796
(BELLS CLANGING)

690
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,428
I mean, what am I supposed
to do in here?

691
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,971
What theywant from me?

692
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,433
-I'm sure they'll tell you, sir.
-Yeah, what if I can't do it?

693
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,311
Just be yourself, sir.

694
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,897
Whatever happens,
they can't take that away from you.

695
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,290
Excuse me, my name is...

696
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,127
Yes, Mr. Valentine, they're waiting
foryou in the last office down the hall.

697
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,654
William, my boy. Right on time.
Come in, come in.

698
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,493
Sit down.

699
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,499
No, thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast this morning.

700
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,502
This is not a meal, Valentine.

701
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,714
We are here to try to explain to you
what it is we do here.

702
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,467
We are commodities brokers, William.

703
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,303
Now, what are commodities?

704
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,515
Commodities are agricultural products.

705
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:38,018
Like coffee, thatyou had for breakfast.

706
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,729
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

707
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,024
Pork bellies,
which is used to make bacon,

708
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:48,028
which you might find in a bacon
and lettuce and tomato sandwich.

709
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:54,535
Then there are other commodities
like frozen orangejuice and gold.

710
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,207
Though, of course,
gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

711
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,877
-Clear so far?
-Yeah.

712
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:08,048
Good, William. Now,
some of our clients are speculating

713
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,969
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

714
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,887
And we have other clients
who are speculating

715
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,807
that the price of gold is going to fall.

716
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:23,730
They place their orders with us
and we buy or sell their gold forthem.

717
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,150
Tell him the good part.

718
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,361
The good part, William, is that,

719
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:34,408
no matterwhether our clients
make money or lose money,

720
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,661
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

721
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,539
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

722
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,752
Well, it sounds to me
like you guys are a couple of bookies.

723
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,464
I told you he'd understand.

724
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,385
It doesn't take a genius
to figure outwhat happened.

725
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,971
It's the same guy
who tried to rob the payroll.

726
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,182
No doubt about it, that's him.

727
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,267
He planted the drugs on me.

728
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,853
Rahim, Mohammed, Larry.
How you guys doing?

729
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,772
RAHIM: Hey, how you doing?
LARRY: Hey, how you doing, baby?

730
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,568
You know those people?

731
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,957
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,962
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh, sure, he went to Harvard.

733
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,425
I mean, if he's being driven around
in my car,

734
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,886
he could actually be living in my house.

735
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,680
Maybe he's even taken my job.

736
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,307
You know, for all I know,

737
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,352
right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancée.

738
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,898
And Coleman.
Afteryears of service, this betrayal.

739
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,983
I don't understand it.

740
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,612
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

741
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,323
-The things that I am going to...
-Shut up, Louis.

742
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,991
Listen, taxis cost money,

743
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,577
food costs money
and rent costs money!

744
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,914
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

745
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,211
These were here when I moved in.
Put them on ifyou want.

746
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:19,012
Look, I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this...

747
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,515
Ophelia.

748
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,017
Ophelia. You realize that
that's the name...

749
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,727
I know, I know, I know.
Hamlet's girlfriend.

750
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,982
He went crazy, she killed herself.
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

751
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,818
Look, I'm 24 years old.

752
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,572
I'm from a small, miserable little mining
town you probably never heard of.

753
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,616
The only thing I've got going for me
in this whole big, wide world

754
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,537
is this body, this face,
and what I got up here.

755
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,217
I don't do drugs
and I don't have a pimp.

756
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,929
This place is a dump,

757
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:05,100
but it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

758
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,395
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

759
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,981
I figure,
I got three more years on my back.

760
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,858
I'll have enough to retire on.

761
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,736
You're a prostitute?

762
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,536
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

763
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:29,541
I help you getyourself back on yourfeet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

764
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,003
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

765
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,589
Understood?

766
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,606
By the way,

767
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,193
food and rent are not the only things
around here that cost money.

768
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,487

Okay. Pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

785
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,834
Which means everybody's sitting
in their office

and they're waiting forthem
to hit rock bottom

787
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,837

working forthe firm, Mr. Duke.

923
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,593
Itwas before you joined us, Valentine.

924
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:57,432
We did manage to stay in business
for 47 years before your arrival.

925
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,518
Have a drink, William. Merry Christmas.

926
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,770
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duke.

927
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,480
-What?
-Merry Christmas.

928
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:07,900
Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

929
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,093
Justwhat do you think you're doing?

930
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,637
Randolph! Mortimer!

931
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,348
Come in here quickly!
I've finally caught him!

932
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,770
-Who are you?
-I've caught him red-handed.

933
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,856
Winthorpe, is thatyou?

934
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,276
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
This man is a drug dealer.

935
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,405
Look. Look, here in his office drawer,
he's got all the bad drugs here.

936
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,325
Marijuanajoints, pills, Quaalude,

937
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:01,913
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

938
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,290
He's the pusher, not me.

939
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,752
Really, I just came in and caught
this man planting this stuff in my desk.

940
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,671
It's obviously some primitive attempt
to try to frame me.

941
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:15,343
Frame you? Boy, ifthat isn't
the pot calling the kettle black.

942
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,721
This man's obviously a lunatic.
I'm calling security.

943
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,891
Put that phone down.

944
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,187
Hello, security, Merry Christmas.

945
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,317
You try to rob me, plant drugs on me.

946
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:35,321
You steal my house, my car, my job.
You know, I ought to kill him right now.

947
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,323
Hey, look, man,
this is a big misunderstanding, all right.

948
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:39,825
I don't know nothing aboutyour house
and your car and yourjob, really.

949
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,619
Could you put the gun away?
Will you ask the Dukes?

950
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:45,414
Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe.
Have you lostyour mind?

951
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,459
Freeze, slime ball.

952
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,089
RANDOLPH:
I realize this whole experience

953
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,633
must have been
rather unsettling foryou.

954
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,010
Winthorpe, don't leave. We can explain.

955
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,597
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

956
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:07,395
You'll all be very, very sorry.

957
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,314
(WINTHORPE SHOUTING)

958
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:33,421
Poor, deluded creature.
We caught him pilfering at our club,

959
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:36,716
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

960
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,468
Now he's dressing up like Santa Claus.

961
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,597
Very sordid business.

962
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:46,392
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

963
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,061
It's none of my business,
but that guy belongs behind bars.

964
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:52,773
-He's unemployed, Valentine.
-It's no excuse, Mortimer.

965
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,526
He's flat broke, obviously hungry.

966
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,737
Oh, but he has money
to buy drugs, right?

967
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,655
Listen, you can't be soft
on people like that.

968
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,866
Take it from me. I know, Randolph.

969
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,975
RANDOLPH: Pay up, Mortimer,
I've won the bet.

970
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,814
Here, $1.

971
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:22,738
We took a perfectly useless psychopath
like Valentine,

972
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,450
and turned him
into a successful executive.

973
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,537
And during the same time,

974
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:33,207
we turned an honest, hard-working man

975
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:38,462
into a violently deranged
would-be killer.

976
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:44,051
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

977
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,387
and returning Valentine to the ghetto?

978
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:49,598
I don'twant Winthorpe back
afterwhat he's done.

979
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,395
You mean keep Valentine on
as managing director?

980
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,064
Do you really believe

981
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,860
I would have a nigger
run ourfamily business, Randolph?

982
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:04,029
Of course not. Neitherwould I.

983
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,992
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

984
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:11,036
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don'tyou?

985
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:13,914
Absolutely. No sense
rocking the boat until then.

986
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:17,460
If Mr. Beeks does
whatwe paid him to do,

987
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:21,130
we should have a very happy New Year.

988
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:23,215
Indeed.

989
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,695

I have a big surprise foryou.

Excuse me. The doorwas open...

Does he live here?

Wait here a minute, I'll be right back.

but he's going to be all right.

Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest.

-Not at all.

Yeah, research on how he can get

two days before it goes public.
