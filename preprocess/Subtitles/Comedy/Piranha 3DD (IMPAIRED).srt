00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,322
- Let's go!
- [Shelby screaming indistinctly]

319
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,284
Come on, it's just a foot!

320
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,326
- Grab my hand! I got you!
- [shrieks]

[both shrieking]

[gasps]

326
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,706
What is this thing?

327
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,571
Maddy?

328
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,143
What the fuck is that?

329
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,041
Ugh.

330
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,612

- Fuck. Oh, shit.
- [Shelby] Oh, my God!

333
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,897
Is that a fucking piranha?

334
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,937
<i>My father worked construction</i>
<i>on Carson Dam.</i>

335

<i>He gave me this one</i>
<i>for my eighth birthday.</i>

337
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,542
I'm telling you, man, it was a piranha.

338
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,947
How'd they get from
Lake Victoria to our lake?

339
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,883
That's what we've gotta find out.

340
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,354
- [chuckling]
- What?

341
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,928
Look at us.

342
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,031
The cop and the marine biologist.

343
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,190
I'm sorry. That just
sounds like a shitty sitcom.

344
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,668
- <i>The Cop and The Marine Biologist.</i>
- [clicks on siren]

345
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,598
[siren stops]

346
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,510
You're still wet.

347
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,879
A little, yeah.

348
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,413
[indistinct police radio chatter]

349
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,545
[engine races]

350

[car approaches, slows]

351
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,652
Guys, can one of you open the door?

352
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,189
Kyle, open the door.

353
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,758
Little man.

354
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,961
That's funny.

355
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,154
Dick.

356
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,190
[gasps]

357
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,130
Who are you?
Why are you here?

358
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:54,269
- Sir, we saw you on YouTube.
- You and 11 million, 486 other people.

359
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,273
I have 700 more hits

360
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,474
than the Laughing Diarrhea Baby.

361
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,246
Uh, we need your expertise,
Mr. Goodman.

362
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,183
Why?

363
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,088
We think they're back.

364
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,563
Cross Lake isn't even connected
to Lake Victoria.

365
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:24,505
The piranha must be migrating
through underground lakes and rivers.

366
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,545
I've studied this specimen
for almost a year.

367
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,040
- [tank thumps]
- [laughs wildly]

368
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,616
Here, Meanie.

369
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,687
[speaking gibberish]

370
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,812
- [tapping tank]
- [growls]

371
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,289
I think you might
find this interesting.

372
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,423
- You need some help?
- Yeah. [grunting]

373
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,363
OK, this is galvanized steel,

374
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,460
like ordinary household plumbing.

375
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,398
There we go.

376
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,009
Aha! Now, for some incentive.

377
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,608
- [frog croaking]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

378
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,079
No, no, no, not the frog. Aah!

379
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,151
Sorry, I... sold out of puppies
this morning.

380
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,752
OK...

381
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,252
Now, I think this is
quite resourceful. Watch.

382
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,920
- [thumps]
- [gasps]

383
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,368
Come on, come on, come on.

384
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,518
Now it's got something to grab.

385
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,797
- [grunts]
- Oh, dear! Fuck!

386
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,128
Barry, are you crazy?!
You almost lost a hand!

387
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,963
I had a pet frog once.

388
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,196
[sighs]

389
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,707
Come on. OK. Come here.

390
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,036
Really?

391
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,875
Now check out some data.

392
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,105
What were you thinking?

393
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,647
These piranha spent eons

394
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,523
living in underground
lakes and rivers

395
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:30,259
full of sulfur dioxide
from all the geothermal activity.

396
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,598
That's how they come back to spawn.

397
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,968
- They follow the rotten egg smell.
- Yes.

398
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:42,544
Problem is, sulfur dioxide
is commonly released

399
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,513
during the treatment
of chlorinated water.

400
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,711
So it's conceivable
that the fish could become...

401
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,788
...confused...

402
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,188
...and try to enter man-made
drainage systems.

403
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,991
Especially with all the shocking

404
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,826
abundance of backyard pools.

405
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,730
Our water park drains directly
into Cross Lake.

406
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,998
That's like the equivalent
of a thousand swimming pools.

407
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,700
Oh, that would be a very bad thing.

408
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,368
Did you tell anyone
that this could happen?

409
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:18,209
I tried. Unfortunately,
I lost some credibility

410
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:23,685
after my last book foretold
a dreadful plague of walking fish.

411
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,517
Oh, that's right!

412
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,023
You wrote <i>Fish Walk Among Us.</i>
I loved that book.

413
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,724
That's really great.

414
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,591
Why, thank you...

415
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,164
...kindred spirit.

416
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,399
Mm-hm.

417
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,025
[chuckles]

418
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,400
[Goodman mutters indistinctly]

419
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,665
[laughs] Thanks.

420
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,839
Barry... you, uh...

421
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,379
You read a marine biology book?

422
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,246
Well, I wanted to see
what you're so interested in.

423
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,316
[sighs]

424
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,819
Guys, we've gotta check the drains over
the outflow pipes in the lake, tonight.

425
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,156
I could get a dive team up here
from Tempe by tomorrow.

426
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,490
No, that's too late.

427
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:10,328
The water park opens tomorrow,
that place is gonna be packed.

428
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,060
If the fish are getting through
the drain system...

429
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,139
That would make Lake Victoria
look like an appetizer.

430
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,002
Guys, we've gotta get
out there right now.

431
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,707
Thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Goodman.

432
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,336
Thank you. Thank you.

433
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,709
[Barry] Thank you, sir. Honor.

434
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,409
- OK. Be well.
- It's a pleasure...

435
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:35,117
- Aha! 11 million, 888 hits!
- [door closes]

436

Take that, Laughing Diarrhea Baby!

[growls]

438

<i>[man] Two Merkin teens,</i>

It's totally cool.

443
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,296
How you feeling?

444
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,004
- A little better.
- You don't seem any better.

- [sobs]
- Hey, what is it?

446
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,343
It's just the stress
of the whole Ashley thing and...

447
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,945
Make love to me.

448
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,821
- Please.
- Right now?

449
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,448
Please, Josh.

450
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,856
Right now. I...

451
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,724
I think something's
really wrong with me,

452

and I... if I don't...

453
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,930
If I don't get better,
I don't want to die a virgin.

00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,362
[panting] Please, Josh.

455
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,337
I want it to be with you.

456
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,044
Just come inside me.

457
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,344
Come inside me, I'll do
whatever you say after that.

458
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,921
The outflow pipes down there
link directly to the water park.

459
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:13,887
I've gotta check them out.

460
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,516
You've considered
how batshit crazy this is, right?

461
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,925
I've gotta take a look.
I'll be quick.

462
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,590
Um, look, about what I was
trying to say last night...

463
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,565
Are you coming in?
Because I could really use a spotter.

464
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,603
- What?
- I mean, if you're... It's OK.

465
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:31,004
No, no, no, I'm not scared.
It's just, um...

466
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,007
...I can't swim. [nervous chuckle]

467
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,203
You work at a water park
and you can't swim?

468
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,041
Ding-ding.

469
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,808
What about all the beach parties
in high school,

470
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,442
or the parties at the park?
You never?

471
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,953
My God, Barry, I totally
would've taught you how to swim.

472
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,649
No, yeah, I know.
You seemed kind of busy at the time.

Not a big deal.

Toss me that flashlight.

00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,094
[Kyle, quietly] Yes, I know. That's
what I said, Chet, but she won't listen.

and dump my sorry ass
in the water.

The way that parents toss their kids
into the pool when they wanna swim?

641
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,872
That's a great idea. OK.

642
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,566
All right, I can do this. Here we go.

643
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,802
- One, two...
- Just stop!

644
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,537
OK. OK, right. What happened?

645
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,807
- Why'd you stop?
- You said stop.

646
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,678
No, don't listen to my pussy-ass mouth.

647
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,013
No matter what I say,
dump me in the water.

648
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,917
OK, got it. Not gonna listen
to your pussy-ass mouth.

649
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,683
I mean, you don't have a pussy-ass
mouth, I'm just saying...

650
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,850
- Dump me in the water.
- OK, OK. Here we go.

- No, no, no, you're going in.
- No, I changed my mind.

- No, no, no, he wants to go in.

No, the hell I do.
I don't wanna go in.

What's wrong with you? Don't push
that poor legless stump into the pool.

659
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,280
Yeah, that's right, don't dump
this poor legless stump in the pool.

OK, you know what?
You're gonna go into the water.

you might get some private

[Chet] What are you doing
back here, Maddy?

697
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,344
I saw this when I was taking inventory,

698
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,478
but I didn't think to ask
why it was here until now.

We pump our own water now.
Fuck the utilities, right?

700
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,221
You can't fill this water park
off a well.

[laughing] It's not a standard well.

You could be pumping piranha straight

just might, be piranha in the pipe?
