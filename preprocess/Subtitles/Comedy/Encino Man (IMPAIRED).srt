00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,700
If we tell anyone,
if anyone sees him, they'll
take him away from us.

342
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,600
They'll cut him up
into little pieces.

343
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,000
They'll take all the credit,
and we'll still be geeks.

Why does none of this
sound familiar to me ?

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,200
I told you about this
months ago, remember ?

441
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,600
About school giving us
extra credit for college
for housing exchange students,

442
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,900
And learning about
their culture and
you said it was okay.

443
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,300
Now you're gonna
take it back ?

444
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,200
No, no, no, i'm not
gonna take it back.

This is important to me.

You're bogus.
Larry, how could i forget
something like this ?

He's an exchange student.
He's going to be staying
in our house.

00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,300
You forgot me
in the third grade.

456
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,600
I spent the entire night after
the play in the parking lot.
In the sixth grade, the soccer ?
