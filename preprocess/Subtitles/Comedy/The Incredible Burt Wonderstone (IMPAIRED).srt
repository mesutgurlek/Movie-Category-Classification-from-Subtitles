Good evening. For 15 years,
Anton and I did a little show called:

1416
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:01,527
"Burt & Anton: A Magical Friendship."

1417
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:05,531
But as some of you may know,
we recently had a falling-out.

1418

Yeah, we fell right out of The Hot Box.

[ALL LAUGH]

BURT: Oh. See, ladies and gentlemen,
along the way...

1421
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:17,085
...we forgot the most important thing of all,
and that is that Burt needs Anton.

1422
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:19,545
And Anton needs Burt.

1423
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,840
Because that is what a magical friendship
is all about.

1424
01:28:23,633 --> 01:28:28,221
Tonight, we offer you the one illusion
that we dreamed about as kids...

01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:31,015
...but never dared perform until now.

1426
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:35,353
I guess you could say that this trick
started 3O years ago on my birthday...

1427
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,940
...when I was given
a Rance Holloway Magic Kit.

1428
01:28:40,066 --> 01:28:44,904
And I watched the instructional video
for the very first time.

1429
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:56,416
Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.

1430
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:59,252
You've probably seen me
on The Merv Griffin Show...

1431
01:28:59,419 --> 01:29:00,920
...or live onstage...

1432
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:05,591
...at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino
in Las Vegas.

1433
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:08,928
Magic is the art of making people
believe something...

1434
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:12,515
...they know can't possibly be true.

1435

in the second row aisle seat:

01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:21,941
"That's the ugliest goddamn orange
sweater I have ever seen"...

1437
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:25,445
...you might be astonished,
because there's no way I could've known...

1438
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:29,407
...what he'd be wearing
when I recorded this 3O years ago, right?
