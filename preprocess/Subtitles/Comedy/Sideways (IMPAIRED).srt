- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

266
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,285
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

267
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,880
and it just cools down the berries.

268
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,824
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

[ Miles ]
Let me show you how this is done.

271
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,437
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

272
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,700
You're looking for color and clarity.

273
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,208
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

274
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,303
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

275
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,279
- Okay?
- Okay.

276
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,282
Now tip it.

277
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,844
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

278
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,857
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

279
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,859
It's usually
more important with reds.

280
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,861
- Okay?
- Okay.

281
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,863
Now stick your nose in it.

282
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,365
- [ Sniffs ] Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

283
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,731
Really get your nose right in there.
Really--

284
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,396
Mmm. A little citrus.

285
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,533
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,381

like, the faintest...

288
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,044
[ Sniffs ]
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--

289
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,123
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--

290

like, a nutty Edam cheese.

- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

294
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,393
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

295
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,402
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

296
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,404
Oxygenating it opens it up.

297
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,168
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,269
- Nice job.
- We like it.

307
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,635
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

308
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,641
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

309

[ Chuckles ]

310
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,480
Are you chewing gum?

311
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,452
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

312
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,454
Whoa!

313
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,957
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

314
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,391
I mean, you've been there.

315
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,397
Well, you know, I-- I think that you
waited for some good reason...

316
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,400
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

317
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,902
so I think it's great.

318
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,905
It's time.

319
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,908
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

320
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,912
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

321
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,915
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

322
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,919
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

323
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,923
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

324
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,925
So I'm thinking about it.

325
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,927
But I don't know.

326
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,929
Might get a little incestuous.

327
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,932
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

328
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,434
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

329
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,266
This would just provide some stability.

330
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:51,001
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

331
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,010
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

332
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,012
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

333
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,741
No. No.

334
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,889
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

335
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,891
- Miles!
- Sir.

336
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,393
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

337
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,396
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

338
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,399
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

339
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,901
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

340
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,905
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,908
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

342

[ Laughs ]
Absolument.

343
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,913
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

344
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,983
Very special. Thank you.

345
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,988
Mmm!

346
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,581
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

347
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:46,529
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

348
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,997
Pour us a couple, will ya.

349
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,194
Yeah. It's tight.

350

There you are, gentlemen.

351
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,876
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

352

Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

353
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,548
It's gonna be great.

354
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,618
Here's to us.

355
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,059
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

356
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,561
Check out that chick.

357
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,257
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

358
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,267
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

359
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,964
- You know that chick?
- Yes.Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

360
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,268
You know?
It's practically my office.

361
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,276
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

362
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,280
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year,year and a half.

363
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,282
She's incredibly hot.

364
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,648
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

365

Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

367

When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

368
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,489
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

369
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,496
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

370
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,501
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

371
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,936
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

372
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,941
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

373
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,137
Calm down. Let's just eat.

374
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,478
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

375
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,486
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

376
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,216
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

377
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,918
Uh... no, actually.

378
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,825
But... thank you.

-Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

And she's obviously into you.

388
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,253
What else do you know about her?

389
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,482
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

390
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,527
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

391

- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

392
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,099
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton,Jack.

393
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,100
How is that ever gonna work out?

394
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,500
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

395
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,336
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

396
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,043
You're blind, dude. Blind.

397

I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

403
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,696
Please. Light up, light up.

404
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,300

- So, how's that book coming, Miles?

00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,716
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

408
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:58,152
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

409
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,156
It's getting published.

410
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,557
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

411
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,153
Well, congratulations.

- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

- Cheers.
- Thanks.

No, Maya, I'm an actor.

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
Really. What kind of stuff?

417
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,843
Mmm, a lot ofTV.

418
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,346

on a couple of series.

But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

Anything I might know?

421
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,681
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

That's hilarious!

So, what are you guys up to tonight?

00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,050
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

434
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:08,182
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

435
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,229
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

Uh, the Windmill.

Windmill.

and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

-Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired,Jack.

- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

when she found out
your novel was getting published.

- Thanks,Jack.
-Just trying to get you a little action.

I would appreciate a little bit of help.

448
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,894
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

449

Well, somebody had to do the talking.

she's not married.

- No rock.

the closer we get to the motel.

on this trip, Miles...

Man, this is our week to get crazy.

479
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,839

- Yeah? Like that?

That's a big one.

486
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:40,070
[ Woman ] But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

487
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,572
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

488
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,202
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

489
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,145
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

491

[ Woman ]
This is our estate chardonnay.

492
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,605
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

So, what do you think?

496
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,422
Mmm. Quaffable.

497
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,754
But, uh, far from transcendent.

498

Oak-y.

500
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,729
This is a cabernet franc.

501
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,734
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

502
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,396
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

503
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,405
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

504
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,408
and it was a silver medal winner...

505
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,410
at Paso Robles last year.

506
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,072

Well, I will tell you something.

509
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,552
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

510
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,557
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

511

Tastes pretty good to me.

So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

513
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,191
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

514

Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

518
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,711
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

519
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,338
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

520
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,349
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

521
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,351

- I do?

tonight. So we're all going out.

- It's beautiful.

Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

542
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,767
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

543
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,201
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

545

Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

546
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,547
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

Why didn't you tell me
about this before,Jack?

566
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,879
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,164
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

620
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,394
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

621
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,300
Yeah. I miss you too.

622
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,374
Yeah. I love you too.

623
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,271
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

624
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,280
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

625
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,282
People love that guy.

626
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,285
And don't forget--
your novel is coming out in the fall.

Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

628
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,358
Come here, Miles. Come here.

Do not sabotage me.

If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,869
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

632
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,872
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

633
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,375
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,878
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

640
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,360
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

641
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,260
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

645
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,752
- Hi, Miles.
- [ Stephanie ] Good. How are you?

646
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,255
Hello, Maya.
[ Sighs ]

00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,259
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- [ Maya ] Thank you.

00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,955
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

So, what's good here?

650
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,296
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

651
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,371
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

652

- What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--
- Kalyra.

around 5:30, 6:00.

- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were--

- That's nice.
- It's aged 1 2 months in oak.

00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,051
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

657
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,053
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

658
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,318
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

659
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,553
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

660
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,860
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,957
- Right.
-Just... small stuff.

Yeah. Mmm.

Sorry. It's good.

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,674
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

Oh, that's-- that--

Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

670
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,519
I didn't hear him say that.

671
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:35,024
- Whenever I say something he said--
- [ Laughs ] Very good.

672
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,525
No, actually-- No. That one.

- Right?
- Oh, yes.

That's what I'm saying.

677
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,937
For our soup we have corn chowder...

678
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,440
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

Miles, what does this remind you of?.

"Red wine. Red wine."

He was brought up on a lot of charges.

- Yeah?

00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,431
Right.

687

After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

Ancient way of treating the grape.

695
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

696
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,664
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

697
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,397
[ Stephanie ]
So everyone's going back to that.

698
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,816
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

and picked the grapes...

how many of them must be dead by now.

if I opened a bottle of wine today...

it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:51,059
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

1000
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,120
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.
