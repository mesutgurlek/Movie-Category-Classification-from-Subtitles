<i>Previously on Eureka...</i>

2
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,900
Relax, Carter.
It's a promotion.

3
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:05,100
You know,
sometimes it sucks

4
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:06,700
having a dad who's
the town Smokey.

5
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,100
Well, sometimes it sucks
having a daughter

6
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:09,700
who's the town delinquent.

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,900
Dog!

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm Jack Carter.

9
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:14,700
He's a U.S. Marshal.

10
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:16,500
I was an engineer.

11
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,500
Trains?

12
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,400
Space shuttles.

13
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,100
Allison Blake,
Department of Defense.

14
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:22,100
<i>(Carter)
Where are you taking me?</i>

15
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>(Allison)
Welcome to Eureka.</i>

16
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,000
A haven where
the world's greatest thinkers

17
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,200
could live and work.

18
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,900
You must be the new sheriff
I heard so much about.

19
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,300
Nathan Stark.
You two have a history?

20
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:31,500
Not exactly.
He's my husband.

21
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:32,500
<i>(woman)
Section Five.</i>

22
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>(man)
Let's go.</i>

23
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,300
We happen to be in the most advanced scientific
facility in the world.

24
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,900
(Henry)
We ought to go back
to the last remnant

25
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:41,200
of whatever universe
existed before our own.

26
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,200
What's happening in there?

27
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:43,100
I don't know.

28
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:44,500
Systems are offline!

29
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,700
You feel that?
Yeah.

30
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,100
Henry, what did you do?

31
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,600
I couldn't let you go.

32
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,600
None of what we've known
for the past four years

33
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:57,700
was supposed to happen.

34
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:59,900
Henry went back

35
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,200
and changed history.

36
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,800
????

37
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>We need to stop Henry</i>

38
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:05,200
from saving Kim.

39
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:06,800
Someone's gotta go back.

40
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:07,800
I love our life.

41
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,200
I love this baby.

42
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,200
(Carter)
There's no time, no way,

43
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:12,800
that we don't end up together.

44
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>(S.A.R.A.H.)
October 3, 2006.</i>

45
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:16,300
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm stopping you, Henry.

47
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:20,000
I have to save her.
Get the hell out of the way!

48
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,900
[sobbing]
No! No!

49
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,300
I think this is definitely
becoming a thing.

50
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,500
<i>We don't have a thing.</i>

51
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,700
We might.

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,100
We are at marginal
proximity now.

53
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,100
No change in core temperature
or ambient emissions.

54
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's proceed.

55
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,800
Extreme proximity now.

56
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
Still no reaction
from the Artifact.

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,800
Moment of truth.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,300
What's happening in there?

59
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:23,200
I don't know!
Systems are offline!

60
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,800
Get 'em back online!

61
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:25,900
I'm trying!

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
<i>I thought I'd
find you here.</i>

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,100
You're not returning
my phone calls.

65
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
I didn't feel much like...
talking.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
<i>You know, you can't</i>

67
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,700
keep reliving this, Henry.

68
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,800
It's been over a month.

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,100
I know.

70
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,800
I can't bring Kim back...

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,300
either.

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
<i>Well, you could.</i>

73
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:37,100
But...not without
unraveling the universe, so...

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,000
<i>Sorry.</i>

75
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Look.

76
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,600
You and I are gonna be
living with the memory

77
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,300
of a timeline that's gone.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,200
<i>I know it's gonna
seem impossible.</i>

79
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,300
<i>And, uh...I know it's
not gonna happen overnight.</i>

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
But...I think
that you and I

81
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,900
should help each other
move on.

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I mean, don't you?

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Working on it.

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,200
<i>Then the Phoenix appears.</i>

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
The firebird,

86
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:32,100
<i>rising from the ashes.</i>

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,800
<i>A mythical symbol</i>

88
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:36,400
of death and rebirth.

89
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
Mythical is right.

90
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:40,200
Phoenix is about
as real as Bigfoot.

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,500
History and cultures

92
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>are chock-a-block
with stories</i>

93
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,100
<i>of the Phoenix.</i>

94
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:49,200
Its sacrifice
to the flames

95
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>begins our salvation.</i>

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Lest we suffer the flames
ourselves.

97
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
So show
a little respect, lad.ct

98
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:01,700
Okay.

99
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Another refill, Vincent.

100
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:18,900
That is my famous
five-alarm chili, Wayne.

101
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,900
You may wanna go easy.
Try a lobster button.

102
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,600
Uh...I been fighting
a cold.

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,200
Spicy food cleanses
the evil spirits.

104
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,800
The hotter the better.

105
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
All right.

106
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

107
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,800
So why don't you
just go talk to him?

108
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,800
I can't.

109
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,200
You know, everything is all
weird with us now.

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,000
Maybe it was just
a one-time thing.

111
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,900
You know, adrenaline,
heat of the moment.

112
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,100
Making out with Taggart?

113
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,200
More like a moment
of insanity.

114
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,500
Not so loud.

115
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
Look, I really need some
outside perspective here.

116
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Please?

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,500
You want perspective?

118
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:03,400
Uh-huh.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,800
You hooked up with a guy
whose age difference with you

120
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,500
is the same
as me and my dad.

121
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
That did it.

122
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,500
Thanks.
You're welcome.

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,700
You need something, Fargo?

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
What? Uh, no.

125
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:39,900
I mean, I was, uh,

126
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,000
just gonna go get
some food.

127
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,900
<i>Do you want anything?</i>

128
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm good.

129
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,300
Okay, then.

130
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,200
<i>Nathan.</i>

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
I didn't expect
to see you here.

132
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I didn't expect
to be here.

133
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,600
But my ears
finally stopped ringing.

134
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,000
I thought I could
use the distraction.

135
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,300
Well, it's good
that you came.

136
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah.

137
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,000
So how are
your burns healing?

138
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:06,600
Surprisingly well,
actually.

139
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,100
My last treatment's
tomorrow.

140
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I take it there's no news
from the disciplinary committee?

141
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,900
It's the Department of Defense.
Nothing happens quickly.

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Well, it was my call
to sample the Artifact.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,700
Kim Anderson died
as a result.

144
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,700
As did the Artifact.

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Someone has
to take the fall.

146
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,700
Nathan, it was an accident.

147
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,400
Let's just wait to see
what the results are

148
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,600
before we jump
to worst-case scenarios.

149
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,800
Gonna head
back to the lab.

150
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,500
Take one last look
at the Artifact,

151
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,500
just in case.

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
Look, I don't think
you should necessarily

153
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:39,600
forget about what happened.

154
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:40,700
I think it'd be wrong.

155
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:41,900
It'd be horrible.

156
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,900
But I do think that we should
look on the positive side.

157
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
Positive?
Yeah.

158
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Like...

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
Like, um, the little things,
you know.

160
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:53,000
For the next four years
we're gonna know

161
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,700
which movies suck
before they even come out.

162
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,200
We're gonna know
where bad guys

163
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,600
are gonna do bad things
before they even happen.

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
We're gonna know, uh,

165
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,200
the outcome to every
major sporting event.

166
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:03,400
Huge financial upside.

167
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,500
Jack, I don't think
you understand.

168
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,200
That life is gone.

169
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,300
We are not likely to relive
many of the same events again.

170
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, I've had
this picnic before.

171
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,800
Right? As a matter of fact,
tonight is the night

172
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,000
when I ask Allison out
for the first time.

173
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,500
I remember that, because
Vincent was right over there

174
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,300
making the same
lobster balls.

175
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,900
Buttons.
But...

176
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Oh, whatever...it...

177
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,200
Oh, and, uh,

178
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,800
<i>see the sweaty
Asian guy here?</i>

179
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>He's gonna trip</i>

180
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,500
on that kid's
hover thing

181
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,900
<i>and spill his chili
all over that guy's T-shirt.</i>

182
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,100
And I know that,
because tomorrow,

183
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,300
when I go
to the dry cleaners

184
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,000
to get my clothes
for the first date with Allison,

185
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,600
<i>he's gonna be complaining
about how the stains</i>

186
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:39,800
<i>didn't come out
of his favorite T-shirt.</i>

187
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah!

188
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,000
Jack, you have
to take a step back.

189
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,700
Granted, some things
may occur

190
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:49,700
in a similar way.

191
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:52,200
But they are going
to diverge more and more.

192
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:54,900
No--
You lived through
four years of a timeline

193
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,300
that was erased
because you stopped me

194
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,900
from doing the thing
that created it--saving Kim.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
And the very fact that
we're having this conversation

196
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:04,400
means things
are going to change.

197
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Everybody get ready!

198
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,400
The moment...has arrived.

199
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
There she is.

200
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
The firebird.

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Well, so far,
everything's happened

202
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,000
exactly the way
it did last time.

203
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,500
Including the fact
that I still can't see

204
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:08,900
Taggart's crazy firebird.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Excuse me.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,300
Okay, that's new.

207
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,500
So no one saw
what happened?

208
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,700
No, all our eyewitnesses
were staring at the sun.

209
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,900
<i>There's not much
tissue left,</i>

210
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,000
but I can run a DNA sample
and get an I.D.

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,300
No, I know who it is.

212
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,700
It's, uh, fat,
sweaty Asian guy.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
What?

214
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:18,800
Carter!

215
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm being descriptive.

216
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:21,800
<i>If I knew his name,
I'd use it.</i>

217
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:23,100
<i>His name is Kwan.</i>

218
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,200
Wayne Kwan.

219
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
What?

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Are you sure?

221
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, he was on his third bowl
of five-alarm chili.

222
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,300
Fourth, if you count the one
he spilled on Dr. Brock.

223
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:31,900
You okay?

224
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah, that's Kevin's
occupational therapist.

225
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,100
He's been working with him
for years.

226
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:37,500
<i>I don't know how I'm gonna
tell Kevin that he's gone.</i>

227
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
<i>What's up?</i>

228
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
Um, so, what--

229
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:42,400
he get too close
to a barbecue?

230
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,100
None nearby.

231
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,400
Uh, drop
a cigarette?

232
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,600
Mm-mm, Wayne was asthmatic.

233
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:46,700
He never touched them.

234
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
Vincent...do you have
any special ingredients

235
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:52,400
in that five-alarm chili?

236
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:53,300
Like what?

237
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,300
<i>I don't know.
Alcohol, rocket fuel.</i>

238
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,100
Whatever else you cook up

239
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:57,900
in that chemistry lab
you call a kitchen.

240
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:00,400
I'll have you know I come
by my spice naturally.

241
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,300
Without a doubt.

242
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,800
But that guy ate
three bowls of your chili

243
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:03,900
and burst into flames.

244
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:04,700
So if it's not
too much trouble,

245
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,800
I'd love a sample.

246
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,600
Cool.
Help yourself.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,300
Any of you wanna
test it for me?

248
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,400
It's what I live for.

249
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
<i>There is another
possibility.</i>

250
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:15,800
What's that?

251
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh, you're not
buying into Taggart's

252
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,000
crazy firebird
fairy tales?

253
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:22,800
You've got to admit,

254
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,300
the timing
was a little disturbing.

255
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,100
There are documented
incidents of combustion

256
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,100
when certain chemicals
are exposed to sunlight.

257
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>But in this case,
most of them</i>

258
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,800
would have been
in his GI tract.

259
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
He also spilled a bowl,
so...

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,500
So maybe there is something
to this Phoenix thing.

261
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,600
Fine.

262
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Go talk to Taggart.

263
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:42,400
But don't
get your hopes up.

264
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,400
Uh...

265
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
talk to Taggart?

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
By myself?

267
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,200
Why, do you have
a problem with that?

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,500
No, uh...

269
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,800
you just never let me
follow up on my own leads.

270
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:56,800
Jo, you've done this
dozens of times over the years.

271
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,200
What years?

272
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Well, I...you know.

273
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
I mean, no time
like the present.

274
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,600
It's, uh...

275
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,600
I have every confidence
in you.

276
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,800
Uh...great.

277
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,700
See?
We're not in Kansas anymore.

278
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
How's Kevin doing?

279
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,700
[whispering]
I asked Beverly
to come over and help him

280
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,100
process the news.

281
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:38,900
Oh.

282
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,200
Kevin, has your mom

283
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,900
told you
what happened to Wayne?

284
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
He's gone.

285
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, I'm afraid he is.</i>

286
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,800
How do you feel
about that?

287
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
Will I still see
the other man?

288
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,900
What other man?

289
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
The man downstairs.

290
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,100
[whispering]
Do you know
who he's talking about?

291
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,000
[whispering]
No, his sessions
were always one-on-one.

292
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:07,900
<i>Kevin, can you</i>

293
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:09,300
tell me the name
of the man?

294
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Kevin?

295
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
I don't know.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

297
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,300
I, uh...

298
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,100
<i>[whispering]
I don't wanna push him.</i>

299
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,000
It's an awful lot for him
to process at one time.

300
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>He may even be
making up this other man</i>

301
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>as a defense mechanism.</i>

302
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,900
Well, thanks for
coming by, Beverly.

303
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,100
We really appreciate it.

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,000
<i>And...</i>

305
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,800
by "we," I mean...
just...all of us.

306
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,300
You know, in Eureka.

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
It takes a village.

308
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,100
Okay. I might be making
a lot of house calls

309
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,400
in this village today.

310
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

311
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you, Beverly.

312
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,100
Hey, it's Carter.

313
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,800
I just talked to Taggart,
and he thinks

314
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,500
he may know
what happened with Wayne.

315
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:09,900
All right,
I'll be right there.

316
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,400
I call it
the Phoenix Effect.

317
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,000
When the firebird appears,
solar flares

318
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:24,700
emit high-energy
exotic meson particles.

319
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,800
Under the right
atmospheric conditions,

320
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:29,400
you can get
spontaneous combustion.

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Is that human?

322
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,600
Of course it is.

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,300
Freshly-ground
skin grafts

324
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,800
from the bio-chem
burn unit.

325
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
<i>Now watch.</i>

326
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Uni-directional
meson particle emitter.

327
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Turn up the juice, and...

328
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,000
The Phoenix...rises.

329
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,200
I hate you.

330
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,600
You're welcome.

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,500
Well, mystery solved.

332
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Except why did it only
happen to Wayne Kwan?

333
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Interesting point.

334
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm gonna go shower.

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,300
I'm covered in human.

336
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>(Zoe)
Dad, it's been 20 minutes.</i>

337
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>I need you to take me
to the concert.</i>

338
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>(Carter)
I'll be out in a minute.</i>

339
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,200
<i>(S.A.R.A.H.)
Allison Blake is calling,
Sheriff.</i>

340
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>(Carter)
Oh, great,
put her through!</i>

341
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,100
Oh, yeah, please,
take your time!

342
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, Allison,
can you hear me?

343
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,900
Um, uh, yeah.

344
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,100
I can do more
than hear you.

345
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:11,600
Oh, sorry, yeah.

346
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,000
<i>Hey.
Hey?</i>

347
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,600
Can you put that
away, please?

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Oh!

349
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,300
<i>Right, um...</i>

350
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,800
<i>S.A.R.A.H.,
no video phone in the bathroom!</i>

351
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,500
Any idea what happened
to Wayne Kwan yet?

352
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:23,900
Henry's testing the chili,

353
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,500
and Taggart thinks the fire
was caused by an eclipse.

354
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:28,200
Uh, that's impossible.

355
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:29,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

356
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
He has impressive visuals,
though.

357
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:34,300
Um, anything more
on the man downstairs

358
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:35,500
that Kevin
was talking about?

359
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:36,900
<i>No, I checked Global.</i>

360
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:38,800
<i>Wayne wasn't working
with anyone else.</i>

361
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,100
I don't know, maybe...

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
maybe Kevin did make it up.

363
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:46,300
Huh. Do you have access
to the GD phone records?

364
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:47,300
Yeah. Why?

365
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:49,100
Well, I figure if we can
find out who he was talking to,

366
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,300
it might tell us something.

367
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
All right, hold on
while I pull it up.

368
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,500
All right.
Take your time.

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay, you know what?
Now you're just mocking me.

370
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,500
Uh...

371
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Drive yourself.

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Really?

373
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah,but...

374
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
if you're not home
by 11:00,

375
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,700
you will be sleeping
in a jail cell.

376
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,200
<i>Carter...</i>

377
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm not gonna make her
sleep in a jail cell.

378
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:16,700
She's only 15.

379
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,300
Right.

380
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>Which obviously means
that you don't have a license.</i>

381
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:22,800
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

382
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,900
I won't tell
if you don't.

383
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,100
Well, I was testing you.

384
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,500
And I'm disappointed.
You failed.

385
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,200
Carter, there are a bunch
of calls to a chemist.

386
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,700
Rob Matthew.
But he works in Section Five.

387
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,100
<i>Why would he be talking
to Kevin's therapist?</i>

388
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Nice place.

389
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,100
Yeah, Section Five guys

390
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,100
say they don't get
the best houses.

391
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:48,100
But they do.

392
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,100
Well, I live in
an underground bunker

393
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:51,200
that has more opinions
than my ex-wife.

394
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,100
Hey, I'm thrilled
just to have a window.

395
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,600
Do you smell smoke?

396
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,000
Dr. Matthew?

397
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,300
Is everything okay?

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, Carter.

399
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh, no.

400
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,200
Dr. Matthew?

401
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Guess that would explain
why he didn't answer his phone.

402
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,600
You know, if Taggart's right
about the Phoenix,

403
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:05,800
everyone
could be in danger.

404
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,300
Oh, it's not
the stupid Phoenix.

405
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,000
After everything we've seen,
how can you say for sure?

406
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,900
Well, because Taggart said
the combustion was caused

407
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,300
<i>by meson particles
coming from a solar flare.</i>

408
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm no astrophysicist,
but I don't think

409
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,100
there are a lot of solar flares
inside a house.

410
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,000
He's right.

411
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,500
Really?

412
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,100
Could you not
act so surprised?

413
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,700
<i>Think of it</i>

414
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:26,700
as getting a sunburn.

415
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,400
The sun's rays burn you
from the outside in.

416
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,400
This guy's burned
from the inside out.

417
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:33,100
Now, this is where
the initial combustion happened.

418
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Radiating from here.

419
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:35,700
<i>The frontal lobes.</i>

420
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,900
So their own minds
did this to them?

421
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,200
<i>Yeah, it's like
a power surge</i>

422
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:40,600
in the body's
electrical system.

423
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
Think of the brain
as the microprocessor

424
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:45,600
and the body
as the motherboard.

425
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:48,700
So...then food
would be the energy source.

426
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:51,000
Great--have you tested
Vince's chili yet?

427
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:53,000
Digesting the beans
in the chili

428
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,500
would release methane,

429
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:55,800
which is
extremely flammable.

430
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,100
Except then, the burning would
have started in the GI tract,

431
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,400
and not in the brain.

432
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
So we're back to
they just burst into flames

433
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:03,800
for no apparent reason.

434
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,500
<i>Everything has a reason.</i>

435
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:08,300
We just...haven't
figured it out yet.

436
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Maybe that's the thing
we should be looking for.

437
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,400
<i>(Jo)
What's the thing?</i>

438
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,100
Well, all this time
we've been assuming

439
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,100
that it was an accident.

440
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,900
What if someone had
a reason to want them nt?

441
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,100
That should do it,
Dr. Stark.

442
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
You can't even
see the scars.

443
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah...all better.

444
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Time for your monthly
Botox injection?

445
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,700
Hello, Sheriff.

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
Really?ReNo comeback?

447
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,400
Just not in the mood.

448
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,600
All right.

449
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
There was another
fire last night.

450
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:49,100
This time,
we lost a researcher

451
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,300
named Rob Matthew.

452
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
What the hell's
going on?

453
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:52,900
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

454
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:54,500
Two guys burn to death
within eight hours.

455
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm guessing it's related.

456
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,200
Were they working
on anything together?

457
00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:58,800
I doubt they even
knew each other.

458
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,200
Wayne was an occupational
therapist in Section One.

459
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,800
Dr. Matthew studied
biotechnology in Section Five.

460
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Ah, well, we found a number
of interoffice phone calls between them.

461
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,100
They must be talking
about something.

462
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Can't imagine
what it would be.

463
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm gonna need
a list of names.

464
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:15,400
Anyone they
have contact with.

465
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,100
Friends, family, coworkers,
enemies, all of it.

466
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:19,400
You think someone
did this to them?

467
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:20,800
When something seems
too coincidental,

468
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:21,800
it usually is.

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Dr. Stark is one
of the finest scientists

470
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:26,700
Eureka has ever known.

471
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,600
And I think
that his past contributions

472
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:30,200
should be considered
in your review.

473
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,700
Yet the fact remains
that Dr. Stark's decision

474
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:33,800
to sample the Artifact

475
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,600
cost millions of dollars
in damage,

476
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:38,300
and the life of another
of Eureka's finest scientists.

477
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,300
Eureka is a place
where we push the boundaries

478
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:41,800
of human understanding
every day.

479
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,200
And it is hypocritical
to punish Dr. Stark

480
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:45,400
for doing his job.

481
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Are you speaking
as a D.O.D. liaison or his wife?

482
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ex-wife.

483
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,900
And I believe
that my track record shows

484
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,900
that our personal history
has never interfered

485
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,700
with my professional judgment.

486
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,300
<i>Given the magnitude
of this incident,</i>

487
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,100
I'm afraid the committee
has no choice

488
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:01,100
but to appoint a new head
of Global Dynamics,

489
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:02,400
effective immediately.

490
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,500
Why would anyone
want to kill them

491
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
in such a public way?

492
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Oh, I don't know.

493
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:14,500
I guess that's where this thing
called investigating comes in.

494
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Look, I need to know
who they work with

495
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:17,900
and what kind of research
they were doing.

496
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,500
What's wrong?

497
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,300
Trouble logging in.
System error.

498
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,600
Uh-huh.
Sure you have access?

499
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,800
There's nothing in this facility
I don't have access to.

500
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:28,900
Hey, Allie.

501
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:30,800
Cart--um, Allie?

502
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,400
Oh...

503
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:35,500
I'm trying something
a little less formal.

504
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
I'd prefer you didn't.

505
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:37,700
So would I.

506
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,200
I can't get in the database.
Any idea what's wrong?

507
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,200
<i>Yes.</i>

508
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,800
The committee
has reached a decision.

509
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,200
And you're the messenger?

510
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry, Nathan.

511
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,800
Have they found
my replacement yet?

512
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,600
Actually, they have.

513
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,700
Anyone I know?

514
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>Yes.</i>

515
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,700
Me.

516
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>This isn't right.
I'll say.</i>

517
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,200
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

518
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:13,600
No, I didn't mean that.
I just--

519
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:14,700
I defended you, Nathan.

520
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:15,800
Looks like
you defended me

521
00:24:15,835 --> 00:24:17,300
right into
a promotion for you.

522
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,000
The only reason
you're not being redacted

523
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,200
and escorted
to the city limits

524
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:21,600
is because of me.

525
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,900
So I should be
thanking you?

526
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,100
<i>Guys, bigger issues--
Damn right
you should be.</i>

527
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,600
You were obsessed
with the Artifact,

528
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:27,400
and it cost Kim's life.

529
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,000
I mean, what did you expect?

530
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't know.

531
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Not this.

532
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>Good luck, Allison.</i>

533
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:34,900
Nathan, uh...

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,100
Fine.
What do we do?

535
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, we cross-check anyone
Wayne Kwan or Rob Matthew

536
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:45,600
had in common, to see
if they were targeted.

537
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,700
You okay?

538
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,800
Yeah, let's just, um...

539
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,400
let's just find those names.

540
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:52,000
Sure.

541
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,800
<i>(Carter)
I don't know if this helps,</i>

542
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,200
but I believe things work out
the way they're supposed to.

543
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,900
You just have to have
a little faith.

544
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Yeah, well...

545
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,100
I don't have
a lot of faith these days.

546
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,800
G-go back.
I know that guy.

547
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
<i>That's the guy Wayne
spilled his chili on yesterday.</i>

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
Ryan Brock, biotech,
Section Five.

549
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,300
He worked with Dr. Matthew.

550
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:23,300
What'd they work on?

551
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,300
The origins
of the Artifact.

552
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,100
That thing's
been nothing but trouble.

553
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Tell me about it.

554
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,400
I've seen him
somewhere else too.

555
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:35,600
<i>Hi, this is Allison Blake.</i>

556
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:36,800
<i>Can you send Dr. Brock</i>

557
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,600
up to see me, please?

558
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,100
Really?
When?

559
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,300
Okay, thank you.

560
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,400
He left for the day.
With a fever.

561
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Oh...

562
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,800
Good afternoon,
Dr. Stark.

563
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:53,700
Good afternoon.

564
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,700
Is there a problem?

565
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,000
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

566
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:09,000
For some reason your access
is coming up denied.

567
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's me.

568
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,400
Why don't you just
perform an override?

569
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,300
Regulations require special
authorization for that, sith

570
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
And who would you get
that special authorization from?

571
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:19,200
<i>Well...</i>

572
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
you.

573
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Gotta love the irony.

574
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,900
<i>Hey, Jo, it's Carter.
You copy?</i>

575
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,100
Lupo. What's up?
Over.

576
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,100
<i>Keep your eye out
for a Dr. Ryan Brock.</i>

577
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:33,900
He's gonna be driving...

578
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,800
a black Subaru Forester.

579
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:36,600
<i>What'd Brock do?</i>

580
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:37,800
<i>Uh, more was done to him.</i>

581
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,700
Just like Wayne and Matthew.

582
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:40,700
We might have

583
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,000
<i>We're gonna go
to his house right now.</i>

584
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Got it. Over.

585
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Wait, the...

586
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,100
Wayne.

587
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Scratch that.

588
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:51,600
We're gonna stop
at the dry cleaner.

589
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:52,900
Wait, wait--
how do you know that?

590
00:26:52,935 --> 00:26:55,100
Well, I bumped into Brock
at the dry cleaner

591
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,900
the day we had
our first, uh...

592
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,600
First what?

593
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Nothing.

594
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,900
I just know.
[scoffs]

595
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's Brock.

596
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:19,400
Damn, what's he doing
over there?

597
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,900
Oh, God.

598
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,000
Dr. Brock!
Hey, uh, yeah.

599
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,500
Glad we could catch up with you.
You okay?

600
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,500
He's burning up.
Call the paramedics.

601
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,900
Actually,
I'm not feeling so hot.

602
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,400
Uh, maybe get
a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.

603
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Fire extinguisher?
What's happening to me here?

604
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,000
Uh, we don't know,
but it's the same thing

605
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,000
that happened to Wayne Kwan
and Rob Matthew.

606
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:40,900
Rob too?

607
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah.
Oh, no.

608
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, who would
wanna do this to you?

609
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:46,300
I don't know.
Take a seat.

610
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,500
Ow!

611
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,700
<i>Everyone, clear this area--
now!</i>

612
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,700
Allison!

613
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,500
<i>Over here, this way.</i>

614
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
Roll on the ground!

615
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
<i>(Allison)
Oh, my God.</i>

616
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Carter, you tried
to save him.

617
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:12,800
I screwed up.

618
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,900
If I'd been...
a little sooner, I...

619
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm having trouble
keeping the times straight.

620
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:22,600
Everything's changed.

621
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,000
What are you
talking about?

622
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,800
What's changed?

623
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,100
No, just...something
Henry was saying.

624
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,300
Henry.

625
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,500
What about him?

626
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,400
That's where
I've seen Brock before.

627
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, man.

628
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,900
Hey, Henry.
Whatcha workin' on?

629
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,000
???

630
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,600
What's up?

631
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

632
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,400
And I...sincerely
hope I'm wrong.

633
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:03,400
About what?

634
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
<i>Could you run
the hologram?</i>

635
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,000
Just--there's something
I need to see.

636
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,400
I thought you wanted me
to to leave it off.

637
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,500
Move on and all that.

638
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:12,700
I did, but I just realized
what our victims have in common.

639
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,700
So...turn it on.

640
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,100
<i>Please.</i>

641
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,400
<i>(Carter)
Stop it there.</i>

642
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,600
It's them.

643
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,200
It's Brock and Matthew.

644
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
[chuckles]
Hey, look at that.

645
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,000
You're telling me
you didn't know?

646
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah.

647
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,500
What are you saying?

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,300
I'm saying
that everybody in this room

649
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,000
could be held responsible
for Kim's death.

650
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,700
I ruled out the accident.

651
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,400
I ruled out the eclipse.

652
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,000
I ruled out the chili,

653
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:11,900
or should I say,
you did.

654
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,100
You think
I'm capable of murder?

655
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,500
Well, you risked the universe
for her once.

656
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:16,500
What, is it really
that different?

657
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:17,700
Taking a risk
and taking a life

658
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,000
are two
very different things!

659
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:20,200
And I am incapable
of the latter.

660
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,500
Really?
Even for Kim?

661
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:22,800
Especially for Kim!

662
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,300
What are you working on
over there?

663
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,100
Not what you think.

664
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,900
Well, knowing the lengths
you went to last time

665
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:32,600
to bring her back,
what do you think I think?

666
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,400
Even if I did
blame those men,

667
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,100
what motivation
could I possibly have

668
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,900
to kill Kevin's therapist?

669
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:38,600
He wasn't even there!

670
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,500
You're right.

671
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Unless he was.

672
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,600
<i>We can see
everybody in the room.</i>

673
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
Just...

674
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,500
can you fast forward
this for a second?

675
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
Please.

676
00:30:58,935 --> 00:30:59,800
<i>You don't have to watch it.</i>

677
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:00,600
<i>(Henry)
Yes, I do.</i>

678
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Okay, stop it there.

679
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,000
<i>(Carter)
Can you jump forward</i>

680
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>and show me
the other side of the room?</i>

681
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay.

682
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
This might be
a stupid question,

683
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,000
but what exactly killed her?

684
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,500
A concentrated burst
of particulate radiation.

685
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
<i>Like--like a--</i>

686
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:33,900
A shotgun blast.

687
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Shotgun.

688
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,300
What's on the other side
of this wall?

689
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:40,300
Another lab.

690
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:42,000
You'll have to look
at a building schematic--why?

691
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,700
<i>My first year as a marshal,</i>

692
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,300
I tracked this guy
down to a hotel.

693
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,200
Uh, I kick in
the front door.

694
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:48,400
He comes out
of the bathroom firing,

695
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:49,900
just barely missing me.

696
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,100
But the woman in the next room
wasn't so lucky.

697
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Stray bullet.

698
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,800
Yeah.

699
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,400
We have to find out
if someone

700
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,500
was on the other side
of that wall.

701
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
Does this mean
you believe me now?

702
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

703
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,900
(Allison)
But the lab
behind the blast wall

704
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:14,200
???

705
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,800
Well, not that we know of.
Keep scrolling.

706
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
<i>(Henry)
The radiation from the Artifact</i>

707
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,900
<i>is unlike anything
we've seen before.</i>

708
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:19,700
<i>We don't have equipment</i>

709
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,100
sophisticated enough
to measure it.

710
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:22,100
Which means
that some of it could have

711
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:23,500
passed through the wall
undetected.

712
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,300
There, just, now--who--

713
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,200
who works in that lab?

714
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:28,100
<i>Um...</i>

715
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
<i>Dr. Matthew.</i>

716
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,800
Who was exchanging
frequent phone calls

717
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:34,100
with Kevin's therapist.

718
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,600
Can you tell if anyone
was in there

719
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:37,500
at the time
of the accident?

720
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:40,300
Yeah, uh, each lab
in Section Five

721
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,100
has a biometric
security scanner.

722
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,400
I can pull up
the entry log.

723
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,600
<i>I can't believe it.
It's Wayne.</i>

724
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:47,500
And look at the time code.

725
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:48,900
He should have been
in therapy with Kevin.

726
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:49,900
What was he doing in there?

727
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,800
He was visiting
the man downstairs.

728
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,200
My God, Kevin could have
been in there with him.

729
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:55,200
Wait, where is he now?

730
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:56,900
In session with Beverly,
Section One.

731
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,000
<i>Jack, there was someone else
in the chamber.</i>

732
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,600
Nathan is the last man
standing.

733
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,200
Well, he won't be for long.

734
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:03,600
I'll have security
help you find him.

735
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,100
Get him to cryogenics
while there's still time.

736
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,900
Everything looks fine.

737
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
But we'll keep him
under observation

738
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:05,300
just to be
on the safe side.

739
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,100
Thank you.

740
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,800
They found Dr. Stark.

741
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,500
Uh, can you
watch him, please?

742
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,600
<i>(Henry)
We have to cool him down.</i>

743
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
I was so close.
So close to understanding.

744
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,700
Nathan, stay with me.

745
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,800
????

746
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,400
Gah...

747
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,700
Nathan.

748
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,200
<i>(Henry)
He's overloading,
like the others.</i>

749
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
<i>(Beverly)
It looks like
a massive seizure.</i>

750
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,200
<i>(Henry)
It is.
From what?</i>

751
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,600
Exposure to the Art--

752
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:36,200
Henry!
That's classified.

753
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,900
His temperature's
up to 104.

754
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:43,100
Okay, the seizure's frying
his electrical system.

755
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:44,600
We--can we shut it down?

756
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,700
<i>(Beverly)
You shut down his system,
he dies.</i>

757
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,900
Well, not the whole thing.

758
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,200
Ju t bit of it
that's misfiring.

759
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,800
You know,
like tripping a breaker.

760
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,000
<i>Maybe we can.
How?</i>

761
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:53,800
Fight fire with misfire.
Jack is right.

762
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,100
<i>We don't have to shut down
the circuit,</i>

763
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,100
<i>we just have
to disrupt it.</i>

764
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,100
Great.
How do we do it?

765
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:58,800
Electroshock therapy.
No!

766
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Small silver box.

767
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:01,500
Got it.

768
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:03,400
They used
electroshock therapy

769
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,800
very effectively
to disrupt seizure disorder.

770
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,500
Yes, in dealing
with epilepsy.

771
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:09,000
But we have no idea
how that will affect

772
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:10,500
<i>what's going on
inside of his head!</i>

773
00:35:10,535 --> 00:35:11,800
And we don't have time
to fight about it!

774
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,700
Allison!

775
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,900
He's right.

776
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,000
Are you sure?

777
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,500
Please don't burst
into flames.

778
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,200
I'll do my best.

779
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,300
All right,
hang in there.

780
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,100
Oh, Sheriff.
Didn't know you cared.

781
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,200
Oh, I don't.

782
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,600
You ready?

783
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,000
Henry...

784
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,500
<i>I'm sorry about Kim.</i>

785
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,200
I know.

786
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,700
How are you feeling?

787
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh, like someone
microwaved my brain.

788
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:13,400
But besides that...

789
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,700
Well, your fever topped 106--
we were all...

790
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
<i>really worried.</i>

791
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
Me burst into flames?

792
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm not giving the D.O.D.
the satisfaction.

793
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,500
I really am sorry, Nathan.

794
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,700
Don't be.

795
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,600
<i>They made
the right choice.</i>

796
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,800
You mean that?

797
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,300
Absolutely.

798
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,100
After everything
that's happened,

799
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,700
I don't think
I could do the job anymore.

800
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,400
You might be
just what this place needs.

801
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,700
This place
still needs you too.

802
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,900
<i>Well...</i>

803
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,800
I should probably let you
get some rest.

804
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,300
Nathan, can I
ask you something?

805
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,900
Sure.

806
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,400
What was Kevin's therapist
doing in a lab

807
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,600
in Section Five?

808
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,100
I wish I knew.

809
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,400
Hey, Henry.

810
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,100
Jack.

811
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,400
I hear, um...
Nathan's on the mend.

812
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,300
Oh, sure, rub it in.

813
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,900
<i>Huh.</i>

814
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,300
Allie has thatook.
Had--had that book.

815
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,200
In the other timeline.

816
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,000
You okay?

817
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:46,900
<i>No, you're right.</i>

818
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
Every time I try to make things
happen with Allie

819
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,200
the way they did before,

820
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,400
<i>the more they change.</i>

821
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,600
Tonight was supposed to be
our firs.

822
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>Stark was supposed
to take the job</i>

823
00:37:58,535 --> 00:37:59,500
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

824
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,100
<i>And instead,</i>

825
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:04,200
she's holding his hand,
convincing him to stay.

826
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,300
And, uh...

827
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
sorry I suspected you.

828
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,100
You were just...
following your instincts.

829
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,100
Yeah.
Which were all wrong.

830
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,700
I mean...

831
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
I thought it would
be easier this time around.

832
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,800
I thought, uh,
it'd be fun, you know.

833
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:32,100
Like I could
do things better.

834
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,500
Yeah, um...

835
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
instead, uh, a man died.

836
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,500
And I accused you
of murder.

837
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,500
And the woman I love
is slipping away.

838
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,600
I-I don't know
if I can do this.

839
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,000
Maybe you don't have to.

840
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,600
What--what is that?

841
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,000
<i>It's a modified version
of the memory neutralizer</i>

842
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:05,300
<i>that I designed years ago.</i>

843
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:06,800
The original was like
a shotgun,

844
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:08,000
erasing short-term memory.

845
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
This one erases
long-term memory,

846
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:12,300
but is much more precise.

847
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
It can pinpoint
the neuropathways

848
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:17,400
associated with specific
experiences and time periods.

849
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,900
You wanna erase your memory
from the other timeline?

850
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
<i>I want to erase
our memories.</i>

851
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,400
Whoa.
Jack.

852
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,900
<i>You're my closest friend.</i>

853
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,500
And intellectually,

854
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I know that you had
to prevent me from saving Kim,

855
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:38,000
<i>but emotionally,
I blame you for her death.</i>

856
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:39,700
I can't look at you
without thinking that

857
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:40,700
you're the one
who did this,

858
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,400
that you're the one
who took her away from me.

859
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,200
I wish there had been
another choice.

860
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:47,000
<i>I know.</i>

861
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,700
But the pain that I feel
every day that she'sot here,

862
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:53,800
the--the pain that you feel

863
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,300
knowing that you're not
gonna be with Allison,

864
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,700
that you're not gonna be
meeting the child

865
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:58,900
that you were
having together.

866
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
This takes all that away.

867
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,000
Can we keep some
of the memories?

868
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:10,000
'Cause there was this one time
with Allison--

869
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:10,700
Jack.

870
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm afraid it has to be
all or nothing.

871
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
You're really gonna do this?

872
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,700
We have to.

873
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
And who will go first?

874
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:20,100
I'll make it easy for you.

875
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,300
I hear Nathan's on the mend.

876
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Oh, sure.
Rub it in.

877
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
[chuckles]
Mm.

878
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,600
<i>My head is killing me.</i>

879
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,100
You okay?

880
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,400
Yeah.

881
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,500
What...

882
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Can I borrow this?

883
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,600
Sure.

884
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'll see you later.

885
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,700
And I will never forget.

886
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,500
<i>(Henry)
Good morning, Allison.</i>

887
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,700
Henry.
You look nice.

888
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,300
Going for a job interview?

889
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,700
Actually, I am.

890
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
I, uh,

891
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,800
I wanna work
at Global Dynamics.

892
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
<i>(Beverly)
Congressman Faraday.</i>

893
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,700
According to Nathan Stark,

894
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,900
the Artifact appears
to be dead.

895
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,400
That isn't possible.

896
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,200
<i>I said "appears."</i>

897
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,300
Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.

898
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,200
<i>It had to go somewhere.</i>

899
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,800
Kevin, honey,
dinner's ready.

900
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,300
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

901
