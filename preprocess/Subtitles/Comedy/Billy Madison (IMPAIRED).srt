Is it just you and your dad in here?

622
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:21,902
Well, actually, no. There's Juanita,
and some maids and butlers and stuff.

Well, I can think of three things
I'd like to do.

637
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:42,441
One would involve some ice cubes
and a nine-iron.

- Two would include a buffalo.
- Really?

Live or stuffed.
Preferably stuffed, for safety's sake.

640

some of those ice cubes,...

He's a douchebag.

and then he did that little weasel laugh.

Well, it was tough for me, so back off!

1083
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:30,093
- Sorry. Sorry about that.
- Yahoo, Billy! Billy's number one! Yahoo!

1084
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:33,764
[BILLY] That's nice, buddy.

Yahoo!

Anyways, this hotel stuff
really isn't for me,...

1089
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:51,156
so I decided to step down
as chairman of Madison Hotels...

1090
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:53,951
and give the company to Carl.

1091
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:02,334
I'm gonna go to college.
I'm gonna be a teacher.

Daddy.

01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:13,387
What can I say? I saved the day, I guess.

1095
01:24:13,512 --> 01:24:16,390
I mean, Eric doesn't
take over the company.

1096
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:18,892
Are you sure, this is what you wanna do?

1097
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:21,895
I'm sure, Dad. Thanks for everything.

1098
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:28,026
Max! What can I say, buddy?
You saved my life.

1099
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:31,655
You don't have to say anything.
I'm so proud of you.

1100
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:34,658
But I'm still horny.

1101
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:38,370
All right, man. You're hurting me.

1102
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:45,002
You think he's horny.
