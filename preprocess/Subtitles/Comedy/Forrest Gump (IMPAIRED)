Hello. My name's
Forrest--Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,586
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:36,593
I could eat about a million
and a halfofthese.

4
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,595
My mama always said

5
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:42,394
Iife was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,595
You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,946
Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:00,381
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:02,385
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:08,058
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,559
My feet hurt .

12
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:12,562
Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,566
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,568
Where they're going,

15
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,103
where they've been.

16
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,704
I've worn lots ofshoes.

17
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,584
I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,086
I could remember
my fi rst pair ofshoes.

19
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,886
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere .

20
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,045
[Gump]
Shesaid th ey was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:49,558
All right, Forrest,
Open your eyes now .

22
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,929
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,167
How do those feel?

24
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,878
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,383
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:19,512
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:22,956
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,288
Forrest!

29
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,022
Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,860
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:30,934
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:32,026
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,537
She said we was related
to him in some way.

34
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,038
What he did was,

35
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:40,542
hetarted up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,046
They'd all dress up in their robes
and th eirbed sheets

37
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:48,550
and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:52,554
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:56,683
And, anyway, that'show
I got my name-- Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,092
Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me

41
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:03,098
that sometimes we all
do things that, well,

42
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,600
that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,496
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,725
All right.

45
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,734
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,235
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:26,295
a little boy with braces
on his legs before ?

48
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,974
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,476
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:33,979
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

51
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,982
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

52
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,986
Mama always hada way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:45,522
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

54
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:48,527
about a halfmile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:51,530
That's in the county
of Greenbow.

56
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,032
Our house had been
in Mama's family

57
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:56,160
since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa

58
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:59,672
had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

59
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,106
Since it was just me and Mama

60
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,109
and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,611
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,113
mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:11,776
Iike from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:14,787
That'show me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:17,619
Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,625
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:22,719
You're no different
than anybody else is.

68
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,465
Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?

69
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,968
You're the same
as everybody else.

70
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,970
You are no different.

71
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,702
Your boy's...different,
Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:39,211
His I.Q is 75.

73
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,804
Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:43,144
Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,820
She wan ted me to have
the finest education

76
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,325
so she to ok me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:55,327
I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:58,660
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

79
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,132
Now, this is normal.

80
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:06,195
Forrest is right here .

81
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:09,106
The state require s
a minimum I.Q of 80

82
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,905
to attend public school.

83
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,274
Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:15,246
he's going to have to
go to a special school.

85
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:17,749
Now, he'll bejust fine.

86
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:20,252
What does normal mean anyway ?

87
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,254
He might be...

88
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,449
a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:25,957
but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:28,961
is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,122
He's not going to
some special school

92
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,132
to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,192
We're talking about
five little points here .

94
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,939
There must be something
can be done.

95
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:45,467
We're a progressive
school system.

96
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:48,309
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

97
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:53,148
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,899
He's on vacation.

00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,691
Mama, what's vacation mean?

112
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,025
Vacation?

113
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,861
Where Daddy went?

114
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,532
Vacation's when
you go somewhere...

115
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,204
and you don't ever come back.

116
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,214
Anyway, I guess you could say

117
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,842
me and Mama was on our own.

118
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,885
But we didn't mind.

119
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,387
Our house was never empty.

120
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:18,390
There was always folks
coming and going.

121
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,550
Supper!

122
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,059
It's supper, everyone!

123
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,652
That sure looks special.

124
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:25,562
Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us

125
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:29,068
that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,

126
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,570
folks living
out of their suitcases

127
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:35,074
and hat cases
and sample cases.

128
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:38,839
Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

129
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:41,745
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

130
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,909
and he had him a guitar case.

I told you not to bother

No, that's all right, ma'am.

a thing or two on the guitar.

It must be hard being a king.

163
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,879
You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,

164
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,879
but some things you can't.

165
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:25,415
You do your very best now, Forrest.

166
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,885
I sure will, Mama.

167
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:31,481
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school

168
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:32,889
very well.

169
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:37,827
Are you coming along?

170
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:41,390
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers .

171
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,993
This is the bus to school.

172
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,271
I'm Forrest--
Forrest Gump.

173
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,139
I'm Dorothy Harris.

174
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,645
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore .

175
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:09,089
This seat's taken.

176
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,961
It's taken.

177
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,964
You can't sit here .

178
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,214
You know, it 's funny what
a young man recollects,

179
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,613
'cause I don 't
remember being born.

180
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,085
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

181
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,587
and I don't know

182
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:38,089
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

183
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,591
but I do remember

184
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,652
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

185
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,630
in the wide world.

186
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,634
You can sit here
if you want.

187
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:54,839
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

188
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:57,502
She was like an angel.

189
00:13:57,577 --> 00:14:01,343
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

190
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,477
What's wrong with your legs?

191
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,488
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

192
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:12,354
My legs are just fine and dandy.

193
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:15,360
I just sat next to her
on that bus

194
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:18,363
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

195
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,865
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

196
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:23,562
Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me

197
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,037
or asked me questions.

198
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:28,370
Are you stupid or something?

199
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,501
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

200
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,570
I'm Jenny .

201
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:37,208
I'm Forrest-- Forrest Gump.

202
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:39,718
From that day on,
we was always together.

203
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:42,346
Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.

204
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,358
She taught me how to climb.

205
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,918
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

206
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:52,658
I showed her how to dangle.

207
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:54,256
"A good little..."

208
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,768
She help edme
learn how to read,

209
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:59,930
and I showed her how to swing.

210
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,508
Sometimes, we'd just sitout

211
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:05,875
and wait for the stars.

212
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,414
Mama's going to worry about me.

213
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,382
Just stay a little longer.

214
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:15,547
For some reason,
Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

215
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:18,386
O.K.,Jenny, I'll stay .

216
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:22,758
She was my most special friend.

217
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,728
My only friend.

218
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,403
Now, my mama always told me

219
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,405
that miracles happen every day .

220
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,407
Some people don't think so,

221
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,965
but they do.

222
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,338
Hey, dummy !

223
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,883
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

224
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:46,714
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

225
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,117
Just run away, Forrest.

226
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,554
Run, Forrest!

227
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,717
Run away! Hurry!

228
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,350
Get the bikes!

229
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:56,224
Let's get him! Come on!

230
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:58,093
Look out, Gump!

231
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:01,031
We're going to get you!

232
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,228
Run, Forrest, run!

233
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,328
Run, Forrest!

234
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,264
Come back here, you!

235
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:12,539
Ha ha ha ha ha!

236
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:24,854
Run, Forrest!

237
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:26,516
Run!

238
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,720
Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...

239
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:04,025
but I could run
like the wind blows.

240
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,356
From that day on,

241
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,869
if I was going somewhere ,

242
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:13,303
I was running.

243
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,466
That boy sure
is a running fool.

244
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:54,369
Now, remember how I told you

245
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:57,372
that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

246
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,807
She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

247
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:03,505
Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,

248
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,017
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

249
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,312
Jenny ?

250
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:12,321
He was a very loving man.

251
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:16,553
He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

252
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,329
And then this one time,

253
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:23,332
Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.

254
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,834
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today ?

255
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:28,336
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

256
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,497
Jenny !

257
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,836
Come on!

258
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,843
Jenny, where'd you run to?

259
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,436
You better
get back here, girl!

260
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,580
Where you at?

261
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,354
Jenny !

262
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,288
Jenny, where you at?

263
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,061
Jenny !

264
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,062
Pray with me, Forrest.

265
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,563
Pray with me.

266
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,860
Jenny !

267
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,232
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

268
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,237
far, far away from here .

269
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:07,242
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

270
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,245
Mama always said
God is mysterious.

271
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:11,644
Jenny !

272
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,649
He didn 't turn Jenny
in to a bird that day.

273
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,480
Instead,

274
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,487
he had the police say

275
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:21,991
Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

276
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,492
She was to live
with her grandma,

277
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,495
just over on Creek more Avenue,

278
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:30,556
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

279
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:33,027
Some nights,

280
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:35,036
Jenny'd sneak out

281
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:37,538
and come on over to my house,

282
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:40,041
just'cause
she said she was scared.

283
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:43,101
Scared of what,
I don 't know.

284
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,841
But I think
it was her grandma's dog.

285
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,850
He was a mean dog.

286
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:52,081
Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends

287
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,645
all the way up
through high school.

288
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,090
Hey, stupid!

289
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,127
Quit it!

290
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,627
Run, Forrest, run!

291
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:01,095
Hey ,

292
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:03,189
didn't you hear me, stupid?

293
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,198
Run, Forrest!

294
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,598
Get in the truck!

295
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:09,001
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

296
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:11,540
Run, Forrest! Run!

297
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,240
Ha, ha!

298
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,507
Move it! Move it!

299
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:20,412
You better be runnin'!

300
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:33,894
Yeah!

301
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:36,625
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!

302
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,726
Run, Forrest!

303
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:45,397
Now, it used to be

304
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,410
I ran to get
where I was going.

305
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:51,811
I never thought
it would take me anywhere .

306
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,771
Ohh!

307
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,502
Who in the hell is that?

308
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:25,377
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

309
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,439
Just a local idiot.

310
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,883
And can you believe it ?

311
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,751
I got to go to college, too.

312
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,894
Forrest, move it!

313
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:40,895
Run!

314
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:41,896
O.K. !

315
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,057
Run!

316
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:45,965
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

317
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:01,716
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

318
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,616
Run! Run! Go!

319
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,464
[Whistle Blows]

320
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,437
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive ,

321
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,472
but he sure is fast.

322
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:28,307
Now, maybe it's just me,

323
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:31,438
but college was
very confusing times.

324
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:35,114
Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

325
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:37,448
in tegrated the University
of Alabama today.

326
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,044
Two Negroes were admitted,

327
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:41,056
but only after
Go vern or George Wallace

328
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:43,058
had carried out
his symbolic threat

329
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,560
to stand in the school house door.

330
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,392
I take it from that statement...

331
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,398
Earl, what's going on?

332
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,900
Coons are trying
to get into school.

333
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,904
Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,

334
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:58,406
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

335
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:00,339
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers .

336
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,345
And they want to go
to school with us.

337
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:05,347
With us? They do?

[TV Reporter]
Shortly after Govern or Wallace

339
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,352
had carried out his promise
to block the door way,

340
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,480
Kennedy ordered these cretary
of defense to use military force.

341
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:15,888
Here, by video tape,
is the encounter

342
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,392
by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,

343
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,019
and Govern or Wallace.

344
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,860
Because these National Guardsmen

345
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:26,368
are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,

346
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:28,370
and they live within our borders.

347
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,372
They are our brothers.

348
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,034
We are winning in this fight,

349
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:36,044
because we are awakening
the American people

350
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:40,048
to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times

351
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,050
that is so evident today- -

352
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:45,918
A trend to ward military
dictatorship in this country.

353
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,892
And so, at day's end,

354
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,418
the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

355
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:57,022
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

356
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,968
had been signed up
for summer classes.

357
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,534
Ma'am, you dropped your book.

358
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,199
Ma'am.

359
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:08,709
[Chet Huntley] Govern or Wallace
did what he promised.

360
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:12,373
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...

361
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:13,915
Say, wasn't that Gump?

362
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,008
Naw, that couldn't be.

363
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:19,020
It sure as hell was.

A few years later,

365
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,894
that angry little man
at the school house door

366
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:29,989
thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for president.

367
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:36,098
But somebody thought
that it wasn't.

368
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:38,766
But he didn't die.

369
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,880
My bus is here .

370
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:47,882
Is it the number 9?

371

No, it's the number 4.

372
00:24:49,952 --> 00:24:52,477
It was nice talking to you.

373
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,388
I remember when that happened,

374
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,893
when Wallace got shot.

375
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,326
I was in college.

376
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:02,830
Did you go to a girls' college

or a girls' and boys'
together college?

It was coed.

379

'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

It was a college

of playing football,

493
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:17,845
I got a college degree.

494
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,515
Congratulations, son.

495
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,717
Mama was so proud.

496
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,224
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

497
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:27,888
I'll hold this for you.

498
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:30,057
Congratulations, son.

499
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,727
Have you given any thought
to your future ?

500
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,272
Thought?

501
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,441
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

502
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,101
Nobody gives a horse's shit

503
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,770
who you are, pus ball!

504
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:45,610
You're not even a lowlife ,
scum-sucking maggot!

505
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:47,946
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

506
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:49,451
You're in the army now !

507
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,282
Seat's taken.

508
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:54,615
Taken.

509
00:31:57,694 --> 00:32:00,595
At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.

510
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:02,598
It was only
my induction day,

511
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,725
and I was getting yelled at.

512
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:10,899
Sit down if you want to.

513
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,238
I didn't know who I might meet

514
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,743
or what they might ask.

515
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:17,575
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

516
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,410
No.

517
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:22,246
But I been on a real big boat.

518
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,254
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

519
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:28,257
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life .

520
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,589
I started out
on my uncle's boat

521
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,594
when I was about maybe 9.

522
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:35,597
I was just looking
into buying my own boat

523
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:37,599
and got drafted.

524
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,932
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

525
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:43,268
People call me Bubba,

526
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,774
just like one of them
old red neck boys.

527
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,104
Can you believe that?

528
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,270
My name's Forrest Gump.

529
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:51,610
People call me Forrest Gump.

530
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:54,616
So Bubba was from
Bayou La Ba tre, Alabama,

531
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,413
and his mama cooked shrimp.

532
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,754
And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,

533
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:04,419
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

534
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,257
Bubba's family knew everything

535
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,763
there was to know about
the shrimping business.

536
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,096
I know everything
there is to know

537
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,429
about the shrimping business.

538
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:14,936
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

539
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,269
after I get out ofthe army .

540
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,165
O.K.

541
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,506
Gump!

542
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:25,173
What's your sole purpose
in this army ?

543
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,682
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

544
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:31,346
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

545
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,855
That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard .

546
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,518
You must have
a goddamn l.Q Of 160.

547
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:39,187
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

548
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,694
Listen up, people!

549
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:45,701
Now for some reason,
I fit in the army

550
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:47,703
Like one of them round pegs.

551
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,033
It's not really hard.

552
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,039
You just make your bed neat,

553
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:52,540
remember to stand up straight,

554
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:54,201
and always answere very question

555
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:56,211
with "Yes, Drill Sergeant. "

556
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,712
Is that clear?

557
00:33:57,781 --> 00:34:00,045
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

558
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:03,552
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

559
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,882
On a good day ,

560
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,890
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

561
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,220
Everything goes all right,

562
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,055
2 men shrimping 10 hours ,

563
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,220
Less what you spends on gas--

564
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,389
Done, Drill Sergeant!

565
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:16,898
Gump!

566
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:21,403
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

567
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,405
You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.

568
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:25,065
Jesus H. Christ.

569
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,075
This is a new company record .

570
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,576
If it wasn't a waste

571
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,078
of a fine enlisted man,

572
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,580
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

573
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:34,913
You're going to be
a general someday !

574
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,919
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

575
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,923
Anyway, like I was saying,

576
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:43,255
shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.

577
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:46,591
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

578
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:48,096
bake it, saute it.

579
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:51,258
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

580
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:55,270
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

581
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:56,600
stir fried.

582
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,436
There's pineapple shrimp

583
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:01,375
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

584
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:02,570
pepper shrimp,

585
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:05,079
shrimp soup, shrimp stew ,

586
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:06,740
shrimp salad,

587
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,579
shrimp in potatoes,

588
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,084
shrimp burger,

589
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,916
shrimp sandwich.

590
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,250
That--That's about it.

591
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:23,660
Night time in the army
is alonely time.

592
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,167
We'd lay there in our bunks,

593
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,670
and I'd miss my mama,

594
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,332
and I'd miss Jenny.

595
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,678
Hey, Gump.

596
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,340
Get a load of the tits on her.

597
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:53,528
Turns out...

598
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:55,689
Jenny had gotten
in to some trouble

599
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:59,030
over some photos of her
in her college sweater.

600
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:01,297
And she was
thrown out of school.

601
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,534
# My baby does the hanky panky #

602
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:07,041
But that wasn't a bad thing,

603
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,544
'cause a man who owns a theater

604
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:11,045
in Memphis, Tennessee,

605
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:12,706
saw those photos

606
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:16,548
and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

607
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,712
The first chance I got,

608
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:21,052
I took the bus up to Memphis

609
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:23,388
to see her perform in that show.

610
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,893
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

611
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,394
Give her a big hand.

612
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:29,398
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure ,

613
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,229
direct from Hollywood,
California,

614
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:33,064
our very own beatnik beauty .

615
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:35,400
Let's give a big round of applause

616
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:37,235
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

617
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:52,251
# How many roads
must a man walk down #

618
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:57,692
# Before you can
call him a man? #

619
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,960
# Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail #

620
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:05,967
Her dream had come true.

621
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:07,969
# Before she sleeps
in the sand? #

622
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:09,868
She was a folk singer.

623
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:13,033
# Yes, and how many times #

624
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:16,169
# Must the cannon balls fly #

625
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:20,842
# Before they're
fo rever banned? #

626
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,248
Shake it up now .

627
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:23,751
Somebody get her a harmonica.

628
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,549
# The answer, my friend #

629
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:27,385
# Is blowin' in the wind ##

630
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:28,890
This ain't Captain Kangaroo.

631
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,722
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

632
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:33,853
Hey! God damn it!

633
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,194
Hey, you stupid jerk!

634
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:38,029
I'm singing a song here .

635
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:42,537
Polly, get out here !

636
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:45,039
Shut up yourself!

637
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:46,575
Just shut up!

638
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:52,080
Forrest! What are you
doing here ?

639
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:53,479
What are you doing?

640
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,482
- Hey !
- Aw !

641
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:56,314
What are you doing, Forrest?

642
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,411
Let me down!

643
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:01,013
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!

644
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,451
Ha ha ha!

645
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,018
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

646
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,521
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

647
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,386
They was trying to grab you.

648
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,790
A lot of people try to grab me.

649
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,853
Just--You can't keep
doing this all the time.

650
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:19,458
I can't help it.
I love you.

651
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,798
Forrest--

652
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,838
You don't know what love is.

653
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:33,514
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

654
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,352
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

655
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,354
so I could fly far away .

656
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,182
Yes, I do.

657
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:48,595
You think I could
fly off this bridge?

658
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,863
What do you mean,Jenny ?

659
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,305
Nothing.

660
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:08,645
I got to get out of here .

661
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:11,978
Wait, Jenny .

662
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:14,487
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O.K. ?

663
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:16,490
You stay away from me, please.

664
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:17,991
Can I have a ride?

665
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,321
Where are you going?

666
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,486
I don't care .

667
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:21,790
Get in the truck.

668
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:24,058
So bye-bye,Jenny .

669
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:28,334
They sending me to Vietnam.

670
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:32,871
It's this whole other country.

671
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,207
Just hang on a minute.

672
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,715
Listen, you promise me
something, O.K. ?

673
00:39:41,783 --> 00:39:43,717
Just if you're
ever in trouble,

674
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,047
don't be brave .

675
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,055
You just run, O.K. ?
Just run away .

676
00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:49,488
O.K.

677
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:55,992
Jenny .

678
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,660
I'll write you all the time.

679
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,050
Andjust like that,
she was gon e.

680
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,813
Andjust like that,
she was gone.

681
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,501
You come back safe to me.

682
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:32,002
Do you hear?

683
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,182
# Some folks are born #

684
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,522
# Made to wave the flag #

685
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:58,859
# Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue #

686
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:02,458
# And when the band play s
"Hail To The Chief" #

687
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:06,129
# Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you #

688
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:07,968
# It ain't me #

689
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,974
# It ain't me #

690
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:13,136
# I ain't no senator's son #

691
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,975
# It ain't me ##

692
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,480
Now they told us

693
00:41:16,548 --> 00:41:19,483
that Vietnam was going
to be very different

694
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,576
from the United States
of America.

695
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:25,749
Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,

696
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:27,587
it was.

697
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:40,430
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters .

698
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:43,441
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

699
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:45,443
After we win this war

700
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,138
and we take over everything,

701
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:49,476
we can get American
shrimpers out here

702
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,810
and shrimp these waters .

703
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,817
Just shrimp all the time, man.

704
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,818
You must be my FNGs.

705
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,982
Morning, sir.

706
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,582
Oh, get your hands down.

707
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,092
Do not salute me.

708
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,595
There are goddamn snipers
all around this are a

709
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:06,756
who'd love
to grease an officer.

710
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:10,097
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

711
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:12,928
What's wrong with your lip?

712
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:16,270
I was born with big gums, sir.

713
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:18,434
Well, you better tuck that in.

714
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,944
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire .

715
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:24,615
Where are you boy s
from in the world?

716
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:25,775
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

717
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:27,986
You twins?

718
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:32,816
No. We are not relations, sir.

719
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,155
Look,

720
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:37,559
it's pretty basic here .

721
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,892
You stick with me

722
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:41,398
and learn from the guys

723
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:43,401
who've been in country a while,

724
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:44,731
you'll be all right.

725
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:47,067
There is one item of G.I. gear

726
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,233
that can be the difference
between life and death--

727
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,367
Socks .

728
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,468
Cushioned sole, O.D. green.

729
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:55,376
Try and keep your feet dry.

730
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,881
When we're out humpin',
change your socks

731
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,144
whenever we stop.

732
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:01,482
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet

733
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:02,986
right off his legs.

734
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:04,488
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

735
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:06,990
where's that sling rope
I said to order?

736
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:08,492
I put in the requisitions.

737
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,824
Well, you call
those sons of bitches--

738
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,989
Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

739
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:16,000
I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.

740
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:19,731
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

741
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,330
Somebody in his family
had fought

742
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:23,874
and died

743
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:25,534
in every...

744
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:26,737
single...

745
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,905
American war.

746
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,915
God damn it, kick some ass.

747
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,245
Get on it!

748
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:33,750
I guess you could say

749
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,253
he had a lot to live up to.

750
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:39,256
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

751
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:40,416
Well,

752
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,255
I been through there .

753
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:45,091
Little Rock's a fine town.

754
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,927
Now, shake down your gear.

755
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,261
See the platoon sergeant.

756
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,097
Draw what you need
for the field.

757
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,603
If you boys are hungry,

758
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,435
we got steaks burning
right over here .

759
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,271
Two standing orders
in this platoon--

760
00:43:58,343 --> 00:44:00,868
1 --take care of your feet,

761
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:04,541
2--try not to do
anything stupid,

762
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:06,208
Like getting
yourself killed.

763
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:14,982
I sure hope I don't
let him down.

764
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:29,106
I got to see
a lot of the country side.

765
00:44:29,174 --> 00:44:31,574
We would take
these real long walks.

766
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,579
# There must be
some kind of way #

767
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,740
# Out of here #

768
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:39,909
# Said the joker
to the thief#

769
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,418
And we were always lookin '

770
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:43,420
for this guy named Charlie.

771
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:45,080
# There's too much confusion #

772
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:49,255
# I can't get no relief##

773
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,922
Hold it up!

774
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:54,431
Hold up, boys!

775
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:59,027
It wasn't always fun.

776
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,369
Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings

777
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:05,535
about a rock or a trail
or the road,

778
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,546
so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.

779
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:09,706
Get down!

780
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,873
Shut up!

781
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,212
So we did.

782
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:33,000
Now I don't know
much about anything,

783
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:36,006
but I think some of
America's best young men

784
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:37,336
served in this war.

785
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,673
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

786
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,843
Cleveland- -
he was from Detroit.

787
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:45,143
Hey, Tex .

788
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:46,707
Hey, Tex .

789
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,377
What the hell's going on?

790
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:50,648
And Tex was- -

791
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:53,316
Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from--

792
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:54,916
Ah, nothing.

793
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,855
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

794
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:03,833
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

795
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:05,494
Move out.

796
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,004
1, 2! Hup!

797
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:10,841
Step it up!

798
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:12,240
Look alive out there .

799
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,744
The good thing about Vietnam

800
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,076
is there was always
someplace to go.

801
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,410
Fire in the hole!

802
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,580
Gump, check out that hole.

803
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,590
And there was always
something to do.

804
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,750
Mount'em up!

805
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,623
Spread out!
Cover his back!

806
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,294
One day it started raining,

807
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:40,702
and it didn't quit for four months.

808
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:44,208
We've been through
every kind of rain there is- -

809
00:46:44,276 --> 00:46:46,904
little bitty stinging rain

810
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,880
and big old fat rain,

811
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:53,737
rain that flew in side ways,

812
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,531
and sometimes rain even seemed

813
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,938
to come straight up
from underneath.

814
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:02,536
Shoot, it even rained at night.

815
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,375
Hey, Forrest.

816
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,539
Hey, Bubba.

817
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,879
I'm going to lean up against you.

818
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,384
You lean up against me.

819
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,716
This way we don't have to sleep

820
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,722
with our heads in the mud.

821
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,384
You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?

822
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,724
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

823
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,559
like brothers and stuff.

824
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,058
Hey, Forrest,

825
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,228
something I been thinking about.

826
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:30,238
I got a very important
question to ask you.

827
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,909
How would you like to go

828
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,911
into the shrimping
business with me?

829
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,742
O.K.

830
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,578
Man, I tell you what.

831
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,914
I got it all figured out, too.

832
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:44,419
So many pounds of shrimp

833
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,920
will pay off the boat.

834
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,422
So many pounds for gas.

835
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,424
We'll live right on the boat.

836
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,756
We ain't got to pay no rent.

837
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,762
We can just work it together,

838
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,764
split everything right
down the middle.

839
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,925
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

840
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,027
Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

841
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,199
That's a fine idea.

842
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:08,039
Bubba did have a fine idea.

843
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:12,710
I even wrote Jenny

844
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:14,716
and told her all about it.

845
00:48:14,784 --> 00:48:16,376
I sent her letters- -

846
00:48:16,453 --> 00:48:18,546
Not every day, but almost.

847
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:20,885
I told her what I was doing

848
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:23,391
and asked her what she was doing

849
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,653
and told her how
I thought about her always.

850
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:29,955
And how I was looking forward

851
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:31,957
to getting a letter from her

852
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:34,789
just as soon
as she had the time.

853
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:37,796
I'd always let her know
that I was O. K.

854
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:45,293
Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump. "

855
00:48:55,214 --> 00:48:57,978
# There's somethin'
happenin' here #

856
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,914
This one day, we was out
walking like always,

857
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:06,755
and then, just like that,

858
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:08,760

We're going to move
back to the blue line.

Run, God damn it! Run!

884
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:55,850
I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.

885
00:50:58,596 --> 00:51:00,791
I ran so far so fast

886
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:03,299
that pretty so on
I was all by myself,

887
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,960
which was a bad thing.

888
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:06,128
Bubba.

889
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,799
Bubba was my best good friend.

890
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,309
I had to make sure he was O.K.

891
00:51:22,387 --> 00:51:24,821
Where the hell are you?

892
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,982
Bubba!

893
00:51:27,058 --> 00:51:29,993
And on my way
back to find Bubba,

894
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:32,825
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

895
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:33,886
Tex.

896
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,425
O.K.

897
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:39,936
I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,

898
00:51:40,004 --> 00:51:41,437
scared the way he was,

899
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,269
so I grabbed him up

900
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:45,070
and run him out of there.

901
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,021
Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

902
00:52:03,094 --> 00:52:04,527
somebody else was saying,

903
00:52:04,595 --> 00:52:07,530
"Help me, Forrest, help me! "

904
00:52:14,105 --> 00:52:16,266
O.K. Here. Here .

905
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:21,545
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.

906
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:28,408
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

907
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:29,919
I know my position

908

is danger close!

909
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:34,390
We got Charlie
all over this area.

910
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:37,394
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

914
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,902
God damn it!

915
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,904
What are you doing?

916
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,405
You leave me here !

917
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:51,408
Get away .
Just leave me here !

918
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:52,909
Get out!

919
00:52:52,977 --> 00:52:56,913
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

920
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:59,347
LegLima, this is Strong-arm.

to leave me there, Gump.

Forget about me.
Get your self out!

Get your ass out of here .

I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

934
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:42,592
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

935
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,093
To get Bubba.

936
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:47,097

the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,

something better to say.

990
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,833
Gump!

991
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,528
I'm Forrest Gump.

992
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:02,237

00:58:21,407 --> 00:58:24,376
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

997
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,616
Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?

998
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,116
Turn it off.

999
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:34,619
You are tuned
to the American forces

1000
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,120
Vietnam network.

1001
00:58:36,189 --> 00:58:37,747
This is channel 6, Saigon.

1002
00:58:40,193 --> 00:58:41,854
Good catch, Gump.

1003
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:45,596
You know how to play this?

1004
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,668
Come on. Let me show you.

1005
00:58:51,204 --> 00:58:53,638
Now, the secret to this game is

1006
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:55,640
no matter what happens,

1007
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:58,142
never, ever...

1008
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,304
take your eye off the ball.

1009
00:59:03,216 --> 00:59:04,478
All right.

1010
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,153
For some reason,

1011
00:59:09,222 --> 00:59:11,656
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

1012
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:12,884
See?

1013
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:15,154
Any idiot can play .

1014
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:18,664
So I started playing it
all the time.

1015
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:20,358
I played Ping-Pong

1016
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:24,028
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

1017
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:33,811
The hospital's people

1018
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:37,815
said it made me look
like a duck in water- -

1019
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:39,316
Whatever that means.

1020
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:42,616
Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

1021
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,785
I played Ping-Pong so much,

1022
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,686
I even played it in my sleep.

1023
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:00,729
Now...

1024
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,231
you listen to me.

1025
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,233
We all have a destiny .

1026
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:07,737
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

1027
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:10,797
I should have died
out there with my men,

1028
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:14,867
but now...l'm nothing
but a god damn cripple,

1029
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,640
a legless freak!

1030
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,806
Look. Look! Look at me!

1031
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,315
You see that?

1032
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,249
Do you know what it's like

1033
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,311
not to be able to use your legs?

1034
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,383
Y-Y -Yes, sir, I do.

1035
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,594
Did you hear what I said?

1036
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,531
You cheated me!

1037
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,034
I had a destiny .

1038
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,628
I was supposed
to die in the field

1039
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:42,899
with honor!

1040
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,702
That was my destiny ,

1041
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:47,744
and you...
cheated me out of it!

1042
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:58,652
You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1043
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,219
This wasn't supposed
to happen--

1044
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,091
Not to me.

1045
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,155
I had a destiny .

1046
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,727
I was...

1047
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:14,566
Lieutenant...

1048
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,367
Dan Taylor.

1049
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:23,179
Y-You still

1050
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,908
Lieutenant Dan.

1051
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:48,704
Look at me.

1052
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,708
What am I going to do now ?

1053
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:58,077
What am I going to do now ?

1054
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,418
PFC Gump?

1055
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:13,024
Yes, sir!

1056
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,495
As you were .

1057
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:16,724
Son,

1058
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,260
you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

1059
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:21,623
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1060
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,425
They want to give me a med--

1061
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,138
Ma'am.

1062
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,640
What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

1063
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,573
They sent him home.

1064
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:46,584
Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.

1065
01:02:46,654 --> 01:02:48,144
The ceremony was kicked off

1066
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,315
with a can did speech
by the presiden t

1067
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:54,828
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.

1068
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:58,831
Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.

1069
01:02:58,899 --> 01:03:00,799
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

1070
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:04,670
I understand you were wounded.

1071
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:06,672
Where were you hit ?

1072
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,332
In the but-tocks, sir.

1073
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,343
Well, that must be a sight.

1074
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,175
I'd kinda like to see that.

1075
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:17,013
# And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson #

1076
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:20,144
#Jesus loves you more
than you will know #

1077
01:03:21,355 --> 01:03:23,721
# Whoa, whoa, whoa #

1078
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:27,124
# God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson ##

1079
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:28,855
God damn, son!

1080
01:03:30,698 --> 01:03:34,134
After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,

1081
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:38,137
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

1082
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,139
Hi lary! I got the vets.

1083
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:43,005
What do you want
to do with them?

1084
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:45,637
It's a good thing
Mama was resting,

1085
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:48,648
'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people

1086
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:51,651
lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,

1087
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:54,654
and some of them people
were loud and pushy.

1088
01:03:54,722 --> 01:03:56,553
O.K., follow me!

1089
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,923
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

1090
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:07,792
Come on.

1091
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:08,857
Go!

1092
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:21,112
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.

1093
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:22,546
Good.

1094
01:04:22,616 --> 01:04:24,106
O.K.

1095
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:27,119
There was this man
giving a little talk.

1096
01:04:27,187 --> 01:04:28,620
And for some reason,

1097
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:31,624
he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.

1098
01:04:33,193 --> 01:04:37,129
And he liked to say
the "F" word...a lot.

1099
01:04:37,197 --> 01:04:39,461
"F" this and "F" that.

1100
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:42,502
And every time
he said the "F" word,

1101
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:45,629
people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.

about the war, man.

There was only one thing
