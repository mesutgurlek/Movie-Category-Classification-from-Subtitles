1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,116
Three card brag
is a simple form of poker.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,077
You get three cards only.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,153
And these you can't change.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,676
If you don't look at them,
you're a blind man,

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,194
you only put in half the stake.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,714
Three of any kind
is the highest,

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,670
but the odds are 450-1
against getting any three.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,392
Then there's a running flush,
all the same suit, all in order,

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,679
then a straight
and a flush and a pair,

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,515
and finally, whatever
the highest card you've got.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,990
Now, there are some telltale
signs that can help,

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,392
but they took me long enough
to learn so I'm not telling you.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,031
They can only help a player,
not make one.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,317
So, d'you wanna play?

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,149
Let's sort the buyers
from the spiers

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,630
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,756
If you can't see value here,

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,559
you're not shopping,
you're shoplifting.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,518
You see these goods?
Never seen daylight, moonlight,

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,989
Israelites,
Fanny by the gaslight.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,958
Take a bag, come on.
I took one home last night -

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,235
cost more than ten pound,
I can tell you.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,709
Anyone like jewellery?
Look at that one.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,473
Hand-made in Italy,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,233
It's as long as my arm,
not like something else.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,834
Don't think 'cause these boxes
are sealed, they're empty.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,876
0nly the undertaker
sells empty boxes.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,953
By the look of you lot, I'd make
more money with my tape-measure.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,996
Here, one price, ten pound.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,469
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,515
Bargain. I'll take one.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,591
Squeeze in. Left leg, right leg.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,033
They call it walking.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,953
You want one, darling?
That's it, they're waking up.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,759
Treat the wife -
treat somebody else's wife.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,513
It's more fun
if you don't get caught.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,034
You want one?
Show me a bit of life, then.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,396
It's no good standing
like one o'clock half struck.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,438
These are not stolen -
they're just not paid for.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
Can't get 'em again,
they've changed the locks.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,514
Can't come back -
I'll have sold out.

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,794
[Punter] Nice bit of stuff.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,316
"Too late" will be the cry
when the bargains pass you by.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,992
If you've no money on you,

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,196
you'll cry tears
big as 0ctober cabbages.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,191
Bacon, cozzers!

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,391
# So I said I'm on the roam
So I need a car

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,313
# And I know
that I'm getting alive

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,119
# And I say I got faith
in a season #

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,992
'Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,196
'But his real talent
lies in cards -

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,713
'and gambling with cards.

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,478

55

I'm bloody skinny, pal.

'Course you are. All right, Ed?

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,757
Nick the Greek, a pleasure.
Tom, what have you eaten?

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,876
- I was telling him...
- Enough!

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,837
You two, join me in my office.

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,711
So how much is it, Tom?

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,199
You know how much, Nick.

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,953
- And that includes the amp?
- No.

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,632
That does not include the amp.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,431
Shit, Tom. I thought
it included the amp.

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,035
It doesn't. I'll throw in
one of these telephones,

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,873
but it does not include the amp.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,837
Very nice.

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,239
I hope it includes the speakers.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,517
It doesn't include
the speakers or the amp.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,034
It's not supposed to include
me getting the hump

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,554
with your questions.
You want it, you buy it.

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,914
What else do I get?

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,719
A gold-plated Rolls Royce,
if you pay for it.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,075
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,073
Seems... this seems
to be a waste of my time.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,628
That is 900 nicker
in any shop,

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,631
and you're complaining
about 200?

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,517
What school of finance
did you study?

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,875
It's a deal, it's a steal.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,996
It's the sale
of the fucking century.

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,514
In fact, I'll keep it.

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,511
All right, keep your alans on.

85
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,509
Here's a ton.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,953
[Both] Jesus Christ!

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,474
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that.

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,073
You're haggling over 100 pound.

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,435
What d'you do when
you're not buying stereos -

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,839
finance revolutions?

91
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,911
£100 is still £100.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,070
Not when the price is £200.

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,038
Not when you've got Liberia's
deficit in your sky rocket.

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,395
Tighter than a duck's butt!

95
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,040
Let me feel
the fibre of your fabric.

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,632
'The skinny one is Tom.

97

That's my 25 grand.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,269
It took me a long time to earn,
so treat it with respect.

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,509
What about the chef?

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,760
What've you come as?

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,910
Cupid, stupid.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,753
That's the last time
I get fruit off you, Tom.

110
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,879
There was more small armoured
things in it than fruit.

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,315
You should open a butchers,
not a grocers.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,152
If you order stuff
from Kathmandu,

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,073
don't be surprised
if it picks up a few tourists.

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,549
Anyway, enough.
Where's the money?

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,269
Keep your fingers
out of my soup!

116

sensible side of the four.'

120

Are you sure you can afford 25?

121
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,951
It depends
how you look at it.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,600
I can afford it
if I see it again.

123

Got the rest from
the fat man and Bacon?

Looks like it's time
to call Harry.

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,790
For 25 grand invested,
going on experience.

157
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,233
Going on optimism.

158
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,993
Whatever - it'll be enough
to send you on a cooking course.

159
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,516
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat -

160
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,716
and look as though you
should be, but you're not.

161
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,109
Fat! Who you calling...
Jesus!

162
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
It's good here, innit?
Handy for the tube,

163
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,717
great electrics - I can
see why you moved in.

164
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,837
Don't knock it, it's "cheep",
like the budgie.

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,514
Nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

- What d'you mean?

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,271
He means they're
thieving bastards.

168
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,477
When they're not picking
peanuts out of poop,

169
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,075
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their drugs.

170
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,272
Not exactly thick, these walls.

171
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,955
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,912
Is that it?

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,797
How many times
do I have to tell you, Plank?

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,111
Find a job worth doing, you'll
find your share improving.

175
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,395
Have you got a problem
with that?

176

guns and ammunition #

178
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,030
Charles, this gear
is getting heavier.

179
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,477
I've a suspicion we should have
been rocket scientists or...

180
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,235
Nobel Peace Prize winners...
something.

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,995
Peace Prize? Be lucky
to find your penis for a piss -

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,036
the amount you smoke.

183

[Door buzzer]

Who the hell's that?

185
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,871
All right, Willie?

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,191
Does it look like I am?
Take this.

187
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,597
I'm in danger of breaking
a sweat any second.

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,194
< Charles,
why've we got that cage?

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,918
Security.

190
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,270
That's right. Security.

191
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,989
What's the point in having it if
we're not gonna fucking use it?

192
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,878
I would've used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

193
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,428
- And Willie lives here.
- Yes, Charles.

194
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,115
But you didn't know it was
until you opened the door.

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,715
Chill, Winston. It's me.

196
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,997
Charlie knows it's me,
what's the problem?

197
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,674
The problem is, Willie,
Charles and yourself

198
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,716
are not the quickest cats
at the best of times.

199
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,998
So do as I say and keep
the fucking cage locked!

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,349
- What is that?
- That's Gloria.

201
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,034
I know that's Gloria.
What's that?

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,269
Fertiliser.

203
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,352
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter.

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,556
You come back with
a semi-conscious Gloria

205
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,392
and a bag of fertiliser.

206
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,438
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

207
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,431
We need fertiliser, Winston.

208
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,476
We also need a money counter.

209
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,391
This money's gotta
be out by Thursday.

210
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,311
I'm buggered
if I'm gonna count it.

211
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,552
If you do have to buy
sodding fertiliser,

212
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,949
could you be
a little more subtle?

213
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,712
What do you mean?

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,709
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

215
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,472
Yeah.

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,236
And you're carrying a wasted
girl and a bag of fertiliser.

217
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,915
You don't look your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,558
That's what I mean, Willie.

- About... 20 minutes.

224
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,274
- Is he on his own?
- Yeah, carrying a bag.

225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,197

shall we?

Aaagh!

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,270
I've got some bad news
for you, John.

What the fuck!

236

That includes blasphemy.
Now tell me, John,

239
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,873
how can you concentrate
on improving this tan -

240
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,757
and it is a lovely tan -

241
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,876
when you've got more pressing
priorities at hand?

242
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,069
Tell Harry...

243
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,188
Did I say speak?
And it's Mr Harry to you.

244
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,395
Now, don't disappoint me, choose
your words very carefully.

245
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,357
You may now...

246
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,793
speak.

247
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,314
Tell Harry, I mean Mr Harry,

248
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,994
I've been busy,
I'm nearly there.

249
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,116
Check his locker, son.

250
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,193
I don't suppose there's a chance
of you lifting this up, Chris?

251
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,355
He's not poor! He's got
over a monkey in his wallet!

252
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,558
Fuckin' hell, John, you go round
with that in your pocket?

253
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,076
Use language like that again,
you'll wish you hadn't!

254
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,513
Sorry, Dad.

255
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,953
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

256
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,840
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight.

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,674
By the time this tan's faded
you wanna have paid.

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,877
- You never would've paid.
- Who would pay for shit?

260
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,712
Exactly. We had to...

261
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,477
What the hell
are you doing here?

have anything to do with that.

he get a hundred grand?

He's got adhesive mates -
like brothers.

271

They've tossed up
between 'em.

No mortgage, no debts.

Lock, stock - the fucking lot.

275
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,232
Don't worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

276
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,153
Good. You can get this
under control now.

complete muppets.

284
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,520

what they're worth, Barry.

Antiques! What the fuck
do we know about antiques?

[Bacon] This geezer, Smithy
Robinson, worked for Harry.

It was rumoured
that he was on the take.

for an explanation.

do a very good job.

a 15-inch black rubber cock.

He then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

That was seen as
a pleasant way to go.

627
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,436
You sell it with...

628
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,353
"Does what no other
dildo can do until now.

629
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,635
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology.

630
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,392
"Guaranteed results."
All that bollocks.

631
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,199
These dils cost 25 quid a pop -

632
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,078
a snip for the pleasure
they'll give the recipients.

633
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,993
They send their cheques
to the other company name.

634
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,551
Not offensive, "Bobby's Bits"
or something, for 25 quid.

635
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,108
You stick it in the bank
until it clears.

636
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,872
This is the smart bit.

637
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,714
You send back the cheque
for 25 pound

638
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,518
from the other company name -

639
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,716
"Arse Ticklers Faggots
Fan Club" - saying we're sorry,

640
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,032
we couldn't get supplies from
America - they ran out of stock.

641
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,793
You see how many people
cash that cheque.

642
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,672
Not a single soul.

643
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,548
Who wants their bank manager
to know they tickle arse?

644
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,154
How long do you
have to wait for a return?

645
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,037
< Probably
no more than four weeks.

646
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,672
What good is that if we need it
in six - no, five days?

647
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,113
Well, it's still a good idea.

648
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,991
All right, I got one.

649
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,915
Look, he set us up,

650
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,034
which means he put money in.

651
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,350
Which means
he expects money out.

652
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,954
Don't have to be an economist
to work that out.

653
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,715
He may know we smoke a lot,
burn a bit of profit,

654
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,472
but he can't have any idea

655
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,676
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

656
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,469
I don't know. Do you know?

657
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,075
We can just...
slice it off the top.

658
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,277
You guys have got
to realise who this chap is.

659
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,909
He might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

660
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,310
If he gets an inkling we're not
throwing straight dice,

661
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,628
we're gonna know

662
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,429
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

663
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,275
Yeah, but we're in this
for the cash however it comes.

664
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,918
So you know these geezers well?

665
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,390
[Plank] Well enough - I bought
gear off 'em for years.

666
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,711
- What they like, then?
- Poofs! Nothing heavy.

667
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,758
Four public school boys,
soft as shite.

668
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,229
And you keep all the money.

669
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,276
I've heard some
stupid fuckin' ideas

670
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,828
but yours makes
Bacon's sound inspired.

671
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,474
[Plank] They ponce around
in hippy clothes all day

672
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,154
talking bollocks - they're
just good at growing weed.

673
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,674
Business got bigger
than what they can handle.

674
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,796
[Dog] They can't all be stupid.

675
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,634
They got a container load
of cash in shoe boxes,

676
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,994
they sell class A gear -

677
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,674
someone sensible
must be involved.

678
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,352
What about security?

679
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,795
[Plank]
There's a gate they never lock.

680
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,952
What d'you mean never lock?
Why've they got it, then?

681
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,600
I must've been there 50 times -
it's never locked.

682
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,274
They're not suspicious. Everyone
that goes there's a toff.

683
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,759
They're into that karma crap -

684
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,831
"I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me."

685
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,150
No way they can get back to you?

686
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,515
They'd be too scared -
I'm a geezer.

687
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,034
Got no muscle - gutless faggots.

688
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,758
Fancy one?

689
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,717
If you're so fuckin' clever,

690
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,075
why don't you come up
with a suggestion?

691
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,470
Look, I'm thinking, all right?
I am thinking.

692
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,397
We're gonna be here
all night, then.

693
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,119
Is Big Chris on his way?

694
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,589
He should be here any minute.

695
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,592
I think you're making
a big mistake, Harry.

696
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,195
That is a lot of money
for Chris to be after.

697
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,352
Who the fuck are you
to question my judgement?

698
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,079
What d'you know
about Big Chris, eh?

699
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,075
Put Big Chris on a job and he
will get it done no matter what.

700
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,119
His dad used to collect debts,
and his dad before that.

701
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,919
And that monster of a boy will
after he's gone.

702
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,752
'The Almighty himself

703
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,149
'requested them
to collect debts for eternity,

704
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,277
'and not to fear knockin'
on 0ld Nick's door himself

705
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,396
'if he was behind
on his payment.

706
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,354
'And he's never nicked
a nicker in his life.'

707
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,830
Straight as an arrow and strong
as the bow that fired it.

708
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,350
If you dropped a tenner,
he'd search till he found you.

709
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,836
'There is a problem,
he isn't stable.

710
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,758
'Heaven protect anybody
who touches that boy.

711
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,308
'Not that that boy
needs protecting.'

712
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,958
What's all the flapping?
You told the old man yet?

713
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,156
Hoping I won't need to.

714
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,913
I've got a plan.
Listen carefully.

715
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,670
- Hello, boys.
- Harry.

716
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,796
Do you want a drink?

717
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,757
Hello, my son.
D'you want a lolly?

718
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,512
Piss off, you nonce.

719
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,397
0i, watch it!

720
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,793
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

721
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,472
Nice shooter.

722
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,949
0ne of a pair -
Holland and Holland.

723
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,758
D'you wanna hold it?

724
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,637
Not my thing, thanks, Harry.

725
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,029
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

726
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,918
Four young fellas got in deeper
than they could handle.

727
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,275
They owe me
half a million pound.

728
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,318
- How much?
- Half a million.

729
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,871
Well, what d'you
want us to do about it?

730
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,319
Hit the fuckers.

731
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,351
I know it sounds a bit strong,

732
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,591
but it's not as if
we're doing anything illegal.

733
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,353
I dunno how you
reached that conclusion.

734
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,274
They can't report they've had
their drugs and money nicked.

735
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,318
- How heavy are they?
- Don't look all that.

736
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,550
Hitler didn't look all that.

737
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,438
All right, but we
are in the soup here

738
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,670
and this is a silver spoon.

739
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,833
And it's not as if we've got
all the time in the world. Dig?

740
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,313
I'm game.

741
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,274
Me too.

742
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,713
0h, God!

743
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,555
Right. We hit 'em
as soon as they come back.

744
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,029
We'll be prepared. Waiting.

745
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,192
And they're armed.

746
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,032
What was that? Armed?

747
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,237
What d'you mean armed?
Armed with what?

748
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,278
Bad breath, colourful language,
feather duster?

749
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,839
What do you think
they'll be armed with?

750
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,672
Guns, you tit!

751
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,194
You never said
anything about guns.

752
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,714
A minute ago, this was
the safest job in the world.

753
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,836
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia!

754
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,388
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

755
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,790
- I've thought about that and...
- And what, exactly?

756
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,317
All we have to do is find out
who's carrying 'em.

757
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,597
They could all be carrying 'em
for what we know.

758
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,990
No. 0nly one of 'em carries
them going to the job.

759
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,789
I assume the same one
will carry 'em back.

760
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,108
< You assume?

761
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,954
What is it - assumption
is the brother of all fuck-ups?

762
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,632
It's the mother of all fuck-ups!

763
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,676
Brother, mother,
any other sucker.

764
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,796
It don't make any difference.

765
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,238
They're still fucking guns and
they still fire fucking bullets!

766
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,916
Soap, if you have a better idea
how to get £500,000

767
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,560
in the next few days,
let us know.

768
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,278
In the meantime, Tom,

769
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,193
talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

770
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,268
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

771
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,999
It's fucked-up skunk, Class A,

772
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,071
"I can't think
let alone move" shit.

773
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,559
Doesn't sound
very good to me.

774
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,359
Neither me - depends
what flicks your switch.

775
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,830
The light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

776
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,638
Anyway, do you know anyone?

777
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,676
I know a man, yes.

778
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,229
Rory Breaker.

779
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,074
The madman with an afro? I don't
want anything to do with him.

780
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,232
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

781
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,436
No can do.

782
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,512
What's that -
a place near Kathmandu?

783
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,874
Meet me half-way, mate.

784
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,996
It's all completely
chicken soup.

785
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,072
- It's what?
- It's kosher... as Christmas.

786
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,355
Jews don't
celebrate Christmas, Tom.

787
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,079
Never mind that.
I'm gonna need some artillery.

788
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,037
Coupla sawn-off shotguns.

789
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,554
A bit heavy. This is London,
not the Lebanon.

790
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,198
Who d'you think I am?

791
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,794
I think you're Nick the Greek.

792
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,791
Hold those two.

793
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,316
I don't normally have
anything to do with weed.

794
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,550
But if it is what he says,

795
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,633
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

796
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,631
If it is what he says.

797
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,551
I don't want to see it
after a sample,

798
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,870
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

799
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,554
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

800
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,790
He'll sort out the details.

801
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,996
Just let me tell you
one thing...

802
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,068
If the milk turns out
to be sour,

803
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,628
I ain't the kind
of pussy to drink it.

804
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,159
D'you know what I mean?

805
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,917
Rory Breaker.

806
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,709
I know Rory. He's not
to be underestimated.

807
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,597
He's a funny-looking
fucker, I know.

808
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,672
You've got to look past the hair
and cute cuddly thing.

809
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,352
It's a deceptive façade.

810
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,633
A few nights ago
his roger iron busted.

811
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,679
He's gone down the battle
cruiser to watch the football.

812
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,672
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel.

813
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,149
A fat geezer's north opens.

814
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,596
He wanders up
and turns the Liza over.

815
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,716
"Fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

816
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,791
He knows claret is imminent,

817
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,711
but he doesn't
want to miss the game.

818
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,509
Calm as a coma, picks up
the fire extinguisher,

819
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,637
walks past the jam rolls
ready for action

820
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,438
and plonks it outside
the entrance.

821
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,637
He orders an Aristotle
of the most ping-pong tiddly

822
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,349
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer.

823
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,510
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

824
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,239
"That's fucking what?"
Says Rory.

825
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,232
He gobs out a mouthful of booze,
covering Fatty.

826
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,959
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest

827
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,190
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

828
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,794
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

829
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,952
His team's won, too. Four nil.

830
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,596
0i! Is your hair supposed
to look like that?

831
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,513
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

832
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,149
Next time we do a job like this,
we want more money.

833
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,674
0r we're going back
to post offices. Fuck that!

834
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,079
Where's the others?

835
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,754
There was no others.

836
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,035
Stop fucking around.
The others - the old ones.

837
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,348
I don't know what you mean.

838
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,829
There were two old guns.
Where are they now?

839
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,592
Not in the cabinet.

840
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,638
There were some old hammer-lock
muskets the butler was carrying.

841
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,235
- They were ours. We sold them.
- Unsell them!

842
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,356
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

843
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,715
I am not fucking interested.

844
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,076
If you don't wanna be counting
the fingers you haven't got,

845
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,913
or sharing a bed
with the Antichrist,

846
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,560
I want those guns. Quick!

847
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,398
All right, Barry.

848
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,711
Calm down.
We'll get them, all right?

849
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,679
Now fuck off, you scouse cunts.

850
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,557
[Greek music]

851
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,273
Jesus! If I pick 'em up,
will they stay in one piece?

852
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,032
Where'd you get them?

853
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,270
I got contacts. Listen, Tom -

854
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,592
you point them at me, I'll shit
myself or do whatever you say.

855
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,352
Either way, you get
the desired effect.

856
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,954
They look very nice, I agree.

857
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,996
They're lacking in criminal
credibility, ain't they?

858
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,152
I might get laughed at.
How much d'you want for these?

859
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,912
700 each.

860
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,719
What - a pound for every year
they been about?

861
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,837
They're antiques, but I ain't
paying antique prices.

862
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,839
Bit long, ain't they?

863
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,831
Sawn-offs are out.

864
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,514
People want a bit
more range these days.

865
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,275
Range? I don't wanna blow
the arse out of this country,

866
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,796
but I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry either.

867
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,757
I want to look... fucking mean.

868
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,831
0f course you'll look mean.

869
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,592
You'll look really scary.

870
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,069
Enough. What about
this geezer who sells drugs?

871
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,037
Rory Breaker's standing by.

872
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,556
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy.

873
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,119
< I understand
this has come as a shock.

874
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,236
Let me tell you
how this can be resolved

875
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,151
by you, the good father.

876
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,912
Go on.

877
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,072
- He likes your bar.
- Yes.

878
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,469
He wants your bar.

879
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,472
And?

880
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,835
D'you want me
to draw you a picture?

881
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,310
Look, that boy doesn't know
his arsehole from his earhole.

882
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,710
This is my bar. It's got
nothing to do with him.

883
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,438
What, and I care?

884
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,556
Remember, you have
the luxurious advantage

885
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,029
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

886
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,951
You do have a reputation -

887
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,110
so I'll choose my words
very carefully.

888
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,873
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

889
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,315
Whew...

890
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,188
Careful, JD, you'll give Harry
another heart attack.

891
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,551
Now...

892
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,797
I'll put that down to shock.

893
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,313
0nly once.

894
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,520
0nly once can I, or shall I,
let you get away with that.

895
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,797
Your son's got three days
to find half a mill.

896
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,997
Make up your mind
which you prefer -

897
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,834
your bar... or your son.

898
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,719
[Plank] There's nothin'
to worry about, it's easy.

899
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,633
[Dog] No such thing
as easy in my experience.

900
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,269
If you think it's gonna
be easy, you're a prick.

901
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,399
It might be easier than most,
but it's not gonna be easy.

902
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,836
[Feedback]

903
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,514
What's that idiot
doing next door?

904
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,716
Right, we use your van.

905
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,634
There's stairs up to this place
so we'll stick out.

906
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,914
Plank goes in first.

907
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,072
There's a cage, but it's never
locked, is it, Plank?

908
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,799
- Never.
- It don't wanna be.

909
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,668
0nce he's set,
he gets the rest of us in.

910
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,639
We'll get nasty,
shit 'em up, gag 'em, whatever.

911
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,995
These wankers shouldn't
give us any problems.

912
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,390
Like any cowboys - there'll
be a few tools lying around.

913
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,995
When the job's done, we come
straight back here and unload.

914
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,991
And Robert's
your father's brother.

915
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,036
Everyone savvy?

916
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,712
[All] Sweet.

917
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,916
[Dog] We'll do it
tomorrow at eight.

918
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,117
These slags like
to lie in bed till midday.

919
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,795
Lowest ebb and all that.
That's the way I like it.

920
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,632
Jesus!

921
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,031
Don't worry, we can manage this.

922
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,634
And what do you want me to do?

923
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,314
I don't know.
Turn up and look mean.

924
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,868
What d'you mean, look mean?

925
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,837
You know, growl a bit.

926
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,957
Just look as if you know
what you're doing.

927
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,031
I can do better than that.

928
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,916
Have a look at these.

929
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,639
What are we supposed
to do with these?

930
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,076
Put them on your head, stupid.

931
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,957
Christ!

932
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,600
If you think
I'm turning up clean-shaven

933
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,717
and greet them with a grin,
you've got another thing coming.

934
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,518
These fellas
are your neighbours.

935
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,752
I thought it might be a good
idea to disguise ourselves.

936
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,071
Right... er, good thinking,
Soap. Well done.

937
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,030
I brought weapons as well.

938
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,951
What do you mean weapons?

939
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,952
These.

940
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,837
Jesus!

941
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,036
Let's keep 'em covered up.

942
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,313
Couldn't you get
anything bigger?

943
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,997
What, like that?

944
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,399
What d'you think?

945
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,199
I think you need help.

946
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,029
Bar steward, can we have
a coupla drinks, please.

947
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,951
Have you seen your dad?

948
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,190
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

949
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,350
0h, shit. When?

950
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,113
Crazy.

951
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,878
A good few years ago, your dad
and Harry played brag together.

952
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,954
Now, JD is a better player
but Harry is a shit and a cheat.

953
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,114
This game went on for two days,
until your dad lost everything.

954
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,830
But Harry wanted more. He wanted
to put your dad deep in debt,

955
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,869
so he plays on and on
until the stakes are a joke.

956
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,837
Harry's got some scam goin' on,

957
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,992
wants to put JD
in trouble for years.

958
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,553
Harry turns over and he's got
next to unbeatable cards.

959
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,316
Everyone falls over
'cause they all hate Harry.

960
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,791
JD starts to weep,
it's a real mess.

961
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,429
Harry starts laughin', cheerin',
doin' a little jig

962
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,670
and he turns JD's cards over.

963
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,469
JD by this time
is cryin' proper tears,

964
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,755
this is next to pathetic.

965
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,717
We see the cards, he's got three
threes, the best possible cards!

966
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,918
And the only time
I have ever seen them.

967
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,959
JD continues to cry, but now
it doesn't seem so pathetic.

968
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,952
Harry... he's had a heart attack!

969
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,229
JD bought this place
with the profits

970
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,357
and he's never
played cards since.

971
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,149
Harry's been looking to get
revenge for all those years.

972
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,710
You've just given him his cue.

973
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,678
If Harry don't kill you,
your father will.

974
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,718
He is not a happy chappy, Ed.

975
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,516
[Phone rings]

976
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,552
Yes?

977
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,551
It's happening tomorrow morning.

978
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,871
No fuckin' about, Ed,
get back here now.

979
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,118
Where'd you get these,
a fucking museum?

980
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,792
Nick the Greek.

981
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,270
How much did you part with?

982
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,475
700 for the pair.

983
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,391
Drachmas, I hope.

984
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,948
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

985
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,951
These are gonna do
more harm than good.

986
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,630
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

987
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,235
I don't know. Look nice, though.
I rather like 'em.

988
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,880
That's top of priorities,
that is.

989
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,509
Ladies, back to more important
issues, if you don't mind.

990
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,388
We've only got two real guns -
apparently that's what they are.

991
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,436
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

992
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,830
We wait till it's the right
time, then jack-in-the-box,

993
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,708
look nasty and stuff, cocoon 'em
in gaffer tape, nick their van,

994
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,678
swap the gear into the new van
and bring it back.

995
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,558
As long as we're out
of our hiding places quickly,

996
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,029
it's the last thing
you'd expect.

997
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,874
If Tom or anyone else feels
like giving 'em a kicking,

998
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,916
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

999
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,310
Yeah, little bit of pain
never hurt anybody.

1000
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,789
If you know what I mean.

1001
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,714
Also, I think knives
are a good idea.

1002
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,711
Big, fuck-off shiny ones.

1003
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,678
0nes that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

1004
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,435
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise.

1005
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,717
The less noise they make, the
more likely we are to use 'em.

1006
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,711
Shit 'em right up.

1007
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,995
Makes it look
like we're serious.

1008
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,038
Guns for show, knives for a pro.

1009
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,312
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

1010
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,756
I'm not sure what's more
worrying, the job or your past.

1011
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,072
Come on, girls.

1012
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,239
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

1013
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,629
I thought this was meant
to be a robbery.

1014
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,836
Where'd they get those outfits?

1015
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,434
Not a bad idea, that.

1016
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,872
Come on, you fucking jellyheads,
move it!

1017
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,633
You've been up two hours,
you should've got somewhere.

1018
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,712
The money and the gear's
gotta be out by 12.

1019
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,233
[Door buzzer]

1020
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,799
Who's that?

1021
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,278
Don't open the door until you've
used that cage. I'm serious.

1022
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,278
Find out who it is first.

1023
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,271
Hello, can I help you?

1024
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,430
All right, it's Plank.
Is Willie there?

1025
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,478
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

1026
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,074
Perhaps you can help.

1027
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,833
Perhaps I can't,
if you know what I mean.

1028
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,469
If you could open the door so
I could talk without shouting.

1029
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,232
I can't help you, Plank.

1030
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,754
You'll find
it's in your interest.

1031
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,319
Hold on, 0K?

1032
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,393
Willie, it's Plank for you.
He says it's in our interest.

1033
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,914
I don't care if it's
King-fucking-Kong,

1034
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,116
he's not coming in here,
not today.

1035
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,079
Hold on. We are in business
and... correct me if I'm wrong

1036
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,037
but that is business.

1037
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,317
Corrected. That's a walking
accident we can do without.

1038
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,029
Jesus. He's 0K... He knows
only to buy weights now.

1039
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,429
We're looking at at least
a couple of thou'.

1040
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,829
What do you think, Winston?

1041
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,480
This is the last time.
All right?

1042
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,472
You and the money
are going out the back.

1043
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,471
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

1044
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,516
Just clear this shit up!

1045
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,999
What, now?

1046
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,675
Yes! Now! Just get rid
of him quick.

1047
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,274
All right. Just coming.

1048
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,355
What the fuck is he doing?

1049
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,311
Come on, I can't wait
out here all day!

1050
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,311
[Jake] Just coming.

1051
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,988
I thought you was gonna
leave me out there all day.

1052
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,150
I didn't know you were
a removals man, Plank.

1053
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,993
Lives and learns, don't ya?
Keep the gates locked now?

1054
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,072
Ya, sorry. Gotta
do business like this now.

1055
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,390
Can't be too careful these days.

1056
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,913
I know.

1057
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,798
Say a word, the right ear goes,
another, your left!

1058
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,838
- What are you doing, Plank?
- What do you think?

1059
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,672
Hang on, what are you doing?

1060
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,354
Unlock the gate!
Unlock the fucking gate!

1061
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,000
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

1062
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,393
What the fuck's going on?

1063
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,754
Hang on, I've got the keys.

1064
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,910
The gate's locked.

1065
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,752
I don't believe
the fucking gate's locked.

1066
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,319
What you done to Fauntleroy?

1067
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,913
I didn't touch him.
He passed out.

1068
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,468
Shut the door!
D'you want the world to see?

1069
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,199
[Door slams, shouting]

1070
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,032
What's going on down there?

1071
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,519
Shit!

1072
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,315
Charles, get the rifle out.

1073
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,630
We're being fucked.
