00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,054
You mean to tell me you got engaged

808
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,291
to someone you just met that day?

809
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:01,891
Yes. Pay attention.

810
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,961
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time

811
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,564
so, I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

812
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,867
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

813

Yes, they did.

But Hans is not a stranger.

815
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,208
Oh, yeah?
What's his last name?

816
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,610
(SCOFFS) "Of the Southern Isles."

817
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,111
What's his favorite food?
Sandwiches.

Probably John.

the way he picks his nose?

Picks his nose?

825
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,356
And eats it.

No. But, uh, I have

Are you serious?
Yes!

1928
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:36,363
And it's the latest model.

1929
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:37,464
No, I can't accept this.

1930
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:40,066
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1931
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:44,704
She's named you the Official

What? That's not a thing.
Oh, sure it is.

1933
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:50,477
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1934
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:52,679
Like it? I love it!

I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

01:30:57,686 --> 01:31:00,854
(STAMMERS) May I? We me.
I mean, may we?
