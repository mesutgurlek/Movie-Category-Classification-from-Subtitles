Carl, I know it's you.</i>

Oh. Hey, man.

10
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,874
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,340
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

12
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:02,705
Did you block your number?

13
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,212
<i>Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.</i>

-What? Text? What?</i>

00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:18,386
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

I'm just so jammed up.

20

I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

22
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,396
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,477

I could tell you what it is...

Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

36
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,831
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

37
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,600
That's probably who you're seeing.

38
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:07,800
Wow, that's amazing...

39
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,912

Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

CARL: Hey.
-Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,475
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

50
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:44,238
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

51
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,972
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

52
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,617
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

53
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,219

to make.

-Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

60
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,367
What has it been, six months?

61
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,368
-No.
-Two years.

62
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,007
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

63
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,778
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

66
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:24,620
-Yeah, we'll figure it out.
-What's there to figure out?

00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,381
Oh, God, look who's here.

68
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:29,150
PETE: I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

69
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,385
-Open bar. What's the problem?
-I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

70
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,622
-The Stephanie?
-Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,727
PETE:
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

72
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,703
-Looks like she's with someone there too.
-They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

73
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,571
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

74
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,839
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

75
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,313
-No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
-What?

76
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,679
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

77
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,481
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

-No, I don't believe we have.

-You're leaving?
-Yeah, unfortunately.

84
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,561
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

85
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,330
You just got here, too, Carl.

86
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,068
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

87
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,270
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

88
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,348
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,759
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

96
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,057
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

97
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,133
-Some cereal, a little yogurt?
-Yeah, no.

98
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,894
How about some toast, huh?

99
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,335
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

Good show tonight. Come check us out.

101
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,368
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

102
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,105
-Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
-Yep.

103
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,614
-Yes?
-No, I meant yes to your no.

104
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,749
Yeah, bye.

00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:58,273
-Carl Allen has reported for duty.
-I'm not a soldier, Norman.

110
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,542
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

111
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,436
Norman. Line one.

112
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,983
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

113
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,211
-I'll just get it here.
-Yeah, or that.

114
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,344
You're with Norman.

115
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:19,184
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because--
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

116
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,693
Okay.

117
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,058
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

118
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,633
-Yeah.
-It's not gonna happen.

119
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,896
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

120
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,597
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

121
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,675
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

122
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:38,245
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

123
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,508
Look at it this way:
at least you didn't get shit-canned.

124
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,482
-Do you know what that means?
-Fired?

125
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,252
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

126
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,324
No, it's a pretty common expression.

127
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,226
-In my circles. I made it up.
-Well, it's catching on.

128
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:58,458
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

129
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:02,570
-It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
-Oh, man.

130
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,163
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

131
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,732
-You don't know what day it is.
-When is it?

132
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,070
-Friday.
-I'm out of town.

133
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,613
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

134
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,409
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

135
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,644
-...regardless of what I was gonna say.
-Hm.

136
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,855
I admit, business has been slow.

137
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,958
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

138
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,186
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

139
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,796
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

140
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,868
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

141
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,196
-None.
-And your credit--

142
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,896
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

143
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,100
-Yeah.
-I have no other options left.

You must be running this place by now.

I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

to any request that's presented.

that appears suspicious...

...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1207
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,430
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

-He's really into it.
-You say yes to everything?

Are you serious?

-No, of course not.

weigh the options.

You had to say yes.
