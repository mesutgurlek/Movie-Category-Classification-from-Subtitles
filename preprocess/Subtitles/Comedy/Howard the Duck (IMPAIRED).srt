00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,729
I mean, I believe that there are
no accidents in the universe.

332
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,492
Maybe you're here
for some greater purpose,

333
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,570
some cosmic cause.

334

(YAWNING)

336
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,322
I got no intention
of being stranded here.

337
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,490
I gotta get back.

338
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,826
How is another matter.

339
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,003
Yeah. Right.

340
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,668
We gotta get some help.

341
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,920
Oh, but, Howard...

I just don't want people

What about me?

I'm gonna have to see a psychiatrist

Oh, goodie.

359
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,569
Phil's a scientist.
He can help.

I give you a hand with that?

00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,415
No. We're doing...
What's in the bag?

364
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,588
I'm doing fine,
thank you very much.

365
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,212
Let me out of here. Ouch.

00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,258
Excuse me,
could I help you with that?

Yes! No!

00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,842
Why are we stopping?

00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,216

Oh, hi, Beverly.

Hey, Phil, don't talk
to him like that.

He's just as smart as you are.

Can you burn a hole through this
with some kind of eye laser?

Can I bite your nose off
with my super bill?

Howard, quit holding out!

415

I want you to concentrate
and read my mind!

416
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,805
Right.

Tell me if I'm warm
on any of these, Phil.

421

I want you to look
into the future

422
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,150
and tell me what you see!

No, no, no! Wait, wait!
You can't leave!

Oh, yeah? Why not?

427
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,739
Because there are
papers to be written,

428
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,119
there's research to be done,

429
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,747
there's symposiums
to give, lecture tours.

to the science hall of fame.

you famous, Blumburtt.

Beverly, listen, I never badmouth
others in the scientific fraternity,

435
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,674
but you bring an alien
in a bag to most guys,

436
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,260
and whammo! They're talking,
“Let's cut him into little pieces

"and see what color
his organs are!"

438
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,431
I just want to know,
A, what I'm doing here,

439
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,436
and B, how I'm gonna get back.

440
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,859
Piece of cake.
A, I'm just the guy to help,

441
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,109
and that's because
B, I've already got a theory.

442
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,360
What theory?

443
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,114
Well, this is, of course,
the evolutionary ladder,

444
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,993
showing how man progressed
from monkey to...

445
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,449
Me, for instance.

446
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,374
You consider that progress?

447
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,748
Jeez, you're all hairless apes?

448
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,500
That's really disgusting.

449
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,207
Now, I want you both to imagine,

450
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,635
somewhere in the universe
is Howard's world.

451
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,963
Picture it in your mind,

452
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,299
a world almost
exactly like ours,

453
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:30,012
except that the progenitor
of the dominant species

454
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:34,395
was not a monkey, but a duck!

455
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,816
Some theory.

456
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,768
Every school duck
knows this stuff.

457
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,945
And as the duck

458
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,489
climbed up
the evolutionary ladder,

459
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,692
he said adios to his wings.

460
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,948
His mental capacity increases.

461
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,156
He begins to develop...
Beverly?

462
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,239
Shopping malls?

463
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,328

00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,001
No, tribes.

Howard.

468
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,504
Hey, Blumburtt! Blumburtt!

469
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,630
Come on.

470
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,337
DR. CHAPIN: What the hell
are you doing?

471
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,422
Don't move!
Don't breathe!

472
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,970
Did you finish cleaning
up the specimen lab?

473
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,801
Um, almost finished.

474
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,012
Well, get down to the marine
life exhibit with a mop.

475
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,564
Some kid upchucked
all over the fern fossils.

476
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,232
Right Good as done,
Dr. Chapin.

477
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,194
HOWARD: So, Philsie...

478
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,943
You a scientist or a janitor?

479
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,740
Uh, I am a lab assistant.

480
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,112
That's terrific.
Just perfect...

481
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
Yeah, I'm out of here.

482
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,368
Look, it's just a temporary job

483
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,242
until I finish school
and get my own museum.

484
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,118
Yeah. Stuffed,
you'd make a great exhibit.

485
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,198
Howard!

486
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,909
BEVERLY: Howard, wait!

Ah-ha!
Typical hairless ape.

489
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,422
Howard, now, come on. Don't
flutter off in a huff.

490
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,874
Beverly, listen, I've got
some important matters...

491
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,924
DR. CHAPIN: Blumburtt,
did you hear me?

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,092
To clean up here,
but I'll call you tonight.

493
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,169

Good!

820
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,209
Howard! I'm about to meet
secretly with my colleague,

821
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,132
and he's bringing the feather.

822
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,084
What feather?
What are you talking...

823
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,546
If it matches, it'll be the
answer to all your problems.

00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,007
Matches? No, you don't!

the astrophysics lab at Dynatechnics.

937
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,831
Now, on the night
of September 8...

938
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,106
That's the night
that Howard landed.

939
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,230
Yes, now, on that night,
we were initiating

940
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,062
our first full-scale test
of the laser spectroscope.

941
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,818
This was shot
during the experiment.

942
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,817
It was just a routine
procedure meant to measure

943
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,779
the density of the gases
that surround Alpha Centauri.

944
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,080
However, partway through
the experiment,

945
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:46,787
there was a deviation and we lost
control of the laser spectroscope.

946
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,046
What do you mean, lost control?

947
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:54,343
Some unknown force was redirecting the
laser beam from its original target

948
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,420
so that it hit
your planet instead.

949
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,553
Hit my planet? How about
hit my living room?

950
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,225
Talk about an
invasion of privacy.

951
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,553
When the beam hit, you
must have been caught up

952
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,604
in a massive energy inversion

953
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,274
which literally
dragged you through space

954
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,852

here on Earth.

00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,241

we saw a single feather fall.

957
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,491
Oh.

958
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,116
We weren't aware that
the rest of you, Howard,

959
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,203
had landed in that alley
just 2 miles away.

960
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,458
Any questions?

961
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,631
Yeah. Where are my pants?

962
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,120
Howard, where are you going?

963
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,793
To this lab of theirs.
What for'?

964
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,588
<i>To hop back onboard
that laser thing.</i>

965
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,175
Then all you have to do is hit the reverse
lever to send me back home, right?

966
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,095
Well, we hadn't considered
reversing the process.

967
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,562
I don't think it's feasible.
Me either.

968
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,765
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate

969
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,395
a strong enough hypercharge...

970
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,521
You can't do that

971
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,319
You mean the reflex mode might
provoke a total reversal.

972
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,147
It just might be possible.
It won't work.

973
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,482
Yeah.
Sir...

974
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,737
Don't listen to them, Howard.

975
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,365
I have got you booked
on A.M. Cleveland.

976
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,822
We can get the cover
of Science Digest...

977
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,905
Butt out, four-eyes.

978
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,036
BEVERLY: Yeah.

979
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,538
Look, you guys, could you
really send him back?

980
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,287
JENNING: If we did, we could
establish a continuing link

981
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,997
between our planets,

982
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,503
but he would have to leave tonight,
while the alignment still exists.

983
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,800
We can't afford to wait.

984
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,345
You mean I'm finally
gonna breeze this flytrap?

985
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,967
Ducky, this is what you wanted.

986
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,173
You're going home.

987
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,508
Yeah.
JENNING: Right.

988
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,515
Carter, call Larry. Have him set
up the initiation procedure.

989
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,891
Tell him I'll meet him
at the lab right away.

990
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,813
You and Blumburtt
can bring Howard.

991
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,735
You are about to make history a
second time, my little friend.

992
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,278
Thanks. But once was plenty.

993
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,360
Get to it.
Right.

994
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,989
You know, Howard, we could
hold out for a PBS special...

995
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,160
Phil.

996
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,614
HOWARD: Bev, get dressed.
Aren't you gonna see me off?

997
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,622
Sure, I am. I just hope they
let you take a carry-on bag.

998
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,921
Look, I'm gonna put in these
Polaroids that we took at the club.

999
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,373
Thanks.

1000
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,878
These'll help.

1001
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,631
The guys back home
are never gonna believe me.

1002
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,962
(CHUCKLES)

1003
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,797
What's this in my bed?

1004
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,925
Souvenirs?

1005
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,391
I'm gonna miss you a lot, Ducky.

1006
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,981
Bev, I don't belong here.

1007
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,980
You know I've gotta go.

1008
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,188
Yeah.

1009
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,992
(BARKS)

1010
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,750
Lilly had the dolphins,

1011
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,827
Cousteau, the whales,

1012
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,041
Goodall, gorillas.

1013
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,131
I had a duck.

1014
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,004
I could have been a contender.

1015
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,548
Bev...

1016
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,010
I'm not a real sentimental guy.

1017
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:53,599
No. I bet you were born from
a very hardboiled egg, Ducky.

1018
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,024
Yeah.

1019
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,852
But I do keep wondering...

1020
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,782
Of all the alleys in the world I
could have fallen into that night,

1021
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,985
why did it have to be yours?

1022
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,862
Because, right now,

1023
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,447
you're the one and only thing

1024
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,374
that's making it very
hard for me to leave.

1025
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,551
(PHONE RINGING)

1026
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,473
There's no guard.

1027
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,892
Oh. We should
go back, then, huh?

1028
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,389
Phil...
What?

1029
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,641
Drive.

(ALARM BLARING)

1031
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,997
What are these alarms?

1032
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,512
Somethings happened.
What's happened?

1033
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,746
I don't know.

1034
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,123
That is really cool. Right.

1035
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,126
Hold it. Security.

1036
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,421
(SCREAMING) My eyes! My eyes!

1037
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,013
It exploded again!
It was terrible!

1038
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,842
We have no right to
tamper with the universe!

1039

(GROANING)

1040
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,763
This does not bode well.

1041
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,098
Hmm.

1042
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,226
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

1043
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,686
Is he okay?

1044
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,531
Whoa!
BEVERLY: Holy Toledo!

1045
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,154
MAN 1: Put it here! Come on!

1046
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,613
Get out of the way! It's still hot!
Get over here!

1047
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,872
Shut down the laser system!

1048
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,042
Drop the emergency shield!

1049
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,789
Get that platform stabilized!

MAN 2:
Where's Jenning?

1051
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,006
WOMAN: You get over here now!
Come on, come on!

1052
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,529
BEVERLY: Howard,
where are you going?

1053
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,551
Larry, where's Dr. Jenning?

1054
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,227
Carter, come here,
let me show you this.

1055
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,062
He was pre-activating
the laser spectroscope.

1056
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,097
Uh-huh.

1057
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,603
We lost control again and
there was another explosion,

1058
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,232
and Jenning caught the full
force of the blast this time.

1059
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,903
Is he all right?
Where is he?

1060
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,698
You see, the bottom of the
spectroscope blew into the wall,

1061
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,821
and Jenning just...
Just disappeared.

1062
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,246
Excuse me, but is this
gonna delay my takeoff?

1063
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,073
Is that...
Is that it?

1064
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,663
That's unbelievable!

1065
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,167
Yeah. We brought Howard down
the first time, but what if...

1066
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,625
Oh, my God, Larry, what if we've
brought down something else this time?

1067
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,801
We're rounding up all the
scientists for you in the lab, sir,

1068
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,179
but I think you'd better take a
look at this other thing first.

1069
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,761
A thing' Hanson?

1070
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,063
Is that the kind of precise
descriptive techniques

1071
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,891
they're teaching rookies
nowadays? A thing?

1072
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,477
I want to know what they're
doing with Howard.

1073
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,403
Excuse me,
are you in charge here?

1074
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,479
Yeah, why?

1075
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,816
Well, I want to know why
they're harassing Howard.

1076
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,899
Who's Howard?

1077
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,103
He had nothing to do with it.

1078
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,370
Howard is just
an innocent, um...

1079
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,446
Thing?

1080
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,781
No. Duck.

1081
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,118
Just an innocent duck?

1082
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,077
And they wonder why I'm
asking for early retirement.

1083
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,161
You deal with this.

1084
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,001
Wait a second.
You can't...

1085
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,299
Kirby. You got
a thing in here?

1086
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,126
Uh, thing.
Mmm-hmm.

1087
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,098
I've had enough.
I want to see my lawyer.

(LAUGHING)

1089
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,644
I've got rights, you know.
I'm suing.

1090
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:19,720
Yeah.

1091
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,795
God damn it, Hanson, get in here

1092
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,808
and get this frigging duck
suit off this nut. Sir.

1093
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,810
Uh-oh.

1094
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,861
All right, get a hold of him.

1095
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,405
Hey! Hey, let me go,
you big gorillas!

1096
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,404
HOWARD: On my planet,
we never say die,

1097
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,577
we say...
Not my shorts!

1098
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,949
Find that damn zipper!

Uh, lieutenant...

Lieutenant, there's no zipper!

1102
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,748
There's no buttons,
no Velcro, sir.

1103
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,751
I think the suspect's duckness
is, like, inborn, sir.

1104
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,332
I think he's for real.

1105
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,134
HOWARD: If your goons are finished...
Let go!

1106
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,803
Ow, ow!

1107
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,924
I'd like a word with those
so-called scientists out there.

1108
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,008
Oh, yeah?
What about?

1109
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,642
About when they can rev up that
machine and send me back home.

1110
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,473
Listen, Howard, I'm gonna go talk
to the scientists out there.

1111
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,854
You are gonna go play
sitting duck in a jail cell.

1112
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,857
Lieutenant,
what's the charge, sir?

1113
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,438

Come on!

1115
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,195
I'll get the car.

1116
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,867
All right.
Oh, a cigar!

1117
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,823
(EXCLAIMS) All right, that's how
it starts, police brutality!

1118
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,452
Hey, stop manhandling him!

1119
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,909
Hey, you can't come in here.

1120
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,003
Ah. Here's another one,
already lit.

1121
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,830
Oh, nuts!
I dropped my cigar!

1122
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,914
Fire!

1123
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,249

Book him, Ducko.

What?

1134
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,983
The duck got away.
Ah!

1135
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,909
Get up, fool.
Get him out of here.

on the double!

I told you, bird brain,
I am not Jenning anymore.

1301

I am now one of the Dark
Overlords of the Universe.

a responsibility.

1304

Tonight, the laser beam
hit the Nexus of Sominus.

It lies beyond the planets.

It is a region of demons

1309

were exiled eons ago.

Howard, what I'm getting is that
this man is very, very sick.

01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,416
Just as you were brought
down here accidentally,

1313
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:48,463
tonight the laser beam released
me from that region of demons

1314
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,384
and pulled me down
into that lab.

1316
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:59,217
During the explosion,
I entered Jennings body.

1317
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,183
So...

1318
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,898
I have disguised my true form,

1319
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:12,821
which would be considered
hideous and revolting here.

This will mean the extinction

the same discussion here?

I'll give you a hint, doll.
