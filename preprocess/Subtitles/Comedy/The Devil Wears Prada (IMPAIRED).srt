Hi. Uh, I have an appointment

- Yes.

Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...

18
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,363
but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I'm the first.

- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

Andrea,
<i>Runway</i> is a fashion magazine...

30
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,638
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

to confirm an appointment.

48
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,826
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

to the Michael Kors party.

I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30

Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,166
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

Nobody. Um, uh-

65

Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.

00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,954
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

Hello.

301
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,154
Right. Come on.

302
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,917
- Miranda's pushed the run-through
up a half an hour.
- Mmm!

303
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,356
- She's always 15 minutes early.
- Which means?

304
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,758
- You're already late. Come.
- Shoot!

305
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,330
Excuse me.

306

- [Bell Dings]
- Mr. Ravitz.

307

Nigel.

308
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,029
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

309
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,701
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets
and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

310
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,679
What's that costing me?

311
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,941
About 300,000.

312
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,212
Must have been some lousy jackets.

313
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,719
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,016
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

315
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,115
Congratulations, young lady.

316
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,457
A million girls would kill for that job.

317
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,462
Bye-bye.

318
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,761
- Hmm?
- Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.

319
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,635
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.

320
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,173
No. And I've seen all this before.

321
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,179
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so actually it's-

322
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,341
- Where are all the other dresses?
- <i>We have some right here.</i>

323
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,682
- Stand, watch and listen.
- And I think it can be very interesting-

324
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:07,122
No. No, I just-
It's just baffling to me.

325
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,717
Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent run-through?

326
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,698
<i>You people have had hours and hours</i>
<i>to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.</i>

327
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,826
Where are the advertisers?

328
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,064
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?

329
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,075
- Oh. This is-This might be-
What do you think of-
- Yeah.

330
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,735
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

331
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,712
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

332
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,251
- But do you think it's too much like-
- <i>Like the Lacroix from July?</i>

333
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,287
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.

334
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,916
Where are the belts for this dre-
Why is no one ready?

335
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,325
Here. It's a tough call.

336
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,590
- They're so different.
- <i>[Miranda] Hmm.</i>

337

[Snorts, Chuckles]

338
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,566
Something funny?

339
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,144
No. No, no. Nothing's-

340
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:04,113
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

341
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,380
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh-

342
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,251
"This... stuff"?

343
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,917
<i>Oh. Okay. I see.</i>

344
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,221
You think this has nothing
to do with you.

345
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,662
<i>You go to your closet...</i>

346
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:25,430
and you select- I don't know-
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

347
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,404
<i>because you're trying to tell the world</i>
<i>that you take yourself too seriously...</i>

348
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,873
to care about what
you put on your back.

349
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,104
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.

350
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,737
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

351
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,009
It's actually cerulean.

352
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,176
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...

353
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:45,586
<i>that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta</i>
<i>did a collection of cerulean gowns.</i>

354
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,215
<i>And then I think it was</i>
<i>Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-</i>

355
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,294
who showed cerulean military jackets?

356
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,795
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

357
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,698
<i>And then cerulean quickly showed up</i>
<i>in the collections of eight different designers.</i>

358
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,033
<i>And then it, uh, filtered down</i>
<i>through the department stores...</i>

359
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,139
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

360
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,199
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

361
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,437
<i>where you, no doubt,</i>
<i>fished it out of some clearance bin.</i>

362
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,208
<i>However, that blue represents</i>
<i>millions of dollars...</i>

363
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,783
and countless jobs...

364
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,910
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

365
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,989
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

366
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,989
when, in fact...

367
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:24,494
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...

368
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,326
from a pile of stuff.

369
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,059
<i>So then I said,</i>
<i>"No, I couldn't see the difference...</i>

370
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,466
<i>between the two</i>
<i>absolutely identical belts"...</i>

371
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,539
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

372
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,698
I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

373

- [Chuckles]
- <i>It's not funny.</i>

374
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,676
She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

375
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,717
And the Clackers just worship her.

376
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,718
- The who?
- <i>They call them Clackers.</i>

377
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,119
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

378
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,192
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack."

379
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,023
<i>[Groans] And they all act like</i>
<i>they're curing cancer or something.</i>

380
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,690
[Chuckling]
The amount of time and energy...

381
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,203
<i>that these people spend on these insignificant,</i>
<i>minute details, and for what?</i>

382
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,899
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something...

383
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,999
<i>that was probably fine to begin with...</i>

384
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,908
to sell people things they don't need!

385
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,073
God!

386
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,414
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- <i>What?</i>

387
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,421
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- <i>Oh. No, no, no.</i>

388
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,014
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.

389
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,151
[Sighs]
You know what?

390
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,355
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

391
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,094
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

392
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,467
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

393
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,540
Easy there, tiger.

- Hello. Miranda?
- My flight has been canceled.

452
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,426
It's some absurd weather problem.

I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.

00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,437
- What?
- At school!

455
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,803
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute...

457
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,846

could maybe get a flight for my boss...

00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,916
from Miami to New York tonight?

- <i>[Andy] Yeah, any kind of jet.</i>

What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

468
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,998
It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.

Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight

Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.

471

I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

She's going to murder me.

What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

480
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,735
Of course not. Could I do that?

The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

about your so-called work ethic-

more than any of the other silly girls.

Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?

508
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,290
She hates me, Nigel.

509

And that's my problem because-

Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.

511
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:19,033
I don't know what else I can do because
if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.

512
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,105
She doesn't even say thank you.

513
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,505
But if I do something wrong,
she is <i>vicious.</i>

00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,316
- Quit.
- Quit?

516
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,945
I can get another girl to take your job
in five minutes- one who really wants it.

517
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,580
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.

518

But, you know, I'm just saying
that I would just like a little credit...

that I'm killing myself trying.

597
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,554
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

598
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,488
You take the fry and squeeze it.

00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,527
- <i>See how firm that is?</i>
- Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

600
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,128
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.

601
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,224
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

602
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:28,032
<i>I have exciting presents for all of you.</i>

603

<i>Are you ready?</i>

604
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,502
- What is that?
- It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.

605
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,342
<i>Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda</i>
<i>for her birthday.</i>

606
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,576
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.

607
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,380
- What?
- Wow!

608
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,751
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

609
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,256
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!

610
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,817
- Oh, damn it. I love your job.
- <i>Oh! One more.</i>

611
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,989
- A little thing.
- [Gasps]

612
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,000
- Do you want it? You want- Oh.
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

613
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,003
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God! This is the new Marc Jacobs!

614
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,573
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?

615
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,074
Miranda didn't want it, so-

616
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,170
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.

617
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,715
- [Cackles]
- Yeah, you can.

618
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,615
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.

619
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,917
You have one. You put all your junk in it,
and that's it. You're done.

620
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,991
Fashion is not about utility.

621
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,788
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

622
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,759
used to express individual identity.

623
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,264
- Oh! And it's pretty.
- That too.

624
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,030
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is
more to <i>Runway</i> than just fancy purses.

625
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,096
<i>Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney,</i>
<i>a piece by Joan Didion.</i>

626
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,371
<i>Even an interview</i>
<i>with Christiane Amanpour.</i>

- What do you-

628
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,317
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- I got it. It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.

629
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,318
- <i>Oh, Miranda?</i>
- Let me talk to her.

630
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,411
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

631
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,253
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!

632
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,260
It's gonna make-
Give me the... phone.

- Absolutely.

I'm looking for James Holt.

Um, that's him right there.

644
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,145
- Oh. Thanks.
- No problem.

645
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,949
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve.
- Really?

00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,251
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

647

I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

648
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,722
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.

649
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,493
- [Chuckling]
- Nice to meet you.

650
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,058
- Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice.
- Ah.

651
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,606
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand,
finished with a metallic fringe.

652
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,699
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

653
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,801
You.

654
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,905
Hmm. Duh. This way.

655
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,813
Uh, here we go.

656
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,253
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

657
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,326
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

658
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,554
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

659
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,960
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

660
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,764
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

Excuse us, girls.

662

667
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,789
The punch.
I drank it at Jamess last party.

668
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,588
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

- Christian Thompson.

00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,170
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

673
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,869
No, you're-You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

674
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,435
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

675
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,484
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

676

- No, but-
- What do you do?

677
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,483
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like <i>The New Yorker</i> or <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,560
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

679
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,755
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

680
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,196
Yeah?

681

That would be-Thank you.
That would be great. [Giggling]

But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

683
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,974
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

684
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,012
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

685
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,014
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

686

You can't do that job.

687
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,114
Gotta go.

00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,124
Okay.

<i>But we're not expected until Tuesday.</i>
<i>Did she say why?</i>

694
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,731
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

695
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,805
And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about <i>American Idol.</i>

696
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,805
I see your point.

- <i>[Andy] What's a preview anyway?</i>
- Good morning, Miranda.

<i>[Andy]</i>
<i>Which means?</i>

<i>[Nigel]</i>
<i>Catastrophe.</i>

Just, uh-Just go.

00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,854
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,224
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

715
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,493
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

716
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,568
You still don't get it, do you?

717
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,638
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

718
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,701
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

719
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,779
And I'll need a change of clothes.

720
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:20,873
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

721
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:25,648
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

722
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,247
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,890
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

724
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,894
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

725
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,902
I'm not a psycho.

726
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,495
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

727
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,235
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

728
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,903
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

729
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,942
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

730
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,986
Oh. Okay.

731
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,284

<i>until then.</i>

Do not look at anyone.

- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

<i>You open the door</i>

It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

Andrea, you don't understand.

If you get fired,
