or get you down.

Just think as an animal you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.

95

But even then, you must be careful.

You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.

97
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,940
A wolf and a penguin
could never live together,

I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

you'd like to be if you end up alone?

- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?

106
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,439
Because lobsters live for over 100 years,

Room 187, day two.

163
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
Hello, everyone.

164
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,500
My mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman

165
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
who was better at math than she was.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,239
She had a postgraduate degree, I think,
whereas my mother was only a graduate.

167
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,119
I was 19 at the time.

168
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,300
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.

169
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,319
I really missed her.

170
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,380
I found out she'd been moved to a zoo.

171
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,399
I often went there to see her.

172
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,140
I'd give her raw meat.

173
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,940
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,

174
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,

175
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,079
so I used to give a little bit
to each of them.

176
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,919
One day, I decided to enter the enclosure

177
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,639
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.

178
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,759
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

179
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,220
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,

180
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,239
all but two, who stood motionless.

181
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,439
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,319
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.

183
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,060
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,

184
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,479
which is also my defining characteristic.

185
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,319
My wife died six days ago.

186
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,159
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.

187
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,199
She had a limp too.

188
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,119
Thank you, John.
You can return to your seat now.

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,820
- It was an accident. I got carried away.
- Please.

319
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,620
- This is not necessary.
- Please place your hand in the toaster.

320
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,119
This could be a warning.

Please, please, that's hurting.
(SCREAMS AGAIN)

327
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,439
Woman walks with man.

328
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,420
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,

329
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,060
is to wash your body
and your head really well.

330
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,940
How do you know?

331
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,340
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.

332
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,380
No waiters know about the procedure,

333
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,460
they're not allowed inside that room.

334
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,879
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin,

335
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,100
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.

336
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,780
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body

337
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,639
with a laser or scalpels.

338
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,620
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen.

339
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,580
That makes total sense.

340
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,980
I mean, I suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work

341
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,700
than fowls, for example.

342
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,140
Exactly.

343
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,340
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts

344
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,540
into the casks outside
the hotel's restaurant

345
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,540
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.

346
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,100
Why is that?

347
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,919
The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

348
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,020
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

349
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,740
I think I saw a woman with a limp.

350
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,759
It's just a sprained ankle.

351
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,860
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.

352
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,919
That's a shame.

353
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,180
That is a shame indeed.

354
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,599
(ALARM BLARES)

355
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
WOMAN: One night on the coach, he sat
next to the woman who liked butter biscuits.

356
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,020
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,

357
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
just trying to avoid talking to her.

358
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,439
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.

359
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,559
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

360
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,980
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.

361
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,460
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.

362
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,900
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

363
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,919
And that was a really good one.

364
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,940
These biscuits are for Bob.

365
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,180
I want you to give them to him

366
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,260
whenever you want to reward him
for something.

367
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,420
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.

368
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,839
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?

369
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.

370
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,020
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

371
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,380
if that's your thing.

372
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,820
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.

373
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,580
But let's not talk about him.

374
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,679
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.

375
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,140
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.

376
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,399
I haven't caught any the last few nights.

377
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
Hope you catch lots too.

378
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,079
Thank you very much.

379
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,020
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,

380
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,559
I'm gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms.

381
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
Out of the window.

382
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
I want you to know that.

383
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,300
My room is on the first floor.

384
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,439
WOMAN: "I hope I catch
some loners today," she said.

385
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,460
"And I hope you catch lots too."

386
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,020
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,

387
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,959
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,

388
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,220
320, maybe, or one higher up.

389
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,319
480, that would be even better.

390
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,519
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.

391
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,580
He then looked out at the woods

392
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,239
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.

393
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,199
Not bad. Bit higher.

394
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?

395
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,399
A lobster.

396
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,039
(GUNSHOT)

397
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,319
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

398
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,260
Why don't you become parrots too?

399
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,820
And then we'll all be together.

400
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,660
You're a complete idiot,

401
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,460
picking one of the few animals
that can talk

402
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,940
when you have a speech impediment.

403
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,540
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

404
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,500
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

405
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,380
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,

406
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,540
and they'll suck out what little flesh
you have with their mouths.

407
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
You're pathetic, both of you.

408
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,940
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.

409
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,660
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,

410
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,620
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.

411
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,639
Or when we're on one of our trips.

shaped like single people and not couples.

- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.

- Thank,
- (PAUSE)

420

- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

421
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,660
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

422
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,220
I like all strokes equally.

423
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
You know, I love breaststroke.

424
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,300
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,

425
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,340
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."

426
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,300
And then they laugh.

427
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,799
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.

428
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,039
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,

429
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,620
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.

430

- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.

Ah, no.

433
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,319
This happens to me all the time.

434
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,999
It's really, really annoying.

435

- Can I use a tissue?

Yes.

442

I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.

What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,

444
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,060
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal

445
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,999
or to have a nosebleed from time to time?

446
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,220
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.

447
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,180
- Exactly.
- Mm.

448

- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.

I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.

450
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,500
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.

451
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,759
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.

452
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,300
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room

453
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,700
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.

454
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,060
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,

455
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,420
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.

456

We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.

- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.

Well, I think you have quite dry hair.

474
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,660
The colour is OK, though.

475
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,439
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

476
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,719
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.

477
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,399
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.

478
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,220
And even if someday I lose my hair, there
are things I can do to get my hair back.

479
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,860
I can have a hair transplant.

480
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,660
- You can always tell when someone's
had a hair transplant. - I know.

481
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,620
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.

482
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,919
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.

483
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,399
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?

484
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,439
I'm still thinking about it.

485
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
Morning, ladies.

486
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,940
So today is your last day.

487
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,940
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.

488
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,860
What I always say in these situations is,

489
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,860
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...

490
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for example,
read a work of classic literature

491
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,020
or sing a song you really like.

492
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,980
It would be silly to choose

493
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,500
for example a walk in the grounds,

494
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,780
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

495
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,399
because those are things
you can do as an animal.

496
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,300
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,

497
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,319
which is really very touching.

498
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,980
"We always sat together at school.

499
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,220
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

500
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,479
because you always gave the best advice.

501
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,020
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,

502
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,020
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.

503
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,239
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

504
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,980
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,

505
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,900
because you're an admirable person,

506
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,559
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.

507
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,780
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.

508
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,199
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.

509
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,620
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.

510
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,220
I'll miss you.

511
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,020
And however many new girlfriends I make
in a few days when I move back into the city,

512
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,279
I don't think I'll find another as true."

513
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,380
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,

514

and Richard Dreyfus. Alone.

526

WOMAN: One day, as he was playing golf,

527
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,980
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend

528
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,220
that you do have feelings when you don't

529
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,959
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.

530
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,439
He also thought that he liked her accent,

531
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,879
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.

532
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
So he decided that she was the one.

533
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,140
During the hunt, he would follow her,

534
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,919
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,

535
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,540
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones.

536
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,159
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"

537
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,719
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,

538
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,319
"I hope he dies right away."

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,239
They turn you into the animal
no one wants to be.

630
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,780
I saw your partner running back that way.

631
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,740
He looked frantic.

632
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,759
Is everything OK?

633
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,860
WOMAN: At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,

634
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,540
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother.

635
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,559
Take her legs, please.

636
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,540
He thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again,

637
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,039
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach.

638
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,260
But then he thought
there wouldn't be much point,

639
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,820
because she was already unconscious

640
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,919
and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kicks, or the knife.

641
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,020
You have to shoot me
so they won't suspect I helped you.

642
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,980
A hotel maid helped him.

643
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,279
- He couldn't understand why she did it.
- (KEYPAD BEEPS)

644
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,439
So he decided to turn her into an animal.

645
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,559
He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.

646
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,060
I asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into,

647
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,100
but he always gave me the same answer:

648
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,119
"That's none of your concern."

649
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,919
That night, he left the hotel
once and for all.

650
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,359
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed.

651
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,239
But he was headed towards us.

652
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,079
This was the start of his new life.

653
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,879
And back then, he didn't know
how much it hurts to be alone,

654
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,260
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain-relief ointment on your back,

655
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,279
and you are constantly in pain.

656
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,940
I found him in the woods.

657
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,900
He escaped from the hotel.

658
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,919
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

659
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,959
- No.
- That's a pity.

660
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,460
We need a doctor around.

661
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,260
We had one, but they caught him
a couple of months ago.

662
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,279
I'm an architect.

663

That's OK.

664
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,100
So, welcome.

665
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,519
You can stay with us
for as long as you like.

666
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,100
You can be a loner until the day you die.
There is no time limit.

667
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,119
Thank you very much.

00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,980
By the way,

669
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,799
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.

670

And any such acts are punished.

671

Is that clear?

672
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,380
Can I have a conversation with someone?

673
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,340
Of course you can.

674
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,319
So as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that.

675
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,879
That applies to dance nights as well.

676
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,439
We all dance by ourselves,
that's why we only play electronic music.

00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,279
MAN: He can't speak.
He was given the Red Kiss.

679
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,220
What's the Red Kiss?

680
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,580
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,

681
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,580
and we forced them to kiss each other.

682
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,599
That was a couple of days ago now.

683
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,319
But the cuts were deep and they're still
in pain. They were flirting, you know.

WOMAN: Some punishments
are worse than other punishments.

685
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,119
Having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved.

686
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,260
And having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit

687
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,359
is worse than having your leg kicked.

688
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,700
The punishment I am afraid of
isn't the Red Kiss but another one,

689
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,559
that is called the Red Intercourse.

690
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,879
I have never seen it happen, but it's
not difficult to imagine what it means.

He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.

698
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,879
He seemed quite presentable.

699

together in the city,

with a large well-lit kitchen,

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,620
and I was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse.

706
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,999
And he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse.

707
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,540
And as he was fucking me,
a thug came into the kitchen,

708
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,180
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us,

709
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,319
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one.

710

Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.

786
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,820
My husband's away on a business trip.

787
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,239
Yeah, OK. Can I have a look?

788
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,199
Hands.

789
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,479
No dirt under her nails
or mud on her shoes.

791
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,740
- So your husband is away?
- Yes.

792
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,420
- Where?
- (MUFFLED REPLY)

793
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,559
Good morning, sir. Are you here alone?

794
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,380
Good morning, Officer.

795
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,340
No, I'm here with my partner.

796
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,239
She's inside one of the stores,
shopping right now.

797
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,879
Can I see your certificate, please?

798
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,919
My partner keeps it in her purse.

799
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,559
You see, I am losing it all the time.

800
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,460
I see.

801
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,479
And what store is she shopping in?

802
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,399
Oh, here she is.

803
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,060
I'm sorry, darling.

804
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,060
They had such a huge variety
of pain-relief ointment.

805
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,420
I bought you this one.
I hope it's the one you were looking for.

806
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,380
That's wonderful, dear.

807
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,399
Can I have my certificate, please?

808
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,940
Of course, darling.
Would you like to see mine also, Officer?

809
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,900
No, that's OK.

810
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,860
Thank you, sir.

811
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,220
- You have a good day.
- Thank you, Officer. You have a good day.

812
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,319
- Madam.
- Sir.

813
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,100
If I'm walking too slowly,
just say, and I'll pick up my pace.

814
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,119
This pace is fine.

815
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,340
Maybe don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palm's getting a little sweaty.

816
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,100
- Better?
- Yes.

817
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,639
Much better.

818
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,300
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?

819
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,119
Yes, contact lens solution
and a Parker Rollerball.

820
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,919
I didn't know you were short-sighted.

821
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,159
I'm short-sighted too.

Will you stay a few days?

824
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,700
I'm afraid not, Papa.

825
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,660
We're heading back again today.

826
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,119
Tomorrow I'm going away
on a business trip.

827
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,700
You know how demanding my job is.

828
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,479
Don't ask if I can stay a few days
every time I come.

829
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,399
Do you all work for the same company?

830
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

831
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,540
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.

832
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,559
Do you agree?

833
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,239
- It's a rather good company.
- It is.

834
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,079
- One of the best, I'd say.
- Mm.

835
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,940
The only problem with the job

836
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,119
is that I don't have enough time
for my wife and kids.

837
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,439
We have four beautiful children.

838
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,340
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

839
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,959
Thank you.

840
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,039
But even if we'd never had children,

841
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,199
I would never dream of leaving my wife.

842
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,119
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own,

843
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,940
we'd go on trips.

844
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,079
We'd go to Portofino in Italy
or go to a Greek island for the summer.

845
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,079
And so our relationship would be
as intense as it was at the start.

846
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,119
I love my wife so much

847
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,799
I could die for her.

848
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,399
That's how much I love her.

849
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,919
For your first day in the city,
you did great.

850
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,060
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.

851
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,559
Thank you very much.

852
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,159
When did you become short-sighted?

853
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,260
When I was 16.

854
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,700
You?

855
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,660
When I was 12.

856
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,319
What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?

857
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,159
I don't remember.

858
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,159
- Do you have astigmatism too?
- Yes.

859
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,519
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back

860
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,759
on the bits you can't reach on your own?

861
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,359
I'd like that.

862
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,740
Here?

863
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,700

Can I go to the yacht?

OK, then, so you take the yacht.

- No, I didn't know that.

Yes.

The weight's different
for men's and women's games,

893
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,380
but that's roughly how much it weighs.

No, but I'd like to find out.

His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.

He bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood, or something like that.

that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood,

904

but cherry juice or tomato ketchup
