But I'm not positive
it's gonna happen tonight.

97
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,020
Hello! He just had lunch
with his grandmother.

98
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,480
You know he got the rock.

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,650
Why else would she have flown in
from Newport?

100
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,730
It's not like she'd Fed Ex
a six-carat diamond.

101
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,350
Do you really think?

102
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,030
I can't believe
you're getting engaged!

103
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,410
Oh, my gosh...

104
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,030
you guys have to help me
pick out the perfect outfit.

105
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,080
Come on!

106
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,040
I think you should go
with the red.

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,710
It's the color of confidence.

108
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,040
I don't understand
why you're completely disregarding...

109
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
your signature color.

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,500
He's proposing. I can't look
like I would on any other date.

111
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,050
This is THE date--
the night I'll always remember.

112
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,430
I want to look special.

113
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,510
Bridal.

114
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,050
But not like I expect anything.

115
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,560
There's nothing I love more...

116
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,060
than a dumb blonde
with daddy's plastic.

117
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,020
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

118
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,070
Is this low-viscosity rayon?

119
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,230
Yes. Of course.

120
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,650
With a half-loop
top-stitching on the hem?

121
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,990
Absolutely. It's one of a kind.

122
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,080
It's impossible to use
a half-loop top-stitching...

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
on low-viscosity rayon.
It would snag the fabric.

124
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,660
And you didn't just get it in.

125
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,080
I saw it in the June Vogue
a year ago.

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,290
So if you're trying to sell it
for full price...

127
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,960
you picked the wrong girl.

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Girls, this is it.

129
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
In a few hours...

130
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,060
I'll be the future
Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello.

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,140
Wow. You look so beautiful.

133
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,260
So do you.

134
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,020
Let's get out of here.

135
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,540
Must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

136
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,720
God, you're so wonderful.
Elle, thank you.

137
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,180
Here's to us.

138
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,220
To us.

139
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,190
- Elle?
- Yes!

140
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,190
One of the reasons I wanted
to come here tonight...

141
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,190
was to discuss our future.

142
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,200
And I am fully amenable
to that discussion.

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Good. Well, you know how
we've been having...

144
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
all kinds of fun lately?
- Ya.

145
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Well, Harvard
is gonna be different.

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,210
Law school is
a completely different world...

147
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,880
and I need to be serious.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,210
Of course.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,210
I mean, my family expects a lot from me.

150
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,220
- Right.
- I expect a lot from me.

151
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
I plan on running
for office someday.

152
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,800
And I fully support that, Warner.
You know that, right?

153
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,220
Absolutely.
But the thing is...

154
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,230
if I'm going to be a senator
by the time I'm thirty...

155
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,230
I need to stop dicking around.

156
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,190
Warner, I completely agree.

157
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,450
Well that's why I think
it's time for us...

158
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,950
- Elle, pooh bear...
- Yes...

159
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,210
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

160
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
What?

161
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
I've been thinking about it,
and it's the right thing to do.

162
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,260
You're breaking up with me?

163
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
I thought you were proposing.

164
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Proposing?

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Elle, if I'm going to be
a senator...

166
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,850
Well I need to marry a Jackie,
not a Marilyn.

167
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,060
So you're breaking up with me
because I'm too blonde?

168
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,940
No. That's not entirely true.

169
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,280
Then what?
My boobs are too big?

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
Elle, your boobs are fine.

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
So when you said
that you would always love me...

172
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
you were just... dicking around?

173
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,870
Elle, I, I-- I do love you.

174
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,290
I just can't marry you.

175
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,750
You have no idea
of the pressure that I am under.

176
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,290
My family has
five generations of senators.

177
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,300
My brother's in the top three
at Yale Law.

178
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,260
And he just got engaged to
a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.

179
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,480
Bad salad.

180
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,320
Sweetie...

181
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Pooh bear?

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,280
It's not like I have a choice
here, sweetheart!

183
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,330
OK, you get the car,
I'll get the check.

184
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,700
I won't be having salad.

185
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,090
Come on, let me take you home.

186
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,890
No!

187
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Elle, believe me.
I never expected to do this...

188
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,350
but I think
it's the right thing.

189
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,350
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

190
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,350
Well, I have to think of my future...

191
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,350
and what my family expects
of me.

192
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,350
So you're breaking up with me...

193
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,360
because you're afraid
your family won't like me?

194
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,190
Everybody likes me.

195
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,360
Well, East Coast people are different.

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,110
What, just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly I'm white trash?

197
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,370
I grew up in Bel Air, Warner!

198
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,740
Across the street
from Aaron Spelling!

199
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,080
I think most people would agree
that's a lot better...

200
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
than some stinky old Vanderbilt!

201
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,920
I told you.
I need someone serious.

202
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,090
But I'm seriously in love
with you.

203
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Isn't that enough?

204
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,550
Pooh bear, just get in the car.

205
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,100
No.

206
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,100
You're gonna ruin your shoes.

207
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,500
OK.

208
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,910
Morning, Amy.

209
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,460
Elle, it's Amy.

210
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm-- I'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

211
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,460
- Sweetie, didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

212
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,840
It's terrible.
He dumped her.

213
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,050
Why me?

214
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,220
Because you're not gonna
remember anything after tonight.

215
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,930
Oh, you're wrong.

216
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,150
I will remember, no matter what.

217
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,900
And I'm never gonna lose you
again.

218
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,780
You couldn't.

219
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,820
You're a part of me.

220
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,240
I love you.

221
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,500
Liar!

222
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Honey,
you have to leave this room.

223
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
It's been, like, a week.

224
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
- So?
- Drink this.

225
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,510
What's the one thing that always makes us
feel better...

226
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,800
no matter what?

227
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,510
She had eight
grilled cheese sandwiches.

228
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,520
She stuffed them
in her mouth all at once.

229
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
It was so sad.

230
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,100
We all thought she'd be the first
to walk down the aisle...

231
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,940
and now she's totally adrift.

232
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,440
Totally.

233
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,530
She hasn't conditioned
her hair in, like, a week.

234
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,530
Maybe she's going
for the grunge look.

235
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,120
And like, her nails
are full-on chipped.

236
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,080
So trailer park.

237
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,870
[ She'll never get him back
with those cuticles ]

238
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,000
[ No shit.]

239
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,050
Oh, my God!
Do you know who this is?

240
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
No...

241
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,050
- That's Warner's older brother!
- Who?

242
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,560
Third year Yale Law student
Putnam Bowes Huntington III...

243
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,560
and his fiancee
Layne Walker Vanderbilt...

244
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,520
first year Yale Law."

245
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,570
This is the type of girl
that Warner wants to marry!

246
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,570
This is what I need to become
to be serious!

247
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,570
What?
Practically deformed?

248
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,540
No. A law student.

249
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,675
Elle?

250
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,590
Law school?

251
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,590
It's a perfectly
respectable place, daddy.

252
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,590
Honey,
you were first runner up...

253
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,590
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics
contest.

254
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,800
Why are you gonna
throw that all away?

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Going to Harvard
is the only way...

256
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm gonna get
the love of my life back.

257
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Sweetheart,
you don't need law school.

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Law school is for people...

259
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,610
who are boring and ugly
and serious.

260
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,740
And you, Button,
are none of those things.

261
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,200
Harvard Law School?

262
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,950
That's right.

263
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,290
But that's a top three school.

264
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,620
Oh, I have a 4.0.

265
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,590
Yes, but your major
is fashion merchandising.

266
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,590
Harvard won't be impressed that
you aced History of Polka Dots.

267
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,840
What are your back-ups?

268
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't need back-ups.
I'm going to Harvard.

269
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Well, then, you'll need...

270
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,650
excellent recommendations
from your professors.

271
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,645
OK.

272
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,400
And a heck
of an admissions essay.

273
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,650
Right.

274
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,030
And at least a 175
on your LSATs.

275
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
I once had to judge
a tighty-whitey contest...

276
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

277
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,620
Trust me, I can handle anything.

278
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,250
Thanks!

279
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,420
Welcome.

280
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Because I have-- I have a metrabolism--

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,640
- I have a really high metrab--
- It's metabol...

282
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,140
Oh, my God.

283
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,860
What are you doing?

284
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,270
Reading about the LSATs.

285
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,690
My cousin had that.

286
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,570
Apparently, you get
a really bad rash on your...

287
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,280
The LSATs are an exam.

288
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,700
Girls, I'm going to Harvard!

289
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,410
- You mean like on vay-kay?
- Let's all go!

290
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,620
Road trip!

291
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,040
No. I'm going
to Harvard Law School.

292
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,010
Why?

293
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,720
Elle, now, I know
you're upset about all this...

294
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,890
but can't you just take
a Percoset?

295
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
OK, once Warner sees me
as a serious law student...

296
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,730
he'll totally want me back.

297
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,730
It's a completely brilliant
plan!

298
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,930
But isn't it hard
to get into law school?

299
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,940
Well I had the highest GPA
in Delta Nu...

300
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,700
Oh, well.
Here, you're gonna need this.

301
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,740
Your scrunchy?

302
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,700
My lucky scrunchy.
It helped me pass Spanish.

303
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,250
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya...

304
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,750
a lap dance after the final.

305
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,300
Yeah... luckily.

306
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,565
Oh, hi!

307
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,770
My name is Elle Woods,
and for my admissions essay...

308
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,770
I'm gonna tell all of you
at Harvard...

309
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,520
why I'm gonna make
an amazing lawyer.

310
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,900
As president of my sorority...

311
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm skilled at commanding
the attention of a room...

312
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,360
and discussing
very important issues.

313
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,780
It has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff...

314
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,200
is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin...

315
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,790
to generic.

316
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,750
All those opposed to chafing
please say "aye".

317
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,500
A--neither type of opera...

318
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,380
or neither type of rap
is on sale.

319
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,300
B--neither type of jazz...

320
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
and neither type of opera
is on sale.

321
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
C--neither type of opera
and neither type of soul--

322
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,360
Party!
Delta Nu, we love you!

323
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm able to recall
hundreds of important details...

324
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,810
at the drop of a hat.

325
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,820
Hey, Elle,
do you know what happened...

326
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

327
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Why, yes, Margot, I do.

328
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Once again, we join Hope
in the search for her identity.

329
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,870
As you know, she's been
brainwashed by the evil Stefano.

330
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,910
Get set and go!

331
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,300
One forty-three.

332
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,110
I feel comfortable using
legal jargon in everyday life.

333
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,730
I object!

334
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,620
It's here!

335
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,870
- What?
- It's here!

336
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,070
The LSAT scores! It's here!

337
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,380
Open the scores!

338
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,210
What's the score?

339
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
- This is so exciting.
- Tell us!

340
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,220
What is it?

341
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,760
One seventy-nine!

342
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,360
One seventy-nine!

343
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,910
And that's why
you should vote for me...

344
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,870
Elle Woods,future lawyer
for the class of 2004.

345
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
She does have a 4.0 from CULA...

346
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,930
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

347
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,930
A fashion major?

348
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,930
Well, sir,
we've never had one before...

349
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,930
and aren't we always
looking for diversity?

350
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,940
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

351
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
She was in a Ricky Martin video.

352
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Clearly,
she's interested in music.

353
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,530
She also designed
a line of faux fur panties...

354
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,950
for her sorority's
charity project.

355
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,910
She's a friend to the animals
as well as a philanthropist.

356
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,210
Elle Woods...

357
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,670
welcome to Harvard.

358
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,030
Oh Bruiser, it's so exciting!
Look! Harvard!

359
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,790
Are you excited?

360
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
This is our new house
for the next three years.

361
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,790
Oh, are you thirsty?

362
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,210
OK, let's get you some water.

363
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,380
Sweetheart,
you just look parched.

364
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,800
Hey, Brad,
check out Malibu Barbie!

365
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,220
Where's the beach, honey?

366
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,060
Here you go.

367
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Good boy. Warner's gonna be
so excited to see you.

368
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Guys, this way.

369
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,980
- This ain't L.A.!
- Come on, Bruiser.

370
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,070
Yeah, check her out.
Look at the way she walks.

371
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,070
Oh, it's gonna be so exciting.

372
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,950
Now, don't be scared.
Everyone will love you.

373
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,790
Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.

374
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,380
Class schedule, map, book list.

375
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,090
Wait a second. My social events
calendar is missing.

376
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,700
Your what?

377
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Social events--
you know, mixers,formals...

378
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,190
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

379
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,470
OK, has Warner Huntington III
checked in yet?

380
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,010
Ah... no.

381
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,140
No. You know, maybe you should check
with the cruise director...

382
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,930
on the Lido deck.

383
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,420
OK, welcome to law school.

384
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
This is the part where
we go around in a circle...

385
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,130
and everyone says a little bit
about themselves.

386
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,530
Let's start with you.

387
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,130
My name is David Kidney.

388
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,130
I have a masters
in Russian literature...

389
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,140
a Ph.D in biochemistry...

390
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
and for the last
eighteen months...

391
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,100
I've been deworming orphans
in Somalia.

392
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,690
Awesome. What about you?

393
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,150
Hey. How you doin'?
I'm Enid Wexler.

394
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,150
I got a Ph.D. from Berkeley
in women's studies...

395
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,150
emphasis
in the history of combat...

396
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,160
and last year,
I single-handedly organized...

397
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
the march for
Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.

398
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
- Killer.
- Thanks. Good times.

399
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Aaron Mitchell.

400
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I graduated first in my class
from Princeton.

401
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,170
I have an I.Q. of 187...

402
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,170
and it's been suggested
that Stephen Hawking...

403
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,170
stole
his Brief History of Time...

404
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,170
from my fourth grade paper.

405
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,130
Cool.

406
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
- Me?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,850
OK. Hi. I'm Elle Woods
and this is Bruiser Woods...

408
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,350
and we're both
Gemini vegetarians.

409
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,190
I have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising...

410
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,190
from CULA, and I was
a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart...

411
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,190
president of my sorority,
Delta Nu...

412
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,530
and last year,
I was homecoming queen.

413
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Oh! Two weeks ago I saw
Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal...

414
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,990
and I talked her
out of buying...

415
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,540
this truly heinous
angora sweater.

416
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,500
Whoever said orange was the new
pink was seriously disturbed.

417
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,310
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

418
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,930
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

419
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,100
I totally look the part.

420
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,530
There is no way
she got in here on her own.

421
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:10,005
Hi!

422
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,530
Hi!

423
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,010
I totally forgot you go here.

424
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,270
What are you talking about?

425
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,940
I'm sorry.
Are you here to see me?

426
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,440
No, silly. I go here.

427
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,270
You go where?

428
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,650
Harvard. Law school.

429
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,860
You got into Harvard Law?

430
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
What, like it's hard?

431
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Oh, my gosh, Warner,
it'll be so great.

432
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,040
I'm planning this great mixer.
You have to help me.

433
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm thinking like
a luau or casino night.

434
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,630
It'll be just like senior year
except funner.

435
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,300
Time to go.
I have to go to class...

436
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
but meet me after
on the benches.

437
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,180
All right, bye!

438
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
A legal education
means you will learn...

439
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,700
to speak in a new language.

440
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,330
You will be taught
to achieve insight...

441
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,330
into the world around you...

442
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,290
and to sharply question
what you know.

443
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,340
The seat you have picked
will be yours...

444
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,930
for the next nine months
of your life.

445
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,510
And those of you
in the front row...

446
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,270
beware.

447
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,940
"The law is reason
free from passion."

448
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,070
Does anyone know
who spoke those immortal words?

449
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,450
- Yes?
- Aristotle.

450
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,370
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

451
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,920
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

452
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,960
I think so.

453
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,510
What about his life?

454
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,390
I don't know.

455
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,020
Well, I recommend
knowing before speaking.

456
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,780
The law leaves much room
for interpretation...

457
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,990
but very little for self-doubt.

458
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,950
And you were right.

459
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,990
It was Aristotle.

460
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,410
Good job.

461
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,420
Now, I assume all of you
have read pages 1-48...

462
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,420
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

463
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Who can tell us about
Gordon vs. Steele?

464
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,390
Let's call on someone
from the hot zone.

465
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,530
Elle Woods?

466
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,410
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

467
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,470
Vivian Kensington.

468
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,430
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

469
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I don't.

470
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class...

471
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,490
and to return
only when she is prepared?

472
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,360
Absolutely.

473
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,510
Now, Ms. Kensington...

474
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,510
did diversity jurisdiction
exist in this case?

475
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,850
No, it did not.

476
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Good. How about in the case
of Owens vs. McCullogh?

477
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I can't believe that girl.

478
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,980
So stupid!

479
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,530
Who does she think she is?

480
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,240
Excuse me. Are you OK?

481
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Do they put you on the spot
like that all the time?

482
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,540
The professors?

483
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,550
They tend to do that.
Socratic method.

484
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,550
If you don't know the answers,
they just kick you out?

485
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,550
You have Stromwell, huh?

486
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,550
Yes!
Did she do that to you, too?

487
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,560
No.
But she did make me cry once.

488
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Not in class. I waited
till I got back to my room...

489
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
but she'll kick you
right in the ball--

490
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Or wherever, you know.

491
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
She's really tough.

492
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,570
Great.

493
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,570
Don't worry, it gets better.
Who else do you have?

494
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,950
I have Callahan, Royalton,
and Levinthal.

495
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,580
Let's see, speak up
in Callahan's class.

496
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,580
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

497
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,580
And in Royalton's class...

498
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,580
try to get a seat in the back.

499
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,590
He spits when he talks
about products liability.

500
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,590
And for Levinthal, make sure
you read the footnotes.

501
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,260
That's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions.

502
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,930
Right.

503
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,930
Wow.
I'm really glad I met you.

504
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,610
Are you a third year?

505
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,610
- Well--
- Hey, Elle.

506
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,900
Hi!
Thanks for all your help.

507
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,650
Good luck.

508
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,790
So...

509
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,620
how was your first class?

510
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,620
It was good, except for
this horrible preppy girl...

511
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,040
who made me look bad
in front of the professor.

512
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,630
But no biggie.

513
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,630
You're here now.
So, how was your summer?

514
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,630
Good. It was good.

515
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,130
Did you do anything exciting?

516
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Have you met Vivian?

517
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,600
Hi. Vivian Kensington.

518
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Do you know her?

519
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,780
- She's--
- I'm his fiancee.

520
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,660
I'm sorry.
I just hallucinated. What?

521
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,670
She was my girlfriend
in prep school.

522
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,670
And, well, we got back together
this summer...

523
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,670
at my grandmother's
birthday party.

524
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,670
Warner told me all about you.

525
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,680
You're famous at our club.

526
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,850
But he didn't tell me
you'd be here.

527
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,390
Pooh bear,
I didn't know she would be here.

528
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,150
Excuse me.

529
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,170
Oh, thank God!

530
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,730
Are you free?
It's an emergency.

531
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,730
Bad day?

532
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,020
You can't even imagine.

533
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,740
Spill.

534
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,740
I worked so hard
to get into law school.

535
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,740
I blew off Greek week
to study for the LSATs.

536
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
I even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

537
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,750
All to get
my boyfriend Warner back.

538
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,750
And now he's engaged
to this awful girl Vivian...

539
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,750
so it was all for nothing,
and I...

540
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,750
I just wish...

541
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,630
I just wish
I had never gone to Harvard.

542
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,760
After you went
to all that trouble.

543
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
He's engaged!

544
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
She's got
the six-carat Harry Winston...

545
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,060
on her bony, unpolished finger.

546
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,900
What am I supposed to do?

547
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,190
You're asking the wrong girl.

548
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,780
I mean, I'm with my guy
eight years...

549
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
and then one day, it's...

550
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I met someone else.
Move out.

551
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Oh, no. That's awful.

552
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,750
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby Rufus.

553
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,630
I didn't even get to throw him
a birthday party.

554
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,960
What's a girl to do?

555
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,800
He's a guy
who followed his pecker...

556
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
to greener pastures...

557
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
and I'm a middle-aged
high-school dropout...

558
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,810
who's got stretch marks
and a fat ass.

559
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,810
That's terrible.

560
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,770
Yep. Happens every day.

561
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,820
So what's this Vivian got
that you don't have?

562
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Three tits?

563
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,820
She's from Connecticut.

564
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
She belongs
to his stupid country club.

565
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,410
Is she as pretty as you?

566
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,450
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights, but...

567
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,790
she's not completely
unfortunate looking.

568
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,840
Hello, ladies.

569
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Hey, there?

570
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,090
How you doing? Sign here.

571
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,850
Oh, jeez.

572
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,850
Look what I did.

573
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,190
- See you later.
- Bye-bye, sugar.

574
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,850
Aw, shit.

575
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,860
Could I have been
any more goddamn spastic?

576
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,360
It's OK.

577
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,200
Are you sure this
Warner guy is, like, the one?

578
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,830
Definitely. I love him.

579
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,870
Well, if a girl like you
can't hold on to her man...

580
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,840
then there sure as hell isn't
any hope for the rest of us.

581
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,630
What are you waiting for?

582
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,930
Steal the bastard back.

583
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,890
I should warn you...

584
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,890
that in addition to competing
against each other...

585
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,900
for the top grade
in this class...

586
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,900
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's...

587
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,900
highly coveted four
internship spots next year...

588
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,780
where you will get to assist
on actual cases.

589
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,030
Let the bloodbath begin.

590
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,710
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

591
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,250
Ms. Woods...

592
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
would you rather have a client
who committed a crime...

593
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,880
malum in se
or malum prohibitum?

594
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,930
Neither.

595
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,930
And why is that?

596
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,890
I would rather have a client
who's innocent.

597
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,900
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

598
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Ms. Kensington,
which would you prefer?

599
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,950
Malum prohibitum.

600
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,950
Because then the client
would have committed...

601
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,950
a regulatory infraction as
opposed to a dangerous crime.

602
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,960
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

603
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,960
You've obviously done
your homework.

604
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Now let us look
at malum prohibitum...

605
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
a little more closely.

606
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,970
It has been said--
Yes, Ms. Woods?

607
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,970
I changed my mind.
I'd pick the dangerous one...

608
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,270
'cause I'm not afraid
of a challenge.

609
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,150
Who is that?

610
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,950
Wow.

611
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,160
Guys.

612
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,710
- Can she play?
- Hi!

613
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,710
Get outta here.

614
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,430
- Hi, everybody.
- Elle, what are you doing here?

615
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,220
I've come to join
your study group.

616
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,770
And look, I brought sustenance.
Who's first?

617
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,770
Our group is full.

618
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Is this like an RSVP thing?

619
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,030
No. It's like
a smart people thing.

620
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,030
And as Viv said, we're full.

621
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,320
Come on guys, we can make room
for one more.

622
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,790
We've already assigned
the outlines.

623
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,910
The answer is no.

624
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,010
Oh, OK.
I'll just leave, then.

625
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Hey, maybe
there's, like, a sorority...

626
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
you could, like,
join instead, like?

627
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
If you had come
to a rush party...

628
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,070
I would have at least
been nice to you.

629
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,070
Is that before
you voted against me...

630
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,070
and then called me a dyke
behind my back?

631
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,240
I don't use that word.

632
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,200
You must have heard it
from Vivian.

633
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

634
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,110
It's Elle! Guess what
I'm doing right this second!

635
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,110
I don't know. What?

636
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,110
I'm picking out
my wedding dress!

637
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,450
- What?
- Josh proposed!

638
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,620
Did you get the rock yet?

639
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,120
Almost.

640
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Well, hurry up,
so you can come home!

641
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
We miss you!

642
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,130
I miss you guys, too.
The people here are so vile.

643
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,130
Hardly anybody speaks to me--

644
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,130
Oh, my God!
I almost forgot to tell you!

645
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,130
What?

646
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,140
I got bangs!
My hair is so now.

647
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Really?

648
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
OK, so just listen to me.

649
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Keep June 1st open,
you're one of my bridesmaids...

650
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
and give Warner our love...

651
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,110
because I'm getting married!

652
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
So don't forget. Eight o'clock
at 45 Dunston Street.

653
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
- It'll be a really nice party.
- We'll be there.

654
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,170
And don't forget
to bring your own merlot!

655
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,170
No way! Is somebody at this
school actually having a party?

656
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,670
Yes...

657
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,720
But it's a costume party.

658
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,300
You probably
wouldn't want to come.

659
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,100
I love costume parties.

660
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,480
Well, then I guess
we'll see you there.

661
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,900
Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.

662
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,670
Oh, my God!

663
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,190
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is super fun.

664
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,240
Nice outfit.

665
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I like your outfit, too.

666
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Except when I dress up
as a frigid bitch...

667
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,200
I try not to look
so constipated.

668
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Oh, she's horrible.

669
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,710
You've got the ring, sweetie.

670
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
- Nice ears.
- How you doin'?

671
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Warner,
the English language...

672
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
is all about
subliminal domination.

673
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Take the word semester.

674
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
A perfect example
of this school's...

675
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,270
discriminatory preference
of semen to ovaries.

676
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,270
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term...

677
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,270
be referred to
as the winter ovester.

678
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,270
- Excuse me. Hey, Warner.
- Wow!

679
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,280
Don't you look like
a walking felony?

680
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Thank you. You're so sweet.

681
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Are you having fun?

682
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I am now.
What's with the costume?

683
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,290
I just decided to dress up.

684
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,290
Really.

685
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,290
I feel like we barely
get to see each other...

686
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,290
since we've been here.

687
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,290
I know. I'm so busy with
these case studies and hypos.

688
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,300
I know what you mean.
I can't imagine doing...

689
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
all this and Callahan's
internship next year.

690
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
That's gonna be so much.

691
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Elle, come on,
you'll never get the grades...

692
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,060
to qualify
for one of those spots.

693
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,640
You're not smart enough,
sweetie.

694
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,310
Wait, am I on glue...

695
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,310
or did we not get into
the same law school?

696
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,320
Yeah, but--

697
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
But what?
We took the same LSATs...

698
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
and we're taking
the same classes.

699
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I know, but come on,
Elle, be serious.

700
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,080
You can do something
more valuable with your time.

701
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,130
I'm never going to be
good enough for you, am I?

Ms. Woods?

740
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,410
Don't you need to have evidence?

741
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,990
Meaning?

742
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,410
Meaning you need
reasonable belief...

743
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,830
that your claim should have,
like, evidenciary support?

744
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,010
And what kind of evidenciary support...

00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,420
And what kind of evidenciary support...
# Bet you don't think I can take it #

does this case require?

You just thought
you could come here...

and show me what
I'm definitely not missing?

That's not why I came by.

How many times
you gonna come over here...

to take you back, huh?

Who's asking?

00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm Elle Woods.
Miss Bonifante's attorney.

796
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,540
And I'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

797
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,130
Come again?

798
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,550
Do you understand what
subject matter jurisdiction is?

799
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,550
- No.
- I didn't think so.

800
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,560
Well, due to habeas corpus...

801
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,560
you and Miss Bonifante
had a common law marriage...

802
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,560
which heretofore
entitles her...

803
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,560
to what is
legally referred to...

804
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,570
as equitable division
of the assets.

805
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,570
Come again?

806
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,570
Due to the fact that you've
retained this residence...

807
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,580
Miss Bonifante is entitled...

808
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,580
to full canine
property ownership...

809
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,750
and will be enforcing
said ownership right now.

810
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,880
Tell him, Paulette.

811
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,550
I'm taking the dog, dumbass!

812
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,470
That's awesome! We did it!

813
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Come here.

814
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,610
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?

815
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,940
He's probably still
scratching his head.

816
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,570
Which must be a nice vacation
for his balls.

817
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,080
Thank you.

818
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,630
According to
Swinney vs. Neubert...

819
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,630
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor...

820
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,640
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms...

821
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,640
with the hours
set forth by the parents.

822
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,640
So, if we're sticking
to past precedent...

823
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,640
Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

824
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,650
He was clearly within his rights
to ask for visitation.

825
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,650
But Swinney was
a one-time sperm donor...

826
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,650
and our defendant
was an habitual sperm donor...

827
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,660
who also happens to be
harassing the parents...

828
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,660
in his quest for visitation.

829
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,660
But without this man's sperm...

830
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,660
the child in question
wouldn't exist.

831
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,960
Now you're
thinking like a lawyer.

832
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,340
Yes, Ms. Woods?

833
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,670
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point...

834
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,880
I have to wonder
if the defendant...

835
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,680
kept a thorough record
of every sperm emission...

836
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,350
made throughout his life.

837
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,640
Interesting. Why do you ask?

838
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,690
Unless the defendant
attempted to contact...

839
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,690
every single one-night stand
to determine...

840
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,690
if a child resulted
in those unions...

841
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,700
he has no parental claim
over this child whatsoever.

842
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Why now? Why this sperm?

843
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,700
I see your point.

844
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,700
And for that matter,
all masturbatory emissions...

845
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,710
where his sperm was clearly
not seeking an egg...

846
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,710
could be termed
reckless abandonment.

847
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,050
I believe
you've just won your case.

848
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,510
Ms. Woods, you did well today.

849
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,140
Really?

850
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,720
You're applying
for my internship, aren't you?

851
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,730
I don't know.

852
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,810
You should.
Do you have a resume?

853
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,020
Yes, I do.

854
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,900
Here it is.

855
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,700
It's pink.

856
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
And it's scented.

857
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,410
I think it gives
it a little something extra.

858
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,660
Don't you think?

859
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,040
See you next class.

860
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,750
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said...

861
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,760
I think I'll go
to law school today.

862
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
That lapse in judgment aside...

863
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,760
I think
she's got a lot of potential.

864
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,140
Here's the Windham file.

865
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,260
Smell this.

866
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,060
What's that?

867
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,770
It's her resume.

868
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,060
Smells good.

869
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,800
What's going on?

870
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,380
Callahan's firm
is defending a murder trial.

871
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,640
His case load is so big,
he's taking first year interns.

872
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,810
He picked them already?

873
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,810
My God,
I can't believe it, Warner!

874
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,980
We got it!

875
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,110
That only leaves one for...

876
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,990
Me!

877
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,280
Yes!

878
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,840
Remember when we spent
those four amazing hours...

879
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
in the hot tub
after winter formal?

880
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Yeah--No.

881
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,680
This is so much better
than that!

882
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,850
Excuse me.
I have some shopping to do.

883
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,730
Four hours?

884
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,620
You look very nice today,
Vivian.

885
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,250
Thank you.

886
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,340
You're welcome.

887
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,890
We're defending
Brooke Windham...

888
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,890
whose very wealthy husband
was found shot to death...

889
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,900
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

890
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Gold digger?

891
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
You'd think so
since the stiff was 60...

892
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,900
but she was rich on her own.

893
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,900
Some kind of fitness empire.

894
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,910
You can buy her exercise tapes
on infomercials.

895
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,910
Are you talking about
Brooke Taylor?

896
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,910
Maiden name--Taylor.

897
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,290
You know her?

898
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,910
She's a Delta Nu!

899
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:08,920
She wasn't in my pledge class.

900
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,080
She graduated
four years before me.

901
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,920
But I used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

902
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,920
She's amazing!

903
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,920
Amazing? How?

904
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,930
She can make you lose
three pounds in one class.

905
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,930
She's completely gifted.

906
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,930
In all likelihood,
she's completely guilty.

907
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,930
She was seen standing over
her husband's dead body.

908
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:28,940
By who?

909
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,940
His 26-year-old daughter
and the pool boy.

910
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,940
Sorry, I'm late.
Excuse me.

911
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,940
This is Emmett Richmond,
another associate...

912
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,950
top three in his class...

913
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,950
and former editor of
"Harvard Law Review".

914
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,950
You've probably seen him...

915
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,950
lurking around campus
doing my research.

916
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:45,950
Thanks for the introduction.

917
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,960
What about the murder weapon?

918
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
The gun is missing.

919
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,710
The coroner said
he'd been dead 30 minutes...

920
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,960
when the cops arrived.

921
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Giving Brooke
plenty of time to stash it.

922
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,960
I just don't think
Brooke could have done this.

923
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,970
Exercise gives you endorphins.

924
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,630
Endorphins make you happy.

925
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,140
Happy people
don't shoot their husbands.

926
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,430
They just don't.

927
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,980
I didn't do it.

928
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,140
I walked in...

929
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,980
I saw my husband
lying on the floor...

930
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,570
I bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off...

931
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,150
then Enrique and Chutney
ran inside.

932
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,990
OK. Your step-daughter
and the pool boy came in...

933
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,990
where they saw you
standing over the body...

934
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,160
covered in his blood.

935
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,000
Why would I kill my husband?

936
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,120
Insurance, a love affair,
pure unadulterated hatred.

937
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,880
The D.A. will come up
with plenty of reasons.

938
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,880
I loved him.

939
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,010
He was 34 years older
than you.

940
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,010
That doesn't
look so good to a jury.

941
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,010
Then show them
a picture of his dick.

942
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,520
That might clear
a few things up.

943
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,190
Brooke, I believe you...

944
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,230
but a jury
is going to want an alibi.

945
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,020
I can't give you that...

946
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:02,030
and if you put me
on the stand, I'll lie.

947
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,570
Then I guess
we're done for today.

948
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,960
I know you.

949
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,960
I'm a Delta Nu,
and I'm a huge fan of yours.

950
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,630
You took my class in L.A.

951
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,220
You had the best high-kick
I've ever seen.

952
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,760
Are you one of my lawyers?

953
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,060
Sort of.

954
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,060
Well, thank God
one of you has a brain.

955
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,020
Let's go.

956
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,320
I'm the only one
that believes her.

957
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,070
Callahan totally thinks
she's guilty.

958
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,070
That's because men are
big fat retards who don't--

959
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,740
Afternoon, ladies.

960
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,700
It's him.

961
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Paulette Bonifante.

962
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,620
Oh, my God.

963
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,960
He's coming over here.

964
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,960
I've got a package.

965
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,840
He's got a package.

966
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,860
How you doing today?

967
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,030
Fine.

968
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,870
Take it easy.

969
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,580
See you later.

970
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
That's great, Paulette.

971
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,130
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

972
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,090
No. Sometimes I say
"OK" instead of "fine".

973
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,130
Why don't you offer him
a cold beverage...

974
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,140
or a neck massage
or something?

975
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,140
What's the point?

976
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:55,140
Trust me, Paulette.
You have all the equipment...

977
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,140
you just need
to read the manual.

978
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,730
Do you know what I'm saying?

979
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,150
OK. I'll show you
a little maneuver...

980
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,150
my mother taught me
in junior high.

981
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,150
In my experience,
it has a 98% success rate...

982
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,150
of getting a man's attention...

983
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,160
and when used appropriately...

984
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,160
it has an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

985
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
Wow!

986
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,160
It's called "the bend and snap".

987
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,580
Watch this.

988
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,170
Oh! I think I dropped
something on the floor.

989
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,180
So you bend... and snap!

990
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,760
See?

991
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,720
Come on. You try it.

992
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,940
Bend... and snap!

993
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,770
OK...

994
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,190
a little less bend,
a little more snap.

995
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,900
Like this?

996
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,190
Good snap.

997
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,990
Come on.

998
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,200
You! Come on, you can do it.

999
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,950
Bend... and snap.

1000
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Very, very good.

1001
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,370
We can all do it!

1002
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,210
- Come on, guys.
- I can't do that.

1003
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,210
You're gonna bend...

1004
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,210
and snap!

1005
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,210
Now put your head into it.

1006
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,220
Bend... and snap!

1007
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,220
Bend... and snap! Good job!

1008
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,220
A little attitude, please.

1009
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,230
Now, everybody smile.
That's very important.

1010
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,230
Pump! Pump! Pump!

1011
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,230
Bend... and snap!

1012
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,230
Good job, everybody!

1013
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,240
Work it out! Work it out!

1014
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,200
That's it! Wow!

1015
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,410
Come on, Paulette!

1016
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,250
Bend and snap!

1017
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,210
Oh, my God! The bend and snap!
Works every time!

1018
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,260
If Brooke didn't kill the guy,
then who did?

1019
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,260
My money is on the angry
daughter or the ex-wife.

1020
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,260
Chutney has a trust fund.

1021
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
She didn't need the insurance
pay off or the inheritance.

1022
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,260
What about the mother?

1023
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,270
Covered.
She was in Aspen at the time.

1024
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,270
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

1025
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,270
Ten people saw her
downing cosmopolitans...

1026
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,270
at the Caribou Club.

1027
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,270
All I know is it's not Brooke.

1028
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,820
That's touching,
but we need an alibi.

1029
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,280
I brought you
some necessities--

1030
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,280
some Calvin Klein
720-count sheets...

1031
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,290
the entire Clinique
skin care line...

1032
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,250
some aromatherapy candles,
a loofah...

1033
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,290
And the Bible.

1034
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,840
You're an angel.

1035
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,300
So how are you?
Are you all right?

1036
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,300
You look so... orange.

1037
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,300
I'm just glad
it's you and not Callahan.

1038
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,310
He means well.
He's very brilliant.

1039
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,730
He better be for what
I'm paying for him.

1040
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,310
I have to tell you
the real reason I came here.

1041
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,320
Professor Callahan says
we really need your alibi.

1042
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,280
Elle, I can't.

1043
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,320
You don't understand.

1044
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,330
Who could understand
better than me?

1045
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,330
It's so shameful.

1046
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,500
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

1047
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,920
That's just it.
It would ruin me.

1048
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,630
How?

1049
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,340
I've made my fortune
on the ability...

1050
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,350
to perfect women's bodies with
Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.

1051
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,720
I know, you helped me
go from a six to a four.

1052
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,470
That's great!

1053
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,480
On the day of
Heyworth's murder...

1054
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,570
I was getting...

1055
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,580
What?

1056
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,330
I was getting liposuction.

1057
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,370
Liposuction!

1058
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,370
Oh, God!

1059
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,370
I know! I'm a fraud!

1060
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,960
It's not like normal women
can have this ass!

1061
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,800
If my fans
knew that I bought it...

1062
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,880
I would lose everything!

1063
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,680
I've already lost my husband.

1064
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,970
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

1065
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,980
Brooke...
your secret's safe with me.

1066
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,320
Thank you.

1067
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,410
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

1068
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,410
We got two interviews
tomorrow...

1069
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,410
that Gerard and Bobby
will handle.

1070
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,410
The ex-wife in an hour.

1071
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,410
According to this communique
from the prison...

1072
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,420
our client apparently
had a visit from her sister...

1073
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,380
a Miss Delta Nu.

1074
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,620
Anyone you know?

1075
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,550
Yes. I went to visit her.

1076
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,840
What the hell do you mean
you went to visit her?

1077
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,430
I went to get her alibi.

1078
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,800
Did you get it?

1079
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,760
It's really good.

1080
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,430
Great. What is it?

1081
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,440
Oh, I can't tell you.

1082
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,440
Why the hell not?

1083
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,440
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret...

1084
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,440
and I can't break the bonds
of sisterhood.

1085
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,740
Screw sisterhood!
This is a murder trial...

1086
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,240
not some scandal
at the sorority house.

1087
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,610
I want the alibi!

1088
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,450
I can't give it to you...

1089
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,450
but I can tell you
she is innocent.

1090
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,460
Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham Vandermark
is on line two for you.

1091
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,460
Someone reason with her
while I take this.

1092
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,460
Are you crazy?
Just tell him the alibi.

1093
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,810
No!

1094
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,660
We're gonna lose this case
if you don't.

1095
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,470
Then we're not
very good lawyers.

1096
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,720
If you tell him, he'll probably
hire you as a summer associate.

1097
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,060
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

1098
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,940
I gave her my word, Warner.

1099
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,360
So what?

1100
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,490
The ex-wife seems
to be unconcerned...

1101
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,490
with the fact
that her interview is today.

1102
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,490
She's at a spa
in the Berkshires.

1103
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:47,490
A spa? Isn't that
like your mothership?

1104
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,500
I could go if you want me to.

1105
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,920
Emmett? Go with her.

1106
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,180
She seems completely
untrustworthy to me.

1107
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,510
Why?

1108
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,520
I mean, this is a person
who's made her living...

1109
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
by telling women
that they're too fat.

1110
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,520
Brooke would never tell
a woman that she was too fat.

1111
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,940
And, she seems to me like
she's hiding something.

1112
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,860
But maybe it's not what you think.

1113
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:21,430
Maybe it's exactly what I think.

1114
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,360
You're really being a butthead.

1115
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,920
A butthead?

1116
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,160
Why would you call me that?

1117
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,540
You know, I mean, you just need to have
a little more faith in people.

1118
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,370
You might be surprised.

1119
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,920
I can't believe
you called me a butthead.

1120
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,550
No one's called me that
since the ninth grade.

1121
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,260
Maybe not to your face.

1122
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,050
So this is what a spa
looks like. Wow.

1123
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,220
How do we find her?

1124
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,970
I called ahead.
She's in the mud room.

1125
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,890
She's not naked, is she?

1126
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,730
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

1127
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,570
So you found me.

1128
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,570
We're from Austen, Platt,
Jaret, and Callahan...

1129
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:07,570
and we're here to ask you
a few questions.

1130
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,990
So I hear that little tart
from California...

1131
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,750
shot poor Heyworth.

1132
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,830
That's what we're trying
to prove didn't happen.

1133
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,920
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

1134
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,590
I've never
actually met the woman...

1135
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,590
but my daughter tells me...

1136
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,050
she can be
quite the little bitch.

1137
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,180
Did your daughter
ever mention anything...

1138
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,060
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

1139
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:34,810
She did say that
they humped like gorillas.

1140
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,610
I guess it wasn't enough,
though,for Brooke.

1141
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,610
Why do you say that?

1142
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,980
Well...

1143
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,360
haven't you seen
the cabana boy?

1144
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:47,610
She's lying.

1145
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,620
And you know this for a fact?

1146
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,620
Did you see the icky
brown color of her hair?

1147
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,620
So? Now you discriminate
against brunettes?

1148
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,630
Why not? I'm discriminated
against as a blonde.

1149
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,630
You know, being a blonde is actually
a pretty powerful thing.

1150
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,630
You hold more cards
than you think you do.

1151
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,630
And I personally would like
to see you take that power...

1152
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,890
and channel it
towards the greater good.

1153
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,060
Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1154
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,970
All right.

1155
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,810
How do you think
I'd look as a blonde, you know?

1156
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,650
I'm not sure
you could handle it.

1157
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,360
- Good night.
- Bye.

1158
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,080
So, I called your room
last night.

1159
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,660
I heard.

1160
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,660
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1161
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,670
No. You're a dork.

1162
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,420
I'm in law school.

1163
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,670
Look, I'm not going out
with you.

1164
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,670
I can't believe you'd even ask.

1165
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,680
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

1166
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,680
Let's get out of here.

1167
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,140
Excuse me.

1168
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,690
Why didn't you call me?

1169
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,690
What?

1170
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,440
We spent a beautiful
night together...

1171
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,980
and I never hear from you again?

1172
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,860
I...

1173
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,280
I'm sorry?

1174
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,490
Sorry for what?
For breaking my heart...

1175
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,700
or for giving me
the greatest pleasure...

1176
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,490
I've ever known and then
just taking it away?

1177
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,960
Both?

1178
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,120
Well, forget it.

1179
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,710
I've already spent too many hours
crying over you.

1180
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,670
So... when did
you want to go out?

1181
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,390
Come in.

1182
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,730
Are you done with
that deposition yet?

1183
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,730
Yeah. Here, take it.

1184
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:48,610
I've read it 20 times.

1185
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,540
You know, Elle,
I still can't believe...

1186
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,750
you didn't tell
Callahan the alibi.

1187
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,750
It's not my alibi to tell.

1188
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:09,420
I know.

1189
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,930
And I thought
that was very classy of you.

1190
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,550
Really?

1191
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:18,140
Sure.

1192
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,140
Thanks.

1193
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,780
Did you ever notice how
Callahan never asks Warner...

1194
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,570
to bring him his coffee?

1195
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,780
He's asked me at least
ten times.

1196
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,370
Men are helpless.
You know that.

1197
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,790
I know. Warner doesn't
even do his own laundry.

1198
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,790
He has to have it sent out.

1199
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,290
I know.

1200
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,800
Did you know
when he first applied...

1201
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,970
he got wait-listed.

1202
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,220
What?

1203
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,600
His father had to make a call.

1204
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,470
You're kidding.

1205
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,480
No way!

1206
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:12,320
God, that is
such a precious dog.

1207
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,070
His name is Bruiser.
Do you want to hold him?

1208
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,530
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

1209
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:23,000
Look, he likes you.

1210
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,750
He's giving me kisses.

1211
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,840
Thanks, Jeoff.

1212
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,840
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1213
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,840
She's charged with
the murder of her husband...

1214
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
Boston millionaire
Heyworth Windham.

1215
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,850
First to testify are the
victim's daughter and ex-wife.

1216
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,850
The Superior Court of Suffolk
County is now in session.

1217
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,850
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1218
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,310
You may be seated.

1219
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,870
And where was she exactly?

1220
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,490
Standing over
my father's dead body.

1221
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,080
And what was
the defendant doing?

1222
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,170
She was sitting
next to the pool, topless...

1223
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:12,000
while the Latin boy
handed her a drink.

1224
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,050
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

1225
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,180
My uniform.

1226
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,890
This is the uniform...

1227
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:28,310
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear
while cleaning her pool?

1228
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,650
Are you having an affair
with Brooke Windham?

1229
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,660
Define "affair".

1230
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,370
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1231
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,580
Yes. OK? Yes.

1232
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
court will reconvene...

1233
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,930
tomorrow morning at 9 A.M.

1234
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,720
We're adjourned.

1235
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,930
You know a Delta Nu would never sleep
with a man who wears a thong.

1236
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:07,770
Never!

1237
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,270
I just liked watching
him clean the filter.

1238
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,270
I believe you, Brooke.

1239
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,650
- Take care of me, Elle.
- I will.

1240
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,210
I got a big one for you.

1241
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,550
Can you sign?

1242
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,880
I got it.

1243
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,600
You broke his nose?

1244
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,020
I blew it, Elle.

1245
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,100
My snap was
all over the place.

1246
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,020
I'll be there
as soon as court is out.

1247
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,810
We have to
cross-examine Enrique.

1248
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,020
But don't worry.
My girlfriend Serena...

1249
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,030
barfed on a guy during
"The Blair Witch Project"...

1250
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,280
and they ended up dating
for three months.

1251
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,200
Really?
All right. Bye-bye.

1252
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,700
OK. Bye.

1253
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,420
Don't stomp your little
last-season Prada shoes at me.

1254
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,760
These aren't last season.

1255
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,060
- He's gay! Enrique's gay!
- What?

1256
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,270
What kind of shoes are these?

1257
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,400
Black ones.

1258
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
- See!
- What are you talking about?

1259
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,900
He isn't Brooke's lover.
He's making it up.

1260
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,070
Back up.
How do you know he's gay?

1261
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:29,200
Gay men know designers.
Straight men don't.

1262
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,410
Know what?

1263
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,830
He left a Cher tape
in the pool house one time.

1264
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,500
While I appreciate
your masterful legal theory...

1265
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,170
I have a murder trial
to attend to.

1266
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:46,680
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.

1267
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,180
The court will come to order.

1268
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,980
Mr. Salvatore,
do you have any proof...

1269
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,530
that you and Mrs. Windham
were having an affair?

1270
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,110
Only the love in my heart.

1271
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:09,120
If that's all the proof
that he has, Your Honor...

1272
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,660
I think I'm done here.

1273
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:12,450
You may step down.

1274
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,870
I'd like to ask a couple
of questions, Your Honor.

1275
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,170
Just give me a couple minutes.

1276
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,550
Did you ever take
Mrs. Windham on a date?

1277
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,760
- Yes.
- Where?

1278
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,550
A restaurant where
no one could recognize us.

1279
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,550
How long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1280
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,550
Three months.

1281
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,260
- And your boyfriend's name is...
- Chuck.

1282
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,150
Silence!

1283
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,560
Pardon me!

1284
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,560
Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1285
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,730
I was confused.

1286
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,740
I thought you said friend.
Chuck is just a friend.

1287
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,160
You bitch!

1288
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,160
Chuck, wait!

1289
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:55,120
Silence in my court!
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1290
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,170
Silence in my courtroom!

1291
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:03,170
How did I miss that?
You were great.

1292
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,460
Silence in my courtroom!

1293
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,630
Thanks.

1294
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,890
- Good night.
- Good night.

1295
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,600
Oh, Elle, Callahan asked to see you
before you leave.

1296
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,360
Really?

1297
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,610
Yeah, you know, he already had his coffee,
but maybe he needs a doughnut.

1298
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,190
- Do you need any help?
- No. I'm fine.

1299
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:29,820
OK. Bye.

1300
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,870
Come on in.

1301
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,710
Sit down.

1302
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,300
Is everything all right?

1303
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,220
You followed
your intuition today...

1304
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,720
and you were right on target.

1305
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,020
I should have listened.

1306
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,230
Thank you.

1307
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,860
About the alibi...

1308
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:04,810
I'm sorry--

1309
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,230
I'm impressed that you took
the initiative to go get it.

1310
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,240
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1311
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,320
And on top of that,
you gained the client's trust...

1312
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,240
and kept it -- that's what
makes a great lawyer.

1313
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,080
You're smart, Elle.

1314
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,540
Smarter than most of
the guys on my payroll.

1315
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,830
Wow.

1316
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,670
I think it's time
to discuss your career path.

1317
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,260
Have you thought about where
you might be a summer associate?

1318
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,260
Not really.

1319
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,260
I know it's very competitive.

1320
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,850
You know what competition's
really about?

1321
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,980
It's about ferocity, carnage.

1322
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,530
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1323
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,280
Knowing exactly what you want...

1324
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,280
and how far you'll go
to get it.

1325
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,790
How far will Elle go?

1326
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,380
Are you hitting on me?

1327
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,460
You're a beautiful girl.

1328
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,460
So everything you just said...

1329
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,300
I'm a man
who knows what he wants.

1330
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,300
And I'm a law student
who just realized...

1331
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,640
her professor
is a pathetic asshole.

1332
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:21,310
Too bad. I thought
you were a law student...

1333
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,180
who wanted to be a lawyer!

1334
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,540
You almost had me fooled.

1335
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,330
What?

1336
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,500
Maybe you should sleep
with the jury, too.

1337
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,460
Then we can win the case.

1338
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,600
I'm quitting.

1339
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,770
Why?

1340
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,770
Law school was a mistake.
This whole internship was a mistake.

1341
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,780
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

1342
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,030
I didn't earn anything, Emmett.

1343
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,360
Callahan only gave me
that internship...

1344
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,820
because he liked the way
I looked.

1345
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,620
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

1346
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,910
Callahan did what?

1347
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,790
Just forget about it.
I'm going back to L.A.

1348
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,380
No more boring suits.
No more pantyhose.

1349
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,630
No more trying to be
something that I'm just--

1350
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,170
I'm just not.

1351
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:38,390
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

1352
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,390
The hell with Callahan.

1353
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,520
Stay.

1354
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:51,110
Call me if you're ever
in California.

1355
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,420
What's the point in staying,
Paulette?

1356
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:13,420
All people see
when they look at me...

1357
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,420
is blond hair and big boobs.

1358
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,840
No one's ever gonna
take me seriously.

1359
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,430
The people at law school don't.
Warner doesn't.

1360
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,390
I don't think my own parents
take me seriously.

1361
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,440
I just felt, like,
for the first time...

1362
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,190
that someone expected me to...

1363
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,440
to do something more
with my life...

1364
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,820
than become
a Victoria's Secret model.

1365
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,950
But I was just kidding myself.

1366
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,870
Callahan never saw me
as a lawyer...

1367
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,450
just as a piece of ass.

1368
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,620
Just like everybody else.

1369
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,500
Turns out I am a joke.

1370
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,420
No, you're not a joke.

1371
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,470
The hell with law school.

1372
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,480
I just wanted to say good-bye.

1373
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:15,320
If you're going to let one
stupid prick ruin your life...

1374
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:24,240
you're not the girl
I thought you were.

1375
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:43,930
Did you go in there knowing how
to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1376
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:45,010
Absolutely.

1377
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:48,930
It's a little thing
I'd like to call strategy.

1378
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:52,520
You know, I had a feeling
about Mr. Salvatore...

1379
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,940
Is he always such an ass?

1380
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,940
He's the top defense
attorney in the state.

1381
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,190
Of course he's an ass.

1382
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:00,360
Fine. Is he an ass
that's gonna win my case?

1383
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,530
No, he's an ass that's gonna try.

1384
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,360
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?

1385
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,990
That's not what's important.

1386
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,740
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

1387
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:12,040
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

1388
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,630
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1389
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,550
What's going on here?

1390
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,760
- Elle quit.
- What?

1391
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,550
Callahan hit on her,
so she quit.

1392
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,560
My God. Scumbag.

1393
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,060
- Oh, God.
- What?

1394
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:36,600
I feel terrible.
I made a huge mistake.

1395
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,700
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about it.

1396
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,450
Thank you.

1397
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:59,000
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

1398
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,590
Get up.

1399
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,010
What?

1400
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,680
You're fired.
I have new representation.

1401
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,300
Who?

1402
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,740
Excuse you,
you're in my way.

1403
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,620
She's a law student.
She can't defend you.

1404
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:40,460
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruling 3.03.

1405
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:43,630
See? Thank you, David.

1406
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,470
Counselors,
approach the bench.

1407
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,640
- You're not going up there.
- Yes, I am.

1408
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,640
I'm sorry, maybe you didn't hear me.
You're fired.

1409
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:56,600
Counselors, now.
All of you.

1410
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,360
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1411
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,650
Rule 3.03 of
Supreme Judicial Court...

1412
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,650
states that a law student
may appear on behalf...

1413
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:08,660
of a defendant
in criminal proceedings.

1414
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,070
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

1415
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,990
I do.
I'm not allowing it.

1416
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:15,660
But you agreed last night.
In your office...

1417
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,660
when we were discussing
my career.

1418
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,870
The ruling also states...

1419
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:23,670
that you need a licensed
attorney to supervise you.

1420
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,670
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

1421
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,680
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1422
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,680
Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1423
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,560
Thank you, Your Honor.

1424
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,860
Enjoy prison.

1425
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,700
Mrs. Windham, you do realize
what you're doing?

1426
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,620
Absolutely.

1427
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,790
Oh, my God! There she is!

1428
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:04,710
Elle! Elle, we came to see your trial!

1429
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,710
Oh look how cute.
There's like a judge and everything.

1430
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:11,720
- And jury people.
- Vote for Elle!

1431
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,140
Ladies, take a seat.

1432
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:14,600
Go, girl.

1433
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,730
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

1434
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,610
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1435
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,480
- I do.
- Be seated.

1436
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:30,280
Ms. Woods, you may begin
your questioning.

1437
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,740
First of all
I would like to point out...

1438
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,750
that not only is there
no proof in this case...

1439
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,750
but there is a complete
lack of mens rea...

1440
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,510
which by definition tells us
there can be no crime...

1441
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,590
without a vicious will.

1442
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,760
I am aware of the meaning
of mens rea.

1443
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,180
What I'm unaware of...

1444
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,760
is why you're giving me
a vocabulary lesson...

1445
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:59,770
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1446
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,930
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1447
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,650
Yes, Your Honor.

1448
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,270
Miss Windham...

1449
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:11,320
when you arrived
back at the house...

1450
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,990
was your father there?

1451
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,530
Not that I saw,
but like I said...

1452
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,790
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

1453
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:24,620
And when you came downstairs,
what happened?

1454
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,920
I saw Brooke
standing over his body...

1455
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,920
drenched in his blood.

1456
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,220
But Mrs. Windham
didn't have a gun?

1457
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,730
No. She'd stashed it
by then.

1458
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,390
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

1459
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,480
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

1460
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,400
Go ahead.

1461
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,490
Miss Windham,
did you hear a shot fired?

1462
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:00,370
No. I was in the shower.

1463
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,960
So, sometime
in the 20 minutes...

1464
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,000
that you were in the shower,
your father was shot.

1465
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:11,670
I guess.

1466
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,220
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

1467
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,800
but you didn't hear
the shot because...

1468
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,350
because you were in the shower?

1469
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:30,520
I was washing my hair.

1470
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,860
Where is she going with this?

1471
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,030
Have a little faith, Gerard.

1472
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,870
Miss Windham...

1473
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,210
what had you done
earlier that day?

1474
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,880
I got up...

1475
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,170
got a latte,
went to the gym...

1476
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,380
got a perm, and came home.

1477
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,050
Where you got in the shower?

1478
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,390
I believe the witness
has made it clear...

1479
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:06,100
that she was in the shower.

1480
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:13,320
Yes, Your Honor.

1481
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:17,490
Miss Windham, had you
ever gotten a perm before?

1482
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,740
- Yes.
- How many would you say?

1483
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,200
Two a year since I was 12.

1484
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,500
You do the math.

1485
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,290
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1486
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,170
We all tried
to talk her out of it.

1487
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,090
Curls weren't
a good look for her.

1488
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,510
She didn't have
your bone structure.

1489
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,130
But, thankfully,
that same day...

1490
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,510
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet t-shirt contest...

1491
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,930
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1492
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:47,350
Objection!
Why is this relevant?

1493
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,560
I have a point, I promise.

1494
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,350
Then make it.

1495
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,600
Yes, ma'am.

1496
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,940
Chutney, why were
Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined...

1497
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,690
when she got hosed down?

1498
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,950
Because they got wet?

1499
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,950
Exactly. Because isn't it
the first cardinal rule...

1500
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,950
of perm maintenance that you're
forbidden to wet your hair...

1501
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,200
for at least 24 hours
after getting a perm...

1502
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,910
at the risk of deactivating
the ammonium thioglycolate?

1503
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,960
And wouldn't somebody
who's had, say, 30 perms...

1504
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,380
in their life
be well aware of this rule?

1505
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:19,970
And if in fact
you weren't washing your hair...

1506
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,300
as I suspect, because
your curls are still intact...

1507
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,970
wouldn't you have heard
the gunshot?

1508
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,970
And if in fact
you had heard the gunshot...

1509
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:28,850
Brooke Windham wouldn't have
had time to hide the gun...

1510
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,980
before you got downstairs...

1511
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,980
which would mean you would
have had to have found...

1512
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,810
Mrs. Windham
with a gun in her hand...

1513
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,610
to make your story plausible.
Isn't that right?

1514
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,990
She's my age!
Did she tell you that?

1515
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:41,400
How would you feel if your
father married someone who was your age?

1516
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,990
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you Chutney,

1517
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,410
after you shot your father.

1518
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,830
I didn't mean to shoot him.

1519
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:49,950
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

1520
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Order! Order!

1521
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,130
Order!

1522
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,340
Oh, my God.

1523
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,710
Oh, my God.

1524
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,630
Oh, my God.

1525
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,430
Bailiff,
take the witness into custody...

1526
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:09,020
where she will be charged for
the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1527
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,020
In the matter of
The State vs. Brooke Windham...

1528
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,350
this case is dismissed.

1529
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,770
Mrs. Windham,
you are free to go.

1530
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,870
Thank you!

1531
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,120
Thank you!

1532
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,000
Elle, how did you know
Chutney was lying?

1533
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,170
Because she's brilliant,
of course.

1534
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:39,460
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

1535
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,510
Any Cosmo Girl
would have known.

1536
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,050
Elle, Elle!

1537
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,050
What?

1538
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,060
I just wanted to say...

1539
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:52,730
that you were
so brilliant in there.

1540
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,060
And that I was wrong.

1541
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:01,280
And you are the girl for me.

1542
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,700
- Really?
- Yes.

1543
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,870
Pooh bear... I love you.

1544
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:14,080
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

1545
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,500
But if I'm gonna be a partner at
a law firm by the time I'm 30...

1546
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,050
I need a boyfriend who's not
such a complete bonehead.

1547
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,890
Thank you, boys.

1548
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,730
Ladies and gentlemen...

1549
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:39,110
I present the graduates
of Harvard Law School...

1550
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,820
Class of 2004.

1551
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,110
[ Two years later ]

1552
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:47,740
I am personally
very honored to introduce...

1553
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,530
this year's
class-elected speaker.

1554
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:54,120
After getting off
to a quite interesting start...

1555
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,410
here at Harvard...

1556
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:59,130
she graduates today
with an invitation to join...

1557
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:02,550
one of Boston's
most prestigious law firms.

1558
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,340
I am sure we are going to see
great things from her.

1559
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elle Woods.

1560
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:35,000
On our very first day
at Harvard...

1561
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,160
a very wise professor
quoted Aristotle.

1562
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,750
"The law is reason
free from passion."

1563
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,590
Well, no offense
to Aristotle...

1564
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,590
but in my three years
at Harvard...

1565
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:50,590
I have come to find that passion
is a key ingredient...

1566
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:55,390
to the study and practice
of law, and of life.

1567
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,600
It is with passion,
courage of conviction...

1568
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,310
and strong sense of self...

1569
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:03,190
that we take our next steps
into the world...

1570
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,610
remembering
that first impressions...

1571
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,190
are not always correct...

1572
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,860
you must always have faith
in people...

1573
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,700
and most importantly...

1574
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,370
you must always have faith
in yourself.

1575
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:24,130
Congratulations, Class of 2004.

1576
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,420
We did it!

1577
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,450
Vivian dumped Warner.
She and Elle are now best friends.

1578
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:59,410
Warner graduated without honors,
without a girlfriend and without
any job offers.

1579
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:06,130
Paulette married the UPS guy.
They are expecting their first child,
a daughter to be named Elle.

1580
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,090
Emmett quit Callahan's firm and opened
his own practice.

1581
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:13,930
He and Elle have been
dating for the past two years.

1582
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,580
Emmett is proposing to Elle

1583
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,080
Emmett is proposing to Elle
tonight.
