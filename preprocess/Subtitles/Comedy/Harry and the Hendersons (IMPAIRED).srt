GEORGE: Survival
of the fittest, Son.

ERNIE: The law
of the forest, right?
Right.

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,240
Of course,
your new rifle gives you
a little edge.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,640
(WHISPERING)
Be real quiet.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
Lunch!

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,760
And I killed it!

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
Nancy!

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
Will you look at the size
of this thing?

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,760
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
I thought you said
we were leaving.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
Will this never end?

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,960
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving.
Before lunch.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,800
George, what happened to
"home before dark.
Grab a bite on the way"?

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,840
Come on, Nan,
we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
Yeah, it's my first blood.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
I hope
you're proud of yourself.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,360
Look, we'll stuff it. Okay?

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,160
You're a butcher, Ernie.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,680
Back off, Sarah!
It was him or me!

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
(SQUEALING)

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,280
SARAH:
I don't feel very good.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,880
ERNIE: Pull over, Dad,
she's gonna launch.
GEORGE: Ernest.

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
NANCY: Open the window, honey,
a little air
will do us all some good.

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,280
SARAH: It's the fish.
Ernie, close the cooler.

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,080
NANCY: Ernie, what are you
doing in the fish?

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Looking for
my baseball glove.

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Do you think I can get
a pair of real major league
baseball cleats

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,720
when we get back?
You bet.

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
Great. I'm gonna
spike Frankie McDowell.

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
NANCY: No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,040
But he spiked me twice!

37
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,320
That's different.
You go right ahead then.
George.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Nan, you don't understand
these things.
It's just smart baseball.

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Hey, hey.
Be careful of my drawings
back there.

40
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
And don't step
on the trout.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
Or my flowers.
They're still alive.
Or Mom's flowers.

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,920
Oh, Nan, don't you love
roughing it in the wild?

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,360
"Roughing it," George?

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
The only thing rough
about it was when

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,560
the generator went out
in the middle
of Masterpiece Theatre:

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,200
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Whoa!

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,320
George, please, slow down.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
I know these roads
like the back of my hand.

49
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,440
And I know Seattle's
not going anywhere.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
Want your sunglasses,
George?

51
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
No, I'm fine, dear.

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Mom, Ernie's playing
with that gun again.

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
Ernie, don't even
touch that gun.

54
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,400
It's a rifle, girls.

55
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,880
If you can shoot with it,
it's a gun.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Oh, my God! Look at that deer!
Did you see that, Sarah?

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,000
No, I missed it.
I always miss everything.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,600
Maybe there's a chance
you can blast something.

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,560
Ernie, don't give Daddy
any ideas. I could not
face two stuffed bunnies.

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,360
Did I bring my rifle
this time?

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
Did I? No.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,880
You're right, George,
we'll always remember this
as our first camping trip

64
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
when Ernie killed something
and you didn't.

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,560
My God!

66

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,200
My God.

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
I thought I hit a man!

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,640
Is everybody all right, Nancy?
Okay, kids?

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,640
Sarah, are you all right?
Yeah.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
George, what is it?

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,840
I don't know.
I hardly saw it.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
But it's gotta be a bear.

74
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,880
Could it be a gorilla?

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
I don't think
they get that big around here,

76
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
SARAH: I think we should
just get out of here, Dad.

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,200
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,160
If it's still alive,
it's probably not
in a very good mood.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,720
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
There's probably
guts and eyeballs
hanging off the bumper.

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
Knock it off, Ern.

82
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
We can't just leave it
in the road, suffering.

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,360
ERNIE: Cool. Look.

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
(GROANING)

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Everybody,
stay in the car.

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Son of a bitch.

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,440
You drive a classic, you try
to take good care of it,
and some dumb animal...

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,200
George, shouldn't
we call a Ranger?

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,080
No, not yet.

90
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
ERNIE: You did bring it.

91
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Don't you need some backup?
No.

92
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,400
I said stay in the car.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,560
This is exactly
why I brought it.
For protection.

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
You didn't have to lie.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
ERNIE: Shoot it!

96
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,920
It's dead.
Shoot it anyway!

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,560
Nan!

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
What?
I think you better come
take a look at this!

Yeah?

102
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
What if it's him?

103
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,160
Who?
Bigfoot.

104
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,840
Bigfoot?

105
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,280
Holy shit! Sorry, Dad.

106
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,600
That's okay.

107
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,400
I was looking
for the right words.

108
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,920
It smells gross!

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
George, what is it?

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,680
I guess it must be

111
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,160
a Bigfoot.

112
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't know
what else it could be.

113
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,680
Nancy, this is a big deal.

114
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,640
It's a major discovery.

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
I bet a museum
would want it or something.

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,600
We have to take it home.

118
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,960

take the stuff off the top of
the car, put it in the back.

119
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
Right, Dad.

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,360
And tell your sister
she's gonna have to
help us lift this thing up!

121
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Oh, Sarah!

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,440
Pull it forward!
Don't worry.

123
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,120
NANCY: I feel so guilty.

124
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,760
What if
it's the only one?

125
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,440
It's not as if
I tried to hit it, Nan.

126
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,760
It was just luck.

127

Luck?

This thing could
really be worth something.

I don't believe
you just said that.

132
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
Come on, Nan.
It's all in
how you look at it.

Be careful.
It's still loaded.

going out there?

do you have someone
in your house?

No, don't think
I'm crazy, Sergeant,

257

but it's Bigfoot.

Of course, yes.
They can be a nuisance,

I'll tell you what,
Mr.: Henderson:

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,000
It kind of happens
all the time around here:

Now, we found these Bigfeet
are pretty reasonable fellows:

Hey!

with my car.
I thought it was dead.

in the morning,

265

but it must have been hungry
'cause I found it
in the kitchen!

266
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,800
You hit a Bigfoot
with your car...
No! Yes.

... in your kitchen:

Look, I'm under
a lot of stress here,

269
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,480
I mean, it wasn't dead
anymore. It must have
just walked into the kitchen.

270
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
It was eating
out of our refrigerator.

271
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
I thought it was gonna eat me,
but it ate my daughter's
corsage instead.

And then
our Passiflora coriacea
and then it ate our goldfish.

Mr. Henderson?

274

you have a Bigfoot

320
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll go to my prom,
the kids will probably
throw pig blood on me!

321
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,760
Thank you, Dad.
Sarah, don't let her in!

322

ERNIE: Come on, big guy.
Rise and shine!

323
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,920
Don't worry.
It's the safest place
in the whole house!

(CRASHING)

325
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,880
Ernie!

326
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,560
It's okay, Mom,
the stairs broke!

327
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,040
We're all right.

328
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Oh, good.

329
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,640
There you are!

330
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,160
Amazing. That was...
Can you imagine?

331
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,680
Little Bob must be in heat
or something. Every dog in
the neighborhood is out here.

My God!

334
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
What is that smell?

335
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,560
What the hell happened?

336
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,800
We decided
to defrost the fridge.

337
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
Oh, God!

338
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,520
Is everything all right
with you kids?

339
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
Us?
Oh, hey, fine.

340
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,440
Wonderful.
No. Great. Really great.

(DOG GROWLING)

342
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,080
I got your mail.

343
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,120
Just put it
on the fridge.

344
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,640
Nan, you wouldn't happen
to have any peanut butter
and brewer's yeast?

345
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,000
I found a new diet.

346
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,000
Sarah, please take
the dog out of the room.

347
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,800
Peanut butter
I know we have.
Is chunky okay?

348
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,480
Let me see
if I can help you, Irene.

349
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,600
Peanut butter's always
on the second shelf.

350
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Great. No brewer's yeast?
No, sorry.

351
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,880
Never mind,
I gotta go to the market

352
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,240
and pick up some
cod liver oil and Tabasco.

353
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,320
It's a new energy diet.
You might wanna try it,
George.

(CREAKING)

355
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,120
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.

356
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
Plenty of energy
right here!

357
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,160
Well, maybe
it's just rotten meat
or eggs or something.

358
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,280
Exactly. No sense
standing around
breathing it.

359

taking care of Little Bob.

Oh! Ernie!

361
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,680
What was that?

362
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
Ernie's experiment
for his science class.

363
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,120
(STAMMERING) He's got
one of those gerbils.

364
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,440
Yeah! It's so cute.

365
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,480
Only, it's more like...

366
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,760
A hamster.

367
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,760
Yeah, only bigger,
and it's always hungry.

368
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,920
Nothing more than rats getting
a lucky shake from society,
if you ask me.

I know where you are
if I need you.

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,400
Boy, is this guy strong!

373
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,320
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.

374

It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?

375
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,240
You are going
to call in sick,

376
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,840
that's what you're
going to do about work.

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,520
Dad's gonna just love that.

378
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,240
Can I be sick, too?
No.

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,880
I think you and Sarah
will be safer at school,
Ernie.

380
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,640
Oh, well.
At least I can tell
the kids at school

381
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,760
my dad creamed a Bigfoot.

382
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,120
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,320
No one's going anywhere
until I figure out
what to do!

384
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,200
Get out of the fridge,
Ernie.

385
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Coffee?

386
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Now, it took
some doing, but...

387
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,200
At least for now
it seems to be trapped.

393
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,480
It's hurt.

394
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,480
Are we sure
we don't have anything
that doesn't sting?

395
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,960
Don't I wish.

396
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
Yeah, this is going
to hurt a little, okay?

397
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,360
What I do is just
close my eyes real tight.
Like this.

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,040
Good.

401
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,320
Does this mean
we can keep him?

402
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,560
Oh, grow up!

403
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,320
Maybe we can.
I don't know.

You don't know?

405
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,760
The answer is "No."
Now you know.

406
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,000
It was just so different
when it was dead.

407
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,200
George, you were different.

408
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,960
And I'm convinced
he wasn't dead.

409
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,440
Hey, hang on. I thought
we were gonna sell it,
and get rich.

410
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,440
Let's keep it
and get rich.
Exactly.

(GROWLING)
I don't believe
this family! Sorry.

412
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,160
We are talking about a living,
breathing being here.

413
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,760
It might even be
some kind of a person.

414
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,640
It's a Bigfoot person.

415
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,400
We don't even know
what it is.

416
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,160
We don't know
if it's male or female.

417
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,520
Definitely male.

418
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,160
How can you tell?

Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.

420
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,560
Nan, I don't know how,
but we gotta figure a way
to keep this thing.

421
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,640
It's big bucks,
don't you see?

422
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,960
I mean, it's a ticket
to a better life!

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,000
A better life for whom?
What about his life?

424
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm thinking about us.

425
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,560
I just need time
to figure a way to...

426
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
Oh, well.

427
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,400
At least he's safe here.

00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,320
LAFLEUR: You should not have
given up, my old friend.

429
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,480
The only difference
between these and those

430
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
is I get a buck
a strand for mine.

431
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,560
These are real, Doc.

432
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,360
I chased a set of tracks
for two or three miles.

433
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,760
Okay, Jocko,
if you've got castings,
I'll buy them,

434
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,720
but let's keep the price
on the ground.

435
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,600
Listen, you don't understand!

436
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,680
I almost had him.
I was that close.

437
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
Then what, gun jam?

438
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,200
Or maybe a change of heart.

439
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,480
Had him in your sights
and couldn't do it?

440
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
What's the story this time?
I don't know.

441
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
I think
he was hit by a car.

442
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,720
That should have
made it easy.

443
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,160
Yes, I know but...

444
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,640
There are no traces,
no tracks, nothing.

445
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,800
He just vanished.

446
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,200
Well, like I tell
my customers,

447
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,080
Bigfoot eat their dead.

448
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know
why the hell
I bother with you!

449
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Because you figure
I'm the only one

450
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,480
who deep down
wants to believe you,

451
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,280
but I don't.
Not any more.

452
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,960
We both spent our whole lives
chasing after that beast,

453
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,280
and we both
have to stare at ourselves
in the mirror every morning

454
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,520
and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"

455
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,600
"I am not a fool!"

456
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,760
Only you finally blinked!

457
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Or finally
opened my eyes!

458
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,880
We'll find out soon enough!

459
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,200
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!

460
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,120
God knows,
I can use the business.

461
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,760
Put the stuff
in the freezer, honey.

462
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Where is he?
Living room.

463
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,560
Everything is melting.
Have I got something
to show you.

464
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,720
George, give me a second.

465
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,280
Irene had us
cornered out there
for 15 minutes.

466
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,480
She invited us to dinner
and bowling.
Bowling?

467
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,640
Don't worry, George,
I spared you.

468
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,520
I told her you had something
to drop off tonight,
don't you?

469
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Don't be so sure.

470
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
You might just change
your mind when you've
seen what I've seen.

471
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,360
Sarah, you, too.
Come on.

472
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,880
George, those are
just empty calories.

473
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,600
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.

474
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Not yet.
Just a minute.

475
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,720
I have a little something
to show you.

476
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,360
But first,
I want you to think about this
just for a moment.

477
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,440
Us,

478
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,800
Life,

479
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
Time:

480
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
Magazines! Cover stories.

481
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,120
I mean, you could be looking
at old Dad on the Carson Show,
for heaven's sake.

482
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,440
No, no, no, no.

483
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,720
Now, we started
with something
kind of simple.

484
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
But I'm sure you'll see

485
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,560
that as soon as he gets going
there is absolutely nothing
to stop him!

486
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,280
Sit.

487
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,640
Sit.

488
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Sit!

489
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?

490
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,920
No, no, no!

491
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,400
Don't sit!

492
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,680
That was outstanding, Dad!

493
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,680
No, no, no. Stay. Please...

494
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,480
George, if I could
have a word with you
before the Carson Show calls.

495
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,840
Nancy!

496
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,160
It wasn't...

497
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,280
Nancy, honey,
we've got to give him
one more chance!

498
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,120
George Nathan Henderson,
what is the matter with you?

499
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,520
This is our home! Our stuff!

500
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Look, he had it perfect
just five minutes ago.

501
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,160
George, you are acting
like a crazy person!

502
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,920
Honey, that wasn't
supposed to happen!

503
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
None of this was
supposed to happen,

504
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,840
but it did,
and now we have
to do the right thing!

505
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I know it seems bad,
but just give me
one more week.

506
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,200
We don't have enough house
for two days!

507
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,640
George, he doesn't fit here!
He doesn't fit in our lives!

508
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,600
Look, we have
to do the right thing
and think about him!

509
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,800
Mom, Dad, hurry,
this is great!

510
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,040
(SIGHING)

511
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
MAN ON TV:
What's the matter with him?

512
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,920
WOMAN: Maybe
he thinks you're getting...

513

(LAUGHING)

514
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,360

(CHAIR CREAKING)

516
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Cool, huh?

517
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
He didn't care
for the blue cheese.

518
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,280
... eat your Pablum
like a good boy...

519
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,400
... and you'll have
Swedish pancake too:

520
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,320
Now I know where
Bonzo get his bad habits:

521
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
That's outright bribery:

522
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Okay.
I'll take him back.

523
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,840
But you know
it might not be so easy,

524
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,040
I think
he likes it here.

525
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,880
What kind of a way
is that to talk to a baby?

526
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,040
What do you mean?

527
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
She's gone.
It's time to go.

528
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,960
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.

529
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,120
Right. What's left of it.

530

531
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,840
No, no, no.

532
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
It's really much nicer
on the inside. Come on.

533
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,480
Perfect.

534
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,080
Hungry? We're gonna
have a little party.

535
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,080
Yeah. A goodbye party.

536
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,880
Plan B.
No problem.

537
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,360
See what we're gonna
be missing?

538
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?

539
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,720
Here. Ern.

540
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,200
Have you
ever had a burger?

541
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,560
Smells good.

542
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,720
Look at this.

543
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,960
Mmm. Mmm.

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,360
Oh, right.

546
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,360
Yours was the fish. Here.

547
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,080
This is for him,

548
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,240
the burgers are for you.

549
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,760
You want another?
I ordered wrong.

550
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,200
Double fish
on a sesame bun.

551
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,200
Catch of the day.

552
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,880
Covered with tartar sauce.

553
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,680
How about
some fries, huh?

554
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,920
Extra larges,
two orders.

555
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,680
You can wash it down
with a chocolate shake.

556
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,480
Look at all this stuff!

557

Great!

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,680
Comfortable?

561
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,000
Just sit... Stay.

562
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,360
Stay.

563
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,560
Stay right there.

You're not changing
your mind, are you?

565
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,200
Your mom's right, Ern.

566
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,520
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.

567
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,720
But it's the right thing
to do.

568
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,040
It was wrong of me
to think that we could just
claim it like a stray dog.

569
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,120
He's more of a man
than an animal.

570
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,960
You were the first one
to see that.

571
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,760
He deserves to be free.

572
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,440
Mom's right.

573
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,320
He's gotta go back
where he belongs.

574
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,960
So why don't you and me

575
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,200
go on down there,
like a couple of real men

576
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,840

"Goodbye, hairy friend."

he have a name?

it's Tuesday:

After the paramedics
had revived the woman
she said,

"She must have been put there
by a huge, hairy,

silly old Jerry Seville?

If there really was a Bigfoot,
don't you think I'd have had
him as a guest on my show?

620
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,240
I gotta check it out anyway.

No, the very best thing
that you can do
is go to work.

from 40 years
driving along the freeway

and, of course,
I cannot remember his name

631
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,440
so I take his
license number plate
and I come here,

632
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,800
and because of that
I am going to find out where
he lives. It's fantastic.

00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,320
So how about you,
George?

636
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,160
Did you see any Bigfoot?
What?

637
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
You know, your vacation.
Bigfoot?

638
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,840
No.
I read the things weigh
over 400 pounds.

639
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,400
Smell real bad, too.

640
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,680
Hell, looks like
we got one of those
right here.

641
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,960
What's your shoe size,
Billers?
Very funny.

642
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,760
I'm working with assholes.

643
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,120
Can I help you?

644
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,320
Probably yes.
I hope we can help each other.

645
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,800
I believe this is yours.

646
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,840
Okay, what are you
selling, buster, huh?

647
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,640
Mrs. Henderson?
Yes.

648
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,320
Irene, would you go see
if the tea kettle is
just about to boil, honey?

649
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,840
Thank you.

650
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,880
Good morning.
Hi.

651
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,240
I am called Richard Smith.

652
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,560
And I'm from
the U.S. Forestry Service

653
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,600
and I'm investigating
a possible road-kill,
with an animal

654
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,520
either killed or maimed
in a car accident.

655
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,120
Now, I know
that you did hit something
on Route A-4

656
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,320
which was a little fire road
off the l-90?

657
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,640
Yes. We did
run into something.

658
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,920
(SNIFFING)

659
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,840
What was it that you hit,
Mrs. Henderson?

660
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,480
I don't know.
We couldn't see it.

661
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,160
You know,
it happened so fast.

662
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,760
Where is it now?

663
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,160
Now? I don't know.
It ran away.

664
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,120
Mrs. Henderson, obviously,
our main concern are
for your family,

665
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,480
to be sure no one was injured.

666
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,320
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.

667
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,760
Obviously our other concern
is for the safety
of that poor little animal.

668
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,400
It could be out there
suffering

669
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,440
and I know you would want to
help me find it
so I could care for it.

670
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,800
No. I mean, yes.

671
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,160
But I mean,
there's nothing wrong with it.

672
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,680
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.

673
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,920
Walked?

674
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
It crawled,
it scurried, you know,
it scampered,

675
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,280
it kind of wobbled, creeped,
like an animal does, you know?

676
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,320
Anyway, he's fine,
and we are fine and...

677
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,840
You know...

678
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,040
I forgot I have a sink
backed up and I...
And a potty.

679
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,000
I've gotta go take care of it.
Thank you.

680
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,360
Thanks very much
for thinking of us
and bringing this to us.

681
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,960
And thanks for
your consideration.

682
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,080
License plates, huh?
That guy's probably a convict.
Here.

683
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,760
What you don't need now
is somebody bothering you.

684
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,720
Just sit back and relax.

685
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,920
I can remember
Herb's and my first fight.
This is nothing.

686
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,280
Can I help you?
Probably not.

687
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,760
This is the first place
I have been.

688
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,720
I want some .458 magnums.

689
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,440
I think we got those
in here somewhere.

690
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,800
Yeah. Here we are.

691
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,600
We don't get much
call for these monsters.

692
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,920
$28.50 for the box.

693
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,800
Do you have any more?

694
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,600
There's 20 of them in there,
you know?

695
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,640
Do you have any more?

696
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,080
I'm sorry,
that's the last we got.

697
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,560
What, are you going
on safari or something?

698
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,840
No. Just into
my own back yard.

699
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,960
There he goes,
just like clockwork.

700
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,480
Jeez, Dad,
who the hell is that guy?

701
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,520
Jacques LaFleur.

702
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,520
He's always the first to show
when these crazy sightings
start up.

703
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,400
He bought some
pretty serious ammo, .458s.

704
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,600
Before Sasquatch
got under his skin
he was a Class A hunter.

705
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,560
Where do you think
Claws came from?

706
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,560
That guy shot Claws?
Yeah.

707
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,080
Why would he part
with a trophy like that?

708
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,840
Probably because
it was the smallest one.

709
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,800
May I help you?

710
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,240
Yes, I'm on my lunch break
and I'm kind of in a hurry.

711
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,240
Could you point me
to some books on the...

712
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
(WHISPERING)
Bigfoot?

713
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,720
Sasquatch?

714
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,560
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch.

715
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,720
That's the one.

716
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,960
Fantasy, folklore,
myths and legends.

717
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,480
Basement stacks.
Take the stairs.
Thank you.

718
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,120
You could also try
children's books!
Right!

719
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,920
This book sucks!
Ernie.

720
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
These pictures
don't look anything
like Harry!

721
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,120
He's right, Nan.
It's no wonder
people wanna kill them.

722
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,520
These books make them
out to be monsters.

723
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,160
All except this journal
from the North American
Anthropological Institute.

724
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,760
Some guy named
Wallace Wrightwood.

725
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,200
NANCY: That's him.
No. That's Jacques LaFleur.

726
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,280
He's a hunter who came
into the store today.

727
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,200
No, honey.
This is Richard Smith,

728
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,720
the forestry guy
I told you about

729
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,680
who came
to our house today.

730
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,480
That lying bastard!
SARAH AND ERNIE: Mom!

731
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,480
Both of you, to bed,
right now.

732
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,880
Sarah, get off that phone.
It's two hours.
Come on, that's it!

733
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,080
Mom, it's only 8:30.
You mind your mother!

734
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,200
(HORN HONKING)

735
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,400
Hard to believe, huh?

736
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,040
And from the look in your mug,
you think it's a load,
don't you?

737
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,920
Everybody asks,
"Has anybody ever seen one?"

738
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,720
Let me ask you,

739
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,000
you being a flatlander,
a city fellow,

740
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,160
you've seen hundreds,
thousands of pigeons, right?

741
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,080
Of course.
Have you ever seen
a baby pigeon?

742
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,520
Well, neither have I.

743
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,680
But I got a hunch
they exist.

744
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,920
Are you Dr. Wrightwood?
I'm George Henderson.

745
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,080
Wrightwood ain't here.

746
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,120
Is he coming back?
He might.

747
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,880
Could I leave
a message for...

748
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,920
How do you know
Wrightwood?

749
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,680
His books. And his research.

750
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,560
He seems to be the only person
who really believes
in all this.

751
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,560
I just need a few answers.

752
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,920
Doctor's old, tired.

753
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,960
I'm gonna put
my phone number down here.

754
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,640
Could you see
that the Doctor gets this?

755
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,000
"Vital facts that could
prevent an unnecessary
and tragic end

756
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,160
"for the big fellow?"

757
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,440
I have a friend,

758
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,440
a man named Jack.

759
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,720
And say there was this,
this, giant...

760
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,480
Is there a beanstalk
involved in this,
Mr. Henderson?

761
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,840
A beanstalk?

762
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,760
No. No.

763
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,120
I mean, with all
these Bigfoot sightings

764
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,920
what if Jack
and his family

765
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,760
opened up their home

766
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,920
and their lives
to this thing?

767
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,600
And, what if they found out
that he was more human
than animal,

768
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,480
and they just said,
"We'll take him in.

769
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,480
"We'll accept responsibility
for him until a safe place
can be found for him to be."

770
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,960
Not some zoo, or lab...

771
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,840
So what you're saying is
you would be willing...

772
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,360
Excuse me,
Jack would be willing
to take this creature in,

773
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,680
care for it
and love it like a pet?
No, no,

774
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,840
like a member
of the family.

775
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,160
That's a noble gesture,
but impossible.

776
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,400
Sasquatch
is a primitive ancestor
of modern man,

777
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,160
but if you ever came
face to face with one

778
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,400
you'd see that they're still
very much animals.

779
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,680
Only on the outside.

780
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,080
Look, I know
what I'm talking about!

781
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,040
And I know it's closing time
so if you wanna talk shop,
then shop!

782
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,160
Jack and the Beanstalk,
George?

783
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,640
It just came out like that.
I didn't know
what I was saying.

784
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,440
I think you knew
exactly what you were saying.

785
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,840
Face it, Dad,
you want him back.

786
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,320
Sarah, I want to take him back
where he belongs,

01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,080
I almost killed him myself!

1255
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,480
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!

1256
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,800
He's our friend!

1257
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,560
For God's sake, Jacques,
open your eyes!

1258
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,320
Are you people
out of your minds?

1259
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,760
Do you think
I'm going to stop now?

1260
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,320
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!

1261
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,920
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!
George!

1262
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,720
George!
I'll kill you first!

1263
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,120
Don't let him kill me!

1264
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,200
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!

1265
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,360
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't,
don't let him kill me.

1266
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,520
I'm...

1267
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,960
No, no...

1268
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,800
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.

1269
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,680
Harry Henderson.

1270
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,400
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?

1271
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
WRIGHTWOOD: What are you
talking about?

1272
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,200
LAFLEUR: It's over.
Over?

1273
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,320
Why, it's just
the beginning.

1274
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:40,280
Jocko, this old ticker
hasn't thumped
like this for years.

1275
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,080
It's like going
to heaven with your feet
still on the ground.

1276
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,440
And we get to share it
with one of
our oldest friends.

1277
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,520
(LAUGHING)

1278
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,600
Goodbye, Harry.

1279
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,960
We gotta let him go.

1280
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,400
GEORGE: Harry...

1281
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,000
I never got a chance
to thank you.

1282
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:44,200
I don't think you'll ever know
how much you've meant to us.

1283
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,840
You take care of yourself
now, okay?

1284
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,120
Okay.

1285
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,800
Mon dieu!
They have a language?

1286
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:04,440
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.

1287
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,800
There's always Loch Ness.

1288
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,120
