2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,743
This is Berk.

3
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,289
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.

4
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:45,210
It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.

5
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,798
My village. In a word, sturdy.

6
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,636
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.

7
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,849
We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.

8
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:02,018
The only problems are the pests.

9
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,440
yöu see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

10
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,775
We have...

11
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,071
...dragons.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,658
Most people would leave. Not us.

13
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,454
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.

14
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:23,623
My name is Hiccup.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,169
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.

16
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:31,006
Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.

17
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,508
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.

18
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,677
Morning!

19
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,681
<font color="#808080">-</font> What are yöu doing here?!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get inside!

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,642
<font color="#808080">-</font> What are yöu doing out?!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get back inside!

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,733
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are yöu doing out?! Get inside!

22
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,528
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.

23
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,533
When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

24
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,786
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

25
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:01,953
What have we got?

26
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,916
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

27
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,503
<font color="#808080">-</font> Any Night Furies?
<font color="#808080">-</font> None so far.

28
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,712
Good.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,714
Hoist the torches!

30
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:21,556
Nice of yöu to join the party!
I thought yöu'd been carried off!

31
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,561
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,898
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

33
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,900
They need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,279
The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,909
I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:45,080
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

37
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,373
Hurry!

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,752
See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.

39
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,254
Fire!

40
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,713
Let's go!

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,468
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins,
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

42
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,220
...and...

43
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,431
...Astrid.

44
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,819
Their job is so much cooler.

45
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,365
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

46
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,451
yöu've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

47
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,453
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

48
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,790
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,626
yöu can't lift a hammer.
yöu can't swing an axe.

50
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,336
yöu can't even throw one of these!

51
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,675
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

52
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,221
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,432
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mild calibration issue...
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hiccup!

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,643
If yöu ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...

55
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,813
...yöu need to stop all this.

56
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,065
But yöu just pointed to all of me.

57
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,611
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of yöu.

58
00:03:58,654 --> 00:03:59,779
Oh, yes.

59
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,657
yöu, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.

60
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,828
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

61
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,663
There will be consequences!

62
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,292
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

63
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,006
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...

64
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,008
...is everything around here.

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,679
A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.

66
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,264
Gronckles are tough.

67
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,684
Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.

68
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,811
A Zippleback?

69
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,774
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.

70
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,192
They found the sheep!

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,527
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

72
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,363
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hurry up!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Fire!

73
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,699
And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.

74
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,744
Only the best Vikings go after those.

75
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,873
They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.

76
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,211
Reload! I'll take care of this.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,716
But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.

78
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,885
<font color="#808080">-</font> We call it the...
<font color="#808080">-</font> Night Fury!

79
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,387
Get down!

80
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,891
Jump!

81
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,437
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...

82
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,691
...never misses.

83
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:22,612
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.

84
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,907
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

85
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,286
Stay. Put. There.

86
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,456
yöu know what I mean.

87
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,085
<font color="#808080">-</font> Where are yöu going?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yeah, I know!

88
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,628
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hiccup!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Be right back!

89
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,760
Let's get him!

90
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,762
Mind yöurselves!

91
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,931
The devils still have
some juice in them!

92
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,278
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

93
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,636
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

94
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,847
Did anybody see that?

95
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,516
Except for yöu.

96
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,900
<font color="#808080">-</font> Do not let them escape!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Right!

97
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,337
yöu're all out.

98
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,012
Oh, and there's one more thing
yöu need to know.

99
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,483
Sorry, Dad.

100
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,702
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

101
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,290
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

102
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,709
yöu guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

103
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,380
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

104
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,840
Stop!

105
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,050
Just stop.

106
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,428
Every time yöu step outside,
disaster follows.

107
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,639
Can yöu not see that
I have bigger problems?

108
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,393
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!

109
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,648
Between yöu and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,733
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

111
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,070
Why can't yöu follow
the simplest orders?

112
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,867
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

113
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,035
It's who I am, Dad.

114
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:21,416
yöu're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

115
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,376
Get back to the house.

116
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,503
Make sure he gets there.

117
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,298
I have his mess to clean up.

118
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,550
Quite the performance.

119
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,511
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,306
Thank yöu, thank yöu. I was trying.

121
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,769
<font color="#808080">-</font> I really did hit one.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sure, Hiccup.

122
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,189
<font color="#808080">-</font> He never listens.
<font color="#808080">-</font> It runs in the family.

123
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,108
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

124
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,694
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.

125
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,907
"Excuse me, barmaid.
yöu brought me the wrong offspring.

126
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,828
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

127
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,748
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

128
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,958
yöu're thinking about this wrong.

129
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:08,588
It's not so much what yöu look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

130
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,132
Thank yöu for summing that up.

131
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,511
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something yöu're not.

132
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,014
I just want to be one of yöu guys.

133
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:31,110
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

134
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,821
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

135
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,990
If we find the nest and destroy it,

136
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,327
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

137
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,996
One more search
before the ice sets in.

138
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,165
Those ships never come back.

139
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,795
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

140
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,963
Count me out.

141
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,215
<font color="#808080">-</font> Today's no good for me.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I have to do my axe returns.

142
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,510
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

143
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,262
<font color="#808080">-</font> To the ships!
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'm with yöu!

144
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:58,513
That's more like it.

145
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,849
I'll pack my undies.

146
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:04,936
No, I need yöu to stay
and train some new recruits.

147
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,524
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

148
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,860
Molten steel, razor sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

149
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,029
What could possibly go wrong?

150
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,323
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

151
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,825
Put him in training.

152
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,202
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, I'm serious.
<font color="#808080">-</font> So am I.

153
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,205
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

154
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,957
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu don't know that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I do, actually.

155
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,583
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, yöu don't.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, I do.

156
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,960
No, yöu don't.

157
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,878
Listen, yöu know what he's like.

158
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:35,008
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

159
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,679
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

160
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,349
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!

161
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,060
Trolls exist. They steal yöur socks.

162
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,230
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

163
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,648
<font color="#808080">-</font> When I was a boy...
<font color="#808080">-</font> Here we go.

164
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,693
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.

165
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,654
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

166
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,990
<font color="#808080">-</font> And yöu know what happened?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu got a headache.

167
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,117
That rock split in two.

168
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,370
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

169
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,541
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

170
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,755
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

171
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,424
Hiccup is not that boy.

172
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,885
yöu can't stop him, Stoick.

173
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,220
yöu can only prepare him.

174
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:25,600
I know it seems hopeless, but yöu won't
always be around to protect him.

175
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,854
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

176
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,291
Oh, the gods hate me.

177
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,628
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

178
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,798
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

179
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:48,307
Oh, wow. I did it.

180
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,395
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

181
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,897
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

182
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,303
I'm going to kill yöu, dragon.

183
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:29,724
Then I'll cut out yöur heart
and take it to my father.

184
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,186
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

185
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,305
I did this.

186
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,630
Hiccup.

187
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,507
Dad...

188
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,176
...I have to talk to yöu, Dad.

189
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,512
I need to speak with yöu, too, son.

190
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,391
<font color="#808080">-</font> I don't want to fight dragons.
<font color="#808080">-</font> It's time yöu learn to fight dragons.

191
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,559
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

192
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,437
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu go first.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, yöu go first.

193
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,688
All right.

194
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,192
yöu get yöur wish. Dragon training...
yöu start in the morning.

195
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,361
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

196
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,280
I was thinking, yöu know,

197
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,450
we have a surplus
of dragon fighting Vikings,

198
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,204
but do we have enough bread making
Vikings or small home repair Vikings?

199
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:58,372
yöu'll need this.

200
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,750
I don't want to fight dragons.

201
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,335
Come on. Yes, yöu do.

202
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:06,380
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

203
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,341
But yöu will kill dragons.

204
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,510
No, I'm really very extra sure
that I won't.

205
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,554
<font color="#808080">-</font> It's time, Hiccup.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Can yöu not hear me?

206
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,890
This is serious, son.

207
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:21,312
When yöu carry this axe,
yöu carry all of us with yöu.

208
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,149
Which means yöu walk like us,
yöu talk like us...

209
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,193
...yöu think like us.

210
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,528
No more of... this.

211
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,656
yöu just gestured to all of me.

212
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,117
<font color="#808080">-</font> Deal?
<font color="#808080">-</font> This conversation is very one sided.

213
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,577
Deal?

214
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,580
Deal.

215
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,208
Good.

216
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,086
Train hard.

217
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,755
I'll be back. Probably.

218
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,466
And I'll be here.

219
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,259
Maybe.

220
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,763
Welcome to dragon training!

221
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,349
No turning back.

222
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,618
I hope I get some serious burns.

223
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,372
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

224
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,791
Yeah, it's only fun if yöu get
a scar out of it.

225
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,209
Yeah, no kidding, right?

226
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,378
Pain. Love it.

227
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,255
Oh, great. Who let him in?

228
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,133
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

229
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,927
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

230
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,804
in front of the entire village.

231
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:41,475
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

232
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,145
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

233
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:48,315
Don't worry. yöu're small and weak...
that'll make yöu less of a target.

234
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:50,234
They'll see yöu as sick or insane

235
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,571
and go after the more
Viking like teens instead.

236
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,283
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species

237
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,451
yöu will learn to fight!

238
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,120
<font color="#808080">-</font> The Deadly Nadder!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Speed 8, armor 16.

239
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,621
The Hideous Zippleback.

240
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,165
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

241
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,333
<font color="#808080">-</font> The Monstrous Nightmare.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Firepower 15.

242
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,502
<font color="#808080">-</font> The Terrible Terror.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Attack 8, venom 12.

243
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,379
Can yöu stop that?!

244
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,424
And the Gronckle.

245
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,676
Jaw strength 8.

246
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,344
Wait, aren't yöu gonna teach us first?

247
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,014
I believe in learning on the job.

248
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,852
Today is about survival.
If yöu get blasted...

249
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,146
...yöu're dead!

250
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,939
What's the first thing yöu'll need?

251
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,858
<font color="#808080">-</font> A doctor?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Plus 5 speed?

252
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,235
<font color="#808080">-</font> A shield.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Shields. Go!

253
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,697
yöur most important piece of equipment
is yöur shield!

254
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,868
If yöu must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

255
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,037
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let go of my shield!
<font color="#808080">-</font> There are a million shields!

256
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,247
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

257
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,583
Oops, this one has blood on it.

258
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,670
<font color="#808080">-</font> Tuffnut, Ruffnut! yöu're out!
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

259
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,506
Shields are good for another thing.

260
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:57,927
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

261
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,722
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.

262
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,099
How many does a Gronckle have?

263
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,559
<font color="#808080">-</font> Five?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, six!

264
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,895
Correct, six!
That's one for each of yöu!

265
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,397
Fishlegs, out!

266
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,608
Hiccup, get in there!

267
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,906
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

268
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,699
yöu look like yöu work out.

269
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,743
Snotlout! yöu're done!

270
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,578
So it's just yöu and me, huh?

271
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,372
Nope, just yöu.

272
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,250
One shot left!

273
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,627
Hiccup!

274
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,637
And that's six.

275
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,849
Go back to bed,
yöu overgrown sausage!

276
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,562
yöu'll get another chance,
don't yöu worry.

277
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,731
Remember, a dragon will always,

278
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,443
always go for the kill.

279
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,661
So... why didn't yöu?

280
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,690
This was stupid.

281
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,903
Why don't yöu just fly away?

282
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,733
All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

283
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,653
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

284
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,406
<font color="#808080">-</font> It threw off my reverse tumble.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yeah, we noticed.

285
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,574
No, no, yöu were great.
That was so "Astrid."

286
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,285
She's right. yöu have to be
tough on yöurselves.

287
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:12,204
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

288
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,873
<font color="#808080">-</font> He showed up.
<font color="#808080">-</font> He didn't get eaten.

289
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,750
He's never where he should be.

290
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,836
Thank yöu, Astrid.

291
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,590
yöu need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.

292
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,970
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

293
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,558
No attacks tonight. Study up.

294
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,351
Wait, yöu mean read?

295
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,769
While we're still alive?

296
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,855
Why read words
when yöu can just kill the stuff

297
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,690
the words tell yöu stuff about?

298
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,776
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

299
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,238
that sprays boiling water at yöur
face. And there's this other one...

300
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,073
Yeah. That sounds great.

301
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,452
<font color="#808080">-</font> There was a chance I'd read it...
<font color="#808080">-</font> But now...

302
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,203
yöu guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

303
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,498
Another one has spines like trees.

304
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,834
<font color="#808080">-</font> So I guess we'll share?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Read it.

305
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,797
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see yöu...

306
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,591
...tomorrow.

307
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,561
Dragon classifications.

308
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,981
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

309
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:26,653
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

310
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:29,823
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

311
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,742
that can kill a man at close range.

312
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,828
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

313
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,832
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor sharp wings

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,959
that can slice through full grown trees.

315
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,129
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

316
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:49,134
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.

317
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,228
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

318
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,065
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

319
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,693
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

320
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,863
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

321
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,991
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

322
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,994
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

323
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,873
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

324
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,043
Night Fury.

325
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:27,256
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

326
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:31,885
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

327
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,846
Never engage this dragon.

328
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:38,183
yöur only chance, Hide and pray
it does not find yöu.

329
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,074
I can almost smell them.

330
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,868
They're close.

331
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,328
Steady.

332
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,340
Take us in.

333
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,260
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

334
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,262
Hard to port!

335
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,767
Steady!

336
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:37,284
Hey, yöu know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

337
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:42,122
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

338
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,501
Focus, Hiccup!
yöu're not even trying!

339
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:51,381
Today it's all about attack!

340
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,259
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.

341
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,137
yöur job is to be quicker and lighter!

342
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,142
I'm really beginning to question
yöur teaching methods!

343
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,770
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

344
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,856
Find it, hide in it and strike!

345
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,776
Do yöu ever bathe?

346
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,528
If yöu don't like it, then
just get yöur own blind spot.

347
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,656
How about I give yöu one?

348
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,244
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

349
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,122
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

350
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,793
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

351
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,295
<font color="#808080">-</font> I know, I know, but hypothetically...
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hiccup!

352
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,797
Get down.

353
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,938
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

354
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,942
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

355
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,069
What do yöu want me to do,
block out the sun?

356
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,154
I could do that but I don't have time!

357
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:58,115
They probably...

358
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,077
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

359
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,371
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

360
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:08,709
Hiccup!

361
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,714
Love on the battlefield.

362
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:14,923
She could do better.

363
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,717
Let me... Why don't yöu?

364
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:27,519
Well done, Astrid.

365
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,232
Is this some kind of a joke to yöu?

366
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,485
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

367
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,863
Figure out which side yöu're on.

368
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,154
Toothless.

369
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,532
I could have sworn yöu had...

370
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:07,869
...teeth.

371
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,125
No, no, no.

372
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,503
I don't have any more!

373
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,285
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

374
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,580
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

375
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,040
He must have passed the word,

376
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,752
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

377
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,589
Isn't it weird to think
yöur hand was inside a dragon?

378
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,966
Like if yöur mind was still
in control of it,

379
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:35,679
yöu could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

380
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:40,600
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge yöur
beautiful hand and yöur beautiful foot.

381
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,771
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

382
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:48,441
It's the wings and the tails
yöu really want.

383
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,069
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

384
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,531
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

385
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,370
All right, I'm off to bed.
yöu should be, too.

386
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,790
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

387
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,168
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

388
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,838
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

389
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,258
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

390
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,510
yöur mom let yöu get a tattoo?

391
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,387
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

392
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,307
OK, I've been stuck with yöu since
birth, and that was never there before.

393
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:24,310
Yes, it was. yöu've just never
seen me from the left side.

394
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,520
Hey, Toothless.

395
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,524
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope yöu're hungry.

396
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,652
OK, that's disgusting.

397
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,573
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

398
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,909
...and a whole smoked eel.

399
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,250
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

400
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,003
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.

401
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,925
That's it.

402
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,803
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

403
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:43,932
And don't yöu mind me.
I'll just be back here,

404
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,935
minding my own business.

405
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:00,698
It's OK.

406
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,043
OK.

407
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:27,767
That's not too bad. It works.

408
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:35,316
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

409
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,871
Oh, my! It's working!

410
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,962
Yes, yes! I did it!

411
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,225
Yeah!

412
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,352
Today is about teamwork.

413
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:17,567
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

414
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,696
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

415
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,325
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

416
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:29,287
yöur job is to know which is which.

417
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,624
Razor sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre digestion.

418
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,126
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

419
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,586
Will yöu please stop that?!

420
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,677
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...

421
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,054
There!

422
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,557
Hey, it's us, idiots!

423
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,477
yöur butts are getting bigger.
We thought yöu were a dragon.

424
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:56,022
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

425
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,735
Wait.

426
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,990
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

427
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,035
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

428
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,044
Wrong head.

429
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,671
Fishlegs!

430
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,883
Now, Hiccup!

431
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,763
Oh, come on.

432
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:34,769
Hiccup!

433
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,065
Back, back, back!

434
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,861
Now, don't yöu make me tell yöu again!
Yes, that's right.

435
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:47,865
Back into yöur cage.
Now think about what yöu've done.

436
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:02,922
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...

437
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,800
Yep, I'll see yöu tomorrow!

438
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,854
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

439
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:04,901
I left my axe back in the ring. yöu guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with yöu.

440
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:47,068
Meet the Terrible Terror.

441
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,530
It's like the size of my...

442
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,074
Get it off!

443
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,577
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

444
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,666
Wow! He's better than yöu ever were.

445
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,920
Oh, great.

446
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,047
Hiccup.

447
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,523
Hiccup? Are yöu in there?

448
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,651
Astrid. Hey.

449
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,404
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

450
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,490
I normally don't care what people do,
but yöu're acting weird.

451
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,368
Well, weirder.

452
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:51,734
<font color="#808080">-</font> I trust yöu found the nest, at least?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not even close.

453
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,902
Excellent.

454
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,279
I hope yöu had more success than me.

455
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:59,784
Well, if by success, yöu mean that
yöur parenting troubles are over, yes.

456
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:03,287
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

457
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,581
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

458
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,126
<font color="#808080">-</font> No one will miss that nuisance!
<font color="#808080">-</font> We're throwing a party to celebrate!

459
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,836
<font color="#808080">-</font> Come over here.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hurry!

460
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:12,004
He's gone?

461
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:18,094
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.

462
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,014
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

463
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,182
Hiccup?

464
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,478
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.

465
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,323
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

466
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,242
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

467
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,911
...three... no, four.

468
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,808
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

469
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:13,816
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

470
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,409
Yes, it worked!

471
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:29,373
Sorry!

472
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,044
It was my fault.

473
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,380
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.

474
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,882
Three.

475
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:43,095
Yeah! Go, baby!

476
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,847
Yes!

477
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:49,185
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!

478
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,853
Stop!

479
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,857
No!

480
00:44:57,944 --> 00:45:01,322
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

481
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,867
All right, OK, yöu've gotta
kind of angle yöurself.

482
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,828
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...

483
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,288
Yeah!

484
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,208
Come on.

485
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,177
No, thanks. I'm good.

486
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:45,342
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are yöu?

487
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,635
Here yöu go.

488
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,323
Everything we know
about yöu guys is wrong.

489
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,503
Dad! yöu're back!
Gobber's not here so...

490
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,670
I know.

491
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:27,092
<font color="#808080">-</font> I came looking for yöu.
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu did?

492
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,761
yöu've been keeping secrets.

493
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:30,471
I have?

494
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,265
Just how long did yöu think
yöu could hide it?

495
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,101
I don't know what yöu're...

496
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:40,689
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

497
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,775
So...

498
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,402
...let's talk...

499
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,446
...about that dragon.

500
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,784
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell yöu.

501
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,370
I just didn't know how to...

502
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,293
yöu're not upset?

503
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,088
What?! I was hoping for this!

504
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,633
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu were?
<font color="#808080">-</font> And believe me, it only gets better!

505
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,553
Wait till yöu spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

506
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,430
And mount yöur first
Gronckle head on a spear!

507
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:17,393
What a feeling!
yöu really had me going there, son!

508
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,730
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

509
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,192
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on yöu.

510
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,611
And all the while
yöu were holding out on me!

511
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,655
Oh, Thor Almighty!

512
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,826
With yöu doing so well in the ring...

513
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:37,830
...we finally have something
to talk about.

514
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,180
Here, I brought yöu something,

515
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,142
to keep yöu safe in the ring.

516
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,394
Wow. Thanks.

517
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:05,441
yöur mother would have wanted yöu to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.

518
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,863
Matching set.
It keeps her close, yöu know.

519
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:16,577
Wear it proudly. yöu deserve it.
yöu've held up yöur end of the deal.

520
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:26,545
<font color="#808080">-</font> I should really get to bed.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, good. OK, good talk.

521
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,131
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'll see yöu back at the house. Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> We should do this again.

522
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,507
Thanks for stopping by...

523
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:33,719
...and for the breast hat.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I hope yöu like the hat.

524
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,598
Well... Yep. Good night.

525
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,574
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

526
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,452
Please, by all means.

527
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,591
This time, this time for sure!

528
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:24,186
No! No, son of a half troll,

529
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,356
<font color="#808080">-</font> rat eating, munge bucket!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Wait, wait.

530
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,358
<font color="#808080">-</font> So, later.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not so fast.

531
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,485
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'm kind of late for...
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?!

532
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,196
Late for what, exactly?

533
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,199
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

534
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:52,881
yöu've done it, Hiccup!
yöu get to kill the dragon!

535
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:57,344
That's my boy!

536
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:01,223
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

537
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,308
...leaving! We're leaving.

538
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:07,938
Let's pack up. Looks like yöu and me
are taking a little vacation.

539
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,648
Forever.

540
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,944
Oh, man.

541
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,991
What the?!
What are yöu doing here?

542
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,244
I want to know what's going on.

543
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,498
No one just gets as good as yöu do.
Especially yöu.

544
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,501
Start talking!
Are yöu training with someone?

545
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,711
Training?

546
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,504
It better not involve this.

547
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,300
I know this looks really bad,
but yöu see...

548
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,679
yöu're right. yöu're right.
yöu're right.

549
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:45,976
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So yöu got me.

550
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:50,272
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

551
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,399
Why would yöu do that?!

552
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,987
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

553
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,781
Oh, man.

554
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:01,241
Get down!

555
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,578
Run, run!

556
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,999
It's OK! It's OK.

557
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,709
She's a friend.

558
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,213
yöu just scared him.

559
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,881
I scared him?!

560
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,509
Who is "him"?

561
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:23,597
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

562
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,896
We're dead.

563
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,024
Where do yöu think yöu're going?

564
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:43,033
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

565
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,255
Hiccup, get me down from here!

566
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,590
yöu have to give me a chance to explain.

567
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,426
I am not listening
to anything yöu have to say!

568
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:05,055
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show yöu.

569
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,975
Please, Astrid.

570
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,033
Now get me down.

571
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,953
Toothless, down. Gently.

572
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:32,457
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

573
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,337
Toothless!

574
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:41,341
What is wrong with yöu?! Bad dragon!

575
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:45,345
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

576
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,021
Toothless, what are yöu doing?
We need her to like us!

577
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,026
And now the spinning.

578
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,071
Thank yöu for nothing,
yöu useless reptile.

579
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,825
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

580
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,827
Just get me off of this thing.

581
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,229
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

582
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,107
It's amazing.

583
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,984
He's amazing.

584
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,780
So what now?

585
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,783
Hiccup, yöur final exam is tomorrow.

586
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:14,077
yöu know yöu'll have to kill...

587
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,787
...kill a dragon.

588
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,664
Don't remind me.

589
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:20,208
Toothless, what's happening?

590
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,087
What is it?

591
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,966
Get down!

592
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:46,985
<font color="#808080">-</font> What's going on?
<font color="#808080">-</font> I don't know.

593
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,155
Toothless, yöu gotta get us
out of here, bud.

594
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,118
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

595
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,829
What does that make us?

596
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,250
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

597
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:03,645
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

598
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:06,648
They're not eating any of it.

599
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,748
What is that?

600
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,884
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

601
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:47,063
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

602
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:49,232
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

603
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,943
It controls them. Let's find yöur dad.

604
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,361
No! No.

605
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,782
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

606
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,660
We have to think this through
carefully.

607
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,747
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

608
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,625
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

609
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:09,085
and yöu want to keep it a secret?

610
00:59:09,253 --> 00:59:12,172
To protect yöur pet dragon?
Are yöu serious?

611
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,508
Yes.

612
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:25,477
OK. Then what do we do?

613
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,397
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

614
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,316
OK.

615
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,152
That's for kidnapping me.

616
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,870
That's for everything else.

617
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,048
What are yöu looking at?

618
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,928
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

619
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,142
I can show my face in public again!

620
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,564
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

621
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:16,319
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup

622
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:20,991
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

623
01:00:21,158 --> 01:00:23,743
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

624
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,745
And yöu know it!

625
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:32,711
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

626
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:35,880
or more proud than I am.

627
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,801
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

628
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,179
Today, he becomes one of us!

629
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:49,060
Be careful with that dragon.

630
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,647
<font color="#808080">-</font> It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What are yöu going to do?

631
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,900
Put an end to this. I have to try.

632
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:00,030
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

633
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:02,240
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.

634
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:06,453
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

635
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:10,457
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

636
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,465
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

637
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:21,885
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

638
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:35,940
I would have gone for the hammer.

639
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,279
I'm ready.

640
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,931
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

641
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,686
What is he doing?

642
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,109
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

643
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:28,159
I'm not one of them.

644
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,541
What's he thinking?

645
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,584
<font color="#808080">-</font> Stop the fight.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!

646
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,462
I need yöu all to see this.

647
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,507
They're not what we think they are.

648
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,676
We don't have to kill them.

649
01:02:46,178 --> 01:02:48,388
I said, stop the fight!

650
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,147
Out of my way!

651
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:20,462
Hiccup!

652
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,553
This way!

653
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,158
Night Fury!

654
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,553
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

655
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:13,932
Go, go!

656
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,099
Stoick, no!

657
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,643
Dad, he won't hurt yöu!

658
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,688
No, don't!
yöu're only making it worse!

659
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:22,815
Toothless, stop!

660
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,444
No! No!

661
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,074
Get him!

662
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,663
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

663
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,790
Please don't hurt him.

664
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,257
Put it with the others.

665
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,512
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

666
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,514
<font color="#808080">-</font> Dad?
<font color="#808080">-</font> We had a deal!

667
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:58,726
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

668
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:02,313
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?

669
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:06,609
I screwed up. I should have
told yöu before now. I just...

670
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:10,321
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

671
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,658
The dragon?
That's what yöu're worried about?

672
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,535
Not the people yöu almost killed?

673
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,121
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

674
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,290
They've killed hundreds of us!

675
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,166
And we've killed thousands of them!

676
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:27,589
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

677
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:31,593
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

678
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,055
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...

679
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,975
Their island?
So yöu've been to the nest?

680
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,935
<font color="#808080">-</font> Did I say nest?
<font color="#808080">-</font> How did yöu find it?

681
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,646
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

682
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,524
Only a dragon can find the island.

683
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,987
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what yöu think.

684
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:54,198
yöu don't know what yöu're up against.
It's like nothing yöu've ever seen.

685
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:58,286
Dad, please. I promise yöu,
yöu can't win this one!

686
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,496
No, Dad. No.

687
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:03,625
For once in yöur life,
would yöu please just listen to me?!

688
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:11,174
yöu've thrown yöur lot in with them.
yöu're not a Viking.

689
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,303
yöu're not my son.

690
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:19,766
Ready the ships!

691
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,987
This way.

692
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,864
Set sail!

693
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,617
We head for Helheim's Gate.

694
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,461
Lead us home, devil.

695
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,859
It's a mess.

696
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:57,447
yöu must feel horrible.
yöu've lost everything,

697
01:07:57,614 --> 01:08:00,491
yöur father, yöur tribe,
yöur best friend.

698
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,827
Thank yöu for summing that up.

699
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,166
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

700
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:12,628
<font color="#808080">-</font> Would have been better for everyone.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

701
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:15,339
So why didn't yöu?

702
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,803
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why didn't yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> I don't know.

703
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,681
<font color="#808080">-</font> I couldn't.
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's not an answer.

704
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,142
Why is this so important
to yöu all of a sudden?

705
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,520
Because I want to remember
what yöu say right now.

706
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:34,734
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

707
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,152
yöu said "wouldn't".

708
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,488
Whatever! I wouldn't!

709
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:42,533
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

710
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,956
First one to ride one, though.

711
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:52,418
So?

712
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:58,758
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

713
01:08:59,843 --> 01:09:03,429
I looked at him and I saw myself.

714
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:09,936
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are yöu going to do about it?

715
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:15,900
<font color="#808080">-</font> Probably something stupid.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Good, but yöu've already done that.

716
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,529
Then something crazy.

717
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:22,532
That's more like it.

718
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:34,252
Sound yöur positions.
Stay within earshot.

719
01:09:34,419 --> 01:09:36,921
<font color="#808080">-</font> Here!
<font color="#808080">-</font> One length to yöur stern.

720
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:42,301
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

721
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:46,097
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

722
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,766
I know yöu're always the man
with the plan. But some,

723
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:52,436
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

724
01:09:52,604 --> 01:09:56,232
<font color="#808080">-</font> and what it might be.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Find the nest and take it.

725
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,526
Of course. Send them running.

726
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,445
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

727
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,039
Step aside.

728
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,512
Bear to port.

729
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:35,813
If yöu're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

730
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,985
yöu were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

731
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:42,153
It's me.

732
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,697
<font color="#808080">-</font> I love this plan.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I didn't...

733
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:47,742
yöu're crazy. I like that.

734
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,578
So, what is the plan?

735
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,506
That's not really encouraging.

736
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,969
I was wondering where that went.

737
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,193
Stay low and ready yöur weapons.

738
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,168
We're here.

739
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,620
<font color="#808080">-</font> Wait! What are yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Relax.

740
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,998
It's OK. It's OK.

741
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,677
Where are yöu going?

742
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,471
yöu'll need something
to help yöu hold on.

743
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:45,735
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

744
01:12:45,902 --> 01:12:48,863
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

745
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,283
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

746
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,006
Is that it?

747
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:55,012
We've done it!

748
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:08,067
This isn't over!
Form yöur ranks! Hold together!

749
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,873
Get clear!

750
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,927
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

751
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,016
Odin help us.

752
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,897
Catapults!

753
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,951
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get to the ships!
<font color="#808080">-</font> No! No!

754
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,757
<font color="#808080">-</font> Smart, that one.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I was a fool.

755
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:16,093
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

756
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:17,428
Gobber, go with the men!

757
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,556
I think I'll stay, in case yöur
thinking of doing something crazy.

758
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,851
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

759
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,561
Then I can double that time.

760
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,609
<font color="#808080">-</font> Here!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Oh, no! Here!

761
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:44,914
Come on! Fight me!

762
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:46,957
No, me!

763
01:15:53,548 --> 01:15:55,799
Ruff, Tuff! Watch yöur backs!

764
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:58,135
Move, Fishlegs!

765
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,139
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

766
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:06,101
Up! Let's move it!

767
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:11,023
Every bit the boar headed
stubborn Viking yöu ever were!

768
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:14,443
<font color="#808080">-</font> Fishlegs, break it down!
<font color="#808080">-</font> OK.

769
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,404
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

770
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:21,575
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!

771
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,120
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

772
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:28,999
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!

773
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,542
That's my specialty!

774
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:34,004
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

775
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:37,424
Just do what I told yöu!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

776
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,344
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't worry! We got it covered!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yeah!

777
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,396
<font color="#808080">-</font> Troll!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Butt elf!

778
01:16:50,563 --> 01:16:52,106
Bride of Grendel!

779
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,364
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

780
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,159
There!

781
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:13,794
Go help the others!

782
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:17,047
OK, hold on. Hold on.

783
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,470
<font color="#808080">-</font> It's working!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yeah, it's working!

784
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:36,483
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

785
01:17:39,904 --> 01:17:41,447
I'm OK!

786
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:43,073
Less OK!

787
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:49,455
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in yöur eye?

788
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,336
Yeah! yöu're the Viking!

789
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,208
Dad?

790
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:54,395
yöu got it, bud.

791
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,357
Hiccup!

792
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,071
I'm sorry... for everything.

793
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:05,572
Yeah. Me, too.

794
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,616
yöu don't have to go up there.

795
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:11,662
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

796
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,999
I'm proud to call yöu my son.

797
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,419
Thanks, Dad.

798
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:25,801
He's up!

799
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,222
Get Snotlout out of there.

800
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,640
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'm on it!
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'm on it first!

801
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,350
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hey, let me drive!
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'm ahead of yöu.

802
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:34,977
No, this way.

803
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,354
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't push me!
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'll take yöur teeth out!

804
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,152
I can't believe that worked!

805
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:51,702
Night Fury!

806
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,620
Get down!

807
01:20:03,506 --> 01:20:04,548
Did yöu get her?

808
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:16,059
Go.

809
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:20,606
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!

810
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,582
yöu think that did it?

811
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,255
Well, he can fly.

812
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:08,820
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

813
01:21:08,988 --> 01:21:10,239
Come on, bud!

814
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:17,955
Here it comes!

815
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,633
Watch out!

816
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,138
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.

817
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:20,934
Come on! Is that the best yöu can do?!

818
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:41,204
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

819
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,502
Hold, Toothless.

820
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,421
Now!

821
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:14,529
No.

822
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,406
No!

823
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:36,259
Hiccup!

824
01:23:37,553 --> 01:23:38,804
Son!

825
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:42,933
Hiccup.

826
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,373
Oh, son.

827
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:09,418
I did this.

828
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:42,492
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

829
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,167
Hiccup!

830
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:59,968
He's alive.
yöu brought him back alive.

831
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:19,905
Thank yöu for saving my son.

832
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,700
Well, yöu know... most of him.

833
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,595
Hey, Toothless.

834
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,723
I'm happy to see yöu, too.

835
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,479
I'm in my house.

836
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:55,482
yöu're in my house.

837
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:57,400
Does my dad know yöu're here?

838
01:25:57,568 --> 01:25:59,736
What? OK, OK.

839
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,322
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

840
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,616
Toothless! Oh, come on.

841
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,866
OK. Thanks, bud.

842
01:26:56,544 --> 01:27:00,088
<font color="#808080">-</font> Toothless, stay here.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Come on, guys. Get ready!

843
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:01,506
Hold on tight! Here we go!

844
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,886
What?

845
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:16,354
I knew it. I'm dead.

846
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:21,484
No, but yöu gave it yöur best shot.
So, what do yöu think?

847
01:27:21,652 --> 01:27:23,320
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

848
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:25,989
It's Hiccup!

849
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:31,661
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

850
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:33,914
yöu just gestured to all of me.

851
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:38,126
Well, most of yöu.
That bit's my handiwork.

852
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,796
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
yöu think it'll do?

853
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:44,257
I might make a few tweaks.

854
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:47,969
That's for scaring me.

855
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:50,680
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...

856
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:54,809
...I could get used to it.

857
01:27:58,022 --> 01:27:59,856
Welcome home.

858
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,317
<font color="#808080">-</font> Night Fury!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get down!

859
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,454
yöu ready?

860
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:19,084
This is Berk.

861
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:23,338
It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.

862
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,635
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.

863
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,306
The people that grow here
are even more so.

864
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:39,312
The only upsides are the pets.

865
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:45,986
While other places
have ponies or parrots...

866
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:48,863
...we have...

867
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,324
...dragons.
