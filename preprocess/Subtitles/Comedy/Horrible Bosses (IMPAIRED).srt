-You gonna rat me out too?
DALE: l could.

1470
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,853
You stole a BlackBerry. You fled a crime.
You raped my boss.

1471
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,564
-l did not rape her.
-l'll climb over and kick your ass!

1472
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,900
-Wanna see what happens?
-Hey! Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

1473
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,777
-Right this way.
-Yeah, let's do it. Come on.

1474
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,529
Let's go in there. Let's go. Let's do it.

1475
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,783
Do you wanna explain
why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1476
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,161
...one block from the victim's house...

1477
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,496
...just moments after he got shot dead?

1478
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,333
I was drag racing.

1479
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,253
-l'm a drag racer.
-You were drag racing?

1480
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,671
Mm.

1481
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,882
In a Prius?

1482
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,386
I don't win a lot.

1483
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,889
Here's what l don't understand.

1484
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,266
You were at the crime scene.

1485
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:31,729
Hour later we find the car. You happened to
be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1486
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,732
-A registered sex offender.
-lt was an empty playground.

1487
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,028
And this guy. Who happens to be working
for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1488
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,905
What?

1489
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,491
My boss was murdered?

1490
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:49,747
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his
house, Nick? Why were you there?

1491
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,250
Where were you during the murder?

1492
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,797
I was making love.
I was making love to a woman.

1493
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,091
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1494
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:04,011
-Detectives....
KURT: No, uh, l have a question.

1495
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,847
If one of us knew, you know,
who the shooter was...

1496
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:11,352
...and he was willing to
serve you that perp on a platter...

1497
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,481
...he would be entitled
to some sort of immunity, right?

1498
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,484
No. He would be entitled
to some jail time.

1499
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:21,487
If he knew who the shooter was
and didn't tell us...

1500
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,531
...that would be obstruction ofjustice.

1501
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,616
Glad none of us
know who the shooter is.

1502
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:30,871
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1503
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,207
...we're gonna be here for a long time.

1504
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:40,089
Okay, wait. By saying
"we're gonna be here for a long time"...

1505
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,509
...you're implying that
we're not allowed to leave...

1506
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:47,304
...which would only be the case if we
were under arrest. Are we under arrest?

1507
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:50,474
No. We just brought you in
for questioning.

1508
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,145
Well, then, ipso facto...

1509
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:57,648
...you don't have sufficient evidence...

1510
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,651
...constituting probable cause
for an arrest warrant.

1511
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,819
Not yet.

1512
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,490
Well, uh, then, pursuant to
the Fourth Amendment...

1513
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:10,953
...l believe we are free to go.
Are we not?

1514
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,997
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1515
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,000
Technically is good enough for me.

1516
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,003
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1517
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,005
Let's go.

1518

-Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1521
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,683

learn stuff watching Law & Order.

1522
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,685
-We showed them, huh?
-We did show them.

1523

You were about to turn us in.

1524
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,939
There was a few conversations
about ratting each other out...

-Lying! You know there's DNA in your butt.

He's covered us this far, right?
Five grand?

Didn't work out. We need your help.

Thank you, but we had nothing to do
with it. We don't know why it happened.

No, no, they don't suspect him.

Get him to confess to the murder
while you're wearing a wire.

Wait, no. You said you did a dime
for some pretty nasty shit.

1571
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:54,909
It was some nasty shit,
but does that mean l murdered somebody?

1572
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,118
You implied it.

1573
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,495
You didn't murder someone,

-Never seen that.
-l love that movie.

1578
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:13,636
What happened was is that l took a video
camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

-l know who's in it.

1585
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,113
Everyone knows the movie. That's not
the point. You tricked us, Motherfuck--

stack up quite right with this, all right?

1587
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:42,331
So you just call yourself a video pirate,
right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1588
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,000
Why do you carry a gun on you,
Mr. Video Pirate?

1589
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,669
-A gun?
-Yeah.

1590
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,963
-l don't wanna see it.
-lt's my cell phone.

-Let's go.
-You are a moron.

hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1600
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,836
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready
to roll, I got some fresh batteries in here.

1601
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,923
It was a pretty big investment so l should
be the one who does the tape-recording.

1602
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,300
-No way. No, l'll do it.
-You're gonna do it?

1603
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:37,511
You'll have to duct-tape that
to your chest.

1604
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,097
I can't tape this to my chest.
I have hair on chest.

1605
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,100
Just put it in your pocket.
Not gonna tape it to his chest.

1606
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:47,938
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come
home, we grab a office chair or something?

1607
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,608
One of us gets in the chair, spins around
and dramatically confronts him.

1608
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,610
-l'm in the chair.
-Nick's in the chair.

1609
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,654
-Why are you in the chair?
-He's my boss.

1610
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:59,283
Maybe we should get three chairs
and all spin around at the same time.

1611
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,576
Confront him like that.

1612
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,203
That's not intimidating,
that's like a musical number.
