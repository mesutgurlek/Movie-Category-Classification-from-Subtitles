1
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:29,454
Guardian of the Universe.
Protector against the forces of evil

2
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:31,073
He can catch a bullet,
faster than a speeding train.

3
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:33,237
He leaps tall buildings in a single bound.

4
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,838
Up in the sky.
Is it a bird, is it a plane?

5
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:39,721
...Mailman by day,
guardian by night.

6
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,752
He protects New York
from the forces of evil.

7
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:47,256
...The World has been protected by extraordinary men and
women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime.

8
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:54,051
He has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings.

9
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,635
I always wondered why nobody did it
before me

10
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:12,083
I mean, all those comic
books. Movies. TV shows...

11
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,001
You'd think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume.

12
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,888
Is everyday life really so
exciting,

13
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:25,003
are schools and offices so thrilling,
that I’m the only one who ever fantasized about this?

14
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,648
C'mon. Be honest with yourself.

15
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:30,897
At some point in our lives,

16
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:34,393
we all wanted to be a super hero.

17
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:49,252
That's not me, by the way.

18
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:53,725
That's some Armenian guy with a history of
mental health problems.

19
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,292
Who am I?

20
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:59,683
I'm "Kick-Ass"

21
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,987
That's me. Back before any of this
crazy shit happened.

22
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:16,621
Guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero

23
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,703
Not saying there was anything wrong
with me.

24
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,897
But there's not nothing special either

25
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,614
I wasn't into sports

26
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:27,119
I wasn't a mathlete...
or a hard-core gamer...

27
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:31,190
I didn't have a piercing,
or an eating disorder,

28
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,136
or three thousand
friends on MySpace.

29
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:37,212
My only superpower was being invisible to girls

30
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,676
And out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.

31
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,262
Like most people my age, I just
existed.

32
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,346
Good morning, class

33
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:00,092
Please open your books to act II, scene II

34
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,878
Kick in my bedroom door, you'd
probably find me watching TV.

35
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,715
Or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.

36
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,656
You watching Family Guy?
Nope.

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,491
Me neither.

38
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:12,279
check on "nippleslip.com... It's good

39
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:18,346
Or "jerking off".
Mostly to my English teacher

40
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:25,328
Dave Lizewski, don't think I
haven't noticed you looking at my tits?

41
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:29,944
Oh!... I want your
hand all over me... Dave...

42
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:30,946
Please

43
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:37,323
Sure a lot of what got me through the average school day
was making deposits in the wack-off warehouse for later

44
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,898
Though, to be honest I didn't take much to set me off.

45
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:48,189
I swear, when hormones balance out
shares in Kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.

46
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,210
Dave Lizewski

47
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,484
Shouldn't you be looking at Hamlet right now?

48
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,086
Yes, Mrs. Zane

49
00:03:59,192 --> 00:03:59,896
Sorry

50
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,627
But don't get me wrong

51
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,025
I like girls in my own age, too.

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,340
Especially Katie Deauxma.

53
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:08,782
Hey gorgeous!

54
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,341
Hey!

55
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:14,947
Oh, No

56
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,812
Ah, you meant - Erika

57
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,856
I know. I
knew that.

58
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,610
I was just kidding.

59
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,018
O.K., cool.

60
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:25,995
oh, my God

61
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,356
Hey, look I'm Todd's mom.

62
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,653
Oh, that's funny, this is your dad

63
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,303
No That's still my mom, actually

64
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,996
What the fuck?

65
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,822
I was just a regular guy.

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,683
No radioactive spiders.
No refugee status from a doomed alien world.

67
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:54,488
You know what? Todd said they do still make Count
Chocula. They just don’t sell it in the store anymore.

68
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:59,015
My mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen,

69
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,163
as opposed to a
gunman in an alley.

70
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:05,269
So if you were hoping for any...
I will avenge you, mother!

71
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:06,919
...You're outta luck.

72
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:09,145
In the eighteen months
since my mother died,

73
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:12,500
the only epiphany I had was realizing that,
life just goes on.

74
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,495
Did they change the bee's face?

75
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,206
No

76
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,129
How come nobody's ever tried to be
a superhero?

77
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,673
well, I dunno. Probably
'cause it's fucking impossible, dip-shit.

78
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:33,574
What, putting on a mask and helping
people? How is that impossible?

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,014
That's not a superhero, though. It has to have Super

80
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,443
Super is like, being stronger than everybody and flying and shit.
That's just hero.

81
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:42,028
No, It's not even hero, it’s just fuckin'
psycho.

82
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,388
Hello? Bruce Wayne?

83
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:45,643
He didn't have any powers.

84
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,870
Yes, but he had all expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

85
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,384
I thought you meant, like how come
no one does it in real life.

86
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,849
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

87
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,140
Dude if anybody did it in real life
they'd get their ass kicked.

88
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,173
They'd be dead in like, a day.
... A day.

89
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,078
O.K., I'm not saying they should do it.

90
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,924
I just can’t figure out why nobody
does.

91
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:03,546
Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes

92
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,305
you'd think
one would give it a try.

93
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,570
Jesus, guys. Doesn't it bug you?

94
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,052
Why do thousands of people wanna be Paris
Hilton, and nobody wants to be Spider-Man?

95
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:14,381
Yeah, what's with that? She has,
like, no tits at all.

96
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,200
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

97
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,093
You guys never saw One Night in
Spider-Man?

98
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,333
Guess who?

99
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,749
Is it just me, or do you feel kinda
sorry for Chris D'Amico?

100
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,952
Yeah, must be terrible to have a
rich dad and everything you want.

101
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,664
I wish you hadn't said anything. 'Cause I feel like I'm gonna start crying.

102
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:37,450
No, the fact that he's..

103
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:38,905
..always on his own.

104
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:43,233
We should, like, talk to him.

105
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,775
See if he wants to hang with us.

106
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,557
...I'm not saying that we should talk to him, but

107
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:50,624
Think about it. C'mon it’d be awesome! If he was
our friend, no one would ever fuck with us again!

108
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:52,287
Go on then, Todd.

109
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,770
You know. I, I can get up. -
No, no -
You wanna go talk to him? -

110
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,130
Nuh-uh. Dave should go.

111
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:56,597
Dave should go.

112
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,085
Why? Dave you should totally go. Go.

113
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,087
You're a dick.

114
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,093
Don't be afraid Dave

115
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:02,094
You're a pussy

116
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,418
Fuck off.

117
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,935
Wanna go over there? -
Yeah -...

118
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,106
You think I just shat my pants or what?...

119
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,328
Sea ya.

120
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,683
Yeah I would just klick his ass ??

121
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,668
When did you ever kick anyone's ass?

122
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,976
Whatever, man I would've just gone for his knees...

123
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,459
You are not making sense.

124
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:38,330
What I'm saying is that in the Joker portion when he got in "Evaran" when
he vowed to penetrate the Joker's force field leaving him totally vulnerable

125
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,787
Pussy Patrol!

126
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:41,561
Phones. Money.

127
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,915
Dude, not again
Come on

128
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:47,776
Phone. I don't have one!
Somebody else jacked it last week!

129
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,441
Pussy

130
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,588
Gimme the bag
It’s just comics.

131
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:53,172
Yo! You wanna get cut?

132
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,646
Look at this asshole, just watching

133
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:12,798
Come on, be honest with yourself

134
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,155
would you do anything differently

135
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,026
We see someone in trouble
and we wish we can help

136
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:21,881
But we don't

137
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,906
The world I lived in,
heroes only exist in comic books

138
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,145
But I guess that would have been OK, if bad guys were make believe too.

139
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,712
But they are not

140
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,870
Frankie. I'm telling you man. I swear I'm not making this up.

141
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:48,567
This fucking guy... Comes outta nowhere
kicks our asses and steals all the coke

142
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,642
This would be the guy that looks
like Batman.

143
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,313
I didn't say he looked like Batman.

144
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:55,072
You did Tre. You said the the guy looked like Batman

145
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,506
And you said like a mask and
stuff and a cape? Yeah like Batman.

146
00:08:57,507 --> 00:09:00,602
I didn't say like Batman -
I never said ‘Batman’-

147
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,033
OK

148
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,830
Let me tell you the problem I
got with that, Tre.

149
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,842
Our mole with the
Russians tells things a little different.

150
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:14,513
according to him, you've sold him my coke
and you took the money

151
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,189
That's a fucking lie!

152
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:20,515
I can't believe that you would believe this shit from
a fucking Russian, man.

153
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,243
Let me see, Tre. Hey, what's more likely?

154
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,631
That you're a greedy little cocksucker,

155
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:28,856
Or that all my coke was stolen by Superman?
Batman.

156
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:30,308
I never said Batman!

157
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:31,759
Enough

158
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,856
My son is waitin' out there in the car
to go to the movies.

159
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,374
And I aint gonna to disappoint him

160
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,144
Joe, you're in charge

161
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:46,024
Thanks
- That's gotta be the worst fuckin' excuse I ever heard, Tre.

162
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:47,811
(Screaming)

163
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:54,917
Sorry you had to wait, buddy.

164
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,570
The movie is starting in 10 minutes

165
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,140
It's O.K. We're cool.

166
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:00,131
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

167
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,682
Yeah, but I wanted to,
get some popcorn.

168
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,820
When we get in there, get Chris some
popcorn.

169
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:04,910
Okay?

170
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,127
What do you wanna drink, wanna Pepsi?

171
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,207
Yeah, that's fine

172
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,898
Get him a Pepsi
and I'll have an Icee.

173
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:11,913
Mixed

174
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,315
Like, when they mix the red one and the blue one?

175
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,425
(gun shot in background)

176
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:17,335
And a pack of Twizzlers.

177
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:40,296
The comic-books had it wrong.

178
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:46,230
It didn't take a trauma, or cosmic
rays or a power ring to make a superhero.

179
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:51,095
...Just the perfect combination of
optimism and naivety.

180
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,990
You are fucking awesome.

181
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,261
C'mon

182
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:57,557
Daddy? I'm scared.

183
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:59,427
C'mon Mindy, honey.

184
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,715
Be a big girl now.

185
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:02,480
There's nothin' to be afraid of.

186
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,859
Is it gonna hurt bad?

187
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,176
Oh, child. Only for a second, sugar.

188
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,604
A handgun bullet travels at... more than?

189
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,795
700 miles an hour.

190
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:12,901
700 miles an hour.

191
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,453
So at close range like this, the force is gonna take
you off your feet, for sure.

192
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:20,071
But it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

193
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,856
I hate getting punched in the
chest.

194
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:24,385
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

195
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:33,467
How was that?

196
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:34,615
Not so bad.

197
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,188
Kinda fun, huh?

198
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,686
Now you know how it feels,

199
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,577
you won't be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a Glock.

200
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:42,905
I wouldn't have been scared anyways.

201
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,418
That's my girl!

202
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,155
Alright. Up you get.

203
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,680
Two more rounds, and then home.

204
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,526
Again?

205
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:50,442
Uh-huh.

206
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,200
Look, only if we can go by the bowling alley
on the way back.

207
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,736
The bowling alley?

208
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:56,938
Yep

209
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:57,854
And icecream after

210
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,288
Hmm

211
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:00,801
Okay

212
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,504
Two more rounds,

213
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:07,866
no wincing, no whining and you got yourself a
deal, young lady.

214
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:10,535
I'm gonna get Hot fudge sundae.

215
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,412
Good call, baby doll!

216
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,010
So you gonna tell a little more about what you might
want

217
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,089
for your birthday?

218
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,667
Can I get a puppy?

219
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,823
Do you want to get a dog?

220
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,589
Yeah. A cuddly fluffy one.

221
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:28,105
and a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.

222
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,084
I'm just fucking with you daddy!

223
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:37,883
Look.
I'd love a Benchmade model-42 butterfly knife.

224
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,980
Oh child. You always knock me for a loop.

225
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,373
You know what?
We gonna get you two

226
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,363
Two?

227
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,854
One ... ?? Two ... ??

228
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,608
That's what you get.

229
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,932
I'll be honest,

230
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:25,858
there wasn't a whole lotta crime
fighting in those first few weeks.

231
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:31,089
But even so, my new vocation kept
me plenty busy.

232
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:39,502
I called it preparation.

233
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,260
But if you called it fantasizing,

234
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:45,463
it woulda been hard to argue.

235
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:50,417
All I knew was I never felt so good about myself.

236
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:06,720
Fuck!

237
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:11,378
Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing
phase.

238
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,946
But it was a start.

239
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,543
What the fuck are you looking at?

240
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,009
Nothing

241
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,488
Get the fuck out of here

242
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:45,196
Like every serial killer already knew, eventually
fantasizing just doesn’t do it for you anymore.

243
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,017
It was time to engage

244
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,830
What the fuck?

245
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,999
What the fuck are you looking at?

246
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,186
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

247
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:18,625
Two cheapshit losers screwing with a car that
somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for.

248
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,580
Say what?

249
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,063
Leave it be man.

250
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,135
This Motherfucker is obviously high.

251
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,506
I'm not high.

252
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:31,588
I just think it sucks you guys think you can do
what you want.

253
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,664
Just walk away from the car,
and we can just forget about this.

254
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,971
You crazy, man!

255
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,427
Fuck this shit!

256
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:54,912
Shit! Get outta here!

257
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:39,819
I came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell
anybody about the costume

258
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,727
He promised he wouldn't

259
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:47,100
All I knew was that my dad was gonna kill me.

260
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:03,972
Why can't I have a gun?
I am a security guard

261
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,187
You're a doorman, now. You don't get a gun no more.

262
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:09,193
Look at me. I look like a putz.
You look sharp. Look at all them buttons

263
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,895
Do your job. Open the fucking door

264
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,437
Have a nice day

265
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:43,960
Good Morning Frank

266
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,566
Hey Joe. How ya doin'?

267
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,552
Great -
want some coffee? -

268
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:48,958
Maybe later

269
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,152
Good morning Angie

270
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,142
Chris -
Good Morning Joe -

271
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,640
Frank we got a thing

272
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,275
It's a big thing Frank

273
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,708
OK

274
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,559
Sorry then

275
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,886
do what you gotta do

276
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:12,591
Chris, where you think you're going?

277
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,692
I gotta talk to dad.

278
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:14,442
Christopher

279
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:15,734
Frank Honey

280
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:19,569
Where do you think you're going?

281
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,274
I don't mind you talking business. Dad

282
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:26,380
I was just gonna sit in there quietly. I mean I should probably
start learning and stuff, anyway, right?.

283
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,093
Go finish your oatmeal

284
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:31,453
Goddamit! I'm gonna be 18 in eight months for
christ sakes.

285
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:35,782
Take a seat

286
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:39,925
So, what's the problem?

287
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Our Russian says Tre just sold them
another 5 K's, at half price.

288
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,666
Which Tre? Tre Tre?

289
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,822
Right. Dead Tre.

290
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,981
So now I'm getting fucked in the
ass by a ghost.

291
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,652
Or Tre was telling the truth.

292
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:58,106
What so this is my choice? I have to
believe in ghosts or superheroes?

293
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,035
Not the part about the superhero, Franky. Just
that he mighta really been gaffled by somebody.

294
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:10,387
I think we better invited our
Russian over for a friendly chat.

295
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:15,104
See what's really going on.

296
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,667
Hey, early birdy

297
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:34,135
You beat me to it.
I wanted to get you breakfast this morning

298
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,975
Happy birthday, sweetheart

299
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,452
check this out

300
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:50,171
Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

301
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,337
Oh my God

302
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:52,775
Dad

303
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,025
Wow

304
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:58,145
Wow, dad

305
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,447
Ok, pop quiz

306
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,294
What's the proper name for one of those?

307
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,260
Isabelle It's... uh... Filippino. Ask me another one.

308
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,958
Excellent, good.

309
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:11,617
The AR 15 was a lighter, smaller caliber version
of what design?

310
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,451
Eugene 7 AR-10
Give me a hard one.

311
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:21,193
Name John Woo's first full length feature.

312
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,905
Chi bi xia: Jue zhan tian xia

313
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,618
Daddy look

314
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,411
Hey, come on, you're not looking

315
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:33,550
the point is some fucker's killing our guys

316
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:38,493
If you find out who that is I don't wanna see
any of you bitches sitting on your asses all right!

317
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:39,997
What the fuck you...?

318
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,315
Hello

319
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,220
Hey Joe, yeah

320
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:46,014
No, I was just training right now

321
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:46,757
one second

322
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,866
Dad... phone.

323
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,288
Dad, the phone's for you

324
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,488
Who is it?
it's Joe

325
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,952
what's the problem? -
Yeah, Frank turns out, man's got the vice here no more.

326
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,410
Really -
aha -

327
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:08,194
But we do got a brand new industrial microwave they use her for treating the lumber.

328
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,414
So where is it?

329
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:14,240
I think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber

330
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:18,808
Well, you're right, I'm sorry, -
Just get the information -

331
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,100
Alright come on, go ahead

332
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:24,454
Hey look the guy told me he killed Fernandez

333
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:25,892
What I know? -
Shut up -

334
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,452
Jesus Fernandez is dead.

335
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:28,988
Now, shut up

336
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,522
He lied, so...

337
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:35,523
This works like a regular microwave, or what?

338
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:39,157
Fuck do I know? We're not making a fucking Hungry Man dinner here, just turn it on!

339
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,023
Here we go

340
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,256
O.K. I want to know who sold you our coke?

341
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:49,171
And don't tell me somebody
who's dead, this time

342
00:22:57,882 --> 00:23:00,773
I said...

343
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:05,107
Who

344
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:07,228
Sold

345
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:08,133
You

346
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:10,830
Our... coke?

347
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:14,704
Shit

348
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:20,887
This is awesome

349
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:22,926
I look like freakin' Wolverine.

350
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,826
They still have that metal detector
at your school?

351
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:30,196
Yeah, It's gonna have a meltdown!

352
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,700
Dave, I need to ask you something.

353
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:36,671
OK

354
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,407
The police report...

355
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,017
They found you naked. You said you didn't remember why.

356
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,746
The muggers... they didn't...?

357
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:46,961
What?

358
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,435
No

359
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:52,291
Jesus! No!

360
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,956
I wasn't even...

361
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,429
In the ambulance, they threw
my clothes away!

362
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,940
Cause of the blood.
Right

363
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,324
Seem like no time at all ...? back on my feet

364
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,674
Dave, What? -
Shhhs.

365
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:13,761
Apart from the messed up nerve ending.

366
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:15,888
The doctors had managed to fix me up pretty good.

367
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,866
Did you feel that?

368
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:18,533
No

369
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:21,562
You're like fucking Jason Bourne or
something! That owns!

370
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,815
How about that?
No. Marty,

371
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:25,703
give it a fuckin' rest,
man.

372
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:29,033
I've only been back, like, half a day and
already you’re making fun of me at the hospital.

373
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,559
He's right
I'm sorry

374
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,002
You're acting totally childish

375
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,471
Hey

376
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,329
Dave Hey

377
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,086
Oh, hey

378
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,024
How are you?

379
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,434
You look better

380
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:56,634
I'm OK

381
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,100
Yeah, much better

382
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:01,028
Hey, you’re into comic books, aren’t
you?

383
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:04,043
Well... me and Erika sometimes hang out
after school at this really great store,

384
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,714
Atomic Comics. They make the best like Crack-a-back-a-latte.

385
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:09,709
Yeah...?

386
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:17,556
Well... I could buy you one... sometime if
you want? If you, like, need someone to talk to?

387
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,329
sure, thank you

388
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,997
Ok. Sweet. Well I'll
see you later

389
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,577
Man, did you just see that?!
Yeah -

390
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,323
Katie Deauxma just offered to buy me coffee

391
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:34,293
Yeah.. I really don't think that's the way it looks like

392
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:35,410
What are you talking about?

393
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,673
The point is, Katie Deauxma is all
about the lame ducks.

394
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:40,959
What's that got to do with me?

395
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,154
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this

396
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:46,339
There's a rumor going around, right...

397
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,469
that you... what? are gay

398
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:49,741
Gay!

399
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:51,368
What kind of rumor is that?

400
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:52,942
Well you know, getting mugged...

401
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,199
You guys have been mugged!

402
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,001
Yeah, I know... but... you know..
we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.

403
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,354
That's not even true! The medics
threw my clothes away!

404
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:04,605
Don't worry about it. Rumors don't mean shit.
We know the truth

405
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:05,560
Right? -
Yes -

406
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:07,844
Yeah. And who knows, it might even
get you laid.

407
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,647
Not if she thinks he's gay, Todd,

408
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,065
you fuckin' retard!

409
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:13,472
Thanks a lot, Marty.
You aint fucking helping me-

410
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,321
I'm just being honest

411
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:20,318
I was getting back to my old self

412
00:26:20,353 --> 00:26:21,660
I should have quit, of course.

413
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,647
But you can't just re-program
yourself

414
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:28,007
what you want, who you
are... your purpose in life.

415
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,545
oh no... I'm just stand around here

416
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:34,654
It is what it is.

417
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,213
You didn't see that did ya?

418
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:41,954
I think it's best that you just walk away

419
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:43,231
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

420
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:44,402
What?
Huh?

421
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:45,665
You looking at me?

422
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:46,828
Well this is my baby.

423
00:26:58,156 --> 00:26:59,153
Me?

424
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:00,521
My hardware was fixed now.

425
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,792
I was back and running Kick-ass
version 2.0

426
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,628
Excuse me, did you see this cat?

427
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:17,352
No

428
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:18,353
Okay, thank you

429
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:20,340
Excuse me, Madam, Have you seen this cat?

430
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,196
I'm sorry, did you see this cat?

431
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,300
Oh, great

432
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,016
Here kitty

433
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,014
Here Mr. Bitey

434
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,196
Come on, no, no

435
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,430
No, no, Mr. Bitey Come on

436
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:04,495
Back here. C'mon. Let's get you home

437
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:05,697
Come on

438
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:18,700
Fuck you Mr. Bitey!

439
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:24,754
Oh God... I'm so sorry, man

440
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,414
You're fucking Green...!

441
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,394
Hey freak...

442
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:35,752
Hey, leave him alone

443
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:36,743
Fuck off me

444
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:37,744
It's none of your business.

445
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:41,926
Guess it is.

446
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,832
Hey, Call 911

447
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:20,762
There's a dude dressed like a superhero out there fighting a bunch of guys.

448
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,276
It's Fucking awesome!

449
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:53,683
Leave him alone

450
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:01,255
Give it up man.

451
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,033
Just walk away

452
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:04,592
No, never

453
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,480
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

454
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,165
You'd rather die for some piece of shit?

455
00:30:10,146 --> 00:30:11,711
That you don't even fucking know?

456
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:15,963
You're just three asholes laying into one guy while everyone else watches.

457
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:19,063
And you wanna know what's wrong with me?

458
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,807
Yeah, I'd rather die.

459
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,699
You bring it on!
(Police sirens in background)

460
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:30,969
You're fucking crazy kid

461
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,363
What?

462
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,461
Thank you!

463
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:46,916
That fucking rocks!

464
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,227
Who are you?

465
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:51,392
I'm Kick Ass

466
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:57,863
Dude you gotta check this shit out.

467
00:30:58,069 --> 00:30:59,594
what is it?

468
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:09,882
And coming up after the hour: a costumed vigilante has become the latest Internet phenomenon after a
Hamilton Park resident filmed the man's remarkable intervention in a gang-related attack last week...

469
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:11,053
This is awesome

470
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:12,067
Fuck Yeah.

471
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,501
Welcome to this special edition
of Eye on New York

472
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,671
How far would you go to help your fellow man?

473
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:20,437
This colorful individual has been all over the news this week

474
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,743
After this video of his intervention of street gang violence

475
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:26,239
became the most watched clip on the Internet

476
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:32,059
My Space... 38 friends

477
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:36,043
Kick-Ass' My Space... 16000 and counting.

478
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,954
This thing was going crazy

479
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:39,771
And I was loving it

480
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,979
And finally, we want to know who is this man

481
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,689
Does anyone have any
idea who this wet suit Crusader is?

482
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:50,971
He must be someone's son... Someone's
brother... Someone's next door neighbor...

483
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:52,728
Holy shit. What happened?

484
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,280
what happened?

485
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,570
This guy happened.

486
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:58,550
That's a great day for America everybody

487
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,732
Everbody's favorite superhero right now is Kick-Ass, right?

488
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:03,862
Kick-Ass!

489
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:05,720
Yeeaah!

490
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,051
I like Kick-Ass

491
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,303
His costume is crappy

492
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,475
He looks like a trans...

493
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,673
You know what? Everyone likes Kick-Ass

494
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,809
He...is actually pretty good.?

495
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:20,480
Good at getting his Ass-Kicked.

496
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,390
He should call himself Ass-Kick, instead

497
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,796
That doesn't even make any sense.

498
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,869
That guy's gonna end up dead that's what I think.

499
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,762
Are you serious? The guy owns.

500
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:35,187
I'd be next if I had a problem needed fixing.

501
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:38,962
What you kidding me? I have 100 guys can fix a problem.
You gotta some guy in some panty-hose?

502
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,683
Well, I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your business...

503
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:42,909
where I'm not wanted.

504
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:46,359
Please, I know you are mistaking me for Kick-Ass, but I am not Kick-Ass.

505
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,892
You don't actually read comics?

506
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,380
Yeah, I just started. I got recommended some.

507
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:11,185
Like Scott Pilgrim and...?

508
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:12,338
That kind of thing.

509
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,611
I'm not really into the whole superheroes thing, you know.

510
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:19,178
So... guess you're not gonna be lining up for
that new Kick-Ass comic, then.

511
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:20,852
I guess not.

512
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,755
You know what, I was seriously thinking of mailing his site?

513
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:26,156
I mean I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.

514
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,558
Help? Really? What with?

515
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,568
You know I volunteer at the
needle exchange?

516
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:33,594
No, I didn’t.

517
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:37,486
Well, there's this one guy,
Rasul. And I just felt so sorry for him and...

518
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:40,543
more I found out about his up bringing and stuff I just...

519
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,776
Wow, that's weird

520
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:47,020
I'm usually the one playing therapist.

521
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:51,250
Can I make a confession?

522
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,423
Ever since I was little

523
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:55,965
I've always wanted a
friend...

524
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:58,023
...like... you.

525
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,041
Is it okay to say that?

526
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:02,075
I mean it’s no homophobic, is it?

527
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:05,618
I mean I don't think you're all the
same, right?

528
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,137
Of course not. No.

529
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:18,923
Thank you

530
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:26,937
I don't know if I was everything Katie had
always dreamed her gay b. f. f. would be.

531
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,004
But I tried my best.

532
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,431
But, more importantly, I
talked her into e-mailing Kick-Ass.

533
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,121
Long story short,

534
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:39,852
this particular lame duck of hers
turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

535
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:46,066
She didn’t want the money back that she'd given
him, or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

536
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:48,271
She just wanted him to get that they
were through,

537
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:49,572
and leave her alone.

538
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:51,295
let’s be real

539
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,193
no other request could've given
me more pleasure.

540
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,359
Who the fuck you're supposed to be?
The Greeen Condom?

541
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,838
You know it ain't Halloween for another few
months, kid.

542
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:19,037
I'm here to see Rasul

543
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:21,985
Who the fuck are you?

544
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:25,425
I am K... I'm a friend of Katie's

545
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:32,860
Kids nowadays...?

546
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,732
So Uhh... which one of you guys is Rasul?

547
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:00,153
I am Rasul. Can't you tell by my big tittys?

548
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:04,870
What is this? Trick or treat or somethin'?

549
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:08,233
fuck

550
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,069
And now I am dead

551
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:12,038
I have a message for Rasul.

552
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,202
About Katie Deauxma.

553
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:17,969
Katie?

554
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:19,026
Oh you're Rasul?

555
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,726
Ok.

556
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:22,440
You've gotta stay
away from Katie now.

557
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:23,430
It's over.

558
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:25,855
So if you just leave her alone

559
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:27,278
everything will be fine

560
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:28,835
What?

561
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,098
Yo Kid...

562
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,275
Who the hell are you?

563
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:33,855
What is this?

564
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:37,147
I'm Kick-Ass.
Look me up.

565
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:39,412
And this is me giving you a message:

566
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,622
leave Katie alone!

567
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:54,567
Or what?

568
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:00,605
Or

569
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,970
I'll come back

570
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:04,569
and break your fucking legs.

571
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm right here now, baby

572
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:22,675
hold him

573
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:30,983
You're so fuckin' dead

574
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:47,633
Ok, you cunts

575
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,403
Let see what you can do now.

576
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:54,022
Eany... Meany... Miney... Mo

577
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,365
What the fuck?

578
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,360
Hey, I have one of those

579
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:01,744
Come on

580
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,673
So you wanna play

581
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,242
What the fuck?

582
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:26,966
Aww dude, that is one fuckin' gay fuckin'
taser.

583
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,655
Relax. We're on the same team.

584
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:34,679
Hey get Up

585
00:39:40,718 --> 00:39:44,211
Now, Hit Girl, we always keep our backs where?

586
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:46,235
To the wall, Daddy I know.

587
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:48,817
Um... it won't happen again

588
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:50,797
Nice shot by the way

589
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:51,892
Thank you

590
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,351
Be careful.

591
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,965
Hey, Green asshole. Can't use the front door now.

592
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:29,784
Wait, wait, wait!

593
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:32,502
What?

594
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,464
Who are you?

595
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:35,807
Me?

596
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:38,097
I'm "Hit Girl"

597
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,841
and that's " Big Daddy"

598
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,419
Come on

599
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,159
Come on!

600
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,053
"Hit Girl" and
"Big Daddy"

601
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,107
They were real deal.

602
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:37,491
Me

603
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,866
I was just a
stupid dick in a wetsuit.

604
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,579
What is this, What am I lookin' at here?

605
00:41:57,946 --> 00:42:00,845
It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.

606
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,342
They must have taken that right before he died

607
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:11,026
I know this sounds fucked up, Franky... but that guy in the
picture... I think it's that superhero nut job from the TV.

608
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:12,559
Who?

609
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:14,325
Kick-Ass?

610
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:16,259
One guy?

611
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,893
Hold on. You telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?

612
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:28,443
Eight at Sal's place... 4 at that kid, Rasul's.

613
00:42:30,154 --> 00:42:31,863
We have no mercenaries on the streets at all.
Right.

614
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:32,861
Made to understand?

615
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,787
One Guy

616
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,040
You think?

617
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,649
Nah if you're right, we're gonna look like the biggest bunch of pussies in New York

618
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:43,735
What do you want me to do?

619
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:49,662
I want Kick-Ass' fuckin' head on a stick. And I want it now.

620
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,948
I didn't say anything, to anyone, I
swear!

621
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,304
Good move. Ass, Kick.

622
00:43:03,305 --> 00:43:04,827
Let's keep it that way.

623
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,311
You know what this is?

624
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:11,742
All the cartridge crap that comes outta
your gay little taser when you fire it.

625
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:15,152
Do you know the police could've traced it
right back to you if they'd found it?

626
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:18,143
Lucky for you, I
picked it up.

627
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,615
Thank you.

628
00:43:22,054 --> 00:43:22,854
Let's call it insurance.

629
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:25,643
Makes it easier for me to take your word.

630
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,647
See, we like you. But we don't trust you.

631
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:32,541
Don't take it personal though. We
don't trust anybody.

632
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:39,047
I re-routed your IP address. Finding you was way too easy.

633
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:40,482
Aw Shit. Shit

634
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:44,010
I hadn't thought - My God, I...

635
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:45,348
I owe you

636
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:48,404
You know what? I'm thinking of
shutting my site down anyway,

637
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:52,734
quitting. This is... fucking insane.

638
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:55,266
I'm in way over my head.

639
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,632
It's a shame. You have potential.

640
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:00,588
Your call, son. But, y'know, we’re
around if you need us.

641
00:44:02,145 --> 00:44:03,145
How do I get hold of you?

642
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:07,587
Just contact the mayor's office. He has
a special signal he shines in the sky?

643
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:09,401
It's in the shape of a giant cock.

644
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,903
You need us, put on your web site that
you're on vacation.

645
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:13,923
We'll find you.

646
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,183
Hit Girl, back to headquarters

647
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,036
Sweet dreams.

648
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:26,266
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

649
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:27,761
What's up?

650
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:28,848
What's up?

651
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:32,082
Kick-Ass is killing my men, Gigante, that's
what's up

652
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:34,212
My condolences.

653
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:37,959
But I'm afraid I can't help you out on this one.

654
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,859
He's movin' outside my jurisdiction.

655
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,676
Outside your jurisdiction?

656
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:46,882
You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law! That's so inside
your jurisdiction it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass!

657
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:51,324
The boss pays me to nail the
bad guys. You pay me not to.

658
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,425
Everything else is in the grey area.

659
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,664
Yeah, Fuck you very much, Vic. Just do
it, okay?

660
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:58,810
Un-fuckin'believable

661
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:01,422
where is Cody?

662
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:03,068
He's late

663
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:07,138
Thank you, Cody. We appreciate
your cooperation.

664
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,290
Let me out now?

665
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:10,330
I gave you all them names and
address.

666
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:15,783
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody. You and you're crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once

667
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:18,188
...Hey c'mon now... that's a very bad thing you're doing now..

668
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,134
Really nasty individuals...

669
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:23,099
Let me go, Hey...
Do not do this

670
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:24,834
Come on!

671
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:26,039
please.. hey.. stop!

672
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,155
stop, please!
(Screaming)

673
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,565
What a douche.

674
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:05,140
You've done a self tan before, right?

675
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,825
Yeah, I do it all the time.

676
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:15,683
Murder. Superheroes breaking into my bedroom.
My life was turning into some fucked up dream I couldn't wake up from

677
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:20,388
Even with the good parts, were totally surreal

678
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:24,329
Oh hey, I read those old Ditko Spider-Mans
you gave me? They're actually pretty good.

679
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:27,019
Yeah, they are.

680
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,747
And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.

681
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,796
That's great.

682
00:47:28,717 --> 00:47:33,331
Once upon a time, there were two super cops called
Daddy and Marcus...

683
00:47:33,794 --> 00:47:35,935
who were very good at getting bad guys

684
00:47:37,556 --> 00:47:42,994
Frank Damico was the baddest guy of them all
and he came up with a plan to get rid of Daddy.

685
00:47:46,923 --> 00:47:51,465
Being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing
that could have happened to Daddy.

686
00:47:54,062 --> 00:47:57,122
Prison was not his natural habitat

687
00:47:57,547 --> 00:47:59,352
He was very upset.

688
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:06,484
With Daddy in prison
His pregnant wife was all alone.

689
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:11,010
And could not cope.

690
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,896
But all clouds have a silver lining.

691
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:15,708
And out of her death..

692
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,118
Mindy was born

693
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,690
Marcus became the child's guardian

694
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,260
And Daddy started a plan of his very own.

695
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:31,354
Five years later he left prison

696
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:33,593
And he was ready

697
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,989
Now it's time for Mindy to get ready too.

698
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,214
How'd you find me Marcus?

699
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,335
One of us is still a cop, remember?

700
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:02,605
Now you brain-washed Mindy?

701
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,371
You say brain-washed
I say made it into a game.

702
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:10,484
What you call this? Playing, Damon?
Vigilante justice. Mass murder. C'mon, partner.

703
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:13,838
So where is she?

704
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,264
She's safe -
Can I see her? -

705
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:19,173
I miss her,

706
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:22,108
I miss you both.

707
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:24,901
I appreciate your concern.

708
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:26,894
But you need to go now.

709
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:36,202
I should warn you that asshole,
Gigante, is looking for Kick-Ass.

710
00:49:36,203 --> 00:49:37,699
He got something to do with you Damon?

711
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:41,385
You started some kinda fucked-up
superhero club?

712
00:49:41,386 --> 00:49:42,527
Never heard of him

713
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:44,828
Ok, well heads up, alright?

714
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:49,134
You keep carrying on like you've been carrying on and it's
only a matter of time before Gigante's looking for you.

715
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:53,289
He's been on Frank D'Amico’s payroll ever since you
passed up the opportunity,

716
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:55,939
You know I'm not gonna stop.

717
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:03,304
Not 'til D'Amico and his whole damn
operation are burnt to ashes.

718
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:05,100
And buried.

719
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:07,972
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

720
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,714
This is not the life for Mindy,

721
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,056
You owe that kid a childhood.

722
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:19,449
I'll tell you who owes her a
childhood:

723
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:22,454
Frank D'Amico

724
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,993
Holy shit

725
00:50:44,565 --> 00:50:46,661
I don't fuckin' believe it.

726
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,223
Follow him. Around the corner.

727
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:53,369
Not too fast

728
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:58,195
He's doing the high fives.

729
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:00,962
I'll give 'em a motherfuckin' high five.

730
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:01,963
High five and bullshit

731
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:04,416
Keep going, keep going.

732
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:07,348
Not too close

733
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,473
He's going into the alley

734
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:15,913
He's going to the alley

735
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:18,922
Okay, when I tell you stop the car.

736
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,376
Ready?

737
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:25,758
Hey Kick-Ass

738
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,331
How ya doin'?

739
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:30,896
Kill my men, huh?!

740
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:32,785
Take my fucking coke?!

741
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:35,341
What are you doing?

742
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,795
Let us go, come on

743
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,845
Come on, Frank, he had enough,
Come on.

744
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,128
What the fuck are you looking at? Huh?

745
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,463
Come on, let's go
Come on

746
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:10,378
He was so young

747
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:15,150
Who would get to die that way?
I just can't believe he's dead that's all

748
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,383
Oh, I know.

749
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:20,076
Listen Katie,

750
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,638
guys like Rasul... They get mixed up in
stuff, and...

751
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,444
I know, but what if it was my
fault?

752
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:30,891
What if Kick-Ass did it?
I mean I feel like should call cops or something

753
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:32,802
you're talking crazy!

754
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:35,569
there's no way! He probably
didn't even read your e-mail yet.

755
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,831
Yeah? -
There's nothing to worry about -

756
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,441
I'm so glad you're here

757
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,247
I look like such a mess

758
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:44,865
You look Okay.

759
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:46,249
I'm here

760
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:48,164
Yeah I'm Okay.

761
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:51,775
I hope it's Okay to say this, but

762
00:52:52,385 --> 00:52:54,379
It so sucks
that you're gay.

763
00:52:56,876 --> 00:53:00,032
I don't fuckin' believe this

764
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:05,552
What kind of children's enterfuckingtainer is that? Huh?

765
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:12,497
What kind of kid has a Spider-Man party? Sure.
But a fuckin' Kick-Ass Party?

766
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,113
What are they're selling paper plates and napkins down at the store, now?

767
00:53:15,114 --> 00:53:16,545
Frank, You're scarin' me

768
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:21,455
You're losin' it.
Since when did you start getting your hands dirty again, huh? And in public.

769
00:53:21,496 --> 00:53:24,587
Since when I asked you Fucks to deliver me Kick-Ass and you don't deliver that's when.

770
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,262
Hey give me a break it's been a week.

771
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:29,724
We e-mailed him. We got half the crew doing petty crimes as bait

772
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:31,222
We're bustin' our asses here.

773
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:33,521
What hell are you doing?

774
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:36,205
You back on the Powder now, as well?

775
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:40,380
(In child-like voice) Mommy, I want
Kick-Ass party. Dumb little fuck.

776
00:53:41,027 --> 00:53:42,734
I know a way you could get him.

777
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:44,425
Aww shit. Chris

778
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:45,504
How long you been there?

779
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,700
What the hell you doin'?
Get the hell out!

780
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:48,130
You wanna hear it or not?

781
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:49,950
Hear what?

782
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:56,006
Okay, look: you're a superhero and you're lonely but you can't
trust anyone because either they'll expose your secret identity...

783
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:58,505
Comic books, this kids reads, all
fucking day long.

784
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:01,659
The point is, there's only one way a
superhero would trust a stranger and...

785
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:04,719
I could be that stranger.
You just gotta give me a chance.

786
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,251
I know I can do
it. I just need a few things.

787
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:10,232
Like what?

788
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:13,809
I need these things.

789
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:18,760
What, you fucking kidding me?

790
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:19,904
What the hell is this?

791
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,049
It's everything I need.

792
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,682
And you might have to screw somebody over
Like, Louie, or somebody.

793
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:25,135
Louie?! Oh whoa, hey, Chris

794
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,696
Or somebody, it doesn't have to be Louie.

795
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:28,816
- Tony
- Tony

796
00:54:29,352 --> 00:54:30,163
Tony?

797
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:32,287
I hate Tony -
Hey, fuck Tony he's a scum bag -

798
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:35,419
I swear, dad. If
you let me do this, it's gonna work.

799
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:41,375
Tony

800
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:46,418
Tony Romita, one of America's most wanted crime king-pins
was arrested in Queens today.

801
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:49,869
after a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero

802
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,699
So how are things going with Katie?

803
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:58,461
Oh, just peachy. Had a sleep over and spent the whole night
watching the entire Ugly Betty box set

804
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,925
and did pedicures.

805
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:03,217
I'm telling you, though the longer you
wait, the worse it's gonna get.

806
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:04,378
I know.

807
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:07,270
I was gonna tell her.
She just seems so happy.

808
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:09,504
I don't know whens the right time.
Well, now's your chance.

809
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:11,824
Hey guys

810
00:55:13,734 --> 00:55:15,540
Hi

811
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,930
Oh, did you watch the TV?
The new superhero guy? How cool was that?

812
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:20,158
What?

813
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:22,443
Hey look. Can you turn it up please?

814
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,618
Check this out.

815
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:28,377
But it seems that far from being put-off,
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,

816
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:32,281
has decided to take crime fighting to a new level,
as his actions last night proved.

817
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:33,747
Red Mist, how do you see it?

818
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:39,816
Well, I guess folks have just had enough of living in
fear, you know, and uh... Kick-Ass really proved that one individual can make a difference.

819
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:43,065
So, If anyone out there needs help, I'll be fighting
crime 25/8.

820
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:45,674
And I'm just one click away.
RedMist. org.

821
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,571
Can you turn that off now?

822
00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:51,134
What's so special about that guy?

823
00:55:51,673 --> 00:55:54,040
He caught, like, a drug dealer
Some most-wanted guy

824
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:56,948
He saw 'em bringing out, like, a ton of stuff,
- That's Pretty cool.

825
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,245
Yeah. way better costume than Kickass, too.

826
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:01,699
He's gotta cape-
Yeah -

827
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,777
Capes rock-
Yeah -

828
00:56:02,778 --> 00:56:04,935
I'm kinda feelin' the cape. Looks good.

829
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,970
What, better than Kick-Ass?

830
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,610
I mean they're both kinda hot I just think that
Red Mist has a better body.

831
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:12,964
Don't you think, Dave?

832
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:19,822
Yeah Dave what do you think? Is that the kind
of guy you'd go for? With all that leather?

833
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,322
No, not me.

834
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,081
No, he's not really my type

835
00:57:16,305 --> 00:57:17,109
Kick Ass

836
00:57:18,744 --> 00:57:19,484
Red Mist

837
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:21,599
Oh shit

838
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,930
Fuck me, that kinda hurt.

839
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,250
You OK?

840
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:26,452
Yeah, no I'm cool

841
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:30,068
I can't believe you're here, man.
like you’re my hero.

842
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:33,359
You... inspired me. No Kick-Ass, no
Red Mist.

843
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:34,506
Seriously.

844
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:36,022
Wow.

845
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:36,654
Really?

846
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:41,917
Straight up. And listen if you.. I dunno know...
if you wanted me to be your sidekick or something like that...

847
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:43,981
You wanna be... my sidekick?

848
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,080
Yeah, man

849
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:49,424

850
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:51,521
Oh... I mean like right now?

851
00:57:52,258 --> 00:57:53,838
Yeah man, come on, I got something I wanna show you

852
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:57,402
Uh.. I mean like... to be honest with you,

853
00:57:57,403 --> 00:57:59,570
I never fight crime between, like
nine and two on weekdays,

854
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:01,756
so I really
need to get back pretty soon.

855
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,705
Sweet!

856
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:10,950
This yours?

857
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:12,858
Meet the Mistmobile.

858
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:26,049
Set-nav. Got my iPhone so I can check the website
for emergencies while I'm driving around.

859
00:58:26,698 --> 00:58:27,653
Movin' up.

860
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:29,046
Mood lighting right there

00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,606
Rear view camera, no big deal.

00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,374

863

The Mist.

864
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:40,315

Hey!-
Yep. That's right. You wish you could be us. They love us.

866
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:52,040
Smoke?

867
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,041
Nuh-uh.

868
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:55,822
Ya know.
A little "Weed" takes the edge off things when I'm patrol.. ya know.

869
00:58:56,123 --> 00:58:58,459
Runnin' up against a crowd can
get kinda scary, don’t you thimk?

870
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:02,358
Something wrong?

871
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,498
You're so not how I expected

872
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:17,818
Oh, I got e-mail from this chick, she said
this guy's been following her home from work.

873
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,690
I've got her address
and stuff. You wanna check it out?

874
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:22,337
Sure, why not?

875
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:23,697
Cool

876
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:32,422
So this chick was totally naked, right?

877
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:35,337
So I tell her to sit in my lap and talk about the first thing that comes up.

878
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:36,366
(Chuckling)

879
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,534
Yep.
Let's get the tag? he's on his way.

880
00:59:48,554 --> 00:59:49,542
Very good.

881
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:51,427
Don't kill him 'til I get there.

882
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:52,553
Right

883
00:59:58,352 --> 01:00:00,393
Looks like reading all them comics
paid off, huh?

884
01:00:01,016 --> 01:00:02,797
Your boy did good, Frankie.

885
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:06,898
This is father's son.

886
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:16,703
(C'mon now... who do you.. who do you.. who do you.. who do you think you are?... ha, ha, ha.. bless your soul)

887
01:00:18,275 --> 01:00:19,120
I forget

888
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:44,888
(I think your crazy... I think your crazy... I think your crazy... just like you)

889
01:00:49,788 --> 01:00:51,158
What... the... fuck?

890
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,280
shit

891
01:00:57,974 --> 01:00:59,082
Hey! What are you doing?

892
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,442
There are people in there!

893
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:03,154
Shall we call the Fire...

894
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,084
Shit!

895
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:14,674
Mike!

896
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:24,617
Mikey

897
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:29,384
Shit!
Red Mist!

898
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,220
Hey, can you hear me?!

899
01:01:56,426 --> 01:01:57,167
Red Mist!

900
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:01,552
We've got to get the fuck outta here!

901
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,377
We gotta get the hell out of here!

902
01:02:36,928 --> 01:02:41,579
Just move your fucking ass!

903
01:02:57,368 --> 01:02:58,634
Shit!

904
01:02:58,736 --> 01:02:59,607
Did you see those bodies?

905
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:00,171
Yeah, man.

906
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:05,680
Why'd you save the teddy?

907
01:03:05,878 --> 01:03:06,575
What?

908
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:08,540
I don't know, man. Come on.

909
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,621
come

910
01:03:23,898 --> 01:03:27,322
What the hell are you doin' Frank?
You know I can't be here. What if somebody saw...

911
01:03:27,323 --> 01:03:31,152
That little motherfucker, Kick-Ass, burned down my warehouse and killed my men, Gigante.

912
01:03:31,153 --> 01:03:33,223
Whoa... wait,wait, slow down. Kick-Ass?

913
01:03:33,224 --> 01:03:35,296
You sure? -
You gotta help me, Vic -

914
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:37,394
My son was there and he's still missing

915
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:42,424
They're all dead! Everbody in the warehouse is dead!

916
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:45,778
Put the gun down, Vic, it's
Chris!

917
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:47,771
Chris is Red Mist?!

918
01:03:47,772 --> 01:03:50,489
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry
about, it's Kickass!

919
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,816
No it's not. Kick-Ass is just some geek!

920
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:54,318
You don't have to worry about him

921
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:55,712
You need to watch this!

922
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,291
Why? What does it do?

923
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:00,236
You're fucking kidding me

924
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,660
What? -
Goddamit, just sit down -

925
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:09,579
What are you doing?
What the hell is that thing?

926
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:12,935
You bought this to spy on the nanny
when I was a kid, don't you remember?

927
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:14,972
Why? You put it in the warehouse?

928
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:18,229
Yeah. I thought it'd be cool to put the
unmasking of Kick-Ass on the Internet, okay?

929
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:20,128
Watch.

930
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:33,860
"Let's get the tag? he's on his way"

931
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:51,312
Who the hell is this guy?

932
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:53,358
I don't know, Dad

933
01:05:54,353 --> 01:05:58,807
But, Kick-Ass told me we're not the only super heroes in town.
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

934
01:06:00,983 --> 01:06:02,577
I want this place locked down.

935
01:06:03,316 --> 01:06:05,713
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out

936
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:13,227
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker
and blows his fuckin' lungs out through his chest.

937
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:20,238
Listen. They're on to you.
Do you hear me? They're on to you

938
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,281
I thought they were looking for
Kick-Ass?

939
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:27,428
Not anymore. Gigante just put on a little movie
show for us. Different Superhero.

940
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:31,492
In a warehouse killing a whole
bunch of D'Amico's guys.

941
01:06:31,493 --> 01:06:32,747
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you?

942
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:36,183
- I killed all the cameras.
- Apparently not.

943
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:39,400
Look bro, you need to get ghost. Hide yourself
quick.

944
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:41,307
Appreciate it.

945
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:46,458
Mindy

946
01:06:47,557 --> 01:06:48,964
No more homework, baby doll

947
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,633
It's time
for Frank D'Amico to go bye-bye.

948
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:02,914
X- Men, Fantastic 4

949
01:07:03,226 --> 01:07:05,334
Right now I can't beat the crap out of them.

950
01:07:06,058 --> 01:07:07,635
Everything was out of control

951
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:09,982
I didn't know what the hell to do

952
01:07:10,262 --> 01:07:11,551
You OK, buddy?

953
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:12,988
You look tired

954
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:14,673
Gonna have an early night tonight, maybe?

955
01:07:14,674 --> 01:07:16,607
And there was no one I could talk to about it

956
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,000
Hello

957
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,201
Yeah... I will.

958
01:07:22,817 --> 01:07:24,230
I never felt more alone

959
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,260
I've always dreamed of being a super hero

960
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:33,248
But this... was a nightmare

961
01:07:37,736 --> 01:07:40,378
It was time to stop wearing this stupid costume

962
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,449
But there was one last thing I needed it for

963
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,101
What's the difference between Spider-Man and Peter Parker?

964
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,602
Spider-Man gets the girl

965
01:08:02,868 --> 01:08:04,413
(Faintly from noise of blowdryer)
Hey-I'm Kick-Ass!

966
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:10,503
I'm Kick Ass

967
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,002
You e-mailed me.
(Screams)

968
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:13,003
Please...
(Screams in pain)

969
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:15,701
Oh... Fuck!

970
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,928
Oh Fuck!

971
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:18,719
Fuckin' freak in a mask-fuck!

972
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,996
Get out of my house

973
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:21,235
I'm not gonna
hurt you, alright!

974
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:23,766
No, no, it's me

975
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,689
I was only trying to surprise you
- Dave?!

976
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,388
Sorry -
What the fuck are you doing?!

977
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:29,992
Why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?

978
01:08:29,993 --> 01:08:31,680
Because I am Kick-Ass.

979
01:08:31,681 --> 01:08:33,118
What are you talking about?

980
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:35,408
And I'm also not gay.

981
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:37,232
Fuck!

982
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:40,126
And I know I've been an idiot,
and a shit friend, I lied to you, I know

983
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,621
Oh my God! -

984
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:44,690
I know and if it makes you feel any better, I
don't think you could hate me any more right now

985
01:08:45,316 --> 01:08:46,399
I hate myself.

986
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,431
Please I'm...

987
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,558
Look, I'm really really sorry

988
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:58,425
I've never met anybody who was as
beautiful and as kind,

989
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:00,520
and... lovely as you.

990
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:04,883
You deserve better.

991
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:24,343
Dave

992
01:09:24,656 --> 01:09:25,523
Yes

993
01:09:26,908 --> 01:09:30,464
My mom has the burglar alarm set downstairs.
You should probably use the window.

994
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:37,468
Or

995
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,746
You could just stay.

996
01:09:45,134 --> 01:09:46,145
stay?

997
01:09:47,528 --> 01:09:49,094
Like when we have a sleepover?

998
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:57,779
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

999
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:34,970
We gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her.

1000
01:10:34,971 --> 01:10:36,434
Daddy, I think I found one.

1001
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:39,471
It's perfect. And they can deliver it in
three days...

1002
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:43,718
And it's three
hundred thousand dollars.

1003
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:48,092
Can you think of anything else
you'd rather spend it on? Oh my Gosh

1004
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,544
that is cool!

1005
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:51,836
Yeah.

1006
01:10:52,717 --> 01:10:53,666
Add to shopping cart

1007
01:10:54,804 --> 01:10:55,392
OK

1008
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:01,128
Out of Kickass and Red Mist, who do
you think would win in a fight?

1009
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:03,602
Why are they fighting?
That seems stupid

1010
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:05,571
What do you think?

1011
01:11:05,572 --> 01:11:07,635
I don't know. But I think Kick-Ass is
cuter.

1012
01:11:08,136 --> 01:11:09,120
Really?

1013
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:13,577
I, for one, would definitely fuck his
brains out if I got the chance.

1014
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:16,908
You would?

1015
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:18,267
Definitely.

1016
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,905
Do you... uh, feel like checking out
that new Kate Hudson movie where...

1017
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,603
she's like a shoe designer kind of guy?

1018
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:25,501
I think we can make the next
showing if we leave...

1019
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:25,843
Hell yeah.

1020
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,376
I guess we're not invited

1021
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,257
Alright.. you know what, come here

1022
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,766
I'm going to request a great meal for you right now

1023
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:40,184
Suddenly, I understood why super heroes only exist in the comics

1024
01:11:41,021 --> 01:11:43,549
I doubt why people didn't risk their life for strangers

1025
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,397
because, for the first time in my life

1026
01:11:46,398 --> 01:11:47,975
I had something to worth living for

1027
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:50,225
Something to lose

1028
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:54,027
Katie was worried about me getting
hurt,

1029
01:11:54,564 --> 01:11:56,736
so I promised her my Kick-Ass
days were over.

1030
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:58,445
And the truth was,

1031
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,069
I hardly missed it at all.

1032
01:12:00,422 --> 01:12:03,341
I hadn't even checked
the web site for, like, a week.

1033
01:12:06,688 --> 01:12:08,016
Ok... I'm off then.

1034
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:10,224
No Katie tonight?

1035
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:13,975
Tomorrow. Wednesdays she does one
of her volunteer things.

1036
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:16,973
You seem like a different guy, you
know that?

1037
01:12:18,124 --> 01:12:20,454
Your mom would've been so happy to
see you out of your shell like this.

1038
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,841
Have a good night

1039
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:35,730
Hey, baby -
Hi, what's going on? -

1040
01:12:36,926 --> 01:12:38,514
I gotta do that Kick-Ass thing

1041
01:12:38,515 --> 01:12:39,382
What?

1042
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:40,800
I thought you were done with that?

1043
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:43,147
This is the last time. I totally
swear...

1044
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:45,705
I worry about you

1045
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:48,574
I wish you wouldn’t worry.

1046
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:51,143
I can't help it. I do. Because I...

1047
01:12:52,795 --> 01:12:54,410
I... care about you a lot.

1048
01:12:58,196 --> 01:12:59,529
I... care about you a lot, too.

1049
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:33,146
This better be serious, Dude, because
I promised my girlfriend that I'm done with all this shit.

1050
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:35,762
How about both of us being dead?
Is that serious enough for you?

1051
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:37,066
Dead?

1052
01:13:38,086 --> 01:13:38,813
How?

1053
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:43,884
Well it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse had some bad motherfuckers for friends
and they think we did that shit.

1054
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,675
There's a price on our heads, man.

1055
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:47,667
A price on our heads? What is this,
the wild west?

1056
01:13:47,748 --> 01:13:52,984
They found out where I lived! They trashed my placed!
I'm fucking screwed! And you're gonna be next, Okay?!

1057
01:13:56,374 --> 01:13:57,623
Shit

1058
01:13:58,419 --> 01:13:59,286
What do we do?

1059
01:14:02,894 --> 01:14:05,511
Remember you mentioned that there were other super heroes

1060
01:14:05,928 --> 01:14:06,848
Yeah.

1061
01:14:07,473 --> 01:14:08,598
Well, do you think they can help us?

1062
01:14:18,202 --> 01:14:20,163
Hot chocolate, extra Marsh-mellows.

1063
01:14:22,728 --> 01:14:25,553
Oah. That looks even cooler than in the picture

1064
01:14:27,059 --> 01:14:27,918
Child

1065
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:31,262
You know because in the picture
it didn't have Gatling guns

1066
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:31,932
Nice job.

1067
01:14:33,379 --> 01:14:34,352
I'm gonna take my new bed, Okay?

1068
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:35,373
Okay, baby doll.

1069
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:37,587
Sleep tight -
Thanks

1070
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:39,210
Oh, Kick-Ass?

1071
01:14:39,211 --> 01:14:40,212
Mmh

1072
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:43,084
You go get dressed I'I tell him to meet us at safehouse B

1073
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:44,807
We'll have our hot-chocolate when we get back.

1074
01:14:45,103 --> 01:14:45,523
Okay daddy.

1075
01:14:45,643 --> 01:14:46,277
C'mon.

1076
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:57,576
Here we go.

1077
01:14:58,054 --> 01:14:58,816
Do you know where that is?

1078
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:00,186
No. But I'll just put it in the GPS.

1079
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,235
Alright, let's go

1080
01:15:04,145 --> 01:15:05,165
Shit

1081
01:16:45,858 --> 01:16:46,759
Well

1082
01:16:46,794 --> 01:16:49,883
Here you are, and Red Mist, too.

1083
01:16:55,588 --> 01:16:57,094
Pleasure to meet you.

1084
01:16:57,296 --> 01:16:58,464
Good to meet you sir.

1085
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,905
Please, come in

1086
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,268
After you

1087
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,995
Hit Girl, manners.. honey.

1088
01:17:09,378 --> 01:17:10,359
Hi, I'm Hit Girl

1089
01:17:12,464 --> 01:17:14,035
No!

1090
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:23,133
Hey he's with me, he's O.K.!

1091
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,333
Shut the fuck up, kid!

1092
01:17:24,334 --> 01:17:26,166
Your daddy's the boss! You don't order shit!

1093
01:17:26,202 --> 01:17:26,964
Are you shitting me? Shit! No!...

1094
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:28,768
He's with me!...

1095
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:30,341
Let him go!...

1096
01:17:30,574 --> 01:17:32,202
Get outta here, get the fuck outta here

1097
01:17:32,265 --> 01:17:33,896
Hotdamn, I always wanted one of these...

1098
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:34,977
Seriously you're gonna take that?

1099
01:17:34,978 --> 01:17:35,978
Yes.

1100
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:43,024
You know what being a super hero actually costs?

1101
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,026
You happen to be in a lot of trouble here.

1102
01:17:46,182 --> 01:17:47,317
Kick-Ass!-
Get em outta here!-

1103
01:17:50,576 --> 01:17:51,817
Kick Ass I'm sorry

1104
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:54,965
Get in there

1105
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,478
You better fire this asshole!

1106
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:10,234
Ignore him.

1107
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:12,876
A Bazooka?

1108
01:18:15,497 --> 01:18:16,341
OK

1109
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:20,206
We had a deal, dad. We had a fucking deal
that would get you the guy who did it.

1110
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:23,484
All I'm asking is you let Kick-Ass go! He didn't do
anything wrong!

1111
01:18:23,772 --> 01:18:25,992
Chris, you gotta look at this from my point of view.

1112
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:26,993
Okay?

1113
01:18:27,462 --> 01:18:30,180
I gotta send a public service
message to the people out there

1114
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:32,937
that being a superhero is
bad for your health.

1115
01:18:32,938 --> 01:18:35,567
And the big motherfucker? Nobody knows who he is.

1116
01:18:35,568 --> 01:18:36,623
Yeah, but that's not fair!

1117
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:38,286
Life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

1118
01:18:38,784 --> 01:18:39,970
What are you gonna do with them?

1119
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,421
You really want to be a part of my business?

1120
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,067
Yeah.

1121
01:18:47,068 --> 01:18:49,115
Then sit down, shut up

1122
01:18:49,548 --> 01:18:50,448
and watch.

1123
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:00,114
Frank, we're ready

1124
01:19:01,294 --> 01:19:02,071
Enjoy the show

1125
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:03,253
You patched-up with this thing?

1126
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:04,938
I sure am big brother.

1127
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:06,377
Watch and learn

1128
01:19:06,629 --> 01:19:12,321
Welcome back to breaking news a world wide web broadcast of the
New York superhero who calls himself Kick-Ass.

1129
01:19:12,322 --> 01:19:19,609
is about to be shown live. Rumors have it that this will be Kick-Ass'
farewell appearance that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting

1130
01:19:19,905 --> 01:19:26,749
but as word-of-mouth continues to spread, internet providers are predicting
that it could be one of the most widely viewed live events in web history.

1131
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,288
Hey, where's Dave?

1132
01:19:30,657 --> 01:19:32,771
Hey have you guys noticed -
He's with Katie...

1133
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:34,397
obviously.

1134
01:19:34,905 --> 01:19:36,554
Why else would I be here?

1135
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:40,035
With no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show

1136
01:19:40,356 --> 01:19:42,868
But we could see wide spread server crashes

1137
01:19:43,814 --> 01:19:46,765
Dave, why didn't you tell this is what you were doing.
You're on the news.

1138
01:19:46,885 --> 01:19:47,589
Call me

1139
01:19:47,943 --> 01:19:50,871
We go now over live to the countdown clock as we are moments away.

1140
01:20:02,741 --> 01:20:03,409
Showtime

1141
01:20:06,278 --> 01:20:12,275
Hello boys and girls, now this... uh...
well you know who this guy is.

1142
01:20:13,028 --> 01:20:15,258
And... uh... this guy here is Big Daddy

1143
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:18,050
And these are my friends.

1144
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:19,341
Come on in guys say hello

1145
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:20,900
Yeah.

1146
01:20:21,075 --> 01:20:23,003
Yeah there they are
Hello, Hello

1147
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:25,803
Now Big Daddy and Kick-Ass

1148
01:20:25,804 --> 01:20:31,099
are gonna help us show you why
being a hero is a bad idea.

1149
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,151
You know what a silent "K" is?

1150
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:36,268
That's when "K" is at the beginning of the but you don't pronounce it

1151
01:20:36,735 --> 01:20:38,429
like in the word knuckle duster

1152
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,206
Show them what knuckle duster can do, Guy.

1153
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:42,308
Oh that must've hurt.

1154
01:20:42,431 --> 01:20:43,871
Let's see that again on the other side, go.

1155
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,060
Oh Yeah, look at this

1156
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:49,352
Now in France they say the word stick like this...

1157
01:20:49,353 --> 01:20:50,741
Ba-ton

1158
01:20:50,742 --> 01:20:53,561
We have some of Kick-Ass' batons.
We're gonna show you what they can do.

1159
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:54,674
Go ahead boys.

1160
01:20:58,492 --> 01:21:00,052
In America we say stick like this...

1161
01:21:00,431 --> 01:21:01,833
Baseball Bat

1162
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:04,172
For hittin' knees..

1163
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:05,920
hands...

1164
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,175
It's also good for hittin' balls.

1165
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:14,188
We don't do 'em individually, we do 'em all together.

1166
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:15,873
Gentlemen please. Yeah.

1167
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:18,195
Oh this looks very painful...

1168
01:21:22,209 --> 01:21:27,833
Due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to
broadcast the events currently streaming live on the Internet

1169
01:21:29,066 --> 01:21:30,023
No No

1170
01:21:32,574 --> 01:21:39,207
Misguided miscalculations suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity
stunt. It is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger

1171
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:43,847
That all signs point to the intentions to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes

1172
01:21:56,859 --> 01:22:00,083
Even with my metal plates and my
fucked up nerve endings,

1173
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:01,967
I've gotta tell ya,

1174
01:22:02,108 --> 01:22:03,594
that hurt.

1175
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:08,935
the silent killer

1176
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:12,050
But not half as much as the idea of
leaving everything behind.

1177
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,779
Katie

1178
01:22:14,443 --> 01:22:15,542
My dad.

1179
01:22:16,221 --> 01:22:17,023
Todd and Marty

1180
01:22:17,618 --> 01:22:19,330
And all the
things I'd never do.

1181
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:22,141
Like learn to drive.

1182
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:24,555
Or see what me and Katie's
kids would look like.

1183
01:22:24,946 --> 01:22:26,863
Or find out
what happened on Lost.

1184
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:32,158
And if you're reassuring yourself
that I'm gonna make it through this since I'm talking to you now,

1185
01:22:33,772 --> 01:22:35,449
quit being such a smart ass.

1186
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:38,456
Hell dude. You've never seen Sin City?

1187
01:22:38,457 --> 01:22:41,303
Sunset Boulevard? American Beauty?

1188
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:48,050
And this,... for all you brave men out there...
is fire.

1189
01:22:57,042 --> 01:22:58,497
Fire, Fire's good

1190
01:23:00,096 --> 01:23:02,036
Fire is our friend

1191
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,176
Gentlemen

1192
01:23:13,491 --> 01:23:14,759
Time to die.

1193
01:23:20,849 --> 01:23:21,731
What the...

1194
01:24:18,376 --> 01:24:19,398
Find me a lighter

1195
01:24:28,848 --> 01:24:29,734
I've got it

1196
01:24:43,599 --> 01:24:44,146
No!

1197
01:24:44,181 --> 01:24:46,017
Take cover, child!

1198
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:55,228
Now switch to Kryptonite!

1199
01:25:24,974 --> 01:25:27,077
Eject, 2 rounds and relay!

1200
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,425
Show's over mother-fuckers.

1201
01:26:20,552 --> 01:26:21,357
Yeah!

1202
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:22,800
I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1203
01:26:23,997 --> 01:26:25,654
She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1204
01:26:26,145 --> 01:26:28,696
I can wait. I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1205
01:26:30,305 --> 01:26:31,837
I can see that this can be really difficult for you.

1206
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:33,090
Are you OK?

1207
01:26:33,759 --> 01:26:34,379
Yeah.

1208
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,380
Whoa

1209
01:26:53,234 --> 01:26:54,308
Good job.

1210
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:04,888
I'm so proud of you, baby doll

1211
01:27:07,524 --> 01:27:08,560
Are you OK?

1212
01:27:12,044 --> 01:27:12,892
Yes

1213
01:27:14,681 --> 01:27:17,645
Getting shot, daddy, hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1214
01:27:19,395 --> 01:27:22,820
That's because I used low-velocity rounds, child.

1215
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:29,327
You're the kindest daddy in the whole world

1216
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,071
I just...

1217
01:27:33,894 --> 01:27:35,472
I love you

1218
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,886
I love you too, daddy

1219
01:27:50,372 --> 01:27:51,180
I love you, dad

1220
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:53,923
good night

1221
01:28:12,977 --> 01:28:13,808
What's your name?

1222
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,209
I mean, your real name

1223
01:28:16,728 --> 01:28:19,592
A super hero never reveals her true
identity.

1224
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:22,894
What!? Look, you can't go on...

1225
01:28:23,785 --> 01:28:25,564
However you
lived before...

1226
01:28:29,468 --> 01:28:30,340
It's over.

1227
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,085
Is there anybody else?

1228
01:28:34,373 --> 01:28:35,622
Any other family, or?

1229
01:28:35,623 --> 01:28:36,932
I can take care of myself.

1230
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:40,107
I saved your sorry ass!

1231
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:42,168
what about money?

1232
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:44,972
Alright, cause you've got to think long-term

1233
01:28:44,973 --> 01:28:47,338
I've got three million dollars in a
suitcase!

1234
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,304
That long-term
enough for ya?

1235
01:28:53,546 --> 01:28:54,967
It's not all about the money,

1236
01:28:56,729 --> 01:28:57,825
I owe you

1237
01:28:59,558 --> 01:29:01,048
If not for you, I'd be dead.

1238
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:04,316
if it wasn't for you

1239
01:29:06,185 --> 01:29:07,442
my dad wouldn’t be.

1240
01:29:24,201 --> 01:29:25,420
Look

1241
01:29:26,003 --> 01:29:29,346
pack up whatever you
need and we'll go back to my place.

1242
01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:32,802
I just need to clean up, I think?

1243
01:30:27,851 --> 01:30:30,463
Woah. I meant, like pajamas

1244
01:30:30,589 --> 01:30:32,008
and clothes and stuff. You can't take that stuff to my house.

1245
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:33,750
You know what my dad would have really
wanted?

1246
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:41,519
He would have wanted me to
finish what we started.

1247
01:30:43,382 --> 01:30:44,775
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1248
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,450
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1249
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:05,491
All that security

1250
01:31:06,528 --> 01:31:07,730
Are you crazy?

1251
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,981
My mom already died for nothing.

1252
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:13,635
So, I'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for
nothing too.

1253
01:31:16,361 --> 01:31:17,715
You can't do this on your own.

1254
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:20,953
Exactly

1255
01:31:23,868 --> 01:31:25,278
You wanna deal with owing
my dad?

1256
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,742
Then shut the hell up and
pick your weapon.

1257
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:39,931
Is that what I think it is?

1258
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:42,442
Damn straight.

1259
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:47,949
Oh you better start reading the instructions,
'cause you're gonna be using it in about five minutes.

1260
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,676
Yo listen up, you've got 5 minutes and
I want you back on your post

1261
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:00,504
and don't leave a mess

1262
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,373
Everything okay?

1263
01:32:15,374 --> 01:32:16,357
Things alright, boss

1264
01:32:19,092 --> 01:32:20,221
Can't believe I got my gun back

1265
01:32:20,222 --> 01:32:21,255
Look at that

1266
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:22,508
You know it's not that..
(Knocking)

1267
01:32:27,067 --> 01:32:27,873
Let her in

1268
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:32,232
That's a little kid

1269
01:32:32,436 --> 01:32:33,455
What's the matter with you?

1270
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:39,280
You okay, sweetheart?

1271
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:43,960
No, I lost my mommy and daddy.

1272
01:32:44,217 --> 01:32:45,741
she lost her mommy and daddy

1273
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,445
You wanna use my cell phone?

1274
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:51,442
Now can you remember the number?

1275
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:36,498
Had I ever been a real superhero?

1276
01:33:37,758 --> 01:33:43,501
The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions
and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking.

1277
01:33:45,301 --> 01:33:48,674
With no power comes no
responsibility.

1278
01:33:49,804 --> 01:33:50,861
Except

1279
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:52,876
that wasn't true.

1280
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:41,159
shit

1281
01:36:18,822 --> 01:36:20,805
Hey I'm in here come help me out!

1282
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:27,673
Wait, fuck this! And, everybody's dead!

1283
01:36:30,182 --> 01:36:32,297
She's behind the counter, she's out of ammo.

1284
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,324
Do you think they got her?

1285
01:36:49,293 --> 01:36:50,457
If they didn't he will.

1286
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,220
Get out there

1287
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:54,648
Now?

1288
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:55,794
Yeah, now

1289
01:37:06,497 --> 01:37:07,483
What the fuck is going on?

1290
01:37:07,518 --> 01:37:09,298
We got her trapped she's still alive

1291
01:37:09,299 --> 01:37:11,010
So what the hell you guys waiting for?

1292
01:37:12,186 --> 01:37:12,812
Go get her-
Go ahead-.

1293
01:37:14,005 --> 01:37:17,050
I ain't got no fucking gun. I'm not going in there.

1294
01:37:18,938 --> 01:37:20,560
Do it now

1295
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,969
Come on

1296
01:37:41,487 --> 01:37:42,409
Fuck this shit.

1297
01:37:42,576 --> 01:37:43,939
I'm getting the Bazooka

1298
01:37:47,095 --> 01:37:47,886
Bazooka?

1299
01:37:48,304 --> 01:37:49,399
Bazooka

1300
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,789
Whoa hold it. It's only me boss. Everything is under control.

1301
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,557
Under control?
You're grabbing a fucking Bazooka you dumb ass.

1302
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:14,219
Sir? -
Do it -

1303
01:38:35,525 --> 01:38:37,579
I always wanted to say this...

1304
01:38:39,357 --> 01:38:41,588
say Hello to my little friend

1305
01:39:12,293 --> 01:39:13,812
(Glory, Glory Halleluah song in background)

1306
01:39:38,409 --> 01:39:39,592
Holy shit

1307
01:39:47,661 --> 01:39:49,413
That is one weird sounding Bazooka

1308
01:39:50,248 --> 01:39:51,177
Stu!

1309
01:39:56,586 --> 01:39:57,404
Fuck!

1310
01:40:07,438 --> 01:40:08,972
Get out

1311
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:18,393
Play time's over, kid.

1312
01:40:20,058 --> 01:40:22,960
I never play

1313
01:40:22,961 --> 01:40:23,717
Oh really?

1314
01:41:39,025 --> 01:41:40,861
Ruin my business, Huh?

1315
01:41:41,986 --> 01:41:44,653
I'll kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way

1316
01:42:13,803 --> 01:42:16,299
I wish my son was just like you.

1317
01:42:22,475 --> 01:42:24,209
It is time for family reunion

1318
01:42:25,671 --> 01:42:26,514
Hey

1319
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:28,878
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size.

1320
01:42:48,476 --> 01:42:49,264
You Ok?

1321
01:42:49,953 --> 01:42:50,761
Yeah

1322
01:42:52,102 --> 01:42:53,082
Time to go home

1323
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:27,439
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

1324
01:44:27,764 --> 01:44:28,990
My daddy...

1325
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:34,009
He would have
been proud of both of us.

1326
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:45,073
Dave

1327
01:44:46,151 --> 01:44:47,031
Dave Lizewski.

1328
01:44:48,005 --> 01:44:49,145
I know that, dumbass

1329
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:01,027
Mindy

1330
01:45:02,735 --> 01:45:03,676
Mindy MacReady

1331
01:45:21,145 --> 01:45:22,065
Bye

1332
01:45:24,268 --> 01:45:27,360
Mindy moved in with Marcus
and he enrolled her at my school

1333
01:45:27,361 --> 01:45:28,615
Bye -
Good luck -

1334
01:45:30,129 --> 01:45:31,287
first school she'd ever been to

1335
01:45:31,455 --> 01:45:33,105
on the promise that I'd look out for her.

1336
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:35,907
Hey

1337
01:45:36,133 --> 01:45:37,186
"Not that she needed me too".

1338
01:45:37,489 --> 01:45:38,428
Hey. New kid.

1339
01:45:38,837 --> 01:45:39,717
Hi

1340
01:45:40,788 --> 01:45:41,445
Lunch money.

1341
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:43,256
Now.

1342
01:45:48,087 --> 01:45:49,087
(The screams of the two bully's getting their ass kicked)

1343
01:45:51,431 --> 01:45:53,677
Kick-Ass was gone,
but not forgotten.

1344
01:45:55,066 --> 01:45:57,726
And my world is much safer
with all the new superheroes.

1345
01:45:59,173 --> 01:46:00,916
They said I was their inspiration

1346
01:46:01,727 --> 01:46:05,657
But all I did was make a door into a world
I dreamed about, since I was little kid.

1347
01:46:06,982 --> 01:46:09,135
A world full of super heroes, huh?

1348
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,125
like a great man once said...

1349
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,096
Wait'll they get a load of me.
