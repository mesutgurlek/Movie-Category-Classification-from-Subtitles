IS SO HARD.

307
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,667
DON'T GET ME WRONG, MY HUNTER IS THE
BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

308
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,834
BUT MAN, CAN HE
BE A HANDFUL.

309
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,067
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- TWO, GOING ON 20.

310
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,701
OH, GOD.

311
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,968
THE KID'S A PLAYER.

312
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,601
WELL, I WONDER WHERE
HE GETS THAT FROM.

313
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:53,534
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

314

HOW'S HE DEALING WITH
THE SEPARATION?

315
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,701
REAL WELL.

316
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,200
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SEPARATED.

317
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,267
YEAH.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH,

318
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,934
BUT HIS MOTHER AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO MAKE A BABY TOGETHER.

319
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,234
WE JUST WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

320
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,400
- THAT'S SO SAD.
- YEAH.

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,634
THANKS.

322
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,300
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SEE HIM?

323
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,167
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

324
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:20,267
THEY'RE NOT KIDDING WHEN
THEY SAY THAT RAISING A CHILD

325
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,000
IS THE TOUGHEST JOB
YOU'LL EVER LOVE.

326
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,667
MMM. WELL, YOU SOUND
LIKE A GREAT DAD.

327

BOTHER ANDREW, ALL RIGHT?

340
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,267
- HE HAS ASTHMA. - THEN HE
SHOULDN'T BE HAVING MILK PRODUCTS.

341
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:07,434
- WHAT? - LISTEN, YOU'RE GROUNDED.
SEND HIM HOME.

342
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:10,334
I CAN'T SEND HIM HOME,
DAD!

343
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,067
GOD, MAN, YOU NEVER
LISTEN TO ME.

I TOLD YOU,
HE DOESN'T HAVE A FATHER

AND HE HAS A MOTHER
WHO'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

346

KYLE, SEND HIM HOME.
YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN SEND HIM HOME.

I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
TO THIS GUY.

OKAY? YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.

00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:33,033
I WISH.
I LIKE ZOMBIES.

619
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,400
OH, YEAH, YOU DO?
ME TOO. I DO.

620
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,934
- REALLY?
- <i>YEAH.</i>

621
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,200
OH, I LIKE THE EARLY ZOMBIE MOVIES
LIKE "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD."

622
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,734
ME TOO.

623
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,734
<i>OH, YEAH, DON'T WATCH</i>
<i>THAT ONE ALONE.</i>

624
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,434
- I DON'T LIKE THE NEW ONES.
- NO.

625
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,934
- ZOMBIES ARE TOO FAST, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH, TOO FAST. YEAH.

626
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:50,033
I BELIEVE LIKE SIMON PEGG SAID,
"THE DEATH IS AN IMPEDIMENT,

627
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,501
NOT AN ENERGY DRINK."

628
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,734
<i>( laughing )</i>

629
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:56,167
<i>( funk music playing )</i>

630
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,167
WHAT YOU DOING?

631
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,033
JESUS, DAD.
YOU ALMOST MADE ME CRAP.

632
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:24,567
DID YOU GET YOUR
HOMEWORK DONE?

633
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,567
YEAH, A LONG TIME AGO.

634
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,734
YEAH.

635
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,167
- YEAH.
- <i>WHAT--</i>

636
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:32,200
<i>ARE YOU STONED?</i>

637
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,567
NO.

638
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,100
SERIOUSLY, YOU SMELL LIKE POT.
ARE YOU SMOKING POT?

639
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,934
- NO.
- YOU CAN TELL ME.

640
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:40,367
- NO.
- <i>YOU'RE NOT USING GRASS?</i>

641
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,868
NO, YOU DON'T USE GRASS.
NO.

642
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:44,868
<i>THEN WHAT'S--</i>
<i>WHAT'S THAT SMELL?</i>

643
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,434
WHAT SMELL?

644
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:49,367
IT'S PROBABLY A SKUNK OUTSIDE
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

645
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,968
OH YEAH, SURE,
A SKUNK.

646
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,501
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

647
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,734
WHY DON'T WE DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER TOMORROW?

648
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:56,534
WHY?
'CAUSE YOU FEEL BAD?

649
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,334
YEAH.NO.

650
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:01,968
I MEAN, IT'D BE JUST FUN TO DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

651
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,200
- OKAY.
- MMM.

652
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,501
YEAH.YEAH,
LIKE BUILD A ROCKET.

653
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,200
SURE, IF YOU WANT TO.

654
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,234
THAT'S RETARDED.

655
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,968
YEAH.

656
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:12,567
YEAH.

657
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,400
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
- NOTHING.

658
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,067
OH, COME ON NOW, KYLE, YOU MUST
BE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING.

659
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,634
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I LIKE?
- YEAH.

660
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,334
- I LIKE LOOKING AT VAGINAS...
- AHH.

661
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:22,567
...ALL DAY LONG.

662
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,133
( laughs )

663
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,701
- <i>THERE YOU GO.</i>
- YEAH.

664
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:31,400
BUT MAYBE DO SOMETHING
NON-VAGINA RELATED.

665
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,200
YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE
THE VAGINA.

666
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,601
OKAY, UH,
WE COULD GO TO THE MALL.

667
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,934
OKAY. AND THEN
WE'LL CATCH A MOVIE.

668
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,267
YEAH, SURE,
AT THE MALL, YOU KNOW?

669
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:45,267
AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE
LOOK FOR A NEW COMPUTER.

670
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,868
NO NO,
WE'LL JUST HANG.

671
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:49,400
DAD, DID I TELL YOU THAT
WE HAD TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER?

672
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,801
NO, I SAID-- IF YOU
WERE LISTENING TO ME--

673
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,934
THAT WE COULD LOOK
FOR A NEW COMPUTER, OKAY?

674
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,200
AND THEN WE'LL GO
TO YOUR MOVIE.

675
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,334
OKAY. BUT WE'RE NOT
BUYING A NEW COMPUTER.

676
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,534
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS FUN.

677
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:03,334
THIS ISN'T
THE BIGGEST SCREEN.

678
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:05,200
JESUS CHRIST,
HOW ABOUT A "THANK YOU"?

679
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,767
ARE YOU ON YOUR PERIOD
OR SOMETHING?

680
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>CAN I NOT SAY ANYTHING?</i>

681
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,968
HEY, ISN'T THAT-- ISN'T THAT
MIKE WITH MISS REED?

682
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,400
YEAH, IT IS.

683
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,968
DUDE, I WOULDN'T LET
MY BITCH TREAT ME THAT WAY.

684
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,634
- YOU DON'T HAVE A "BITCH."
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

685
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,501
- HI, KYLE.
- HEY.

686
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,400
- MR. CLAYTON.
- HELLO, ANDREW.

687
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,267
OH, WOW, SO HE
GOT IT FOR YOU.

688
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,901
- SWEET. - NOT THAT SWEET.
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST ONE.

689
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,267
WHAT-- DAD, WE'RE GONNA
GO HOME AND HOOK THIS UP.

690
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,634
WHAT ABOUT GOING TO
THE MOVIES?

691
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,968
DAD, WE'LL GO
TO DINNER LATER!

692
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,801
OKAY, FINE.

693
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,200
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, MR. CLAYTON?

694
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,734
OH, PROBABLY GO TO THE MOVIES
BY MYSELF, ANDREW.

695
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,601
ANDREW!

696
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

697
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,601
<i>YOU'RE CARRYING THAT</i>
<i>THE REST OF THE WAY.</i>

698
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,400
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

699
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,901
FUCKING PUSSY.

700
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,467
GOD DAMN IT.

701
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,701
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

702
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,667
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S ME.

703
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,267
WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?

704
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:20,734
<i>I was with Mike.</i>
<i>He was having a breakdown about his divorce.</i>

705
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:23,167
HE WAS DEPRESSED 'CAUSE
HE HAD TO GO TO THIS WEDDING,

706
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,734
SO I WENT WITH HIM TO THE MALL AND
HELPED HIM PICK UP A SUIT TO WEAR.

707
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,767
I KNOW,
I SAW YOU TWO THERE.

708
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,234
YOU DID?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

709
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:34,667
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMED WEIRD.

710
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,834
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I HAVE MALE FRIENDS?

711
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,734
NO, IT BOTHERS ME YOU KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET

712
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,601
AND YOU'RE OUT
IN PUBLIC WITH HIM.

713
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,767
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT, HMM?

714
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,501
LET'S GO OUT.
WE'LL GO OUT SOMEPLACE FANCY,

715
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,434
SOMEPLACE THE WORLD
CAN SEE US.

716
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:52,467
HOW ABOUT
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE?

717
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,767
OH.

718
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,734
ANYONE WHO'S ANYBODY
WILL BE THERE.

719
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,667
YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE
AUSSIETIZERS...

720
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:02,033
YOU KNOW, WAIT, I CAN'T.
I PROMISED KYLE I'D TAKE HIM OUT.

721
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,601
LET ME TAKE
BOTH OF YOU OUT.

722
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,601
- IT'LL BE MY TREAT.
- <i>Really?</i>

723
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:09,167
OH.
THAT'S SO NICE.

724
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,467
- HEY, KYLE.
- <i>I'M IN HERE.</i>

725
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,300
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TIP OVER THIS PHOTO?

726
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,968
<i>'CAUSE I HATE IT.</i>
<i>I LOOK INBRED.</i>

727
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,267
I THINK YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

728
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,334
WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER
TONIGHT WITH CLAIRE.

729
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,200
WHAT? NO.

730
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,667
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
- OH, COME ON.

731
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,601
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SEEING MR. LANE.

732
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:33,300
NO NO, THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS
AND SHE'S TRYING TO HELP HIM
OUT THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

733
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,901
WHY AM I EXPLAINING
THIS TO YOU, KYLE?

734
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,467
DAD, OKAY, LOOK,

735
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:39,000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH BEING SEEING
WITH A TEACHER AS A DAD,

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,234
BUT BEING SEEN WITH
TWO TEACHERS IS AIDS.

737
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,801
OKAY, GET DRESSED.
PUT ON SOMETHING NICE.

738
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,334
IF YOU DON'T ACT RIGHT AT DINNER,
I'LL STAB YOU IN THE FACE.

739
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,067
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO, KYLE?

740
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,501
NOTHING.

741
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,601
NOTHING?
YOU MUST LIKE TO DO SOMETHING.

742
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,634
NO.

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,934
KYLE JUST GOT A NEW MONITOR
FOR HIS COMPUTER.

744
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:04,567
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO ON THE COMPUTER?

745
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,267
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY YOU ASK.

746
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,067
- <i>I LIKE--</i>
- GAMES, MOSTLY.

747
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,801
- KYLE, WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?
- ANDREW.

748
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,000
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A BREAK
WHILE WE'RE EATING, SON?

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,367
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

750
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,167
PUT IT AWAY.

751
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,200
( chuckles )

752
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,501
SO, KYLE,

753
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,734
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

754
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:34,334
I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS.

755
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,934
- OKAY.
- OOH.

756
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,200
WATCH OUT.

757
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,167
ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IT?

758
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,400
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.
NON-STOP.

759
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,434
I'M HURTING RIGHT NOW.

760
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,167
( laughs )

761
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,334
LET'S NOT MAKE ME
THROW UP.

762
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,667
SO DO YOU PLAY SPORTS?

763
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,567
NO NO. I'M A BIG SPAZ LIKE MY DAD.

764
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,701
WELL, I WAS ON THE DIVE TEAM
IN COLLEGE.

765
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:08,100
DIVING IS NOT REALLY
A SPORT, IT'S FALLING.

766
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,734
I'M SORRY.

767
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:16,133
<i>NO OFFENSE.</i>
<i>IT'S JUST FUNNY.</i>

768
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,567
HEY, WHY DON'T WE RENT
A MOVIE AFTER DINNER?

769
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,367
SURE, AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT HORROR.

770
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,534
- REALLY?
- I DO NOT LIKE HORROR.

771
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,801
ZOMBIES? ARE YOU
OKAY WITH ZOMBIES?

772
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,667
- NO.
- OH.

773
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,934
DO YOU LIKE MUSICALS?
I LOVE MUSICALS.

774
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,367
BOB FOSSE WAS A GREAT
DIRECTOR.

775
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:37,634
HE DID "SWEET CHARITY"
AND "ALL THAT JAZZ."

776
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:40,767
- "CABARET." - ONE OF THE GREAT
NAZI MUSICALS OF ALL TIME.

777
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,634
BESIDES "THE SOUND
OF MUSIC," YOU KNOW?

778
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,267
THEN HE DID "STAR 80."
THAT WAS NOT A MUSICAL, BUT...

779
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:48,033
- I ONLY LIKE THE MUSICALS.
- OH, WELL.

780
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,968
- ME TOO.
- "WILLY WONKA."

781
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,634
WHICH ONE?

782
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:54,300
- Lance: <i>WELL, GENE WILDER.</i>
- ( beeping )

783
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,901
- I LIKE JOHNNY DEPP.
- OH.

784
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,501
- YEAH.
- MM-HM.

785
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,467
- BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE GENE WILDER... - <i>( beeps )</i>

786
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:04,200
- ...IN "YOUNG...
- Both: FRANKENSTEIN."

787
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,033
<i>"WHAT HUMP?"</i>

788
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:09,133
DID YOU SEE IT?

789
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,267
- NO.
- OH, YOU SHOULD.

790
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,701
- IT'S AMAZING.
- REALLY WONDERFUL.

791
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,267
YEAH.
EVERYBODY'S SEEN IT.

792
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,701
- I'M SURE.
- <i>YEAH.</i>

793
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:20,467
- NIGHT, MISS REED.
- GOOD NIGHT, KYLE.

794
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:23,033
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HIT THAT SHIT TONIGHT?

795
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:26,200
- SHUT UP! - COME ON, DUDE.
THAT SHIT'S TIGHT, DUDE.

796
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,734
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU
DON'T NAIL HER--

797
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,567
HEY HEY,
IF YOU DON'T NAIL HER, DUDE, YOU'RE--

798
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,300
- YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

799
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
<i>DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T THINK</i>
<i>ABOUT PUSSY ALL THE TIME TOO.</i>

800
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,834
- <i>I KNOW YOU DO.</i>
- <i>KYLE.</i>

801
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,934
<i>YOU'RE DROPPING ME</i>
<i>OFF FIRST, I GET IT.</i>

802
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:39,334
- <i>YOU WANT ME TO GO.</i> - I JUST WANNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT TO HER ALONE.

803
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,133
- OKAY?
- WITH YOUR COCK.

804
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,868
KYLE,
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.

805
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,801
WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT THE FUCK UP?

806
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:48,100
JESUS, MAN. YOU FUCKING NEED
TO GET LAID. GO OVER THERE.

807
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,901
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

808
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,100
ALL RIGHT. DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO, OKAY?

809
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,834
SHORT OF KILLING HER,
THAT LEAVES ME A LOT OF ROOM.

810
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,033
HEY, BABY.

811
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,801
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
KYLE.

812
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,801
NIGHT, WHORE.

813
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:09,200
HEY.

814
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,100
- THAT WAS FUN.
- THE KISS?

815
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,734
- MM-HMM.
- I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING, COME ON.

816
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,534
- NOT TONIGHT.
- WOW.

817
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,133
ARE YOU SHOOTING
ME DOWN?

818
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,567
LISTEN, I'D LOVE TO STAY,
BUT I PROMISED KYLE I'D BE RIGHT BACK.

819
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,934
KYLE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

820
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,801
OH NO.
HE LIKES YOU A LOT.

821
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,300
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

822
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,567
HE TOLD ME THAT
WHEN I DROPPED HIM OFF.

823
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,300
- HE DID?
- YEAH.

824
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,033
HE SAID I WAS
A LUCKY GUY.

825
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:31,834
NO, I'M THE LUCKY GUY.

826
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,634
I GOTTA GO.

827
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,901
OH, COME ON.
HE'S ALMOST AN ADULT.

828
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,868
- YEAH.

HOW ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE
HOME WITH THAT BONER, HUH?

831
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,934
I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A STICK-SHIFT
JOKE THERE SOMEWHERE

832
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,400
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT 'CAUSE ALL
THE BLOOD'S LEAVING MY BRAIN.

833

LANCE,

929
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:39,934
<i>THIS IS MR. PENTOLA.</i>

930
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,234
- MR. PENTOLA.
- DR. PENTOLA.

931
00:44:41,234 --> 00:44:42,801
<i>OH, DOCTOR.</i>

932
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:45,767
NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. CLAYTON.
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

933
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:46,901
THANK YOU.

934
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:49,234
DR. PENTOLA
IS A THERAPIST.

935
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:51,801
WE CALLED HIM IN
BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID

936
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:55,434
KYLE'S DEATH MAY
TRIGGER OTHER SUICIDES.

937
00:44:55,434 --> 00:44:57,267
HE'S A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

938
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:58,667
OH.

939
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,067
<i>BEFORE WE BEGIN,</i>

940
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,801
I'VE READ A LOT OF
SUICIDE NOTES,

941
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,300

<i>DEEP.</i>

943
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,767

<i>I NEED TO ASK YOU</i>
<i>A QUESTION.</i>

945
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,267

COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

946
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,334
OF COURSE.

947
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,634
DID KYLE HAVE ANY FRIENDS?

948
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,167
EXCUSE ME?

949
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,167
WELL, IT'S JUST
NO ONE'S COME TO SEE ME.

950
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,801
YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW KYLE.

951
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,801
WELL, I SHOULDN'T SAY
NO ONE.

952
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:27,467
A COUPLE OF KIDS CAME IN WITH
AGE- APPROPRIATE DEPRESSION,

953
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,834
EATING DISORDERS.

954
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,634
ONE KID CAME IN
WITH HEAD LICE.

955
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:31,901
I KNOW HIM.

956
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:33,934
NOT REALLY MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

957
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,801
BUT NO ONE'S COME TO TALK
ABOUT KYLE.

958
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,801
HMM.

959
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,267
- OH.
- WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS?

960
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,367
- ANDREW TROUTMEN.
- AND WHO ELSE?

961
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,067
THAT'S IT.

962
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:53,968
KYLE WAS KIND
OF A LONER.

963
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,868
A LONE WOLF.

964
00:45:55,868 --> 00:45:59,400
UH, I'LL HAVE TO
ASK ANDREW

965
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,234

966
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,667
AND, LANCE, THAT GOES
FOR YOU TOO.

967

RATIONAL, BUT...

- WHAT'S UP?

1058
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:25,534
YOU KNOW THAT WHILE WE
RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY,

1059
00:51:25,534 --> 00:51:28,801
WE ALSO RESPECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND EXPRESSION HERE AT SCHOOL?

1060

- YEAH.
- WELL, ONE OF THE KIDS ON THE PAPER

1061
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,067
WENT ONLINE AND THEY FOUND

1062
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:37,767
THE REPORT OF HIS DEATH.
AND NOW THEY'VE GONE AND
PUBLISHED HIS SUICIDE NOTE.

1063
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,567
- OH MY GOD.

00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,734
YOU-- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

1067

Lance's voice:
<i>"WHICH BRINGS METO YOU, DAD.</i>

1097
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,467
Lance and Kyle's voices:

1107
00:54:54,868 --> 00:54:58,767
HAS ANYONE SEEN
CARL OR STEVEN?

1108
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,000
MM-HMM.

1109
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,567
OH, YOU HAVE?
SO THEY'RE IN SCHOOL?

1110
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,868
YEAH, I SAW 'EM
THIS MORNING.

1111
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:10,067
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE,

1112
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,934
<i>ESPECIALLY THE NEWCOMERS.</i>

1113
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,100
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

1114
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,601
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
WITH WRITING POETRY?

1115
00:55:16,601 --> 00:55:19,267
- YES, HEATHER.
- CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

1116
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,634
SURE.

1117
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:23,601
WHAT WAS KYLE'S
FAVORITE BAND?

1118
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:24,801
UH...

1119
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:27,100
HE LIKED
BRUCE HORNSBY.

1120
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,300
<i>YES, RAY?</i>

1121
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,067
DID HE LISTEN
TO ANY METAL?

1122
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,701
- A LITTLE OZZY.
- I KNEW IT.

1123
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:37,067
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT POETRY OR...

1124
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,100
<i>YES, JASON?</i>

1125
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,968
DID THE BOY KNOW JESUS
BEFORE HE WENT?

1126
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:42,734
WELL, I WOULD SAY
HE WAS AN AGNOSTIC.

1127
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:45,234
BUT I THINK HE WAS
SPIRITUAL IN HIS OWN WAY.

1128
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:46,834
YEAH-- YES, HEATHER?

1129
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,067
WHAT'S HIS SIGN?

1130
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:50,868
OH, HE WAS BORN
APRIL 18TH, SO--

1131
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:52,901
ARIES.

1132
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,601
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1133
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:58,634
YOU KNOW, ANYBODY KNOW
EZRA POUND?

1134
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:00,901
<i>LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI?</i>

1135
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:06,501
YOU KNOW
WHAT KYLE REALLY LIKED?

1136
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,033
EMILY DICKINSON.

1137
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,801
WHAT BAND IS THAT?

1138
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:11,868
IT WASN'T A BAND.
SHE WAS A POET.

1139
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,133
- SHE HOT?
- <i>UM, SHE WAS A VICTORIAN.</i>

1140
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:18,200
IF YOU LIKE YOUR BUTTONED-DOWN GIRL,
SHE WAS ONE OF 'EM.

1141
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,667
- NICE.
- <i>( bell ringing )</i>

1142
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:22,133
- <i>MR. CLAYTON.</i>
- <i>PETER.</i>

1143
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:25,501
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?
- <i>SURE.</i>

1144
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:27,167
IT'S ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE.

1145
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,167
IT-- IT AFFECTED ME
A LOT.

1146
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:33,200
WELL, IT SEEMED TO AFFECT
A LOT OF STUDENTS.

1147
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,467
- I'M NOT HAPPY, MR. CLAYTON. - MM-HMM.

1148
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:38,501
I'M LIVING A LIE.
I'M GAY.

1149
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,501
AND KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE,

1150
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:43,534
IT'S HELPED ME GET THE
COURAGE TO COME OUT FINALLY.

1151
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,767
WELL, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

1152
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,934
I'M MISUNDERSTOOD TOO,
JUST LIKE HE WAS.

1153
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:50,000
I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY.

1154
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,968
GOOD FOR YOU, PETER.
I-I WISH YOU THE BEST.

1155
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:54,667
THANK YOU.

1156
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:01,968
HEY, MR. CLAYTON.

1157
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:03,434
- MR. CLAYTON.
- GINGER.

1158
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:05,634
KYLE WAS RIGHT.
EMILY DICKINSON'S GREAT.

1159
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,534
ISN'T SHE?

1160
00:57:07,534 --> 00:57:09,167
- MR. CLAYTON?
- YES.

1161
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:12,601
- I WROTE ANOTHER POEM.
- CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT, HEATHER.

1162
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:15,701
- JOHN.DOCTOR.
- HEY.

1163
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:17,400
CLAIRE.

1164
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,133
MR. C., WHAT'S UP?

1165
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:26,601
"MILKY WHITE SKIN
AND HAIR SO BROWN

1166
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:29,534
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
HOW BAD YOU HURT

1167
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:32,200
I COULD HAVE HELD YOU
WHILE YOU CRIED

1168
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
YOU WERE TOO SWEET
TO STAY

1169
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,167
IN THIS HARSH WORLD

1170
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,534
BUT I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU CLOSE TO MY HEART

1171
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:43,300
- MY ANGEL IN CARGO PANTS"
- Boy: <i>OH, WOW.</i>

1172
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,534
<i>( applauding )</i>

1173
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,334
HE WAS SUCH
A SWEET KID.

1174
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:04,534
AND KIND.

1175
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,334
OH, PLEASE.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

1176
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:11,334
( sighs )
AS A FATHER,

1177
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:14,467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF
HUNTER DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1178
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,400
MY HEART REALLY GOES
OUT TO YOU, LANCE.

1179
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,067
THANKS.

1180
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:20,601
IT'S SO SAD. I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS SUCH A GOOD WRITER.

1181
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,367
<i>DID HE WRITE</i>
<i>ANYTHING ELSE?</i>

1182
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,067
YEAH, HE DID.

1183
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:31,467
I KNOW IT'S REALLY PERSONAL,
BUT DO YOU THINK I COULD READ IT?

1184
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:34,300
WELL, IF YOU CAME OVER
TO MY APARTMENT.

1185
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,234
I JUST DON'T WANT HIS STUFF OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW, FLOATING AROUND.

1186
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,567
SURE.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

1187
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:40,834
GREAT.

1188
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:47,534
MY PLAYOFF GAME'S
TONIGHT.

1189
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:52,434
ALL RIGHT.
NOT THE LIP.

1190
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:54,000
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TAKE THE LIP.

1191
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,701
OH, THANKS, MIKE.

1192
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,133
WHAT TIME?

1193
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,634
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE TIME BECAUSE
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T CLEANED.

1194
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,434
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1195
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:08,601
- WELL, 8:00?
- THAT'S GREAT.

1196
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:17,567
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.

1197
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,133
THANKS.

1198
00:59:21,734 --> 00:59:23,400
IF YOU THINK THIS
IS A BAD IDEA--

1199
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,601
NO NO NO.
NOT AT ALL.

1200
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:28,100
I FOUND SOMETHING
KYLE WROTE

1201
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,601
AND I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.

1202
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,567
OKAY.

1203
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:50,300
THIS IS FROM HIS JOURNAL.

1204
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,200
"I WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH
MY DAD AND CLAIRE TONIGHT.

1205

I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM,

1206
00:59:57,701 --> 01:00:00,501
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SEEING THEM TOGETHER

1207
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,334
ONLY PROVES THAT I'LL
NEVER BE HAPPY.

1208
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:07,167
I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND
A WOMAN LIKE HER--

<i>SO PRETTY,</i>
<i>SO PERFECT.</i>

1210
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:14,300
SHE SEEMS TO COMPLETE HIM.

1211
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:20,667
I HOPE THEY MAKE IT.

1212
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,934
I HOPE THEY LAST.

1213
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,934
I HOPE I'M LEAVING
MY DAD IN GOOD HANDS.

1214
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,334
NO ONE COULD EVER GET ME.

1215
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,467
I DON'T EVEN GET ME."

1216
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,868
OH.

1217
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,167
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
COULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

1218
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,534
HE DID LIKE ME.
HE REALLY DID.

1219
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:46,200
<i>HE DID.</i>
<i>HE REALLY DID.</i>

1220
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,467
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

1221
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:51,100
NO.
I'D NEVER DO THAT.

1222
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,334
- <i>REALLY?</i>
- REALLY.

( moaning )

1224
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:19,701
MR. CLAYTON.

1225
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,901
- GOOD MORNING, HEATHER.
- YES.

1226
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,601
GOOD MORNING.

1227
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:26,701
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
OF KYLE'S?

1228
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:27,901
WHAT?

1229
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,534
THAT I COULD HAVE?

1230
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:32,467
- NO.
- OH.

1231
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:35,367
WAIT A SECOND.

1232
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:41,234
HERE YOU GO.

1233
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:42,734
BRUCE HORNSBY?

1234
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:46,334
THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE.

1235
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,033
THANK YOU.

1236
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:08,901
I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1237
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:11,100
YEAH, I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT TOO.

1238
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,701
- YEAH.
- ( sighs )

1239
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:16,634
I'M TIRED OF HIDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

1240
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:26,200
MMM.

1241
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,767
- DAN.
- LANCE.

1242
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,868
- GINGER.
- MR. CLAYTON, LOOK AT THIS.

1243
01:02:52,868 --> 01:02:54,601
OH.

1244
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,367
HEATHER.

1245
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:02,067
HEY, MR. C.

1246
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:05,100
OH, PETER.

1247
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,367
- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.
- OH.

1248
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,601
I DON'T KNOW IF KYLE
EVER TOLD YOU,

1249
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,267
BUT HE AND I WERE
KINDA BROS.

1250
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,267
I'M GONNA WIN THIS GAME
TONIGHT IN HIS HONOR.

1251
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,100
GREAT, PETER.

1252
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:30,767
Andrew:
<i>MR. CLAYTON?</i>

1253
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:31,968
ANDREW.

1254
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:34,400
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,
DOES IT?

1255
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,234
WHAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT?

1256
01:03:36,234 --> 01:03:38,033
HOW EVERYONE IS ACTING.

1257
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:39,968
<i>LIKE THEY LIKED KYLE.</i>

1258
01:03:39,968 --> 01:03:42,100
NO, IT DOESN'T.

1259
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,234
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>IS WEIRD?</i>

1260
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:47,767
- WHAT?
- KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE.

1261
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,634
IN WHAT WAY?

1262
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:52,133
THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING
AN INSIGNIFICANT MOLECULE

1263
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:54,901
BOUNCING AROUND IN A
MEANINGLESS GODLESS UNIVERSE.

1264
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:58,534
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
BUT KYLE WAS...

1265
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,567
WHAT?

1266
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,601
KINDA DUMB.

1267
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:04,801
HA.NO.

1268
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:07,901
KYLE WAS ACTUALLY
SMART, ANDREW.

1269
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:11,100
YOU KNOW, HE JUST PRETENDED
TO BE DUMB, EVEN AROUND YOU

1270
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,033
SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WOULDN'T PICK ON HIM.

1271
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,100
YEAH, MAYBE.

1272
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,000
- Heather: <i>IT'S MINE!</i>
- Ginger: <i>LET GO, YOU CRAZY--</i>

1273
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,501
HEY!

1274
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:22,067
OH! GET OFF!

1275
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,601
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LIKE KYLE!

1276
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,133
YOU DIDN'T LIKE KYLE!

1277
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:27,067
SHUT UP, WHORE!

1278
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:39,634
BRUCE HORNSBY?

1279
01:04:39,634 --> 01:04:41,868
Lance:
<i>I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.</i>

1280
01:04:41,868 --> 01:04:43,334
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1281
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:46,234
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

1282
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:48,234
SUICIDE LEAVES
MANY VICTIMS.

1283
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:50,400
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

1284
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,767
KYLE MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING
FROM A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.

1285
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:55,467
AND I KNOW THAT THE NOTE
BEING PUBLISHED

1286
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:57,534
HAS CAUSED YOU SOME
DISTRESS,

1287
01:04:57,534 --> 01:05:01,133
BUT IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN
A VERY POSITIVE THING.

1288
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:03,200
<i>STUDENTS ARE</i>
<i>COMING TO SEE ME.</i>

1289
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,167
<i>IT'S THE BREAKTHROUGH</i>
<i>I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.</i>

1290
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,501
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OF THESE KIDS

1291
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:10,601
I CAN HELP BECAUSE THEY'RE
REACHING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME?

1292
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:14,100
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE PART WHERE KYLE WRITES:

1293
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,167
"I LOVE YOU, DAD."

1294
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:19,901
BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T
REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?

1295
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,067
BUT HE DID.

1296
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:25,501
LANCE, SUICIDE

1297
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:28,033
IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

1298
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:30,334
TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

1299
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,367
AND WHO KNOWS

1300
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:35,133

LANCE, YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD.

1318
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:36,167
WELL, I HAD KIND OF
A ROUGH WEEKEND.

1319
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,868
I DID A LOT OF SOUL
SEARCHING

1320
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,367
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE

1321
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,133
AND THE EFFECT
ON THE OTHER KIDS,

1322
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,467
AND...

1323
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,467
THIS IS KYLE'S JOURNAL.

1324
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,434
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU
TO READ.

1325
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:51,534
I WANT YOU TO READ IT, AND IF YOU THINK
IT'LL BE OF VALUE TO THE OTHER KIDS,

1326
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,868
I WANNA PUBLISH IT
AND HAND IT OUT TO THEM.

1327
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:58,968
- I'LL SEE IF I CAN'T GIVE IT A LOOK.
- OH, THANKS.

( sighs )

1330
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,901
IT'S SO SAD.

1331
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:11,267
YEAH.

1332
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:13,501
I MEAN, KYLE WAS SUCH

1333
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,300
A STRONG POWERFUL WRITER.

1334
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,167
SO TORTURED.

1335
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,868
YES, HE WAS.

1336
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA CALL IT?

1337
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,267
I WAS THINKING
"I AM WHAT I HATE."

1338
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:30,667
WHAT?

1339
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:35,067
"I AM WHAT I HATE."
KYLE WROTE THAT IN CHAPTER SIX.

1340
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,634
OH.

1341
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:39,000
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1342
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I DON'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.

1343
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,300
WHY?

1344
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:47,334
- TO ME, A BETTER TITLE...
- MM-HMM.

1345
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:50,534
...WOULD BE
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

1346
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,901
- OH.
- YOU KNOW?

1347
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,901
BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

1348
01:07:57,267 --> 01:07:59,400
BUT HE DIDN'T WRITE
THAT THOUGH, I MEAN...

1349
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,534
YEAH, BUT
HE FELT THAT.

1350
01:08:01,534 --> 01:08:03,868
- YOU'RE INFERRING THAT FROM HIM.
- <i>YES.</i>

OH.

1352

- <i>OH, OKAY.</i>

1402
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,601
ARE YOU READY FOR
OUR UNDEAD MARATHON?

1403
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:03,834
Lance: <i>Well, that's the thing.</i>
<i>Something came up.</i>

1404
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,000
<i>KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.</i>
<i>I CAN'T MAKE IT.</i>

I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

Mike: <i>EVERYTHING OKAYTHERE, PAL?</i>

1411
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,601
YEAH, GREAT.

1412
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:25,067
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

1413
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:27,100
YOU KNOW WHAT LINE
REALLY BLEW ME AWAY,

1414
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,901
IS WHEN KYLE WROTE:

1415
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:32,367
"AMERICA IS ONE OF THE FINEST
COUNTRIES ANYONE EVER STOLE."

1416
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:34,534
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

1417
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:36,901
HE REMINDS ME
OF MY HUNTER.

1418
01:11:38,534 --> 01:11:40,367
LANCE, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

1419
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:43,000
I LURED YOU OUT HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

1420
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,334
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

1421
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:48,567
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
IF WE RENAMED THE LIBRARY

1422
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:51,300
THE KYLE CLAYTON
MEMORIAL LIBRARY?

1423
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,667
BUT YOU WERE GONNA PUT HIM
IN A SPECIAL-NEEDS CLASS.

1424
01:11:54,868 --> 01:11:56,501
YEAH.

1425
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:58,767
YEAH, AND I FEEL
REALLY BAD ABOUT THAT.

1426
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:01,033
- OH.
- HE WASN'T SLOW.

1427
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:03,033
OBVIOUSLY
HE WAS BRILLIANT.

1428
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:05,634
HE WAS JUST BORED.

1429
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:07,734
YOU KNOW, WE HAD HIM
TOTALLY WRONG.

1430
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:11,567
I JUST HOPE TO GOD THAT OUR MISTAKE
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH--

1431
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:13,667
WELL, WITH
WHAT HAPPENED.

1432
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:15,100
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT DIDN'T.

1433
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,267
THANKS, LANCE.

1434

JUST LIKE MY PROM NIGHT,
NOTHING WENT IN THE HOLE.

1441
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:43,868
NO, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE A TASTEFUL DEDICATION.

1442
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:45,334
VERY TASTEFUL.

- WOW.
- WHAT?

1448
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,534
PENTOLA-- HE SENT
KYLE'S JOURNAL TO DR. DANA.

1449
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,367
SHE LOVES IT. SHE WANTS ME
TO BE ON THE SHOW.

1450
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,901
SHE'S GONNA FLY ME
TO L.A.

1451
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:10,601
- WHAT'S DR. DANA?
- SHE'S LIKE OPRAH.

1452
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,133
WELL, SHE'S NOT
AS BIG AS OPRAH.

1453
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:18,167
I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD SHOW,
YOU KNOW?

1454
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,067
WOMEN SEEM TO
REALLY LIKE IT.

- ANDREW.
- <i>ARE YOU BUSY, MR. CLAYTON?</i>

1457
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,968
OH, NO NO.
JUST PACKING FOR MY TRIP.

1458
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:38,267
YEAH, THAT TV SHOW.

1459
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:40,467
"DR. DANA."

1460
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,634
WHAT'S UP?

1461
01:13:43,634 --> 01:13:45,033
I FEEL BAD.

1462
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,834
I WISH I KNEW
HE WAS THAT DEPRESSED.

1463
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:49,701
YOU AND ME BOTH.

1464
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:52,033
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE
ABOUT THE BOOK?

1465
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,234
WHAT?

1466
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:56,667
KYLE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT VAGINAS, ANAL SEX,

1467
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:59,067
FISTING, FELCHING
OR RIM JOBS.

1468
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,434
IT IS A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE
FELCHING AREA, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1469
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:06,200
BUT I THINK IT'S THERE,
ANDREW, IN ITS OWN WAY.

1470
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,000
I WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
THE BOOK IS SO SMART AND SAD.

1471
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,133
HE NEVER TALKED
WITH ME LIKE THAT.

1472
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:15,367
<i>I WISH HE DID. MAYBE HE WOULDN'T</i>
<i>HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID.</i>

1473
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,534
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,
ANDREW.

1474
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:19,834
ONE THING I KNOW,
HE LIKED YOU.

1475
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:21,467
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
TALK TO ME?

1476
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:23,067
<i>WHAT DO YOU WANT ME</i>
<i>TO TELL YOU, ANDREW?</i>

1477
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,634
MAYBE IT'S LIKE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

1478
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,634
HE WAS SUPER SMART.
HE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

1479
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:28,434
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
OF BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY.

1480
01:14:28,434 --> 01:14:31,033
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE WAS ALREADY TREATED LIKE A FREAK.

1481
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,601
IF HE WAS THAT SMART HE WOULD
HAVE LOVED TO RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT.

1482
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:36,200
OH, JESUS CHRIST, ANDREW.
WHY CAN'T YOU LET IT GO, OKAY?

1483
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,634
NO WONDER
YOUR MOTHER DRINKS.

1484
01:14:38,634 --> 01:14:41,601
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LAST
THINGS KYLE SAID TO ME?

1485
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:44,601
HE SAID THAT YOU'RE
A STUPID FUCKING IDIOT.

1486
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,634
<i>HAVE A GOOD TIME</i>
<i>ON YOUR TV SHOW.</i>

1487

ANDREW.

1489
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:55,234
ARE YOU ALMOST READY?
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.

1490

Claire: <i>I THINK YOU SHOULD
KEEPYOUR PANTS ON.</i>

1491
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,133

YOUR PANTS ON.

<i>I'M NOT GOING</i>
<i>TO WEAR PANTS.</i>

1494
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:04,767
<i>YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.</i>

1495

MMM.
THANKS.

1496
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,601
I'M USING BACKWARD
PSYCHOLOGY.

1497
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:11,367

01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:21,901
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE
BUT THE SHOW CALLED AGAIN

1501
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:24,734
- AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE LEAVING.
- OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1502
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,667
BABY, THAT WAS THE DRIVER.
HE SAID THE SHOW CALLED.

1503
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,534
WE GOTTA GET GOING,
OKAY?

1504
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:32,968
- ( sighs ) - OH, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
LET'S GET GOING, COME ON.

1505
01:15:32,968 --> 01:15:35,501
- DOES THIS MAKE MY ASS LOOK BIG?
- NO NO. NOT AT ALL.

1506
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:37,734
- YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR ASS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1507
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:40,567
- I MEAN--
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T HAVE AN ASS?

1508
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:43,601
I'M SAYING YOUR ASS IS THERE,

YOU KNOW,
SWEETHEART,

1511
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:51,868
I REALLY SHOULD GET OVER THERE SO
I COULD SIT DOWN WITH THE PRODUCER

1512
01:15:51,868 --> 01:15:53,367
AND GO OVER WITH WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY.

1513
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:54,901
THAT WOULD
REALLY HELP ME A LOT.

1514
01:15:54,901 --> 01:15:56,167
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

1515

1533
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:39,601
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TIME
TO GO THROUGH THE NOTES

1534
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:41,133
IN THE GREENROOM
AS WE PLANNED,

1535
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:42,667
- SO WE'RE GONNA DO IT IN MAKEUP.

1539
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:50,601
IS SHE GONNA BE HOLDING
UP THE BACK OF THE BOOK?

1540
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,767
THAT'S A DIRECTOR QUESTION.
I'M A SEGMENT PRODUCER.

1541
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,868
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHEN THE CAMERA IS ON ME?

1542
01:16:54,868 --> 01:16:57,367
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE
FRIENDS- AND-FAMILY SECTION.

1543
01:16:57,367 --> 01:16:59,167
- <i>( audience applauding )</i>
- COULD YOU GRAB A SEAT?

1544
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:00,701
OKAY, YEAH.
SURE.

1545
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:03,601
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF
ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH LANCE.

1546
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,801
- LANCE, DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
- NO NO.

1547
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:07,200
- LOOK OVER HERE, PLEASE.
- GOOD.GOOD.

1548
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,033
SO, LANCE, IF YOU SHOULD START
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SON...

1549
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:11,367
- MM-HMM.
- ...AND BEGIN TO CRY...

1550
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:13,067
- YEAH.

1551
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:15,200

DON'T BE ASHAMED, OKAY?

1552
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,567
- YEAH.

1553
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:18,133

1554
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,601

1555
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,234
- DON'T LOOK DOWN.LOOK UP.
- CAN YOU LOOK DOWN?

1556
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:23,000
- DON'T TUCK YOUR CHIN.
- OH.

1557
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,467
AND ABOVE ALL,
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

1558
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,300
LANCE, HI.

1559

1563
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,534
MM-HMM.

1564
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,601
- OH, THANK YOU. - HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO PUBLISHERS?

1565
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:42,467
- NO. - BECAUSE I HONESTLY
THINK THIS COULD BE

1566
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:43,901
THE BIGGEST POSTHUMOUS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY

1567
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:45,434
SINCE "THE DIARY
OF ANNE FRANK," HONESTLY.

1568
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:46,534
- REALLY?
- OH MY GOD.

1569
01:17:46,534 --> 01:17:49,200
YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR...

1570
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,067
YES.
YEAH, THAT'S HUGE.

1571
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,200
LOOK, I'M GONNA GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR RIGHT NOW.

1572
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,667
BUT IF ANY OF THIS
INTERESTS YOU,

1573
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:56,100
- GIVE ME A CALL, OKAY?
- OKAY.

1574
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,868
JUST GIVE ME A RING.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

1575
01:17:57,868 --> 01:18:00,901
GREAT TO MEET YOU.
GO OUT THERE AND KILL 'EM.

1576
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:03,400
- DO IT.
- OKAY.

1577
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,367
- NOW I'M NERVOUS.
- OH, GREAT.

1578
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:08,968
- IT'S GO TIME, ALL RIGHT?

LANCE'S 15-YEAR-OLD SON KYLE
TRAGICALLY TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

1584
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,868
BUT FROM THIS TERRIBLE
STORY OF LOSS

1585

( woman giggles )

1594
01:18:56,667 --> 01:19:00,634
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS
IS FOR A PARENT TO LOSE A CHILD.

1595
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:03,534
YES.YES IT IS.

1596

TELL US ABOUT
YOUR SON KYLE.

1597
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,901
IT'S DIFFICULT,
ISN'T IT?

1598
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:18,767
YEAH.

1599
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:21,467
HE WAS A SWEET BOY.

1600
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:27,200
KIND.

1601
01:19:30,868 --> 01:19:32,801
I'M SORRY.
HE WAS A SWEET BOY.

( laughs )

1603
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:43,334
- I'M SORRY. - BUT THERE WAS
A LOT BREWING UNDERNEATH?

1604
01:19:43,334 --> 01:19:47,367
<i>THE TRAGEDY IS I DIDN'T</i>
<i>KNOW UNTIL HIS DEATH</i>

1605
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,901
HOW SAD HE WAS
OR PROFOUND.

1606
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,033
- MMM.
- <i>( laughing )</i>

1607
01:19:54,033 --> 01:19:56,000
HERE'S A TISSUE
FOR YOU.

1608
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,400
<i>PROFOUND.</i>
<i>INDEED PROFOUND.</i>

1609
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,701
INDEED.

1610
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:03,334
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

1611
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:05,367
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFULLY
WRITTEN.

1612
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,200
I JUST--
YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,

1613
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,534
I DIDN'T KNOW-- I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.
HE WAS A GREAT WRITER.

1614
01:20:11,534 --> 01:20:14,634
<i>YES, THIS IS REALLY</i>
<i>REMARKABLE WORK.</i>

1615

<i>NO MATTER WHAT PAGE</i>
<i>I TURN TO,</i>

1616
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
THAT REALLY MOVES ME.

1617
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,100
- I WANT TO READ THIS.
- <i>OKAY.</i>

1618
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,968
"IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO BE A GOOD PERSON

1619
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:30,067
<i>OR TO BE THOUGHT OF</i>
<i>AS A GOOD PERSON?</i>

1620
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:32,968
<i>I'M SO SICK</i>
<i>OF LIVING A LIFE IN FEAR</i>

1621
01:20:32,968 --> 01:20:35,801
<i>OF BEING FOUND OUT</i>
<i>FOR THE PHONY I AM,</i>

<i>A LIFE WHERE I DON'T TRUST</i>
<i>ANYONE'S INTENTIONS,</i>

1623

<i>INCLUDING MY OWN."</i>

1624
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:43,767
WOW, THAT IS REALLY DEEP.

1625
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:47,801
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS
WRITTEN BY A 15-YEAR-OLD.

1626
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,868
- HE WAS AN OLD SOUL.
- MMM.

1627
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:54,400
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
THAT I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

1628
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,300
IN THE MIND
OF A TEENAGER.

1629
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,567
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
KYLE MADE A MISTAKE.

1630
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,634
IF YOU'RE THAT DEPRESSED,

1631
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:03,501
REACH OUT TO SOMEONE.

1632
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:06,868
AND REMEMBER, SUICIDE
IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

1633
01:21:06,868 --> 01:21:08,434
TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

1634
01:21:08,434 --> 01:21:12,734
- YOU WANT MY JOB?
- NO.PLEASE, DANA, NO. THANK YOU.

MR. CLAYTON,

1710
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:46,334
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

1711
01:25:46,334 --> 01:25:49,634
I'VE ALWAYS FELT
NOT ENOUGH.

1712
01:25:49,634 --> 01:25:51,634
MY DAD

1713
01:25:51,634 --> 01:25:54,567
RIDES ME
ALL THE TIME.

1714
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,234
HE CALLS ME A LOSER.

1715
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,834
I ALMOST KILLED MYSELF

1716
01:26:00,834 --> 01:26:03,133
UNTIL KYLE'S NOTE
AND BOOK CAME OUT.

1717
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:07,133
IT SAVED MY LIFE.

1718
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,167
I KNOW HE'S LOOKING
DOWN ON YOU SO PROUD.

1719
01:26:15,934 --> 01:26:17,734
THANKS, PETE.

TODAY

1725
01:26:37,834 --> 01:26:40,601
WE CELEBRATE KYLE.

1726
01:26:42,567 --> 01:26:45,067
KYLE HAS SHOWN US
SO MANY THINGS;

1727
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:47,267
HOW FLEETING THE TIME

1728
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,467
WE SPEND ON THIS EARTH
REALLY IS.

1729
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:52,934
<i>KYLE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.</i>

1730
01:26:52,934 --> 01:26:54,200
<i>THROUGH HIS BOOK</i>

1731
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,467
<i>AND THROUGH OUR HEARTS</i>
<i>HE WILL LIVE ON.</i>

1732
01:26:59,267 --> 01:27:02,334
TODAY WE DEDICATE
THIS LIBRARY

1733
01:27:02,334 --> 01:27:04,868
IN HIS SPIRIT.

1734
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:07,801
A TRIBUTE TO HIS DEEP
INTELLIGENCE

1735
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:11,934
<i>AND TO THE PROFOUND IMPACT</i>
<i>HE MADE ON ALL OF US</i>

1736
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:15,133
<i>IN THE BRIEF TIME WE WERE</i>
<i>FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW HIM.</i>

1737
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:20,300
AND NOW TO ACCEPT
THIS HONOR ON HIS BEHALF,

1738
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,534
I GIVE YOU HIS FATHER

1739
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,634
<i>MR. LANCE CLAYTON.</i>

( crowd cheering )

1741
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,734
YOU GUYS
DIDN'T LIKE KYLE.

1742
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:23,734
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
I DIDN'T EITHER.

1743
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:28,133
I LOVED HIM.

1744
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:30,567
HE WAS MY SON,

1745
01:28:32,033 --> 01:28:34,000
BUT HE WAS ALSO
A DOUCHE BAG.

1746
01:28:38,534 --> 01:28:42,167
HE WASN'T VERY SMART

1747
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:44,400
AND HE DIDN'T KILL
HIMSELF.

1748
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,200
KYLE DIED ACCIDENTALLY
WHILE MASTURBATING.

1749
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,667
<i>I MADE IT LOOK LIKE</i>
<i>A SUICIDE</i>

1750
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,667
AND I WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE.

1751
01:29:06,567 --> 01:29:09,801
I ALSO WROTE HIS JOURNAL.
THANK YOU.

1752
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,133
THANKS.

1753
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:30,634
YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.

1754
01:29:30,634 --> 01:29:32,334
YEAH.

1755
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:34,534
Lance's voice:
<i>I USED TO THINK THE WORSTTHING IN LIFE</i>

1756
