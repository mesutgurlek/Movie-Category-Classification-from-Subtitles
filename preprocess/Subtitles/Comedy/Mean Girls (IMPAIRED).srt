1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,365
This is your lunch, OK?

2
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,536
Now, I put a dollar in there
so you can buy some milk.

3
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,432
You can ask one of the big kids
where to do that.

4
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,107
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.

5
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,799
Put it in your pocket,
I don't want you to lose it.

6
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,769
OK? You ready?

7
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,244
I think so.

8
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,319
It's Cady's big day.

9
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,746
<i>I guess it's natural for parents to cry
on their kid's first day of school.</i>

10
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,619
<i>But, you know, this usually
happens when the kid is 5.</i>

11
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,160
<i>I'm 16 and until today,
I was home-schooled.</i>

12
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,332
<i>I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."</i>

13
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:12,163
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.

14
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,669
<i>Or that we're weirdly religious
or something.</i>

15
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,378
And on the third day, God created
the Remington bolt-action rifle

16
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,979
so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.

17
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,978
And the homosexuals.

18
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,582
- Amen.
- Amen.

19
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,184
<i>But my family's totally normal.</i>

20
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:30,355
<i>Except for the fact that both my
parents are research zoologists</i>

21
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,681
<i>and we've spent the last
12 years in Africa.</i>

22
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,254
<i>I had a great life.</i>

23
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,824
<i>But then my mom got offered tenure
at Northwestern University.</i>

24
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,395
<i>So it was goodbye Africa
and hello high school.</i>

25
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,295
I'm OK. Sorry.

26
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,904
I'll be careful.

27
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,163
Hi.

28
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,232
I don't know if anyone
told you about me.

29
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:18,733
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.

30
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,805
Talk to me again
and I'll kick your ass.

31
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,840
You don't wanna sit there. Kristen
Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.

32
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,848
Hey, baby.

33
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,920
He farts a lot.

34
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,064
Hey, everybody.

35
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,736
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,109
It's not you. I'm bad luck.

37
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,345
Ms. Norbury?

38
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,142
My T-shirt's stuck
to my sweater, isn't it?

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,287
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

40
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,785
Is everything all right in here?

41
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,255
- Oh, yeah.
- So...

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,553
...how was your summer?
- I got divorced.

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,727
My carpal tunnel came back.

44
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,733
- I win.
- Yes, you do.

45
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,494
Well, I just wanted to let
everyone know

46
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,502
that we have a new student joining us.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,434
She just moved here
all the way from Africa.

48
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,201
Welcome.

49
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,676
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.

50
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,617
Her name is Cady. Cady Heron.

51
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,376
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.

52
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,146
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.

53
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,983
I have a nephew named Anfernee,

54
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,489
and I know how mad he gets
when I call him Anthony.

55
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,524
Almost as mad as I get
when I think about the fact

56
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,356
that my sister named him Anfernee.

57
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,592
Well, welcome, Cady.

58
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,768
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.

59
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,368
And...

60
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,506
...if you need anything or if you
wanna talk to somebody...

61
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:02,935
Thanks.

62
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:06,540
Maybe some other time,
when my shirt isn't see-through.

63
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,705
OK.

64
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,110
OK. Good day, everybody.

65
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,581
<i>The first day of school was a blur.</i>

66
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,552
<i>A stressful, surreal blur.</i>

67
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,919
<i>I got in trouble for the
most random things.</i>

68
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,823
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,858
You need the lavatory pass.

70
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,330
OK. Can I have the lavatory pass?

71
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,625
Nice try. Have a seat.

72
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,934
<i>I had never lived in a world
where adults didn't trust me,</i>

73
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,539
<i>where they were always yelling at me.</i>

74
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,368
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!

75
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,736
No food in class!

76
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,186
I told you, I saw the whole thing.

77
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,051
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?

78
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,820
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.

79
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,054
<i>I had a lot of friends in Africa.</i>

80
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,829
What?

81
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,027
<i>But so far, none in Evanston.</i>

82
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,079
Hey. How was your first day?

83
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,560
Is that your natural hair color?

84
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,001
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.

85
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,435
Thank you.

86
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,399
See, this is the color I want.

87
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,078
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.

88
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,411
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.

89
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,948
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!

90
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,212
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.

91
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,122
Do you guys know
where Room G 14 is?

92
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,226
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday,
Room G 14."

93
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,829
I think that's in the back building.

94
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,499
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.

95
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,893
Thanks.

96
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,436
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!

97
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,670
"Health. Spanish."

98
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,937
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?

99
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,911
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?

100
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:26,011
Because it's the same
in every country.

101
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,854
That's beautiful. This girl is deep.

102
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,089
Where's the back building?

103
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,593
It burned down in 1987.

104
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,289
Won't we get in some
sort of trouble for this?

105
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,325
Why would we get you into trouble?

106
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,227
We're your friends.

107
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,293
<i>I know it's wrong to skip class,
but Janis said we were friends.</i>

108
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:48,098
<i>And I was in no position
to pass up friends.</i>

109
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,504
<i>I guess I'll never know what I missed
on that first day of health class.</i>

110
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,612
Don't have sex. Because you
will get pregnant and die.

111
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,510
Don't have sex
in the missionary position,

112
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:59,149
don't have sex standing up.

113
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,816
Just don't do it, promise?

114
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,718
OK, everybody take some rubbers.

115
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,915
Why didn't they just keep
home-schooling you?

116
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,855
They wanted me to get socialized.

117
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,655
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.

118
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,966
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.

119
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,166
- What?
- Own it.

120
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,802
How do you spell your
name again, Cady?

121
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,336
It's Cady. C-A-D-Y.

122
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,240
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.

123
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:27,544
In the name of all that is holy, will you
look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?

124
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,408
Of course all The Plastics
are in the same gym class.

125
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,274
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.

126
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,682
<i>If North Shore was Us Weekly,
they would always be on the cover.</i>

127
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,481
That one there, that's Karen Smith.

128
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,058
She is one of the dumbest
girls you will ever meet.

129
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,754
Damian sat next to her
in English last year.

130
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,761
She asked me how to spell "orange".

131
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,700
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.

132
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,394
She's totally rich because
her dad invented Toaster Strudel.

133
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,198
Gretchen Wieners knows
everybody's business.

134
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,238
She knows everything
about everyone.

135
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,207
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.

136
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,044
And evil takes a human
form in Regina George.

137
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,448
Don't be fooled, because she may seem
like your typical selfish, back-stabbing,

138
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:13,785
slut-faced ho-bag. But in reality,
she is so much more than that.

139
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,221
She's the queen bee.

140
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,987
The star. Those other two
are just her little workers.

141
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,789
Regina George.

142
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,934
How do I even begin
to explain Regina George?

143
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,898
Regina George is flawless.

144
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,368
She has two Fendi purses
and a silver Lexus.

145
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,598
I hear her hair's insured
for $10,000.

146
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,606
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.

147
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,540
<i>Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.</i>

148
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,374
One time, she met John Stamos
on a plane.

149
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,072
And he told her she was pretty.

150
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,309
One time,
she punched me in the face.

151
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,146
It was awesome.

152
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,482
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.

153
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,659
- Who cares?
- I care.

154
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,691
Every year, the seniors throw
this dance for the underclassmen

155
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,157
called The Spring Fling.

156
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,456
And whomsoever is elected
Spring Fling King and Queen

157
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,531
automatically becomes head of the
Student Activities Committee.

158
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,567
And since I am an active member
of the Student Activities Committee,

159
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,762
I would say, yeah, I care.

160
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,067
Damian, you've truly
out-gayed yourself.

161
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,039
Here. This map is gonna
be your guide to North Shore.

162
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,739
Now, where you sit in
the cafeteria is crucial

163
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,350
because you got everybody there.

164
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,112
You got your freshmen,
ROTC guys,

165
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,257
preps, JV jocks,

166
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,688
Asian nerds,

167
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,923
cool Asians,

168
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,593
varsity jocks,

169
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,990
unfriendly black hotties,

170
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,525
girls who eat their feelings,

171
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,995
girls who don't eat anything,

172
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,672
desperate wannabes,

173
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,369
burnouts,

174
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,643
sexually active band geeks,

175
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,141
the greatest people
you will ever meet

176
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,916
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.

177
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,819
Hey. We're doing a lunchtime
survey of new students.

178
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,284
Can you answer a few questions?

179
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,454
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?

180
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,593
What?

181
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,864
Would you like us to assign
someone to butter your muffin?

182
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,034
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?

183
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,203
Jason, why are you such a skeez?

184
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,962
I'm just being friendly.

185
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,972
You were supposed
to call me last night.

186
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:12,302
Jason. You do not come to a party
at my house with Gretchen

187
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,003
and then scam on some poor, innocent
girl right in front of us three days later.

188
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,682
She's not interested.

189
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,145
Do you wanna have sex with him?

190
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,920
- No, thank you.
- Good. So it's settled.

191
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,714
So you can go shave your back now.

192
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,782
Bye, Jason.

193
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,823
Bitch.

194
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,861
Wait. Sit down.

195
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,859
Seriously, sit down.

196
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:39,798
Why don't I know you?

197
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,405
I'm new. I just moved here from Africa.

198
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,073
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.

199
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,642
Wait. What?

200
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,608
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.

201
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,281
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.

202
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,609
So you've actually never been
to a real school before?

203
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,777
Shut up.

204
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,087
Shut up.

205
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,192
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.

206
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,725
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.

207
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,396
But you're, like, really pretty.

208
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,823
- Thank you.
- So you agree.

209
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,762
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.

210
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,236
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.

211
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,272
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.

212
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,069
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.

213
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,645
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang. From England.

214
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,281
So if you're from Africa...

215
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,545
...why are you white?

216
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,915
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just
ask people why they're white.

217
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,613
Could you give us some privacy
for, like, one second?

218
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,622
Yeah, sure.

219
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,060
<i>What are you doing?</i>

220
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,958
OK, you should just know
that we don't do this a lot,

221
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,432
so this is, like, a really huge deal.

222
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,332
We wanna invite you
to have lunch with us

223
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,166
every day for the rest of the week.

224
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,308
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.

225
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,738
So we'll see you tomorrow.

226
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,209
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

227
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,615
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?

228
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,444
And then you have to tell me all
the horrible things that Regina says.

229
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,516
Regina seems sweet.

230
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,288
Regina George is not sweet.

231
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,050
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!

232
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,954
She's fabulous, but she's evil.

233
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,152
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.

234
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,194
I love your work!

235
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,195
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?

236
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,334
Regina. You seem to really hate her.

237
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,333
Yes. What's your question?

238
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,597
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor

239
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,674
- that Janis was...
- Damian! Shall we not?

240
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,538
Now, look. This isn't
about hating her, OK?

241
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,508
I just think that it would be, like,
a fun little experiment

242
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,274
if you were to hang out with them and
then tell us everything that they say.

243
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,542
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.

244
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,481
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?

245
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,247
Would you just do it? Please?

246
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,189
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?

247
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,156
- Yes.
- No.

248
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:46,423
<i>By eighth period, I was so happy
to get to math class.</i>

249
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,032
<i>I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.</i>

250
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,134
<i>Nothing in math class
could mess me up.</i>

251
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,504
Hey, do you have a pencil
I can borrow?

252
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,834
<i>I've only had one other
crush in my life.</i>

253
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,011
<i>His name was Nfume,
and we were 5.</i>

254
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,546
<i>It didn't work out.</i>

255
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,813
<i>But this one hit me like a big,
yellow school bus.</i>

256
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,080
<i>- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...</i>

257
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,723
So cute.

258
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:18,622
I mean, A-sub-N equals
N plus one over four.

259
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,297
That's right.

260
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,467
That's good. Very good.

261
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,499
All right, let's talk
about your homework.

262
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,432
Hey. How was your second day?

263
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,936
- Fine.
- Were people nice?

264
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,704
- No.
- Did you make any friends?

265
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,909
Yeah.

266
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,575
<i>Having lunch with The Plastics
was like leaving the actual world</i>

267
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,276
<i>and entering "Girl World".</i>

268
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,512
<i>And Girl World had a lot of rules.</i>

269
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,623
You can't wear a tank top
two days in a row,

270
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,521
and you can only wear your
hair in a ponytail once a week.

271
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,463
So I guess you picked today.

272
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,858
Oh, and we only wear jeans
or track pants on Fridays.

273
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,401
Now, if you break any of these rules,
you can't sit with us at lunch.

274
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,596
I mean, not just you. Like, any of us.

275
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,604
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,

276
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,073
I would be sitting over there
with the art freaks.

277
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,474
Oh, and we always vote before we ask
someone to eat lunch with us

278
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:13,480
because you have to be considerate
of the rest of the group.

279
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,879
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt
without asking your friends first

280
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,249
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?

281
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,421
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.

282
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:25,086
Like, you may think you like someone,
but you could be wrong.

283
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,460
A hundred and twenty calories and 48
calories from fat. What percent is that?

284
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,600
Forty-eight into 120?

285
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:33,430
I'm only eating foods with less than
30 percent calories from fat.

286
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,231
It's 40 percent.

287
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,603
Well, 48 over 120
equals X over 100,

288
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,142
and then you cross-multiply
and get the value of X.

289
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,942
Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.

290
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,414
So have you seen any guys
that you think are cute yet?

291
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,985
Well, there's this guy
in my calculus class...

292
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,021
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?

293
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,784
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!

294
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,963
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.

295
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,825
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.

296
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,261
They went out for a year.

297
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,832
Yeah, and then she was devastated

298
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,435
when he broke up
with her last summer.

299
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,762
I thought she dumped him
for Shane Oman.

300
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,635
OK, irregardless. Ex-boyfriends
are just off-limits to friends.

301
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:13,208
I mean, that's just, like,
the rules of feminism.

302
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,240
Don't worry. I'll never tell Regina
what you said.

303
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,281
It'll be our little secret.

304
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,456
We define the sum
of the infinite geometric series...

305
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,488
<i>Even though I wasn't
allowed to like Aaron,</i>

306
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,389
<i>I was still allowed to look at him.</i>

307
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,024
<i>And think about him.</i>

308
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,391
<i>And talk to him.</i>

309
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,331
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?

310
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,765
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor,

311
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,463
captain of the North Shore Mathletes.

312
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,803
We participate in math challenges
against other high schools in the state,

313
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,276
and we can get twice as much funding
if we've got a girl.

314
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,039
So you should think about joining.

315
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,740
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.

316
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,216
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.

317
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,988
OK, so think it over.

318
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,254
Because we'd like to get jackets.

319
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,621
OK.

320
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,672
Hey!

321
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,407
Get in, loser. We're going shopping.

322
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,008
<i>Regina's like the barbie doll
I never had.</i>

323
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,585
<i>I'd never seen anybody
so glamorous.</i>

324
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,017
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.

325
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,660
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.

326
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,090
- No! No, no.
- No, no.

327
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,856
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.

328
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,694
Damn, you are so lucky
you have us to guide you.

329
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,109
<i>Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of
reminded me of being home in Africa.</i>

330
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:01,615
<i>By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.</i>

331
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:10,991
Oh, my God, there's Jason!

332
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,892
Where? Oh, there he is.

333
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,930
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.

334
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:20,730
Wait. Jason's not going out
with Taylor.

335
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,271
No. He cannot blow you off like that.

336
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,740
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.

337
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,272
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

338
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,048
No.

339
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:37,016
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.

340
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,883
Not when you connect
from Information.

341
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,318
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

342
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:41,958
May I please speak
to Taylor Wedell?

343
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,787
She's not home yet. Who's calling?

344
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,963
Oh, this is Susan from
Planned Parenthood.

345
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,759
I have her test results. If you can have
her give me a call as soon as she can.

346
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,266
It's urgent. Thank you.

347
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,199
She's not going out with anyone.

348
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,967
OK, that was so fetch.

349
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,212
Mom.

350
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,695
Your house is really nice.

351
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,834
I know, right?

352
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,593
Make sure you check out
her mom's boob job.

353
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,965
They're hard as rocks.

354
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,704
I'm home! Hey, Kylie.

355
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,734
Hey.

356
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,707
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?

357
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,680
Hey, Mrs. George. This is Cady.

358
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,911
Hello, sweetheart.

359
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,624
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.

360
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,928
Just want you to know, if you need
anything, don't be shy, OK?

361
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,032
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.

362
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,828
I'm a cool mom. Right, Regina?

363
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,504
- Please stop talking.
- OK.

364
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,799
I'm gonna make you girls
a "hump day" treat.

365
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,075
This is your room?

366
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,514
It was my parents' room,
but I made them trade me.

367
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,221
Hey, put on 98.8.

368
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,360
Cady, do you even know
who sings this?

369
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,632
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.

370
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,094
She's like a Martian.

371
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,634
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please. I hate my calves.

372
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,533
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.

373
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
<i>I used to think there
was just fat and skinny.</i>

374
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,977
<i>Apparently, there's a lot of things
that can be wrong on your body.</i>

375
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,977
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.

376
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,479
My nail beds suck.

377
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,755
I have really bad breath
in the morning.

378
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,419
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!

379
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,857
Thanks.

380
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,600
Is there alcohol in this?

381
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,259
Oh, God, honey, no. What kind
of mother do you think I am?

382
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,668
Do you want a bit? If you're gonna
drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.

383
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,398
- No, thank you.
- OK.

384
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,070
So, you guys, what is the 411?

385
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,875
What has everybody been up to?

386
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,110
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.

387
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,447
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?

388
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,020
Mom.

389
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,624
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.

390
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,263
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.

391
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:37,161
Oh, my God, I remember this.

392
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,497
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.

393
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:41,933
It's our Burn Book.

394
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,971
See, we cut out girls' pictures
from the yearbook,

395
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,109
and then we wrote comments.

396
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,303
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.

397
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,972
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.

398
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,985
"Amber D'Alessio."
She made out with a hot dog.

399
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,290
"Janis lan, dyke."

400
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,490
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.

401
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,522
Yeah. He's almost too gay
to function.

402
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,459
That's funny. Put that in there.

403
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,831
<i>Oh, no. Maybe that was only OK
when Janis said it.</i>

404
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,640
And they have this Burn Book
where they write mean things

405
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,308
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?

406
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,838
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.

407
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,742
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No. Cady,

408
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,415
you gotta steal that book.

409
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,346
- No way!
- Oh, come on. We could publish it,

410
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,020
and then everybody would see
what an ax-wound she really is.

411
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,917
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.

412
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:36,116
Cady, there are two kinds
of evil people.

413
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,726
People who do evil stuff,

414
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,524
and people who see evil stuff
being done and don't try to stop it.

415
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,270
Does that mean I'm morally
obligated to burn that lady's outfit?

416
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,104
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.

417
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,739
I love seeing teachers
outside of school.

418
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,034
It's like seeing a dog
walk on its hind legs.

419
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,211
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.

420
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,973
Yeah, moderately priced soaps
are my calling.

421
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,081
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.

422
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,016
Joking. Sometimes older people
make jokes.

423
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,785
My nana takes her wig off
when she's drunk.

424
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,087
Your nana and I have that
in common.

425
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,993
No, actually, I'm just here because
I bartend a couple nights a week

426
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,929
down at P.J. Calamity's.

427
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,800
Cady, I hope you do
join Mathletes, you know,

428
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:21,369
because we start in a couple weeks

429
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,200
and I would love
to have a girl on the team,

430
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,706
just, you know, so the team
could meet a girl.

431
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,878
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.

432
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,343
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.

433
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,846
Thanks, Damian.

434
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,609
Well, this has been
sufficiently awkward.

435
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,755
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

436
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,549
- Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,922
Oh, man, that is bleak.

438
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,994
So when are you gonna
see Regina again?

439
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,261
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.

440
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:52,300
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.

441
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,231
- Hello?
- I know your secret.

442
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,670
<i>Oh, God, busted.</i>

443
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,107
<i>Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.</i>

444
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:02,904
Secret?
What are you saying about?

445
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,241
Gretchen told me
that you like Aaron Samuels.

446
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,645
I mean, I don't care,
do whatever you want.

447
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,184
But let me just tell you something
about Aaron:

448
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,722
All he cares about is school
and his mom and his friends.

449
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,190
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...

450
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,558
Whatever. I mean, I could talk
to him for you if you want.

451
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:23,632
Really? You would do that? I mean,
nothing embarrassing, though, right?

452
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,429
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.

453
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,865
But wait. Aren't you so mad
at Gretchen for telling me?

454
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,440
- No.
- Because if you are,

455
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,841
you can tell me. It was a really
bitchy thing for her to do.

456
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,016
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy,
but I'm not mad.

457
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,582
I mean, I guess she just
likes the attention.

458
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:42,412
See, Gretch? I told you
she's not mad at you.

459
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,178
I can't believe you think
I like attention!

460
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,085
OK, love you. See you tomorrow.

461
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,820
<i>I had survived my first
three-way calling attack.</i>

462
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,753
<i>And with Regina's blessing, I started
talking to Aaron more and more.</i>

463
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,430
<i>On October 3rd, he asked me
what day it was.</i>

464
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,393
It's October 3rd.

465
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,468
<i>Two weeks later, we spoke again.</i>

466
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,367
It's raining.

467
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,098
Yeah.

468
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,072
<i>But I wanted things to move faster.</i>

469
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,643
<i>So I followed my instincts.</i>

470
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,577
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?

471
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,011
<i>- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.</i>

472
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,083
<i>I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury
was talking about.</i>

473
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,255
It's a factorial, so you multiply
each one by N.

474
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,684
<i>Wrong.</i>

475
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,188
Is that the summation?

476
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,858
Yeah, they're the same thing.

477
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,927
<i>Wrong. He was so wrong.</i>

478
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,361
Thanks. I... I get it now.

479
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:33,230
Lights, please.
OK. See you guys tomorrow.

480
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,664
We're having a Halloween party
at my friend Chris' tonight.

481
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,143
You wanna come?

482
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,003
Yeah, sure.

483
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,443
Great. Here's where it is.

484
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,947
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.

485
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,751
OK.

486
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:52,081
That flier admits one person only,

487
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,383
so don't bring some
other guy with you.

488
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,418
"Grool."

489
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,359
I meant to say "cool"
and then I started to say "great".

490
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,690
Right. Well... grool.

491
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,933
See you tonight.

492
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,298
Hey, Africa. You staying
for the Mathletes meeting?

493
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,539
Yeah, I'll be right back.

494
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,113
<i>OK, I lied. But I had to go home
and work on my costume.</i>

495
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,642
<i>In the regular world, Halloween is
when children dress up in costumes</i>

496
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,184
<i>and beg for candy.</i>

497
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,948
<i>In Girl World, Halloween
is the one night a year</i>

498
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,749
<i>when a girl can dress
like a total slut</i>

499
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,927
<i>and no other girls can
say anything about it.</i>

500
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,959
<i>The hard-core girls just wear lingerie</i>

501
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,755
<i>and some form of animal ears.</i>

502
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,762
Doesn't she look great, honey?

503
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,802
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.

504
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,798
<i>Unfortunately, no one told
me about the slut rule.</i>

505
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,736
<i>So I showed up like this.</i>

506
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,175
Hey.

507
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,919
Yes! Yes!

508
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,352
Hey.

509
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,661
Why are you dressed so scary?

510
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,829
It's Halloween.

511
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,525
Have you seen Jason?

512
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,963
You know who's looking fine tonight?

513
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,198
Seth Mosakowski.

514
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:21,174
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What? He's a good kisser.

515
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,710
He's your cousin.

516
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,673
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.

517
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,051
- Right.
- So you have your cousins

518
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,912
and then you have your first cousins,

519
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,680
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.

520
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,722
That's not right, is it?

521
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,517
That is so not right.

522
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,718
- Hey!
- Hey.

523
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,396
You made it.

524
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,556
And you are... a zombie bride.

525
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,463
An "ex-wife".

526
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,695
Love it. Can I get you
something to drink?

527
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,372
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

528
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,303
Thanks.

529
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,400
Karen, stop it.

530
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,042
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!

531
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:01,980
Hey.

532
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,881
Oh, no.

533
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:05,419
Didn't anybody tell you?

534
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,181
You were supposed
to wear a costume.

535
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,527
Shut up. I need to talk to you.

536
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:13,094
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.

537
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:14,594
I invited her tonight.

538
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,367
Well, be careful because
she has a huge crush on you.

539
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,931
Really? How do you know?

540
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:23,401
Because she told me.

541
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,076
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.

542
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,939
She's like a little girl. She, like,
writes all over her notebook,

543
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,478
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."

544
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:33,146
And she made this T-shirt that says
"I heart Aaron"

545
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,182
and she wears it
under all her clothes.

546
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,616
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?

547
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,187
I mean, you're gorgeous.

548
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,417
And OK, look, I'm not saying
she's a stalker,

549
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,153
but she saved
this Kleenex you used

550
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,800
and she said she's gonna do
some kind of African voodoo with it

551
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,662
to make you like her.

552
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,464
What?

553
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,070
<i>This was it.</i>

554
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,643
<i>Regina said she would talk
to Aaron for me, and now she was.</i>

555
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:06,283
I know she's kind of socially retarded
and weird, but she's my friend,

556
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,112
so just promise me
you won't make fun of her.

557
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,878
Of course I'm not gonna
make fun of her.

558
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:13,149
<i>How could Janis hate Regina?</i>

559
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,416
<i>She was such a good...</i>

560
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:17,655
<i>Slut!</i>

561
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,759
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.

562
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,801
That's crazy. Why would
I break up with you?

563
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:32,202
You're so hot.

564
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,846
That's a scary mask, bro.

565
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,911
<i>I had never felt this feeling before.</i>

566
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,782
<i>I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.</i>

567
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,116
<i>My stomach felt like it was
going to fall out my butt.</i>

568
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,385
<i>I had this lump in my throat like
after you dry-swallow a big pill.</i>

569
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,325
<i>I hated Regina. I hated her!</i>

570
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,903
She took him back.

571
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:12,776
Regina took Aaron back.

572
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,177
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?

573
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,014
Because she's a life-ruiner.

574
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,951
She ruins people's lives.

575
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,251
When we were 13, she made
people sign this petition

576
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,325
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian! Please!

577
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,394
Look, she's not gonna get away
with this again, OK?

578
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:29,259
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?

579
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:33,126
Regina George is an evil dictator.

580
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,697
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?

581
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,307
You cut off her resources.

582
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,637
Regina would be nothing without
her high-status man candy...

583
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,738
...technically good physique...

584
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,612
...and ignorant band of loyal followers.

585
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,717
Now, Cady, if we want this to work,

586
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,325
you are gonna have to keep hanging
out with them like nothing is wrong.

587
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:58,154
Can you do it?

588
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,724
I can do it.

589
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,798
OK, let's rock this bitch.

590
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,361
<i>Pretending like nothing was wrong
turned out to be surprisingly easy.</i>

591
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,598
Regina wanted me to tell you that she
was trying to hook you up with Aaron,

592
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:13,003
but he was just interested
in getting her back.

593
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,542
And that's not Regina's fault.

594
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,077
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?

595
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,839
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.

596
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,747
Because Regina wanted me
to give you this.

597
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,657
It's called
the South Beach Fat Flush,

598
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:30,088
and all you drink is
cranberry juice for 72 hours.

599
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,522
This isn't even cranberry juice.

600
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,822
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.

601
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:37,125
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.

602
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:41,694
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.

603
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,998
Cady, will you please tell him
his hair looks sexy pushed back.

604
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,939
<i>Regina was dangling Aaron
in front of me on purpose.</i>

605
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,545
<i>I knew how this would be
settled in the animal world.</i>

606
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,486
<i>But this was Girl World.</i>

607
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,455
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.

608
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,456
<i>And in Girl World,
all the fighting had to be sneaky.</i>

609
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,261
All this cranberry juice
is making me break out.

610
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,104
Wait. I have this really good
skin stuff I'll bring you.

611
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,274
OK.

612
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:21,175
<i>We kept our eyes open
for opportunities for sabotage.</i>

613
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,316
Regina.

614
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,010
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

615
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,926
- Hey.
- Hey.

616
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,161
Your face smells like peppermint.

617
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,068
<i>This is ass, you guys.</i>

618
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,470
It's been a month, and all we've done
is make Regina's face smell like a foot.

619
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:24,902
I've been really busy with choir.

620
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,667
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.

621
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:28,606
We crack Gretchen,
and then we crack the lock

622
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,508
on Regina's whole dirty history.

623
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,239
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.

624
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,441
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.

625
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,120
I have to go to Regina's
to practice for the talent show.

626
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:40,188
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."

627
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,619
You guys know that song?

628
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,317
Everybody in the English-speaking
world knows that song.

629
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:46,155
They do it every year.

630
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,264
Well, I have to learn it.

631
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,161
Go.

632
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,335
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?

633
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,936
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.

634
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,972
She just, you know, came up to me
and started talking to me about crack.

635
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,073
She's so pathetic.

636
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,702
Let me tell you something
about Janis lan.

637
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:04,437
We were best friends
in middle school.

638
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,876
I know, right?

639
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,916
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even... Whatever.

640
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,714
So then in eighth grade, I started
going out with my first boyfriend,

641
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,948
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous,
but then he moved to Indiana.

642
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,559
And Janis was, like,
weirdly jealous of him.

643
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,923
Like, if I would blow her off
to hang out with Kyle,

644
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,122
she'd be like,
"Why didn't you call me back?"

645
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,200
And I'd be like, "Why are you
so obsessed with me?"

646
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,167
So then, for my birthday party,
which was an all-girls pool party,

647
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:32,308
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you,
because I think you're a lesbian."

648
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,910
I mean, I couldn't
have a lesbian at my party.

649
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:37,171
There are gonna be girls there
in their bathing suits.

650
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,871
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.

651
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,410
So then her mom called my mom
and started yelling at her.

652
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,984
It was so retarded.

653
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,451
And then she dropped out of school
because no one would talk to her.

654
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,556
When she came back
in the fall for high school,

655
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,249
all of her hair was cut off
and she was totally weird,

656
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,792
and now I guess she's on crack.

657
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,295
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.

658
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:57,228
Where did you get it?

659
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,993
It was my mom's in the '80s.

660
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,598
Vintage. So adorable.

661
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,501
Thanks.

662
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:06,235
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt
I've ever seen.

663
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,473
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?

664
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,614
So are you gonna send
any candy canes?

665
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,084
No. I don't send them,
I just get them.

666
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,955
So you better send me one, byotch.

667
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:22,386
Love you.

668
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,294
<i>I was definitely sending her one.</i>

669
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,124
<i>I was gonna use three candy canes
to crack Gretchen Wieners.</i>

670
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,560
Three, please.

671
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,430
"Why, Man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus"

672
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,298
might translate into

673
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,872
"Why is he so huge
and obnoxious?"

674
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:43,941
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.

675
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,776
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.

676
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,474
Glenn Cocco?

677
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:52,383
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.

678
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,649
And Cady Heron.

679
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,156
Do we have a Cady Heron here?

680
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,885
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.

681
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,497
One for you. And none
for Gretchen Wieners. Bye.

682
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:05,796
Who's that from?

683
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,597
"Thanks for being such
a great friend. Love, Regina."

684
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,467
That's so sweet.

685
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,174
OK, back to Caesar.

686
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,545
<i>Once Gretchen thought
Regina was mad at her,</i>

687
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,543
<i>the secrets started pouring out.</i>

688
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,773
<i>All I had to do was wait for one
we could use.</i>

689
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,451
Thank you.

690
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,147
Welcome to the North Shore
High School winter talent show.

691
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,019
Let me hear you make some noise.

692
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,159
All right, settle down.

693
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,967
Our first act calls himself
a star on the rise.

694
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,434
Let's hear it for Damian.

695
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,245
Don't look at me.

696
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:55,051
<i>Every day is so wonderful</i>

697
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,547
I mean, why would Regina send
you guys candy canes and not me?

698
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,224
Maybe she forgot about you.

699
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,290
Yeah, Regina has been acting
kind of weird lately.

700
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,189
I mean, is something bothering her?

701
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,559
Well, I mean, her parents totally
don't sleep in the same bed anymore,

702
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,028
if that's what you mean.

703
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,528
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.

704
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:18,606
<i>I am beautiful in every single way</i>

705
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,079
<i>Yes, words can't bring me down</i>

706
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,068
<i>Yes, words can't bring me down</i>

707
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:27,211
<i>Don't you bring me down today</i>

708
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,579
I mean, no offense,

709
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,414
but why would she send
you a candy cane?

710
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,055
She doesn't even
like you that much.

711
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,319
Maybe she feels weird around me

712
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,791
because I'm the only person
that knows about her nose job.

713
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,530
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,467
<i>Yo, yo, yo</i>

715
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:48,536
<i>All you sucker MCs
Ain't got nothing on me</i>

716
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,730
<i>From my grades to my lines
You can't touch Kevin G</i>

717
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,068
<i>I'm a Mathlete
So nerd is inferred</i>

718
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,302
<i>but forget what you heard
I'm like James bond the Third</i>

719
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,207
<i>Shaken not stirred
I'm Kevin Gnapoor</i>

720
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:59,109
<i>The G is silent
When I sneak in your door</i>

721
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,307
<i>And make love to your woman
On the bathroom floor</i>

722
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:03,577
<i>I don't play it like Shaggy
You'll know it was me</i>

723
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:05,846
<i>because the next time you see her
She'll be like</i>

724
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,957
<i>- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.</i>

725
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,683
Happy holidays, everybody.

726
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,195
K.G. And the Power of Three.

727
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,832
That was something.

728
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:24,006
Does it bother you that they still
use your original choreography?

729
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,436
Shut up.

730
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,270
Damn.

731
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,102
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there

732
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,541
shaking that thing.

733
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,779
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.

734
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,951
But I'm always on your left.

735
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,351
That was when there were three of us,
and now the tallest go in the middle.

736
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:42,718
But the whole dance
will be backwards.

737
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,450
I'm always on your left.

738
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,631
And right now you're getting
on my last nerve. Switch.

739
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,201
And finally,
please welcome to the stage

740
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,395
Santa's Helpers doing
"Jingle Bell Rock".

741
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,518
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock</i>

742
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,282
<i>Jingle bells swing
And jingle bells ring</i>

743
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,824
<i>Snowing and blowing
Up bushels of fun</i>

744
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:22,089
<i>Now the jingle hop has begun</i>

745
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:25,700
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock</i>

746
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,566
<i>Jingle bells chime
In jingle bell time</i>

747
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:33,709
<i>Dancing and prancing
In Jingle bell Square</i>

748
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,242
<i>In the fr...</i>

749
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,584
Jason?

750
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:55,029
<i>What a bright time
It's the right time</i>

751
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,065
<i>To rock the night away</i>

752
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:03,469
<i>Jingle bell time
Is a swell time</i>

753
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,939
<i>To go riding in a one-horse sleigh</i>

754
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,580
<i>Giddyap jingle horse
Pick up your feet</i>

755
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,148
<i>Jingle around the clock</i>

756
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,980
<i>Mix and mingle in a jingling beat</i>

757
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,883
<i>That's the jingle bell</i>

758
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,580
<i>That's the jingle bell</i>

759
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,091
<i>That's the jingle bell rock</i>

760
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,071
That was the best it ever went!

761
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,337
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.

762
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,939
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.

763
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,485
Cady's blushing. Oh, my God.

764
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:51,051
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.

765
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,984
That's why you wanted
to join the Mathletes.

766
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,851
Mathletes? You hate math.

767
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,685
Look how red she is.

768
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,124
You love him. And he totally
complimented you.

769
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,956
That is so fetch.

770
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,696
Gretchen, stop trying
to make "fetch" happen.

771
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,368
It's not going to happen.

772
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:13,039
"Why should Caesar get to stomp
around like a giant

773
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:17,179
"while the rest of us try not to get
smushed under his big feet?

774
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,973
"What's so great about Caesar?

775
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,844
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.

776
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,678
"OK, Brutus is just
as smart as Caesar.

777
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:25,252
"People totally like Brutus just
as much as they like Caesar.

778
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:26,945
"And when did it become
OK for one person

779
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,419
"to be the boss of everybody?

780
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,092
"Because that's not
what Rome is about!

781
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,092
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"

782
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:37,128
<i>Gretchen Wieners had cracked.</i>

783
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,630
OK, if you even knew how mean
she really is.

784
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:45,232
You know that I'm not allowed
to wear hoop earrings, right?

785
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,570
Yeah. Two years ago, she told me
that hoop earrings were her thing

786
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,474
and that I wasn't allowed
to wear them anymore.

787
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:53,009
And then for my Hanukkah,
my parents got me this pair

788
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,981
of really expensive white-gold hoops.

789
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:59,087
And I had to pretend
like I didn't even like them,

790
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,751
and it was so sad.

791
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,949
And you know she cheats on Aaron?

792
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,355
Yes. Every Thursday he thinks
she's doing SAT prep.

793
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:08,292
But really, she's hooking up with
Shane Oman in the projection room

794
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:10,193
above the auditorium,

795
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,698
and I never told anybody that,
because...

796
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,361
...l'm such a good friend.

797
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,508
<i>Jackpot. Gretchen's secret
had put the plan back in motion.</i>

798
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,578
<i>After Christmas break,
we tried every Thursday</i>

799
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,908
<i>to help Aaron catch Regina
in the act.</i>

800
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,810
Hey.

801
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,507
Hey, what's up?

802
00:42:01,718 --> 00:42:03,276
My purse!

803
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,782
Looks like he's headed
for the projection room

804
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,616
above the auditorium!

805
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,132
Coach Carr?

806
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,099
Trang Pak?

807
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:22,773
Guys, why did we think
we could do this? We're amateurs.

808
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,536
Guys, why did we think
we could do this? We're amateurs.

809
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:27,369
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.

810
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,204
What are Klteen bars?

811
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,313
They're these weird
Swedish nutrition bars.

812
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,450
My mom used to give them to the kids
in Africa to help them gain weight.

813
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:41,422
They're these weird nutrition bars
my mom uses to lose weight.

814
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,320
Give me it.

815
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,631
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.

816
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,260
Yeah, you know, there's some
weird ingredient in them

817
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,231
that's not legal in the U.S. Yet.

818
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,337
- Ephedrine?
- No.

819
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,666
- Phentermine.
- No.

820
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,610
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.

821
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:05,312
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.

822
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,016
Oh, my God,
what are you talking about?

823
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,480
You're so skinny.

824
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,051
Shut up.

825
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,449
<i>The weird thing about
hanging out with Regina</i>

826
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,420
<i>was that I could hate her,
and at the same time,</i>

827
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:16,956
<i>I still wanted her to like me.</i>

828
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,526
OK. You have really
good eyebrows.

829
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,357
- Thanks.
- Move.

830
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:24,292
<i>Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her,</i>

831
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,662
<i>the more Gretchen
tried to win Regina back.</i>

832
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,270
<i>She knew it was better to be
in The Plastics, hating life</i>

833
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,134
<i>than to not be in at all.</i>

834
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,544
<i>Because being with The Plastics
was like being famous.</i>

835
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,340
<i>People looked at you all the time,</i>

836
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,810
<i>and everybody
just knew stuff about you.</i>

837
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,177
That new girl
moved here from Africa.

838
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,785
I saw Cady Heron wearing
Army pants and flip-flops,

839
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:46,547
so I bought Army pants
and flip-flops.

840
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,281
That Cady girl is hot.

841
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,460
She might even be hotter
than Regina George.

842
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,390
I hear Regina George
is dating Aaron Samuels again.

843
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,464
The two were seen canoodling
at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.

844
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:58,896
<i>They've been inseparable ever since.</i>

845
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,912
<i>I was a woman possessed.</i>

846
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,776
<i>I spent about 80 percent
of my time talking about Regina.</i>

847
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,315
<i>And the other 20 percent
of the time,</i>

848
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,214
<i>I was praying for someone
else to bring her up</i>

849
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,218
<i>so I could talk about her more.</i>

850
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,618
She's not even that good-looking
if you really look at her.

851
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,725
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter,

852
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,360
she's got pretty big jugs.

853
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,154
<i>I could hear people
getting bored with me.</i>

854
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,800
<i>But I couldn't stop. It just kept
coming up like word vomit.</i>

855
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,534
I have this theory that if you cut all her
hair off, she'd look like a British man.

856
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,707
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.

857
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,503
Hey, I'm having an art show.

858
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,768
So why don't you take
a night off from your double life.

859
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:44,378
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.

860
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,277
What is that smell?

861
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,315
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.

862
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,419
You smell like a baby prostitute.

863
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:52,883
Thanks.

864
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,556
<i>Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse
I could to talk to Aaron.</i>

865
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,389
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?

866
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,628
Nice job, Cady.

867
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,894
Kind of seems like you get it.

868
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,899
<i>If I was gonna keep this going,
I was gonna have to really commit.</i>

869
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,074
Not your best.

870
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,970
Damn, Africa, what happened?

871
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:18,875
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.

872
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:20,674
You know, I think I need a tutor.

873
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,353
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get
together after school or something.

874
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,317
Do you think Regina would mind?

875
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,081
No. You guys are friends.

876
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,785
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.

877
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:35,526
So, what did you get for this one?

878
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,529
Well, the first time I did it,
I got a zero.

879
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,567
<i>- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got...</i>

880
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,294
<i>...one.
- There you go.</i>

881
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,098
I got one too.

882
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,266
Yeah, you have to check it
because sometimes the product

883
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:49,968
of two negative integers
is a positive number.

884
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,642
Yeah, like negative four
and negative six.

885
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:55,978
That's right. That's good.

886
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,279
Well, you're a good tutor.

887
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,997
Man, look, I... I can't do this.

888
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,965
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?

889
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,867
Look, I know she can be really
mean sometimes, but...

890
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:18,973
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?

891
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,238
Look, there's good and bad
to everybody. Right?

892
00:46:21,444 --> 00:46:23,139
Regina's just...

893
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:26,179
<i>- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no. It was coming up.</i>

894
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,112
<i>The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...</i>

895
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,081
She's cheating on you!

896
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:33,688
What?

897
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,559
Did he say why?

898
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,664
Somebody told him
about Shane Oman.

899
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,564
Who?

900
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,258
He said some guy
on the baseball team.

901
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,596
Baseball team?

902
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:52,206
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.

903
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,933
You wanna do something fun?

904
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,336
You wanna go to Taco Bell?

905
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:59,879
I can't go to Taco Bell,
I'm on an all-carb diet.

906
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,916
God, Karen, you are so stupid!

907
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,609
Regina, wait. Talk to me.

908
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,915
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.

909
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,950
You're not stupid, Karen.

910
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,355
No. I am, actually.

911
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:14,757
I'm failing almost everything.

912
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,899
Well, there must be something
you're good at.

913
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,465
I can put my whole fist
in my mouth.

914
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,898
Wanna see?

915
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,936
No. That's OK.

916
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,402
Anything else?

917
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:28,240
I'm kind of psychic.

918
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,310
I have a fifth sense.

919
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,380
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.

920
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,217
My breasts can always tell
when it's gonna rain.

921
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:42,249
Really? That's amazing.

922
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,128
Well, they can tell when it's raining.

923
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,964
<i>I have to admit,
I was mildly horrified</i>

924
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:54,466
<i>when Aaron didn't immediately
ask me to be his girlfriend.</i>

925
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,901
<i>I mean, I know he was sad,
but how much time did he need?</i>

926
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,597
<i>Regina had moved on.</i>

927
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,777
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?

928
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,679
A condom?

929
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,318
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.

930
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,248
<i>But overall, the plan
was going pretty well.</i>

931
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:13,581
<i>Aaron had dumped Regina,
and she was unknowingly</i>

932
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,451
<i>eating 5,000 calories a day.</i>

933
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,718
<i>It was time to turn our attention
to the army of skanks.</i>

934
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:22,132
<i>And finally, the nominees for
Spring Fling Queen are as follows:</i>

935
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,963
<i>And finally, the nominees for
Spring Fling Queen are as follows:</i>

936
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,529
Regina George.

937
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,096
<i>Gretchen Wieners.</i>

938
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,370
<i>Janis lan.</i>

939
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,371
What is happening to the world?

940
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,513
<i>And the final nominee...</i>

941
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,206
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.

942
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,646
<i>... is Cady Heron.</i>

943
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:45,820
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.

944
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,649
I didn't put you in there.

945
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,950
You mean I'm really nominated?

946
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,457
<i>In January, Regina had put
a Spring Fling dress on hold</i>

947
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:58,190
<i>at a store called 1-3-5.</i>

948
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,392
<i>But being Plastic,
she needed our advice</i>

949
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:01,831
<i>before she could actually buy it.</i>

950
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:03,733
Can someone zip me up?

951
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,169
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.

952
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,006
OK, it must be marked wrong.

953
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,081
Cady, all I've been eating are
these Klteen bars. They suck.

954
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,445
No, no, this is just how they work.

955
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,018
This is all your water weight.

956
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,849
First you bloat, and then you
drop 10 pounds like that:

957
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:23,956
Well, the Klteen bars
have burned up all your carbs,

958
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,889
and now your body's
just running on water.

959
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,155
But once the water's gone,
then you'll be all muscle.

960
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,060
It explains it all on the label.

961
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,699
You know Swedish?

962
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,529
Yeah, everyone in Africa
can read Swedish.

963
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,164
Ma'am, do you have this
in the next size up?

964
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:40,275
Sorry. We only carry
sizes 1, 3 and 5.

965
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,705
You could try Sears.

966
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,351
Cady.

967
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:58,618
I need your parents to sign this
so they know that you're failing.

968
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,523
Failing?

969
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,630
You know what's weird
about your quizzes, Cady,

970
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:05,596
is that all the work is right
and just the answers are wrong.

971
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,164
- Really?
- Really.

972
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:10,236
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend

973
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,273
may seem like the most important
thing in the world right now,

974
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:16,104
but you don't have to dumb yourself
down to get guys to like you.

975
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:17,904
<i>- How would you know?
- I know,</i>

976
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:20,082
"How would I know", right?

977
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,377
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.

978
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:26,612
The only guy that ever calls my house
is Randy from Chase Visa.

979
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,418
And you know why?

980
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,185
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.

981
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:34,158
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.

982
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,628
I pushed myself
into working three jobs.

983
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,232
And now I'm gonna push you

984
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,335
because I know
you're smarter than this.

985
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,664
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do

986
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:44,237
for extra credit, please let me know.

987
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,806
Oh, I will.

988
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,741
I hate her! I mean, she's totally
failing me on purpose

989
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,572
because I didn't join
those stupid Mathletes!

990
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,008
She was so queer.

991
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,809
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."

992
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,113
What does that even mean?

993
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,311
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.

994
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:01,046
She said she works three jobs.

995
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:02,815
You know, I bet she sells drugs
on the side

996
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,254
to pay for her pathetic divorce.

997
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,326
You let it out, honey.

998
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:08,497
Put it in the book.

999
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,330
<i>I know it may look
like I'd become a bitch,</i>

1000
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,972
<i>but that's only because
I was acting like a bitch.</i>

1001
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:20,870
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?

1002
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,011
Oh, I got busy. Sorry.

1003
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,704
So you need a ride to my art show
this weekend?

1004
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,510
No. I have to go to Madison
with my parents.

1005
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,242
I'm so sorry.

1006
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:32,045
Well, you wanna
watch a movie tonight?

1007
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,452
Can't. I'm doing major
Plastic sabotage tonight.

1008
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,183
But we don't have anything
planned for tonight.

1009
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,624
Oh, I planned this one on my own.

1010
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,058
Love you. Bye.

1011
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:46,262
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her

1012
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:48,096
because she's running
for Spring Fling Queen.

1013
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:51,364
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.

1014
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:53,599
I think somebody nominated her
as a joke or something.

1015
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,870
And when nobody votes for her,
she's gonna have a total meltdown.

1016
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,378
And who's gonna have
to take care of her? Me.

1017
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:02,949
So you don't think
anyone will vote for her?

1018
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:04,915
Cady, she's not pretty.

1019
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,248
I mean, that sounds bad,
but whatever.

1020
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,516
The Spring Fling Queen
is always pretty.

1021
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,785
And the crazy thing is
is that it should be Karen,

1022
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,589
but people forget about her
because she's such a slut.

1023
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:16,822
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.

1024
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,302
Well, she's not mad at you.

1025
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:25,133
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?

1026
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,474
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad

1027
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,379
about you, you'd want me
to tell you, right?

1028
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,018
- No.
- What if it was someone

1029
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,655
you thought was your friend?

1030
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,848
What are you...?
Hold on. Other line.

1031
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,050
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.

1032
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:46,694
- Hello?
- Let's go out.

1033
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,989
OK. Hold on. I'm on the other
line with Gretchen.

1034
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:51,564
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.

1035
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,395
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.

1036
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,732
It's Regina.

1037
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,703
She wants to hang out with me
tonight, but she told me not to tell you.

1038
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:00,535
Do not hang out with her.

1039
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:03,337
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.

1040
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:05,070
You can tell me. Hold on.

1041
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:09,149
Oh, my God,
she's so annoying.

1042
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,580
Who is?

1043
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,812
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.

1044
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,081
Right. Hold on.

1045
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,963
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know. Just get rid of her.

1046
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,060
OK. What is it?

1047
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,168
Regina says everyone hates you
because you're such a slut.

1048
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,495
She said that?

1049
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,469
You didn't hear it from me.

1050
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:35,238
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever. She has a right to know.

1051
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,242
I can't go out.

1052
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,480
I'm sick.

1053
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:41,673
Boo. You whore.

1054
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:49,086
Regina,

1055
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,589
we have to talk to you.

1056
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,488
Is butter a carb?

1057
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,293
Yes.

1058
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:57,159
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.

1059
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,595
It's Monday.

1060
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:01,394
- So?
- So that's against the rules

1061
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,094
and you can't sit with us.

1062
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,871
Whatever. Those rules aren't real.

1063
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,606
They were real
that day I wore a vest.

1064
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,803
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!

1065
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:21,485
These sweatpants are all
that fits me right now.

1066
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,428
Fine.

1067
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:31,623
You can walk home, bitches.

1068
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,430
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!

1069
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,572
<i>Gretchen and Karen followed me
around all afternoon.</i>

1070
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,012
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?

1071
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:49,878
Oh, I have to go to Madison
with my parents.

1072
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,045
What...?

1073
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,847
We have tickets for this thing.

1074
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,048
- What?
- What?

1075
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,557
<i>Was I the new queen bee?</i>

1076
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,194
I can try and get out of it.

1077
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1078
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:05,832
Because I told my friend Janis
I'd go to her art show.

1079
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:08,026
We've had these tickets for months.

1080
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:10,228
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

1081
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,908
But she's my friend,
and I made her a promise.

1082
00:55:13,342 --> 00:55:16,072
I think Cady's old enough
to spend one night on her own.

1083
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,710
<i>I had learned how to control
everyone around me.</i>

1084
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:26,519
Hey. I'm having a small get-together
at my house tomorrow night.

1085
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,717
- Is Regina going?
- No. Do you think I'm an idiot?

1086
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,416
No, it's just gonna be
a few cool people,

1087
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:33,060
and you better be
one of them, byotch.

1088
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,696
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.

1089
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,889
I love that shirt on you.

1090
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,567
<i>Aaron Samuels was going to be
in my house at my party.</i>

1091
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,607
<i>Everything had to be perfect.</i>

1092
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:54,772
<i>And this time when Aaron saw me,</i>

1093
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,544
<i>I wouldn't be caught
in some ridiculous costume.</i>

1094
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,449
Hey, guys.

1095
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,586
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!

1096
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,225
I know, right?

1097
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,520
OK, so I got enough cheese
and crackers for eight people.

1098
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:08,458
Do you think that's enough?

1099
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,495
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1100
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,292
OK.

1101
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:17,333
<i>It was not enough.</i>

1102
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,100
<i>Somehow, the word had gotten out
about my small get-together.</i>

1103
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:22,334
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.

1104
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,342
He's just using her
to make you mad.

1105
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,107
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.

1106
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:31,649
Dude, put on
"The Ramayana Monkey Chant".

1107
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,555
- Do I know you?
- Deek! What up, dog?

1108
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:52,469
She thinks she's gonna have
a party and not invite me?

1109
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,540
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.

1110
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,235
I, like, invented her,
you know what I mean?

1111
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,322
Jason.

1112
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:09,013
I have to talk to you.

1113
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,660
Whatever.

1114
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,755
- I love you.
- I know, I know.

1115
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,331
Hey! Put that down!

1116
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,267
<i>Was Aaron blowing me off?</i>

1117
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:37,975
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.

1118
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,882
<i>- Oh, no.
- Look,</i>

1119
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:43,525
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but I only date women of color.

1120
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,059
I have to pee.

1121
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,599
Get out.

1122
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

1123
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:47,987
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1124
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,487
Me too.

1125
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:53,561
You look...

1126
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,494
- New clothes?
- Thanks.

1127
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,131
You wanna go downstairs?

1128
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,667
No, no. Let's stay here.

1129
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,331
Thanks for getting me
to come out tonight.

1130
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:07,770
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1131
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,946
I wasted too much time
being pissed off at Regina.

1132
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,637
No more liars.

1133
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:14,679
I would never lie to you.

1134
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,647
I know, I know.

1135
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:18,251
Although...

1136
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,786
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once,

1137
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,117
but you're totally gonna laugh
when I tell you, so...

1138
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,953
Tell me what?

1139
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,127
I pretended to be bad at math
so that you'd help me.

1140
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,392
But the thing is,
I'm not really bad at math.

1141
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:35,536
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.

1142
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,266
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?

1143
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,107
Wait. You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.

1144
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:43,972
No. Not on purpose.
Just, you know...

1145
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,738
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.

1146
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:47,575
So why didn't you just talk to me?

1147
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:49,717
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.

1148
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,477
Because you were her property...

1149
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:53,814
- Her property?
- No. Shut up. Not her property...

1150
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,513
No, don't tell me to shut up.

1151
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,386
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?

1152
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,455
You are just like a clone of Regina.

1153
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,325
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...

1154
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:07,866
<i>Oh, no. It was coming up again.
Word vomit. No, wait a minute...</i>

1155
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,868
<i>- What is this?!
- Actual vomit.</i>

1156
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,608
Aaron!

1157
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:17,970
Aaron, wait! Just...

1158
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,975
OK. Call me.

1159
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,783
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.

1160
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:31,823
I'm sorry. I can explain.

1161
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,258
Explain how you forgot
to invite us to your party?

1162
01:00:34,463 --> 01:00:35,794
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.

1163
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:38,899
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.

1164
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:41,126
Hey, buddy, you're not
pretending anymore.

1165
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:44,306
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.

1166
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,436
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.

1167
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,337
Did you have an awesome time?

1168
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,672
Did you drink awesome shooters
and listen to awesome music,

1169
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,679
and then just sit around and soak up
each other's awesomeness?

1170
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:56,215
You're the one who made me like this

1171
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,751
so you could use me
for your eighth-grade revenge.

1172
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:01,787
God! See, at least me and
Regina George know we're mean.

1173
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,394
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa

1174
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,586
"with all the little birdies
and the little monkeys."

1175
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,596
You know what? It's not my fault
you're in love with me or something!

1176
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,393
- What?!
- Oh, no she did not!

1177
01:01:13,602 --> 01:01:15,763
See? That is the thing
with you Plastics.

1178
01:01:15,971 --> 01:01:18,439
You think that everybody
is in love with you,

1179
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,768
when actually, everybody hates you.

1180
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:22,739
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.

1181
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,776
He broke up with Regina
and guess what.

1182
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,572
He still doesn't want you.

1183
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:29,945
So why are you still messing
with Regina, Cady? I'll tell you why.

1184
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:33,713
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!

1185
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:37,820
Here. You can have this.
It won a prize.

1186
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,494
And I want my pink shirt back!

1187
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,394
I want my pink shirt back!

1188
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:00,881
Hon, slow down.

1189
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,643
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.

1190
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,254
Why are you eating a Klteen bar?

1191
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:08,855
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.

1192
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,494
Coach Carr makes us eat those when
we wanna move up a weight class.

1193
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,325
What?

1194
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,532
They make you gain weight like crazy.

1195
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:21,532
Mother...

1196
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:52,999
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch

1197
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:57,468
I've ever met.

1198
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:06,308
Do not trust her. She is a fugly slut!

1199
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:31,638
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.

1200
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,137
Is this true?

1201
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,503
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?

1202
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,571
Good Lord.

1203
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,273
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?

1204
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:44,145
Fat whore.

1205
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,349
OK, calm down, Miss George.

1206
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:53,519
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.

1207
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,328
Don't worry, we're gonna
find out who did it.

1208
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,092
There's only three girls
in the whole school who aren't in it.

1209
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,627
At your age, you're gonna
be having a lot of urges.

1210
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:06,035
You're gonna want to take off
your clothes and touch each other.

1211
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:10,777
But if you do touch each other,
you will get chlamydia. And die.

1212
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,379
Coach Carr.

1213
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,219
Cady Heron, they wanna see you
in the principal's office.

1214
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:24,919
All right, chlamydia. K-L-A...

1215
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:29,664
In here, Miss Heron.

1216
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,134
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.

1217
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,105
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1218
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,982
I mean, yes, I've seen it before,
but it's not mine.

1219
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:51,880
You better get your story straight,
Miss Heron,

1220
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:53,850
because I'm not messing
around here.

1221
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,751
It's not ours, it's Regina's.

1222
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:59,688
Yeah, she's trying to make it look
like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.

1223
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:06,130
Miss Wieners, why would Regina
refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?

1224
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,433
Miss Smith, this is no time
to be laughing.

1225
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,835
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this right now.

1226
01:05:32,294 --> 01:05:35,752
Maybe we're not in that book,
because everybody likes us.

1227
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:38,228
And I don't wanna be punished
for being well-liked.

1228
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:42,498
And I don't think my father,
the inventor of Toaster Strudel,

1229
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,673
would be too pleased
to hear about this.

1230
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,909
"Made out with a hot dog"?

1231
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,053
Oh, my God, that was one time!

1232
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:05,589
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?

1233
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,523
Who wouldn't write that?

1234
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:10,990
"Trang Pak made out
with Coach Carr"?

1235
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,758
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.

1236
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:23,611
Hey! Hey! Settle down!
All right, hey.

1237
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:26,713
No. You do not push and sh...

1238
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,226
Do you have anything else
you wanna say?

1239
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,762
No, I can't answer any
more questions

1240
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:45,627
until I have a parent
or lawyer present.

1241
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,097
Miss Smith?

1242
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:52,765
Whoever wrote it probably didn't
think anyone would ever see it?

1243
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,409
I hope that nobody else
ever does see it.

1244
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,413
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.

1245
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,924
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.

1246
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,891
- "Too gay to function"?!
- Hey!

1247
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,156
That's only OK when I say it.

1248
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,233
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!

1249
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,098
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!

1250
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,398
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!

1251
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,445
Yeah! Take your top off!

1252
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,609
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!

1253
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,150
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.

1254
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,490
<i>It was full-tilt jungle madness.</i>

1255
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,936
<i>And it wasn't going away.</i>

1256
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:04,004
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.

1257
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:07,011
Coach Carr, step away
from the underage girls.

1258
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,454
Let me help you down there.

1259
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:17,717
Hell, no! I did not leave
the Southside for this!

1260
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,690
Oh, crap! My hair!

1261
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:29,428
All junior girls report to the gymnasium
immediately! Lmmediately!

1262
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:36,000
<i>Have you ever walked up to people</i>

1263
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,509
<i>and realized they were just
talking about you?</i>

1264
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,779
<i>Have you ever had it happen
60 times in a row?</i>

1265
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:45,778
<i>I have.</i>

1266
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:09,243
Never in my 14 years as an educator
have I seen such behavior.

1267
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,443
And from young ladies.

1268
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,916
I got parents calling me on the phone
asking, "Did someone get shot?"

1269
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,152
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.

1270
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,581
No!

1271
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,083
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?

1272
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,458
Now, I'm not gonna do that,
because we've already paid the DJ.

1273
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:27,923
But don't think that I'm not taking
this book seriously.

1274
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,231
Coach Carr has fled school property.

1275
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,233
Ms. Norbury has been
accused of selling drugs.

1276
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,935
Now, what the young ladies
in this grade need

1277
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,165
is an attitude makeover.

1278
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,942
And you're gonna get it right now.

1279
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:47,013
I don't care how long it takes,
I will keep you here all night.

1280
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:48,614
We can't keep them past 4.

1281
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,047
I will keep you here until 4.

1282
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,389
Now, what we're gonna try to do
is fix the way you young ladies

1283
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,081
relate to each other.

1284
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,852
OK? Lady to lady.

1285
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:03,054
So who has a lady problem
that they'd like to talk about?

1286
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:08,233
Yes?

1287
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,668
Somebody wrote in that book
that I'm lying about being a virgin

1288
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:13,898
because I use super-jumbo tampons.

1289
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,977
But I can't help it if I've got
a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.

1290
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,712
Yeah, I can't do this.

1291
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,345
Ms. Norbury.

1292
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:27,316
You're a successful, intelligent,
caring, graceful woman.

1293
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:28,851
I am?

1294
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:31,287
There has to be something
you can say to these young ladies.

1295
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,427
Something to help them
with their self-esteem?

1296
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:35,023
It's not a self-esteem problem.

1297
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:37,755
I think they're all pretty
pleased with themselves.

1298
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:41,196
OK.

1299
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:46,464
OK. Everybody close your eyes.

1300
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,403
I want you to raise your hand
if you have ever had a girl

1301
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:53,740
say something bad
about you behind your back.

1302
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,649
Open your eyes.

1303
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:00,878
Now, close your eyes again.

1304
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:03,887
And this time, I want you to raise
your hand if you have ever

1305
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:06,652
said anything about a friend
behind her back.

1306
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,332
Open them.

1307
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,403
There's been some
girl-on-girl crime here.

1308
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:26,208
OK. So, what we could do today
is a couple exercises to help you

1309
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,316
express your anger in a healthy way.

1310
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,549
Let's start over here.

1311
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:33,550
<i>Ms. Norbury had us confront
each other directly</i>

1312
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:35,222
<i>about the things
that were bothering us.</i>

1313
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,449
<i>And it seemed like every clique
had its own problems.</i>

1314
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:40,560
You've been acting really stuck-up
ever since you switched to shortfielder.

1315
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:42,525
And Dawn agrees with me.

1316
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,358
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,

1317
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,863
I'm pitching tomorrow.

1318
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,733
OK. Good.

1319
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:59,613
Can I just say that we don't have
a clique problem at this school?

1320
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,545
And some of us shouldn't have to take
this workshop, because some of us

1321
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,844
are just victims in this situation.

1322
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:07,180
That's probably true.
How many of you

1323
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:11,189
have ever felt personally
victimized by Regina George?

1324
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,561
Good. OK, who's next?

1325
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,296
Who's next?

1326
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:28,907
Cady.

1327
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,806
Do you have anything
you wanna own up to?

1328
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,242
<i>Yes.
No.</i>

1329
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,317
You never made up a rumor
about anybody?

1330
01:12:36,718 --> 01:12:37,946
<i>Just that you sell drugs.</i>

1331
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,381
No.

1332
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,052
Nothing you want to apologize for?

1333
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,890
<i>I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury</i>

1334
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,117
<i>without getting blamed
for the whole burn book.</i>

1335
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:47,827
No.

1336
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:51,328
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.

1337
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,728
OK, so we're all here
because of this book, right?

1338
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,769
Well, I don't know
who wrote this book,

1339
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:03,741
but you all have got to stop
calling each other sluts and whores.

1340
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:06,914
It just makes it OK for guys
to call you sluts and whores.

1341
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:08,673
Who here has ever been called a slut?

1342
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:15,447
OK, everybody up.

1343
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,181
<i>Ms. Norbury had us
write out apologies</i>

1344
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:19,553
<i>to people that we'd hurt in our lives.</i>

1345
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,423
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you
a gap-toothed bitch.

1346
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,157
"It's not your fault
you're so gap-toothed."

1347
01:13:30,605 --> 01:13:32,072
"Gretchen,

1348
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,708
"I'm sorry I laughed
at you that time you got diarrhea

1349
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,537
"at Barnes and Noble.

1350
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,645
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."

1351
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:41,638
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.

1352
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,413
Laura, I don't hate you
because you're fat.

1353
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:50,955
You're fat because I hate you.

1354
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:58,623
I just wish we could all get along
like we used to in middle school.

1355
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:02,770
I wish that I could bake a cake
made out of rainbows and smiles,

1356
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,871
and we'd all eat it and be happy.

1357
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,700
She doesn't even go here!

1358
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,669
Do you even go to this school?

1359
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:14,542
No. I just have a lot of feelings.

1360
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,317
OK, go home.

1361
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:21,915
Sharon, I think you're doing
a great job.

1362
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,715
Thanks. I feel like I'm getting through.

1363
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:26,325
I'm sorry that people
are so jealous of me.

1364
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,622
But I can't help it that I'm popular.

1365
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:37,697
Oh, my God! Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off. Walk it off.

1366
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,067
OK. That hurt.

1367
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,207
They're OK.

1368
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,439
They're OK.

1369
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:50,241
Oh, boy. OK, who's next?
Who's next? Keep it going.

1370
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:57,891
Oh, my God. It's her dream come true,
diving into a big pile of girls.

1371
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:02,390
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.

1372
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:09,030
So I have this friend
who is a new student this year.

1373
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:13,298
And I convinced her that it would be
fun to mess up Regina George's life.

1374
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,999
So I had her pretend
to be friends with Regina,

1375
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,735
and then she would come
to my house after

1376
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,642
and we would just laugh about
all the dumb stuff Regina said.

1377
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,373
And we gave her
these candy bar things

1378
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,211
that would make her gain weight,

1379
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,614
and we turned her best friends
against her.

1380
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:30,057
And then... Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.

1381
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:32,055
She made out
with Regina's boyfriend

1382
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,353
and then convinced him
to break up with her.

1383
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:37,190
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream
instead of face wash.

1384
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,027
God! I am so sorry, Regina.

1385
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,169
Really, I don't know why I did it.

1386
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:47,603
I guess it's probably because
I've got a big lesbian crush on you.

1387
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,504
Suck on that!

1388
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:54,480
<i>Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis!</i>

1389
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:02,517
Regina!

1390
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,926
Regina, wait! I didn't mean
for that to happen.

1391
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,118
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.

1392
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,321
Regina, please! Regina, stop!

1393
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,194
No! Do you know
what everyone says about you?

1394
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,335
They say that you're
a home-schooled jungle freak,

1395
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,368
who's a less-hot version of me.

1396
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:20,336
Yeah. So don't try to act so innocent.

1397
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,807
You can take that fake apology
and shove it right up your hairy...

1398
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:30,143
<i>And that's how Regina George died.</i>

1399
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,412
<i>No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.</i>

1400
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:35,885
<i>Some girls say they saw her head
go all the way around.</i>

1401
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,889
<i>But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me</i>

1402
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,289
<i>push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.</i>

1403
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,887
- Everybody done?
- No. Mom, I didn't do it.

1404
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:48,861
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1405
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:51,160
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.

1406
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:57,036
Why are my tribal vases
under the sink?

1407
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:00,336
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?

1408
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:02,243
I don't know.

1409
01:17:02,547 --> 01:17:04,845
This is the fertility vase
of the Ndebele tribe.

1410
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:08,076
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

1411
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,717
Who are you?

1412
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:19,058
Great. All my friends hate me,
and now my mom hates me.

1413
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:21,164
Your mom does not hate you.

1414
01:17:21,366 --> 01:17:24,028
She's afraid of you.

1415
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:29,063
I don't know, maybe we
mainstream-schooled you too soon.

1416
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:33,142
Maybe you should come back and
be home-schooled again for a while.

1417
01:17:33,511 --> 01:17:37,538
No. Only thing worse than
going back will be not going back.

1418
01:17:38,483 --> 01:17:40,508
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?

1419
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,813
Remember when we saw those lions
fighting over the wart hog carcass?

1420
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:45,951
I'll be the wart hog.

1421
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,925
You're not a wart hog,

1422
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,889
you're a lion.

1423
01:17:50,395 --> 01:17:52,829
Just focus on your studies
for a little while.

1424
01:17:53,164 --> 01:17:55,496
You're still an excellent student, right?

1425
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,136
Oh, yeah. I need you to sign
my calculus test.

1426
01:17:59,504 --> 01:18:01,699
- Why?
- I'm failing.

1427
01:18:05,009 --> 01:18:07,773
OK. You are...

1428
01:18:09,114 --> 01:18:10,581
What do they call it?

1429
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:12,111
Grounded.

1430
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:14,176
You're grounded.

1431
01:18:42,914 --> 01:18:44,438
She pushed her in front of the bus.

1432
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:46,775
Did you see her do it?

1433
01:18:46,985 --> 01:18:48,316
Yes.

1434
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:06,760
Did your teacher ever try to sell you
marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?

1435
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:09,405
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?

1436
01:19:09,607 --> 01:19:11,507
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?

1437
01:19:11,876 --> 01:19:15,937
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.

1438
01:19:16,147 --> 01:19:19,344
I know, Aaron. But after
the allegations against Coach Carr

1439
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,815
turned out to be extremely true,

1440
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,251
the school board felt that it was best
that we investigate every claim made

1441
01:19:25,457 --> 01:19:26,685
in this Burn Book.

1442
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:29,121
That book was written
by a bunch of stupid girls

1443
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:31,192
who make up rumors
because they're bored

1444
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,159
with their own lame lives.

1445
01:19:33,364 --> 01:19:36,128
Well, unless someone wants to come
forward and say, "I made it all up",

1446
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:38,928
this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...

1447
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:43,801
<i>Oh, no. Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.</i>

1448
01:19:45,043 --> 01:19:46,738
Mr. Duvall.

1449
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:48,173
I wrote it.

1450
01:19:51,082 --> 01:19:52,310
Come on, Cady.

1451
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:01,081
<i>When you get bit by a snake,</i>

1452
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:03,157
<i>you're supposed to suck
the poison out.</i>

1453
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:07,161
<i>That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.</i>

1454
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:09,424
<i>I started with Regina,</i>

1455
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:11,898
<i>who was living proof that the more
people are scared of you,</i>

1456
01:20:12,103 --> 01:20:13,400
<i>the more flowers you get.</i>

1457
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:15,834
<i>Then there was Ms. Norbury,</i>

1458
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:19,601
<i>who was living proof that no
good deed goes unpunished.</i>

1459
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:22,769
Oh, hi. Did you wanna
buy some drugs?

1460
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:26,940
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait. I'll grade it right now.

1461
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:33,719
I gotta say, watching the police
search my house

1462
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:37,417
really was the cherry on top
of a fantastic year.

1463
01:20:38,696 --> 01:20:41,187
How much trouble did you get in
for telling the truth?

1464
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:42,696
A lot.

1465
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:44,558
You didn't write that whole book
yourself.

1466
01:20:44,769 --> 01:20:46,396
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?

1467
01:20:47,171 --> 01:20:48,468
No, because I'm trying
this new thing

1468
01:20:48,673 --> 01:20:50,868
where I don't talk about people
behind their backs.

1469
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:54,303
That's all right. Getting hit by a bus
is pretty good punishment.

1470
01:20:54,512 --> 01:20:55,774
Ninety-four.

1471
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,709
Welcome back, nerd.

1472
01:20:58,216 --> 01:20:59,478
Thanks.

1473
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:01,984
Anyway...

1474
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:04,454
...l'm sorry.

1475
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:05,987
I forgive you.

1476
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:08,623
But as my own personal
form of punishment,

1477
01:21:08,826 --> 01:21:11,226
I figured out how you're gonna
earn that extra credit.

1478
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,163
What's up?

1479
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,659
Excellent. Great turnout this year.

1480
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,901
- All right. It's all you.
- OK.

1481
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:26,866
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.

1482
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:30,370
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.

1483
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:32,800
- You nervous?
- Yes.

1484
01:22:33,011 --> 01:22:36,378
Don't be. You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus,

1485
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:39,175
because not one of those
Marymount boys is cute.

1486
01:22:41,052 --> 01:22:42,383
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1487
01:22:42,587 --> 01:22:45,215
Welcome to the Illinois High School
Mathletes State Championship.

1488
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:48,358
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.

1489
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:51,921
Twice the larger of two numbers
is three more than five times

1490
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:54,030
the smaller, and the sum
of four times the larger

1491
01:22:54,232 --> 01:22:57,463
and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?

1492
01:22:57,669 --> 01:22:59,762
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.

1493
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:01,529
That is correct.
Question number two.

1494
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:04,833
Find an odd three-digit number
whose digits add up to 12.

1495
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:08,103
The digits are all different, and the
difference between the first two digits

1496
01:23:08,312 --> 01:23:09,643
equals the difference between...

1497
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:11,678
- Marymount?
- 741.

1498
01:23:11,883 --> 01:23:15,216
<i>- Correct.
- Shoot. I was really rusty.</i>

1499
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,748
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.

1500
01:23:19,123 --> 01:23:20,351
She's grounded.

1501
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:23,186
Are they not allowed out
when they're grounded?

1502
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:33,397
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling
King and Queen, people.

1503
01:23:33,604 --> 01:23:36,437
These A-holes will represent you
for a full calendar year.

1504
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,906
I'm gonna vote for Regina George
because she got hit by that bus.

1505
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:43,205
I'm voting for Cady Heron
because she pushed her.

1506
01:23:51,422 --> 01:23:54,789
She's supposed to be grounded,
but he let her out.

1507
01:23:55,059 --> 01:23:58,825
After 87 minutes of very
competitive play, we have a tie.

1508
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:02,261
In the event of a tie, we move
into a sudden-death round.

1509
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:05,994
Each team is given the opportunity
to choose their opponent.

1510
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:10,170
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude. The girl.

1511
01:24:10,374 --> 01:24:11,807
Contestant Krafft.

1512
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:15,240
From Marymount,
Miss Caroline Krafft.

1513
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:19,914
We pick the girl too.

1514
01:24:20,151 --> 01:24:22,449
And from North Shore,
Miss Cady Heron.

1515
01:24:22,653 --> 01:24:24,382
It's Cady.

1516
01:24:24,822 --> 01:24:26,312
Oh, my God, that's me.

1517
01:24:34,565 --> 01:24:37,728
<i>Miss Caroline Krafft seriously
needed to pluck her eyebrows.</i>

1518
01:24:37,935 --> 01:24:42,269
<i>Her outfit looked like it was picked out
by a blind Sunday school teacher.</i>

1519
01:24:42,473 --> 01:24:45,340
<i>And she had some 99-cent
lip gloss on her snaggletooth.</i>

1520
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:48,711
<i>And that's when I realized,
making fun of Caroline Krafft</i>

1521
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:51,473
<i>wouldn't stop her
from beating me in this contest.</i>

1522
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:55,140
Contestants,
find the limit of this equation.

1523
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,387
<i>Calling somebody else fat
won't make you any skinnier.</i>

1524
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:00,921
<i>Calling someone stupid
doesn't make you any smarter.</i>

1525
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:04,583
<i>And ruining Regina George's life
definitely didn't make me any happier.</i>

1526
01:25:04,796 --> 01:25:08,232
<i>All you can do in life is try to solve
the problem in front of you.</i>

1527
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,067
<i>- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap. I lost.</i>

1528
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,897
That answer is incorrect.

1529
01:25:14,705 --> 01:25:17,674
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer

1530
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:20,901
this problem correctly,
we have a winner.

1531
01:25:21,112 --> 01:25:23,842
<i>Limits. Why couldn't I remember
anything about limits?</i>

1532
01:25:24,048 --> 01:25:26,539
<i>Limits. That was the week
Aaron got his hair cut.</i>

1533
01:25:26,751 --> 01:25:29,151
<i>Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.</i>

1534
01:25:29,353 --> 01:25:31,685
<i>What was on the board
behind Aaron's head?</i>

1535
01:25:32,557 --> 01:25:35,117
<i>If the limit never approaches
anything...</i>

1536
01:25:35,326 --> 01:25:37,351
The limit does not exist.

1537
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:38,893
The limit does not exist!

1538
01:25:39,197 --> 01:25:41,062
Our new state champions,

1539
01:25:41,265 --> 01:25:43,358
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!

1540
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:54,577
How do you like me now?

1541
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:58,574
You like that? Yeah!
Get some! Get some!

1542
01:25:58,983 --> 01:26:01,178
Awesome. You went
with the leather sleeves.

1543
01:26:01,385 --> 01:26:03,478
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.

1544
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:06,321
Thanks, K.G.

1545
01:26:06,524 --> 01:26:09,755
We're gonna look so kick-ass
in these when we roll into Spring Fling.

1546
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:11,622
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?

1547
01:26:11,829 --> 01:26:13,524
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters

1548
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:15,062
stop you from doing your thang.

1549
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,090
Did you just say "thang"?

1550
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:19,064
Cady, you don't have to punish
yourself forever.

1551
01:26:19,437 --> 01:26:21,166
But I'm grounded.

1552
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:23,064
You're already out.

1553
01:26:33,985 --> 01:26:36,010
All right, do we have all
of our nominees

1554
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,051
for king and queen on the stage?

1555
01:26:38,589 --> 01:26:42,992
OK, good. I just wanted to say
that you're all winners.

1556
01:26:43,327 --> 01:26:47,093
And I could not be happier
that this school year's ending.

1557
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:53,998
Here we go. The winner
of the Spring Fling King,

1558
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:57,205
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!

1559
01:26:57,575 --> 01:26:59,475
That's what I'm talking about!

1560
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,407
And your Spring Fling Queen,

1561
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:07,077
future co-chair
of the Student Activities Board

1562
01:27:07,285 --> 01:27:10,254
and winner of two gift certificates

1563
01:27:10,454 --> 01:27:12,445
to the Walker Brothers
Pancake House,

1564
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:14,188
Cady Heron.

1565
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:20,660
Where is Cady?

1566
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,161
There she is.

1567
01:27:40,918 --> 01:27:42,408
Thanks.

1568
01:27:44,488 --> 01:27:46,888
Well, half the people in this room
are mad at me.

1569
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:49,992
And the other half only like me

1570
01:27:50,194 --> 01:27:53,391
because they think I pushed
somebody in front of a bus.

1571
01:27:53,597 --> 01:27:55,792
So that's not good.

1572
01:27:56,267 --> 01:27:58,929
You know, it's not really required
of you to make a speech.

1573
01:27:59,136 --> 01:28:01,070
I'm almost done, I swear.

1574
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:06,842
To all the people whose feelings
that got hurt by the Burn Book,

1575
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:09,141
I'm really sorry.

1576
01:28:10,514 --> 01:28:13,540
You know, I've never been
to one of these things before.

1577
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:17,084
And when I think about
how many people wanted this

1578
01:28:18,155 --> 01:28:20,146
and how many people
cried over it and stuff...

1579
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:25,794
I mean, I think everybody
looks like royalty tonight.

1580
01:28:25,997 --> 01:28:30,024
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.

1581
01:28:30,234 --> 01:28:33,032
And Emma Gerber, I mean,
that hairdo must have taken hours,

1582
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:34,568
and you look really pretty.

1583
01:28:37,341 --> 01:28:38,740
So...

1584
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:41,977
...why is everybody stressing
over this thing?

1585
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:46,479
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...

1586
01:28:49,453 --> 01:28:50,784
Share it.

1587
01:28:51,122 --> 01:28:55,491
A piece for Gretchen Wieners,
a partial Spring Fling Queen.

1588
01:28:57,895 --> 01:29:00,193
A piece for Janis lan.

1589
01:29:01,799 --> 01:29:04,427
Seriously, most people
just take the crown and go.

1590
01:29:04,635 --> 01:29:06,660
And a piece for Regina George.

1591
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:09,704
She fractured her spine,
and she still looks like a rock star.

1592
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:13,404
Thank you.

1593
01:29:13,611 --> 01:29:16,045
And some for everybody else.

1594
01:29:25,956 --> 01:29:27,719
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?

1595
01:29:28,392 --> 01:29:29,859
Thanks.

1596
01:29:30,694 --> 01:29:33,026
All right, have a good time, everyone.

1597
01:29:40,037 --> 01:29:41,504
Look. I'm a queen.

1598
01:29:41,705 --> 01:29:43,263
As am I.

1599
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:45,834
- Hey.
- Hey.

1600
01:29:46,477 --> 01:29:48,536
So are we still in a fight?

1601
01:29:48,746 --> 01:29:50,839
Are you still an asshole?

1602
01:29:51,048 --> 01:29:52,276
I don't think so.

1603
01:29:52,483 --> 01:29:54,474
Well, then I guess we're OK.

1604
01:29:54,819 --> 01:29:56,650
Oh, my God, I love this song!

1605
01:29:56,854 --> 01:29:57,980
I hate this song.

1606
01:29:58,189 --> 01:30:00,020
I know this song!

1607
01:30:01,225 --> 01:30:03,420
Man candy, stage right.

1608
01:30:06,097 --> 01:30:08,998
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. Didn't think you'd make it.

1609
01:30:11,268 --> 01:30:14,533
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to
present you with two gift certificates...

1610
01:30:14,738 --> 01:30:16,433
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.

1611
01:30:18,175 --> 01:30:21,440
One gift certificate to
the Walker Brothers Pancake House.

1612
01:30:21,879 --> 01:30:23,676
Thank you.

1613
01:30:28,119 --> 01:30:30,087
Congratulations on winning State.

1614
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:32,882
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.

1615
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,819
I thought I was gonna hurl.

1616
01:30:35,025 --> 01:30:37,289
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.

1617
01:30:37,495 --> 01:30:40,328
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.

1618
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:42,260
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1619
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:44,095
OK.

1620
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:45,529
Grool.

1621
01:31:10,794 --> 01:31:12,159
No.

1622
01:31:14,064 --> 01:31:16,726
- What's up?
- Can I help you?

1623
01:31:17,368 --> 01:31:18,835
You Puerto Rican?

1624
01:31:19,036 --> 01:31:20,594
Lebanese.

1625
01:31:20,804 --> 01:31:22,328
I feel that.

1626
01:31:37,721 --> 01:31:40,315
<i>In case you're wondering,
The Plastics broke up.</i>

1627
01:31:40,524 --> 01:31:42,617
<i>Regina's spine healed,
and her physical therapist</i>

1628
01:31:42,826 --> 01:31:45,124
<i>taught her to channel
all her rage into sports.</i>

1629
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,796
<i>It was perfect because
the jock girls weren't afraid of her.</i>

1630
01:31:57,107 --> 01:32:00,634
<i>Karen used her special talents to do
the morning weather announcements.</i>

1631
01:32:00,844 --> 01:32:04,245
Hi. This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees,

1632
01:32:04,448 --> 01:32:08,680
and there's a 30 percent chance
that it's already raining.

1633
01:32:09,553 --> 01:32:11,384
<i>And Gretchen found herself
a new clique</i>

1634
01:32:11,589 --> 01:32:13,250
<i>and a new queen bee to serve.</i>

1635
01:32:18,195 --> 01:32:21,494
<i>Aaron went to Northwestern,
so I still get to see him on weekends.</i>

1636
01:32:21,699 --> 01:32:22,666
<i>And me?</i>

1637
01:32:22,866 --> 01:32:25,528
<i>I had gone from home-schooled
jungle freak to shiny Plastic</i>

1638
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:28,830
<i>to most hated person in the world
to actual human being.</i>

1639
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:30,267
Hey.

1640
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:34,508
<i>All the drama from last year
just wasn't important anymore.</i>

1641
01:32:34,712 --> 01:32:38,512
<i>School used to be like a shark tank,
but now I could just float.</i>

1642
01:32:38,716 --> 01:32:39,944
Regina.

1643
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,675
<i>Finally, Girl World was at peace.</i>

1644
01:32:44,755 --> 01:32:48,816
Hey, check it out. Junior Plastics.

1645
01:32:49,026 --> 01:32:52,393
<i>And if any freshmen
tried to disturb that peace...</i>

1646
01:32:52,596 --> 01:32:55,588
<i>Well, let's just say we knew
how to take care of it.</i>

1647
01:33:01,538 --> 01:33:03,165
<i>Just kidding.</i>
