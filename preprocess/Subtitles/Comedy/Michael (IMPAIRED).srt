then you're with him.

If he's somewhere else,

in the room with us.

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,942
that smells so delicious?

493
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:27,544
We are serving eggs
this morning,
and that's that.

494
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,313
Over easy would be just fine.

495
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,415
Over easy!

496
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,549
[Sigh]

497
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,251
I thought angels were...

498
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,252
Cleaner.

499
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:38,386
[Cough]

500
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,687
She doesn't mean to offend.

501
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:40,821
It's...

502
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:43,390
Miss winters is
an angel expert,

503
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:44,991
and she gets kind of...

504
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:45,958
Literal.

505
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,326
What she probably
wants to know is...

506
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,929
Can you fly?

507
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,397
I do not want to know
if he can fly.

508
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,798
I know he can't fly.

509
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,299
Only little angels can fly
because their wingspan...

510
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,633
says who?

511
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,534
I just thought...

512
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,601
Halos?
Yes.

513
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:02,502
Inner light?
Yes.

514
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:05,705
I'm not that kind of angel.

515
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,440
What kind of angel are you?

516
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,708
Michael is an archangel.

517
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,109
He battled Lucifer

518
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:14,011
and threw him out of heaven.

519
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,912
<i>Revelation</i> 12, verse 7.

520
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,647
That was a long time ago.

521
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,616
He smote a bank for me!

522
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,150
A bank?

523
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:24,218
I knew it.
Money was involved,
wasn't it?

524
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,687
Oh, I should say so.

525
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,221
After Elmer died...

526
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,255
who's Elmer?

527
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,556
My husband.

528
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,025
After he died,
they built the highway

529
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,727
and stole all my truckers.

530
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:40,764
And then the bank came
to take the milk bottle,

531
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:44,566
and I prayed for help

532
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:47,035
until God sent me Michael.

533
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:49,470
Well, she was persistent.

534
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:51,772
You came... Down

535
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:53,106
and smote the bank?

536
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:54,507
Eh, a branch.

537
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,875
First Iowa bank of commerce.

538
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,276
It was lovely.

539
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,678
He walked into the manager's
office and said...

540
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,513
what was that you said?

541
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,747
Moneychanger!

542
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,949
Moneychanger!

543
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,484
I shall turneth
this earthly den

544
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,386
into a parking lot!

545
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,653
Come on.
Did I say that?

546
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:12,920
I didn't say that.

547
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,521
They didn't believe us,

548
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,256
so Michael flattened it.

549
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,657
Huey: You did that?

550
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:18,658
Had to.

551
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,059
Quinlan: Into
a parking lot?

552
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:23,228
Well, they said
it was a tornado.

553
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,931
This town doesn't really
need a parking lot,

554
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:32,068
but it's, uh,
more, uh... Cosmopolitan.

555
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,003
And what about the money?

556
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,139
We never heard another
word about it, did we?

557
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,340
Nope.

558
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,710
You look like you must eat
a robust breakfast.

559
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,478
How would you like your eggs?

560
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,916
Poached?

561
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,152
Uh, that's...
poached is fine.

562
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,819
Poached.

563
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,357
[Coughing]

564
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,705
The lord is my Shepherd.

565
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,106
I shall not want.

566
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:20,342
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

567
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:23,378
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

568
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,312
Look, she's...

569
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,981
she's happier
where she is, right?

570
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,316
Heaven?

571
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,785
She's happier up there, right?

572
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:35,654
It isn't my area.

573
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:38,056
[Crying]

574
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:44,728
You hardly knew her.

575
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,263
She died cooking us breakfast.

576
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,234
She died making breakfast.

577
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:02,476
What is it that you keep
writing in that book?

578
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,344
Lyrics.

579
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,679
To what?

580
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,348
I write
country-Western
songs.

581
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,049
It's my hobby.

582
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,751
Earth to earth,

583
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:15,919
ashes to ashes,

584
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,554
dust to dust.

585
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:20,455
The lord bless and keep you

586
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,423
and give you peace.

587
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,159
Justine?
It's quinlan.

588
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:26,627
Put me straight through.

589
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,228
What you got?

590
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,696
Wings.

591
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:30,830
Real wings.

592
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:33,165
Don't play with me, quinlan.

593
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,368
This guy is about 6 feet tall,

594
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,435
and his wings

595
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:40,371
reach from
his shoulders
to his knees.

596
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:41,305
He's filthy, though.

597
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,306
We're gonna have
to clean him up

598
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,573
and put him in a white robe.

599
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,375
Get craddock to dig up
some of those sandals.

600
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,443
You know, the ones
with those straps
that go up your legs.

601
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,912
It's too bad he's not
blond, all right.

602
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:51,979
Angels is supposed to be blond.

603
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,413
But<i> Oprah,</i> Barbara,

604

00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:57,750
book the works.

606
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,118
Then let's don't
mess this one up.

607
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,020
I want that guy
on the first plane
to Chicago...

608
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,355
or does the birdman
fly himself?

609
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:08,025
I don't know if he
actually uses the wings,

610
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:09,793
but, God, wouldn't
that be a draw?

611
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,462
Anyway, don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

612
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,764
Yeah, and I'm
the queen of england.

613
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,832
Don't fret, malt.

614
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,000
[Hangs up]

615
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,035
He's in safe hands.

616
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,603
In view of this development,

617
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:23,837
should we call the girl off?

618
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,673
No, no. Leave her
where she is.

619
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,075
I'm in a no-lose
situation.

620
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,310
Heh heh heh heh!

621
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,918
Hey ya, Mike.

622
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,319
Michael.

623
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,857
Have you, um...

624
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,258
Have you ever seen

625
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,860
the world's biggest
ball of twine?

626
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:54,061
No.

627
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:55,429
Listen, we have to get back.

628
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,565
I once saw the world's
biggest cannonball.

629
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,699
Mesopotamia.

630
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,333
I wonder if it's still there.

631
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,068
Mesopotamia isn't still there.

632
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,970
Ohh! Nothing lasts.

633
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:08,806
Listen, I have to ask a favor.

634
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:10,207
Huey and I,

635
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:13,676
we're on a little bit
of a losing streak.

636
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:15,511
Quit.

637
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,912
We can't quit.

638
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:18,313
He's got a mortgage.

639
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,048
He's got 3 kids
in a soccer camp.

640
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,049
He's got a wife.

641
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,483
God knows he loves her,

642
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,318
but she's burning
a hole in his pocket.

643
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,186
And I...

644
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,620
Well...

645
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,288
Love to fight.
Like me.

646
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,555
We'll drive.

647
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:32,722
Where?

648
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,757
Chicago. That's where
you want to go, isn't it?

649
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,758
Yes!

650
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,159
Yeah. I know.

651
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:38,360
That's why I wrote you.

652
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:39,961
<i>You</i> wrote?
I thought...

653
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,562
Yeah. My idea.

654
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:42,696
Ah.

655
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,097
Why are we driving?

656
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,400
I mean, why don't we fly?

657
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:49,201
I mean, all of us,

658
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,069
together, in a plane.

659
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,670
