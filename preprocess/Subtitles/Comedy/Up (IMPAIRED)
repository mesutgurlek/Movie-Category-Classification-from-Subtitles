DUG: Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

1121
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,271
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

1122
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,693
You know, it's just a house.

01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,959
I wish I could keep one.

A little gift from me to you.

Bye, Kevin!

Ready?

Ready.

For Assisting the Elderly...

1143
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,692
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

1144
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:25,531
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

1145
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:29,869
I'm here for him.

1146
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,329
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

1147
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,586
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

1148

and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

1149
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,512
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

I think that covers everybody.

you're cheating.

Adventure is out there
It's heading our way

01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:10,102
So grab your scarf and goggles
Let's fly

1171
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:14,773
I've mapped out our journey
We're up here to stay

1172
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:19,111
A sunset is our home
A moonbeam we will own

Freaks of nature span a globe
That's too big to deny

1175
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:32,124
With canine guards we'll travel there
and spit into their eye

1176
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,837
Bang, bang
Once the smoke has cleared

1177
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:40,841
After all the crowds have cheered

1178
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:45,429
We'll make it a joint venture
Before we're in our dentures

I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall

1182
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:20,338
To say that I'm traveled
is far too mundane

1183
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:24,718
Let's grab our aero-fare
The high-brows will be there

is something to indenture
