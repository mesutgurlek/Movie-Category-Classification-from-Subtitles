a very good lesson for me.
Thank you.

477
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,654
Don<i>'</i>t try to sell me, Carter.

478
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,054
l love you, Kim.

479
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,458
Kim, l want to
have kids with you.

480
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,466
But l don<i>'</i>t want to have kids
with you.

481
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,271
l don<i>'</i>t even know
if l want to have kids.

482
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,267
l told you that.

483
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:22,870
l told you that
on our second date.

484
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,681
Wow, l thought
you were kidding.

485
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:29,778
Carter, is this really
such a surprise to you?

486
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,585
Are you sleeping
with somebody else?

487
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:39,687
l was,
but l broke up with him.

488
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,725
Well, it must have been
really rough on him.

489
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:45,929
Well,

490
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,895
l<i>'</i>ll be at my parents<i>'</i>.

495
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,084
(Ann)
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,958
That strong, slower one
is yours, mom.

Oh, my God!

Nice, strong heartbeat.

Dan?

505
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,306
[panting]
Yeah?

506
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:34,382
Are you okay?

507
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,817
Uh, yeah.

508
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,516
That<i>'</i>s fantastic.

509
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,291
Uh, l<i>'</i>m feeling a little,

(doctor)
You are having
a little bit of arrhythmia.

512
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,926
Have you been drinking
a lot of caffeine lately?

513
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,095
No.

514
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,230
You under
a lot of stress?

515
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,064
Well, l...

516
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:58,405
l did sort of
get demoted at work.

517
00:24:58,477 --> 00:24:59,603
Ah.

518
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:00,869
You what?

519
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,072
Yeah.

520
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:05,879
l, uh... We<i>'</i>ll talk.

Another?

527
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,052
Yeah, just keep them coming.
You don<i>'</i>t even have to ask.

528
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:56,896
[sighs]

529
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:00,169
How was everyone<i>'</i>s weekend?
Fun?

530
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,839
l<i>'</i>m sorry. That was, uh...

531
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,500
[sighing]

532
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:10,276

[clearing throat]

534
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:15,011
Um, l<i>'</i>d like to thank everyone
for joining me here.

535
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,180
Teddy K. has an...
has a thing

536
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:23,225
that what makes GlobeCom great
is the men and women

537
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,119
of GlobeCom.

538
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,462
ls it like a thousand degrees
in here or is it me?

539
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,467
[chuckling]
lt<i>'</i>s like...

540
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,364
lt<i>'</i>s me.

541
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,666
l have an agenda.

542
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:39,106
And you<i>'</i>re gonna learn this
about me. l<i>'</i>m a machine.

543
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,812
What was l saying
about the...

544
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,408
(Alicia)
An agenda.

545
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,077
An agenda, l have an agenda.

546
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,177
[sighing]

547
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:52,849
Which is that l have to
immediately, um,

548
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:56,986
increase the ad pages here
by 20 percent.

549
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:03,231
20 percent? Carter,
only a startup magazine
can do that.

550
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:06,837
Yeah, well, l think
this team can do it, Dan.

551
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,701
Um, how?

552
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,669
Well, Morty,
basically what we--

553
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,142
God,
that<i>'</i>s an awesome question.

554
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:15,140
<i>''</i>How?<i>''</i>

555
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,509
And the answer

556
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,419
is synergy.

557
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,260
We need to team up here.

558
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,464
Yeah, we need to synchronize

559
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,824
and we need to synergize.

560
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,426
We<i>'</i>re not alone.
We<i>'</i>re not alone.

561
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,937
We<i>'</i>re part of
one of the biggest multimedia

562
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:43,804
and brand name companies
in the known universe, okay?

563
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,537
Let<i>'</i>s--let<i>'</i>s take advantage
of that, like, uh...

564
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,600
Like...

565
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,006
Krispity Krunch.

566
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,883
Did anyone know that, uh,

567
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,078
one of our sister companies
is Krispity Krunch?

568
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,177
So?

569
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:59,850
So we talk to
our brothers and sisters
over at Krispity Krunch.

570
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,358
We make a deal
where we supply

571
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,326
sports factoids
to their boxes.

572
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,659
So that when Joe Couch Potato
is sitting there,

573
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:08,564
he<i>'</i>s, uh, snacking,
he looks down,
and what does he see?

574
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,101
<i>Sports America</i>
Krispity Krunch
sports factoids.

575
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,194
He<i>'</i>s definitely buying
more Krispity Krunch

576
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,670
and not Krunch <i>'</i>n Krackle

577
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,232
which, by the way,
looks and tastes
exactly the same.

578
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,404
But guess what?
No sports factoids.

579
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,574
And Krispity Krunch
is so happy they guarantee us
28 pages a year.

580
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,617
Besides which,
they know if they don<i>'</i>t,

581
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,209
Teddy K. is gonna be pissed.

582
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:31,551
What is that? What am l
talking about here, people?

583
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:35,888
Synergy.

584
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,296
lsn<i>'</i>t that cheating?

585
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,161
No, no. Hell, no.

586
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,598
And, uh, Techline cell phones.

587
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:43,861
We own Techline cell phones.

588
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,368
Guess what we put
on their browser?

589
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:46,597
Factoids.

590
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,935
Yes! Factoids! Synergy!

591
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,907
And what else?
Uh, box scores. And ads!

592
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:53,035
We make a deal
like a 100,000 hits
on the lnternet

593
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,636
has the equivalent value
of one ad page
of our hard copy.

594
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:56,840
Are you getting it, people?

595
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,746
The magazine has become
just a portal

596
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,876
to a synergized world
of cross-promotion.

597
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,647
We<i>'</i>re gonna bust things
wide open.

598
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,689
We are gonna take things
to the next level.

599
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:07,623
Who<i>'</i>s with me? Who<i>'</i>s with me?
Who-- who<i>'</i>s psyched?

600
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:08,818
Lou, are you psyched?

601

Alicia, are you psyched?

604
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,555
Absolutely.

605
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:17,159
Better. This guy. l<i>'</i>m sorry,

607
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:21,538

608
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,507

Yes, Hector<i>'</i>s psyched!

612
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,870
And if Hector<i>'</i>s psyched,
then you know l<i>'</i>m psyched.

613
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:31,973
l am psyched for this team.

614
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,711
Now who else is with me?
Who<i>'</i>s psyched?

615
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,082
(all)
l<i>'</i>m psyched!

616
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,053
(Carter)
Excellent. Who else? Come on.

617
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:39,647
Who do you think will be
the first to get canned?

618
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,249
My money<i>'</i>s on Dan.
He<i>'</i>s prehistoric.

619
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,604
Sorry, Dan.

620
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,072
Thanks for joining me
for lunch.

621
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,369
You like sushi?

622
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,535
l<i>'</i>ll just stick
with the teriyaki.

623
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:00,976
You should try some.

624
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,310
The spicy tuna here is money.

625
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,507
Come here. Get that.

626
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,174
Get that.

627
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,553
Yeah, go fishing, man.

628
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,213
Yeah.

629
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,963
[grunting]

630
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:22,693
Yeah.
So l wanted to talk to you,

631
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,756
[grunting]

632
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:24,802
because, uh,

633
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,802
This is raw.

634
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,600
...an increase
in ad pages is...

635

This is what l need.

with him?

Clearly.

804
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:34,028
Let<i>'</i>s just feed him
and get him the hell
outta here, okay?

805

of megabytes,

1716
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,987
streaming video
and satellites?

1717
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,520
Every day,

1718
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,924
the world becomes
more complex.

1719
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:03,024
And to survive
in a complex world,

1720
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,534
we need complex bonds
to interface with it.

1721
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:10,834
ln this room,

1722
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,341
l see this.

1723
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:24,144
What we<i>'</i>re trying to get to,
is this.

1724
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:28,419
(Teddy K.)
This is unbreakable.

1725
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:32,556
This is inevitable.

1726
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,691
(Teddy K.)
What are we building here?
ls it a company?

1727
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:42,567
Or are we building
a new country
with no national boundaries?

1728
01:27:43,038 --> 01:27:45,472
A new democracy
for the consumer.

1729
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,270
A new democracy
with a new electorate.

1730
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,473
24-hour music videos
in Kuala Lumpur.

1731
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:55,448
Computers with parts
manufactured in Japan,

1732
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:57,542
Greenland, ldaho, lndia.

1733
01:27:58,019 --> 01:28:00,783
A soft drink ad
going out simultaneously

1734
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,115
to seven different continents.

1735
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:06,554
The Dalai Llama
eating his Krispity Krunch

1736
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,222
while uploading prayers
onto the Net.

1737
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:12,432
<i>Woman's World</i> magazine.

1738
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,958
Well, why not
Woman<i>'</i>s World Channel
across the world?

1739
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:17,265
Computers.

1740
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:21,207
Why not a computer section
in <i>Sports America</i> magazine?

1741
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:22,776
[chuckles]

1742
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,678
(Dan)
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

1743
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:29,608
Yes?

1744
01:28:29,918 --> 01:28:31,180
Uh, uh...

1745
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:35,218
Uh, my name is, uh, uh,
Dan Foreman. l...

1746
01:28:35,423 --> 01:28:39,689
l work for <i>Sports America</i>
and l<i>'</i>m not sure

1747
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,628
l--l understand
what you<i>'</i>re talking about.

1748
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:47,026
(Dan)
W-what l mean is--is

1749
01:28:48,603 --> 01:28:51,037
what do computers have to do
with sports?

1750
01:28:51,106 --> 01:28:53,631
Are you...
Are--are you literally saying

1751
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:56,199
that there should be
a section in the magazine

1752
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:57,938
about computers?

1753
01:28:59,247 --> 01:29:01,613
Who<i>'</i>s going to want to
read that?

1754
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:07,481
Um...

1755
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:09,550
[clears throat]
And, uh...

1756
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:10,682
[sighs]

1757
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:12,590
l-l<i>'</i>m not sure
l understand

1758
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,652
how the way
the world is changing

1759
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:17,493
is actually going to change
how we do business.

1760
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:21,763
We<i>'</i>re still selling
a product, right?

1761
01:29:21,836 --> 01:29:23,963
Which hopefully
someone needs.

1762
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:27,099
We<i>'</i>re human beings
with other human beings
for customers.

1763
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:31,441
So l don<i>'</i>t see how
this company is like
its own country.

1764
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:34,744
l mean,
just because we sell
different kinds of things,

1765
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:38,616
that doesn<i>'</i>t mean
we should operate
by our own laws, does it?

1766
01:29:40,388 --> 01:29:44,256
Besides which, countries,
at least democratic ones,

1767
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,287
they have some obligation
to their citizens,
don<i>'</i>t they?

1768
01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:51,731
(Dan)
So how do layoffs

1769
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,662
and bottom line thinking
fit into that?

1770
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,983
Dan Foreman.

1771
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,478
<i>Sports America.</i>

1772
01:30:15,523 --> 01:30:18,754
You ask
some excellent questions.

1773
01:30:18,827 --> 01:30:21,125
Excellent,
excellent questions.

1774
01:30:21,763 --> 01:30:23,788
l<i>'</i>m glad you asked them.

1775
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:28,996
And l<i>'</i>m leaving it to you,

1776
01:30:29,771 --> 01:30:32,740
to all of you,
to answer them.

1777
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:39,505
Hmm.

1778
01:30:48,623 --> 01:30:49,885
Teddy K.!

1779
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:53,559
(Steckle)
Teddy K.! Teddy K.!

1780
01:30:57,599 --> 01:30:59,658
(Carter)
Oh, my God, Dan.
Oh, my God.

1781
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:01,326
(Steckle)
Good, you<i>'</i>re both in here.

1782
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,960
You,
l<i>'</i>ll talk to in a second.

1783
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:05,699
You, have you lost
your frigging mind?

1784
01:31:06,141 --> 01:31:09,008
Well, he said
they were excellent questions.

1785
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:11,102
Okay,
you think this is funny.

1786
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:13,977
You think it<i>'</i>s funny
to disrespect a great man.

1787
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,278
Do you know
who you were just talking to
in there?

1788
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:19,184
That was Teddy K.!
Teddy K., God damn it!

1789
01:31:20,555 --> 01:31:21,988
Look,
we<i>'</i>ve been carrying

1790
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:23,990
your fat, bloated salary
for way too long.

1791
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,821
(Steckle)
l want you
out of this building

1792
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:26,952
within the next
10 minutes.

1793
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:28,427
l<i>'</i>m going to my office.

1794
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:30,088
l<i>'</i>m going to smoke
a nice Cuban cigar

1795
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:31,962
and try to forget
that you ever existed.

1796
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:33,864
You, in my office now.

1797
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:35,698
Mark, don<i>'</i>t do that.

1798
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:38,464
Excuse me?

1799
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,666
Look.

1800
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,139
The guy busts his ass and--

1801
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:42,301
And what?

1802
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:44,208
Nothing. l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1803
01:31:45,914 --> 01:31:49,145
(Carter)
l just... lf you fire him,

1804
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:55,314
you<i>'</i>re going to have to
fire me, too.

1805
01:31:58,459 --> 01:31:59,585
Wait.

1806
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:02,022
Let me get something
straight here.

1807
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:04,394
You<i>'</i>re throwing yourself in
with him?

1808
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:07,491
With this useless,
over-the-hill loser?

1809
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:09,628
Think here.
Think about what you<i>'</i>re doing,

1810
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:13,333
because if you<i>'</i>re not careful,
you could end up like him.

1811
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:17,606
l guess that
that would be okay.

1812
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,549
All right.

1813
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:26,185
Then you<i>'</i>re fired, too,
you little shit.

1814
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:28,680
Well, that<i>'</i>s too bad,

1815
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:32,192
<i>'</i>cause, uh, you<i>'</i>re gonna lose
a huge account that
Dan and l<i>'</i>ve been working on.

1816
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,659
lt was gonna save
the year for us.

1817
01:32:33,728 --> 01:32:35,753
Without it,
the magazine<i>'</i>s
pretty deep in the red.

1818
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,627
Really? What account is that?

1819
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:39,428
You think
we<i>'</i>d actually tell you?

1820
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:45,198
You<i>'</i>re bluffing.

1821
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:46,830
l don<i>'</i>t bluff.

1822
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:48,498
l<i>'</i>m not
that good of a salesman.

1823
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:55,106
Yeah, well,
l don<i>'</i>t give a crap.

1824
01:32:55,183 --> 01:32:56,445
l think Teddy K. will.

1825
01:32:56,517 --> 01:32:58,644
See, l<i>'</i>m gonna call him
and l<i>'</i>m gonna tell him

1826
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,245
that you single-handedly drove
his most profitable magazine,

1827
01:33:01,322 --> 01:33:03,847
his flagship,
right into the ground.

1828
01:33:04,592 --> 01:33:06,116
And he<i>'</i>ll remember my name.

1829
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:07,957
He likes
what l did with cell phones.

1830
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,604
You<i>'</i>ve got 24 hours,
or you<i>'</i>re both gone.

1831
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:25,741
[sighs]

1832
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,815
Any ideas?

1833
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:32,245
One.

1834
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:51,594
You got
all your research?

1835
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:52,765
Yep.

1836
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:55,533
Follow my lead.

1837
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,173
(Kalb)
So, um,
how are your daughters?

1838
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:00,908
They<i>'</i>re great. Thanks.

1839
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,313
How about
your grandkids?

1840
01:34:02,383 --> 01:34:03,577
Uh, they<i>'</i>re fine.

1841
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:06,279
My son-in-law
has just enrolled our oldest,
Ralphy,

1842
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:09,380
in a computer camp,
whatever the hell that is.

1843
01:34:10,425 --> 01:34:12,586
Uh, this is my boss,
Carter Duryea.

1844
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,821
lt<i>'</i>s a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Kalb.

1845
01:34:14,896 --> 01:34:16,887
You have
a really awesome company
here.

1846
01:34:16,965 --> 01:34:19,126
You...
lt<i>'</i>s a really awesome,
awesome--

1847
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,998
Your boss?
He looks more like
your nephew.

1848
01:34:22,637 --> 01:34:25,231
Well, l<i>'</i>ve, uh, certainly been
learning a lot from Dan.

1849
01:34:25,306 --> 01:34:27,001
So what happened to your eye?

1850
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,635
That<i>'</i>s one of the things
he learned from me.

1851
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:33,078
Are you saying
that you punched him
in the eye? Why?

1852
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:36,776
Well, it<i>'</i>s...
We don<i>'</i>t have to
really go into it here.

1853
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:40,480
No, no, no, please, please.
l<i>'</i>m--l<i>'</i>m--l<i>'</i>m rather curious.

1854
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,418
Why did l hit you?

1855
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:50,458
He called me
a dinosaur.

1856
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:51,998
He said
l was out of date.

1857
01:34:52,066 --> 01:34:54,557
That l<i>'</i>d better
step in line.

1858
01:34:55,703 --> 01:34:57,330
So you slugged him?

1859
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:59,430
lt was a fair fight.
Hmm?

1860
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,035
Right.

1861
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:07,277
Mr. Kalb,
we have a sister company,
Krispity Krunch,

1862
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:10,181
that l think we could do
a really exciting
cross-promotion with here,

1863
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:12,116
all in the GlobeCom family.
Carter, Carter.

1864
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:13,483
l think that we
could achieve--

1865
01:35:13,554 --> 01:35:14,851
Carter, it<i>'</i>s ok.
Mr. Kalb,

1866
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:18,323

01:35:18,393 --> 01:35:20,122
(Dan)
l just want to ask you
one question.

1868
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:21,354
What is your hesitation

1869
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:24,489
about advertising
with <i>Sports America</i> magazine?

1870
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:31,500
My hesitation is
that our ad budget
is already overextended.

1871
01:35:31,706 --> 01:35:35,301
My son-in-law has put
a lot of money
into cable and online.

1872
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:39,210
And now he wants to plow
even more money back into it.
But...

1873
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,745
But what?

1874
01:35:42,383 --> 01:35:44,851
But he is such an asshole!

1875
01:35:45,653 --> 01:35:46,881
l mean,
l built this business.

1876
01:35:46,954 --> 01:35:49,149
l know more about running this
than he ever will.

1877
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:51,691
So, yeah.
l<i>'</i>m gonna make a major ad buy
in your magazine.

1878
01:35:51,759 --> 01:35:54,193
And then l<i>'</i>m gonna restructure
the whole damn ad campaign.

1879
01:35:54,262 --> 01:35:56,025
That is great news.
Thank you, Mr. Kalb.

1883
01:36:05,406 --> 01:36:06,668
You really slugged him?

1884
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:07,833
Yeah. Carter.

1885
01:36:09,911 --> 01:36:12,880
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

God,
that was actually fun.

What Kalb
really needed to see
