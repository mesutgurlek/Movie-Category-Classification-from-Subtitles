Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate...

1
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,955
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,089
Now, Ross, repeat after me.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,085
"I, Ross."

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,490
I, Ross.

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:17,322
"Take thee, Emily."

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,158
Take thee, Rachel.

7
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,510
Shall I go on?

8
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,646
He said, "Rachel," right?

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,148
Do you think I should go up there?

10
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,820
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,352
"I, Ross."

00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,856

00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,799

Do you have the rings?

24
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,192
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

25

...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.

Happy to.

30

They have made
their declarations...

31
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:50,117
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

32

You may kiss the bride.

33

This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

34
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,571
Just keep smiling.

35
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:15,114
Well, that went well.

36
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,880
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

37

00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:21,807
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?

43
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:33,224
That's all right. You take your time.

A bad time

That's true. Thanks, Dad.

Yes, Waltham Interiors.

53

This is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.

54
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,432
Who?

55
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:25,512
I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

56
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,377
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

57

...women's names are interchangeable.

58
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,182
Through no fault of his own.

Oh, my God! Phoebe.

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,727
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

61

Oh, no! You have it too!

What kind of bitch hangs up
on a doctor?

63
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,071
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

64
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,217
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight.

65
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,922
I'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,084
I know.

67
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,418
- How could we have let this happen?
- Seven times!

68
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,229
You know, look.
We were away.

69
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,560
In a foreign, romantic country.

70
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,504
I blame London.

71
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,105
Bad London!

72
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,767
So look...

73
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:32,047
...while we're still in London,
we can keep doing it, right?

74
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,739
Well, I don't see that
we have a choice.

75
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,880
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

76
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,452
Only here.

77
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,457
You know, I saw
a wine cellar downstairs.

78
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,419
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

79
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,865
Mon? I gotta ask you something.

80
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,123
Now?

81
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:56,566
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.

82
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,438
I don't know.

83
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,803
Monica, what should I do?

84
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,671
Just do the right thing.

85
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,109
What?

86
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,376
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!

87
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,782
I'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

88
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,283
Wait! Rachel, no.

89
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,582
He's married.

90
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,388
Married.

91
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,586
If you don't realize that,
I can't help you.

92
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,766
Okay. You're right.

93
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,457
You're right.
You can't help me.

Joey, what are you doing?

You promised, no meat

It could be better.
It'll be okay, right?

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,658
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,333
So you said my name.

113
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,129
You just said it
because you saw me there.

114
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,966
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

"I take thee, Circus Freak."

116
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,041
It didn't mean anything.
It's a mistake.

117
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:47,580
It didn't mean anything.
Right?

Oh, no! Of course
it didn't mean anything.

119
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,254
I can understand why Emily
thought it meant something...

120
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,719
...because it was you.

121

Get the hell out of there.
You know?

I'm coming in!

Yes, we do.

But we have to change first.

143

Yes, I want to change.

- We'll only be five minutes.

145

Fifteen minutes.

Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!

Well, Ross said my name.

150
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,000
But I don't think
that means anything.

Then he sees me in

00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:20,861
Wow, you look...

159
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,536
No time for that.

160
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:30,134
Hey, dude! Let me in!
I got a girl out here!

161
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:32,906
I got a girl in here!

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,247
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.

163
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,212
Well, we're hanging out.

164
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:46,261
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?

165
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,729
I suppose I would
have to say you.

166
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,260
- What if we're watching a movie?
- Which we are!

167
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,061
And we've paid for it.

168
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,533
It's <i>My Giant.</i>

169
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,865
<i>My Giant</i>?

170
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,169
I love that movie!

171
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,445
Think this is okay?

172
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,551
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.

173
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,048
Oh, it's so beautiful!

174
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,854
I don't feel right about this.

175
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,727
This is the honeymoon suite.

176
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,366
The room expects sex.

177
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,763
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

178
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,806
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

179
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,980
Nope! Not under here!

180
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,287
- You didn't find her?
- I've looked everywhere.

181
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,151
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.

182
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:54,090
- Keep looking!
- Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

183
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,729
Or 45?

184
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,061
In 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

185
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:09,636
For all I know, she's trying to find me
but couldn't, because I kept moving.

186
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,573
From now on,
I'm staying in one place.

187
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,248
Right here.

188
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,487
- It's getting late.
- We're going to go.

189
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,586
Do you guys mind staying here
for a while?

190
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,488
We've got to get up early
and catch that plane.

191
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,688
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

192
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,702
That's cool.

193
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,830
But we'll stay here with you.

194
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,643
Thanks, guys!

195
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:48,007
I really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

196
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,890
We have to leave in an hour.

197
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,795
I know. I've been looking
at those doors.

198
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,972
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

199
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,671
We can't do that.
That's insane.

200
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:17,412
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

201
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,045
...let's go for it.

202
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,758
Nope.

203
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,756
- She's not with us.
- We've come for her things.

204
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,056
Where is she?

205
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,599
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.

206
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:46,931
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

207
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,240
But I think you're
absolutely delicious!

208
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,942
Excuse me,
I'm standing right here.

209
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,548
Oh, yes.

210
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,915
There you are.

211
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,754
Hurry up! Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.

212
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,021
Goodbye, Geller.

213
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,198
Now, hold on. Hold on.

214
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:16,370
Your daughter and I are supposed
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

215
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,836
Tell her I'll be at that airport,
and I hope she will too.

216
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,403
I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

217
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,874
She's just a friend.

218
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,911
Tell Emily I love her and...

219
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:31,448
...I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

220
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:35,123
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

221
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,149
All right, I'll tell her.

222
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,692
Come on, bugger face!

223
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,524
Call me.

224
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:48,763
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?

225
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,183
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.

226
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,519
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

227
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,960
Technically, we still are
over international waters.

228
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:25,034
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?

229
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,015
Can I ask you something?

230
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:41,714
Felicity and I watched
<i>My Giant.</i> And I thought:

231
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:45,189
"I'll never be as good an actor
as that giant."

232
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:49,056
Do you think I'm wasting my life
with this acting thing?

233
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,824
The giant's five years
younger than me.

234
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,933
You think I'll ever get there?

235
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,509
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, man.

236
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,713
But what about how much
taller he is than me?

237
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:10,608
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

238
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,584
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...

239
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,554
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?

240
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:23,588
You've been in the
bathroom for a half-hour.

241
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,455
I know!

242
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,263
Had the beef tips, huh?

243
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,713
You ate meat!

244
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,050
You had sex!

245
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,451
No, we didn't.

246
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,827
I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.

247
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,735
I did not have sex.

248
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,999
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
[UNCUT] and making me fat.

249
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,905
- I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
- Me too!

250
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,806
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.

251
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,044
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.

252
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,227
We certainly are alone.

253
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,296
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

254
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,561
Listen, since we're on that subject...

255
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,466
...I just wanted to tell you that...

256
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,733
I was going through
a hard time in London...

257
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:47,142
...with my brother getting married and
that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

258
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,476
Well, anyway, I just...

259
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:54,178
That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.

260
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,985
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.

261
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:04,426
It wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

262
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,829
It just meant a lot because
you're really hot.

263
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:13,298
Is that okay?

264
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,840
That's okay.

265
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:16,867
And I'm cute too?

266
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,641
And you're cute too!

267
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,941
Thank you.

268
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,845
All right, I gotta go unpack.

269
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,471
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

270
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,033
- Oh, that counts!
- Oh, good!

271
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,589
What are you doing here?

272
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:06,191
I've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.

273
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,228
So no sign of Emily?

274
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,925
Not yet.

275
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,063
When do you have to leave?

276
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:22,141
<i>This is the last call</i>
<i>for flight 1066 to Athens.</i>

277
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,868
<i>The last call.</i>

278
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,842
Pretty soon, I guess.

279
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:29,916
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,511
I don't understand.

281
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,621
How could she do this?

282
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:39,226
Am I a complete idiot for
thinking she'd actually show up?

283
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:45,027
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.

284
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,399
Same difference.

285
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,700
<i>All passengers for flight 1066</i>
<i>to Athens should now be onboard.</i>

286
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,374
I get it!

287
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,371
Well, that's that.

288
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,940
No, you know what?

289
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,448
I think you should go.

290
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,813
I think you should go...

291
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,422
...by yourself.
Get some distance.

292
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,321
Clear your head.
It would be really good.

293
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,257
I don't know.

294
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,160
Come on.
It would be really good for you.

295
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,729
I could do that.

296
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,900
I can't even believe her.

297
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,009
You know what?
I am going to go.

298
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,404
- Good.
- Why not?

299
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:31,636
- Right?
- Right.

300
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,136
Thanks.

301
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,815
I'll see you back at home.

302
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,176
If I ever get a flight out of here.

303
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:42,420
What? Wait, what?

304
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,457
Why don't you come?

305
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,755
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?

306
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,661
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?

307
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,298
Yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

308
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,370
You can lay on the beach...

309
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,941
...and I can cry over
my failed marriage.

310
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,338
You see how I make jokes?

311
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:07,445
Really. I mean...

312
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,841
I could use a friend.

313
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,610
Oh, wow. Maybe.

314
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,385
Yes, I can do that!
