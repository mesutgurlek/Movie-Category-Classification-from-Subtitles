1
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,133
It's an emergency!
We have to evacuate!

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,601
What?

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,736
Hurry! Get your stuff
and meet me downstairs!

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,838
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
We're under attack.

5
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:14,306
We're under attack.

6
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,808
This is what
the disaster kit is for.

7
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:17,809
Hurry!

8
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,877
Okay! Okay.

9
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,646
The bras, mom. Dad.

10
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:24,582
I should've bought a drill!

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,018
Hurry! Go! Go! Go!

12
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,120
Where is our emergency
rendezvous point?!

13
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:29,621
What is the mayor saying?!

14
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,189
Kidding. We're going
to the hamptons.

15
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,224
What?

16
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,926
Whoo!

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,239
I thought

23
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,408
I flushed my diary
down the toilet.

24
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:54,477
I know you would've never agreed
to come unless I tricked you.

25
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,479
You haven't even left
the apartment in days.

26
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,114
You've just been waiting
by the phone

27
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,650
For some dumb guy you like
to call you back.

28
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,784
I am waiting to hear back
about a job interview

29
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:04,420
At harkin financial.

30
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:05,821
The c.E.O. Is in town
from london,

31
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,957
And I'm waiting to hear
if he wants to meet with me.

32
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,725
Well, whoever it is, I hope
you let them touch your boob.

33
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:14,396
Why are you wrapped
in tinfoil?

34
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,565
Chloe, I can't go
to the hamptons

35
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,099
With you this weekend.

36
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,134
My whole plan was
to stare at my cell phone

37
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,570
And reread old report cards
to calm my nerves.

38
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:24,905
June, that is the beauty
of cell phones.

39
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,475
You can take them with you
and stare at them anywhere.

40
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,909
James needs us.

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,345
He's so depressed

42
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,946
From his flameout
on "dancing with the stars,"

43
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,114
Not to mention being the butt
of every jimmy kimmel joke.

44
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,716
So we are taking him
on a weekend bender.

45
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:38,151
I've never seen him like this.

46
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,919
He stopped googling himself.

47
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:42,155
Well, I guess I could go.

48
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,424
I'll have my cell phone with me
the whole time,

49
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,926
And if I need to come back,
it's only a 2-hour drive.

50
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,495
Give or take.

51
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,329
Depending on whether or not
billy joel's ass is on the road.

52
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,565
I've always wanted to go to
a real life hamptons lighthouse,

53
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,067
In rainy weather,

54
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:56,935
In a fisherman's sweater,

55
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,004
On a bike,

56
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,806
With a sandwich
and my thoughts.

57
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,110
I almost just hit you.

58
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:06,212
I almost just lost control
and hit you.

59
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,114
Okay, so it's settled.
We'll get drunk on the drive up,

60
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,416
And then we'll stay at our
crazy friend katarina's house

61
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,184
And then we'll hit
the willoughby party.

62
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:14,285
The what?

63
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,521
The willoughby party.

64
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:17,055
It's the best party
of the year.

65
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:18,857
It's hosted by this mysterious
guy named willoughby.

66
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,093
I've never actually met him,
but his parties are beyond.

67
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,795
<i>(woman) ♪ never,

68
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:26,597

71
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,237
Whoo!

72
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:36,941
This is the year
I'm gonna meet willoughby...

73
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,208
Well, it's always nice
to meet the host.

74
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,877
And have sex with him.

75
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:41,945
Of course.

76
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,479
Yeah, you know, this year,

77
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,314
I was thinking, I really want
to do something special,

78
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,250
You know,
something that matters.

79
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,621
James is about
to come down.

80
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,690
Don't treat him any differently,
but don't look directly at him.

81
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,126
Compliment his outfit,
but not too much, or he'll know.

82
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,328
(footsteps approach)

83
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,469
They hate my hat.

84
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:12,173
That hat was given to you
by mr. Jason mraz.

85
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,642
Let them hate it.
They lose.

86
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,578
(bottles rattle)

87
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:17,579
He knew.

88
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:22,617
<i>(man) ♪ I got my love

89
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:25,252
<i>♪ put your hands in the sky

90
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,388
Weekend bender! Whoo!

91
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,457
So where'd you get this car?

92
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,292
My cousin edgar has
a limo business,

93
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,994
And this is one
of his party s.U.V.S.

94
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,395
I borrowed it

95
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,965
So that chloe would let me
come to the hamptons.

96
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,467
(cell phone ringing)
oh, my gosh! It's from a 2-1-2
number that I don't recognize.

97
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,735
It's probably about
my job interview.

98
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,737
Hello.
This is June colbern.

99
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,305
Scrotum!

100
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,974
(laughs) funny, right?

101
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,709
That's an important call.

102
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,645
Sorry. That was from
a very immature passerby.

103
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:53,813
Whoo-hoo!

104
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,549
Oh, hello, debbie
from dr. Curtis' office.

105
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,151
Another 64-calorie,
low carb beer.

106
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,519
(horn honks, tires screech)

107
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:04,089
That's what my blinker's for,
dumb-ass!

108
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,323
(clink)

109
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,060
Whoo! Yahoo!
Weekend bender!

110
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,862
(June) bye, goats.

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,031
Did you guys see me
milk that goat?

112
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,565
June, this is supposed to be
a party drive.

113
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,133
When you said you wanted
to milk a goat,

114
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,668
I thought you had to pee.

115
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,202
If I'm gonna do
the hamptons,

116
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,038
I am going to do
the hamptons right.

117
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,940
I made a list of everything
I want to see and sample

118
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,441
While we're here.

119
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,309
You're not supposed to have
a list on a bender.

120
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,978
You're supposed to go
where the moment takes you.

121
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,114
Now if "little house
on the prairie" is done,

122
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,214
We can get on with it.
Bender.

126
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,655
That farmer says
that the barefoot contessa

127
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,256
Shops there
every other Tuesday.

128
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,159
(door closes)
when I tell katarina
why we're late,

129
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,162
You just wait, ho.
You just wait.

130
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,830
I need another beer.

It's "dancing with the stars"
post-traumatic stress disorder.

138
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:12,452
D.W.T.S.P.T.S.D.

139
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,593
Well, June, you ruined
the drive up here

140
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,595
With your stupid fruit
and vegetable parade,

141
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,230
But now the bender
really begins.

142
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,033
What we need is
a dose of crazy katarina!

I wouldn't have stayed here.

159
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:08,357
When you said you had new twins,
I thought you meant a boob job.

160
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:11,861
I need adult interaction.
I haven't showered in four days.

161
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:13,428
I'm a milk monster.

162
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,964
Look at my roots!

163
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,064
(cell phone rings)

164
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,632
No! The babies!

165
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,735
Oh. Ooh.
It's a private caller.

166
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,537
Oh.
This might be it. Hello?

167
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,272
Scrotum!

168
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,841
Oh. Hi, aunt nancy.

169
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,811
You know, you really should stop
calling from a blocked number.

170
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,081
Do we go in
or do we just wait out here?

171
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,783
What's the etiquette?

172
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,418
I love rocking chairs.

173
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,487
I have two in my apartment--

174
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,289
One in the living room

175
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,692
And one in the bathroom.

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,760
You wouldn't think it would
get much use in there,

177
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,328
But it does.

178
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:52,398
Mm. (chuckles)

179
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,033
It smells like poo
in this house.

180
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,334
Well, why don't
we just yell "cut"

181
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,236
And have them
take the babies away? Cut.

182
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,438
Katarina, would you mind
if I borrowed your bicycle?

183
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,140
I'd love to go bird-watching.

184
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Help yourself...

185
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:05,510
To the bike and anything else
I used to enjoy.

186
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,212
Yeah! Bender!

187
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,513
<i>(baby crying)
no!</i>

188
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:11,883
(object thuds)

189
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,221
Okay. So you're going to need
this map,

190
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,890
Binoculars, a whistle,

191
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,592
Sunscreen,
a mosquito netting--

192
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,128
I don't need mosquito netting.
I'm just going bird-watching.

193
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,263
Ah. Okay. Um...

194
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,664
(under breath) west nile.

195
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,933
What?

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,169
Oh, nothing. Just asking
if you want to die.

197
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:33,771
June?

198
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,740
Mark! Hey!
What are you doing here?

199
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,507
Jennifer wanted a romantic
weekend in the hamptons

200
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,443
So we borrowed
her parents' house.

201
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,246
We're sleeping in their bed.
It's not weird at all.

202
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,314
Oh.
What are you doing here?

203
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,682
Aren't you waiting
to hear about that job?

204
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,719
Oh, yeah, well, I have
my phone with me, so...

205
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,354
(horn honks)

206
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,788
Oh. I better hurry.

207
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,623
Jennifer doesn't like
when I shop mom and pop.

208
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,558
She thinks the food
gets dusty.

209
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,093
So see ya.
(horn honks)

210
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,895
Okay.

211
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,797
(dog barks)

212
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:02,865
(whines)

213
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:08,736
Great capris.

214
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,172
Excuse... Me?

215
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,974
Look at me--a bow tie.

216
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,575
I'm full of regret
and self-loathing,

217
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:17,145
But you, you're so bold.

218
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,913
You're ahead of the curve.

219
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,916
Or I'm just wearing pajamas
and a sweater that I borrowed.

220
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,950
Presto. Instant success.

221
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:27,120
Willoughby,
currently of east hampton.

222
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,224
Wait. You're
willoughby the party guy?

223
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,493
You're judging me,
and it stings,

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,095
So keep doing it.

225
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:37,998
This is a riddle invitation
for my party tonight.

226
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,500
What do you think
of the font?

227
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,302
You would've picked
a different one.

228
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,736
How do you do it?

229
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,071
(crow caws)

230
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,441
(snoring)

231
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,277
I guess we're all just one
small hole in the condom away

232
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,613
From having our lives
totally destroyed.

233
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:55,782
(sighs)

234
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:59,250
Chloe, I got some pretty serious
soul searching to do.

235
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,287
I think I'm gonna have
to take this bender solo.

236
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,457
You gotta follow the bender.
I understand.

237
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:09,260
If you need me, I'll be trudging
down a quiet hamptons road...

238
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,729
Alone.

239
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,332
(continues snoring)

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,700
Wake up, bitch.

241
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,602
(birds chirping)

242
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:38,555
I just worry about your arches
in those shoes.

243
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:45,327
(door opens and closes)
perfect.

244
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:46,862
So I just met willoughby.

245
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:47,963
What?

246
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,399
Oh, my god!
A willoughby riddle.

247
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,501
"on this day occurred
a love massacre,

248
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,870
"when the clock struck
a manic gay actor

249
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,572
Who does not like
to work subtle."

250
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,306
It's his new address
or something.

251
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,508
(gasps) the valentine's day
massacre was February 14th.

252
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:01,909
Everyone knows that.

253
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,012
I'm instantly picturing
a grandfather clock. Oh!

254
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,314
Who is that actor who I thought
was claymation?

255
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,617
Oh! Oh! Oh! Nathan lane!

256
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,619
Oh.
That's it!
214 grandfather lane.

257
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,188
That's it. That's the address
of the party. We're so going.

258
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,556
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
I have to get up super early.

259
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,958
I'm going to get, uh,
scones at maude's.

260
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:21,361
They run out of the blue--

261
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,329
My list!

262
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:26,700
(spits) June, you have to go
where the bender takes you,

263
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,368
And I am telling you,
your bender is

264
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,203
Taking you
to willoughby's party,

265
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,872
Where you will introduce me
to willoughby,

266
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,706
And I will meet him
and I will bang him.

267
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,307
Well, what if my bender was
taking me

268
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,410
To do a sunset tour
of the cranberry bogs?

269
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,845
Ugh! You are
the worst bender-er ever.

270
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,113
You might as well
have just stayed home

271
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,215
And stared at your phone
on the coffee table.

272
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,017
(beep)
no one's called
since aunt nancy.

273
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,219
Exactly. So relax.
Come on.

274
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,954
There is a fabulous party
with our names on it.

275
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,156
I'm sure you could borrow
something to wear of katarina's.

276
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,626
I know.
Something with a crotch.

277
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,429
Chloe asked me
to look after james.

278
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:59,363
She deputized me...

279
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,200
With her eyes,
not with her words.

280
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,735
(horn honks)

281
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,870
Yeah! Pass me!
Look at you go!

282
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:10,774
You're an asian-american
driving poorly,

283
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:15,111
And I'm an african-american
sitting in the back of the bus,

284
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,713
Both chasing

285
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,782
A distant white man.
(high-pitched squeak)

286
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,418
This is not why my mother
marched on washington.

287
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:26,322
Oh, sweet freedom,
where is james?

288
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,724
(grunts)

289
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:33,195
Coffee guy?
What are you doing here?

290
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,130
What are you doing here?

291
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,198
Well, I heard
a-a high-pitched squeak.

292
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,667
I thought a little girl
was in trouble.

293
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:42,303
It was my girlfriend jennifer.

294
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:45,474
She broke up with me again,
this time for good.

295
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,642
She thought I was gonna
propose to her this weekend,

296
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,578
So she kept looking
for an engagement ring

297
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,879
In everything I handed her.

298
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,481
She tore apart a pinecone
with her bare hands.

299
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:54,849
(luther) james!

300
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,016
James!

301
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,384
I see you're on a bender.

302
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,687
I, too, am trying
to drink my pain away.

303
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,455
I thought I wanted to do
the lonely bender,

304
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:04,291
But the quiet
just makes it worse.

305
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,793
(luther) james!

306
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,928
My lonely road
has brought me to you.

307
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,396
I think we're supposed to be
bender buddies.

308
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,733
(clink)

309
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,602
(luther, singsongy)
I have cookies!

310
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,036
(blows nose)

311
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,806
Excuse me. Pollen.

312
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:23,175
<i>(woman) ♪ oh ♪</i>

313
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,811
God, put that pie away.
What is the matter with you?

314
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,080
It's my host gift.
Every time you try

315
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,549
To slap it out of my hands,
it only makes me grip it harder.

316
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,551
Okay, where's willoughby?
I want to find him

317
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,086
And sex him
and then have a martini.

318
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,288
Oh, I just had
one of those moments

319
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,923
Where I realize
what a great girl I am.

320
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,893
Wow! This house is amazing!

321
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,427
And I love this dress
of katarina's.

322
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,730
It's tight, but I get it.
It even has a cool phone pocket.

323
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,765
Oh, my god!
Katarina's pill pocket!

324
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,501
A lot of good times
in that pocket.

325
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,635
A lot of memories.

326
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,538
Oh, no. Oh, no.
There's no bars.

327
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,140
There's no signal.

328
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,874
Katarina should've used
that pocket

329
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,275
For some birth control pills.

330
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,577
Ha ha ha ha! That's hilarious!

331
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,213
I'm gonna text her that
right now.

332
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,416
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

333
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,783
Boo.

334
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,984
Willoughby.

335
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,387
'tis I, June.
'tis willoughby.

336
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:11,855
What are you doing up here?

337
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,389
I actually hate parties.

338
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,191
I just like
to find a dark corner

339
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,860
And watch all the puppets dance
from afar.

340
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,062
Is that a pie?

341
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,864
Oh. Yes!
This is for you.

342
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,399
You know how many people
have been to my parties

343
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,534
Over the years?

344
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:26,802
5,342.

345
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,371
You wanna know
how I know that?

346
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,106
It's this antique clicker.
(click)

347
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:32,974
You know how many people have
ever brought me a pie?

348
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,242
Zero.

349
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,279
Go downstairs
and get us two pastry forks.

350
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,714
I've got something important
I need to say.

351

<i>(dance music playing)</i>

352

Excuse me. Can I have
your attention, please?

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,621

354
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,356

358
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:58,298
Bernard, what the hell
are you doing?!

359
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,665
You're not willoughby!

360
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,367
Chloe, what are
you talking about?

361
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:02,768
That is willoughby.

362
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,905
No, that's bernard,
my husband.

he's your husband?

366
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:17,987
I mean he's my husband.
We got married

367
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,089
At a wedding party
when I first moved to new york.

368
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:23,658
Ha ha! This party is awesome!

369
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,793
People are
getting married upstairs.

370
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,595
We should
totally get married.

371
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,731
Oh, my god! I thought
you were gay! Okay!

372
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,432
(cheering)

373
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,268
I met him that night
and I haven't seen him since.

374
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,871
Honestly, I thought he was dead.
I saw some news report

375
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,772
About a skinny guy
who got hit by a garbage truck,

376
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,140
And I figured, welp,
I'm a widow now.

377
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
Hello, wife.

378
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,709
(chloe scoffs)

379
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,178
I still think
of you daily.

380
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:45,712
Bernard, what the hell
are you doing?

381
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,147
You're not willoughby.

382
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,649
I thought willoughby was
a cosmopolitan man of mystery.

383
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:50,817
It's just you?

384
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,586
Exactly. Just me,

387
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:00,927
Thank you, June, for exploding
this prison of my own creation.

388
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:03,763
I-I have
a-a-a lot of questions,

389
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,999
But right now, I was gonna ask
you, may I borrow your laptop?

390
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,201
I need to access my voicemail
over the internet.

391
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:11,169
Yeah, I don't have a computer.
They're disgusting.

392
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,005
But I do have a vintage
typewriter collection

393
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,606

to compose a sonnet.

Okay.

397

Oh! You got the sunglasses.
That's a foul.

"dancing with the stars" is
haunting me.

402
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,993
You see, I practiced,

403
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,429
I was--I was--I was...

404
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,697
Ready.

405
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,533
I didn't get
a chance to do it.

406
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,234
You know what you have?

407
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,303
You have performance
squelchings, brother.

408

I mean, you're trapped
in a bag with memory cats.

You gotta punch your way
out of it.

410
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,411
I had...

411
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,180
I had a chance to dazzle,
you know?

412
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,882
It got taken away from me.

413
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,249
Who cares, man?

414
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,418
Make your own opportunity,
james.

415
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:04,987
You want to dance,
then dance.

416
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:08,090
We just gotta find you
a floor.

417

Ow! Dude!

418
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,293
Chloe just texted me
willoughby's address.

419
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,728
Willoughby has a floor.

420
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,230
Yeah! Yeah!

421
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,832
Whoa!

I went up on the roof with
willoughby

426
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,876
And got a signal.
No messages.

427
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,278
Also, he said that
your marriage wasn't legal.

428
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,513
The priest was some club kid
named stinklord

Is everything okay?

432
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:42,457
Willoughby was one of the last
new experiences I had left,

433
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,925
And it turns out I married him
six years ago.

434

There are no new mountains
to climb, June.

what--what are you doing?

Oh, every year
when I'm in the hamptons,

I have sex in the bushes

So you're okay
with all of this?

Well, when I was having sex
with lenny, I was thinking,

I've had sex with him

00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,937
And it's still great.

478
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,505
Just because I've done it before
doesn't mean it's not awesome.

479
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,307
(laughs)

480
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,110
She's a party girl, June.

481
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:43,145
We lost a lot of good
party girls along the way.

482
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:44,713
We're not gonna lose
this one.

483
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,015
Aah! Don't get all
sentimental on me, james.

484
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,051
Pull yourself together.
You want to show me you care,

485
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,651
Buy me an island.
(cell phone alert chimes)

486
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,754
What's that noise?

487
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,022
(chime)
oh, that is
a voicemail noise.

488
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,357
That is a voicemail noise.
(keypad beeps)

489
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,059
Oh, no!

490
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,426
It's harkin financial.

491
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:02,028
They want me to come in
for a job interview

492
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,964
First thing
tomorrow morning!

493
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,166
Robin, will you take June
back to the city?

494
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,568
Deputized!

495
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:10,771
Wait. Really?
You're okay with me leaving?
(car door opens and closes)

496
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,004
Interrupting the bender?
(engine starts)

497
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,106
You gotta go where
the bender takes you, June.

498
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:16,541
If this is where your bender is
taking you, then so be it.

499
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,411
This job interview is your
lenny kravitz. Now go bang it.

500
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,913
(chuckles)

501
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,783
Aah! You people hold
yourself together.

502
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,851
It's not like
I'm dying of leukemia.

503
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,153
(slurred voice) one day,
I'm gonna tell June

504
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,854
That she's amazing

505
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:32,356
And pretty
and I want to touch her hair

506
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,859
And I want to kiss her
on her tongue doors.

507
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,028
You mean her mouth?

508
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:39,297
Oh, yeah.
I couldn't think of the word.

509
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,533
Make your own opportunity.

510
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:43,967
You tell June how you feel.

511
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,937
I'm gonna write a movie
that I direct and star in.

512
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,172
Let's do it!

513
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,841
Yeah! Future is now!

514
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,276
Now!

515
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:53,210
(clink)

516
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:57,214
(james and mark gulping)

517
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:58,448
Mm.

518
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,416
(birds chirping)

519
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,618
(snoring)

520
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:05,154
(toy rattles)

521
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,555
Oh!
(rabbit squeaks)

522
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,425
Ohh.

523
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,394
What the hell?
How do you look so fresh?

524
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm a celebrity.

525
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,965
Oh, no. Did I say anything
to June last night?

526
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,366
Oh, yeah. (laughs)

527
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,935
You said a lot
of things to June last night.

528
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:24,072
I could eat, like, eight
string cheeses in a row.

529
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,941
You ever seen
that movie "rat race"?

530
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,744
It's like this side of my face
but then this side of my face...

531
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,979
Toenails.

532
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,179
Ugh.

533
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,480
I wrote the script
last night.

534
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:34,581
What?

535
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,950
"dancing with the stars" is

536
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,384
The greatest thing
to ever happen to me

537
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,320
Because it forced me to
make my own opportunities.

538
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,288
I'm gonna make this movie.

539
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,357
It's called "fingered."

540
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,960
It's a cop drama. Luther
read it, said it's amazing.

541
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,461
(luther) it's amazing.

542
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,562
Now don't wash it
till Thursday

543
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:52,899
And don't blow-dry it on high
ever...

544
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,001
Ever again.

545
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:56,535
Bless you. (giggles)

546
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,304
Before we leave,
I want to steal

547
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,306
One of p. Diddy's
white lawn jockeys.

548
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,875
I do it every year.
It's tons of fun.
(door opens and closes)

549
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,542
Good afternoon, all.

550
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,180
Say hello to harkin financial's
newest junior analyst.

551
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:09,281
I got the job!

552
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,849
Whoo! Yeah!

553
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,017
(robin) yay!
Congratulations, June!

554
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:14,987
And I got the car washed.

555
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,855
(under breath)
congratulations, robin.

556
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:18,790
(normal voice) yay!

557
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,091
Yay. (chuckles)

558
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,959
So why did you come back?

559
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,727
I wanted to celebrate
with my friends,

560
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:26,530
And I brought everybody scones
from maude's.

561
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,165
Ooh! Delish!

562
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,634
That'll go perfectly
with my kahlua and cream.

563
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:31,903
Ooh!

564
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,371
I made it from
katarina's breast milk.

565
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,705
It's super smooth.

566
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,208
You just drank milk made
from boobies.

567
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:39,242
 - (spits)
- Ew.

568
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:48,634
