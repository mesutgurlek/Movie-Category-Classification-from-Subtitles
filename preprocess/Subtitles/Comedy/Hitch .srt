1
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,111
<i>Basic principles:</i>

2
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,275
<i>No woman wakes up saying:</i>

3
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:52,544
<i>"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today".</i>

4
00:00:55,524 --> 00:01:00,018
<i>Now, she might say,
"This is a really bad time for me".</i>

5
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:06,496
<i>Or something like, "I just need some space".</i>

6
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,665
<i>Or my personal favorite:</i>

7
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,502
<i>"I'm really into my career right now".</i>

8
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:19,170
You believe that? Neither does she.

9
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:23,216
You know why?
Because she's lying to you, that's why.

10
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,479
You understand me? Lying.

11
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:31,054
It's not a bad time for her.
She doesn't need any space.

12
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:33,058
She may be into her career...

13
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:36,858
but what she's really saying is,
"Get away from me now".

14
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,826
Or possibly, "Try harder, stupid".

15
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,634
Well, which one is it?

16
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,972
<i>60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.</i>

17
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:50,835
<i>Body language.</i>

18
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:52,971
<i>30% is your tone.</i>

19
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,212
<i>So that means that
90% of what you're saying...</i>

20
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,819
ain't coming out of your mouth.

21
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,884
Toby!

22
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,519
Shit!

23
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:07,926
Of course she'll lie to you.

24
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,827
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings.

25
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,561
What else is she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

26
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:14,760
Yet.

27
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:20,439
<i>Luckily, the fact is
that just like the rest of us...</i>

28
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:24,945
<i>even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.</i>

29
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:26,875
<i>And that's where I come in.</i>

30
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,177
<i>My job is to open her eyes.</i>

31
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,019
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,283
Is this what you're looking for?

33
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:43,296
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

34
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:46,924
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

35
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,133
Just needs the right broom.

36
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,878
You cannot use what you do not have.

37
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,975
So if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

38
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,553
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

39
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:10,113
She may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

40
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,626
She may not want to see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

41
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:18,563
So tonight, when you're wondering what
to say, how you look, or if she likes you...

42
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,636
just remember, she is already out with you.

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,134
That means she said yes
when she could have said no.

44
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:30,277
That means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off.

45
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:34,473
So that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

46
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:37,551
It is your job not to mess it up.

47
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,416
The shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you?

48
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:48,053
Yeah, but I don't think they're really me.

49
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,897
"You" is a very fluid concept right now.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,561
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

51
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,468
That's the you I'm talking about.

52
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,073
<i>The key tonight is hang back.</i>

53
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,138
<i>Give her plenty of space.</i>

54
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,807
<i>If she lingers at a photograph, move on.</i>

55
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,778
<i>But maintain the visual.</i>

56
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:22,494
<i>It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight.
So when you leave the club, walk a little.</i>

57
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,929
<i>Ask her what she thought about the show...</i>

58
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,763
<i>what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.</i>

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.</i>

60
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:34,035
<i>Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.</i>

61
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:37,634
Listen to what she is saying and respond.

62
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:40,537
Listen and respond.

63
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,013
<i>That way, when it's your turn to talk...</i>

64
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:46,053
<i>you'll have something better to say than,
"I like your mouth".</i>

65
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,452
What was your favorite one?

66
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:51,351
The elephant, definitely.

67
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:54,155
<i>And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.</i>

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
Ready.

69
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,368
No way.

70
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:11,136
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

71
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:15,041
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

72
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,709
<i>So how does it happen, great love?</i>

73
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:18,877
Are you okay?

74
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:20,648
<i>- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.</i>

75
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:24,089
Let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

76
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:28,492
<i>But what I can tell you,
is that it happens in the blink of an eye.</i>

77
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:33,357
<i>One moment, you're enjoying your life.</i>

78
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:37,665
<i>And the next, you're wondering
how you ever lived without them.</i>

79
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Three dates is all I need.</i>

80
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,569
<i>Three dates, and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...</i>

81
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,706
<i>where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss...</i>

82
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:52,685
<i>will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship.</i>

83
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:24,584
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

84
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,119
<i>But always remember...</i>

85
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:30,448
<i>life is not the amount of breaths you take.</i>

86
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,153
<i>It's the moments that take your breath away.</i>

87
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,833
Did I call it or did I call it?

88
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,130
I mean, what did I say, six months?

89
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,002
And when was her first date?

90
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:49,133
So five-and-a-half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

91
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:52,907
What is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks...

92
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,348
even when they're going out with
someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

93
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,249
She's only the most fabulous thing
walking around New York.

94
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:00,412
Thanks, Young.

95
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:02,820
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

96
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:06,358
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

97
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,463
Even if he is gorgeous.

98
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,297
If he's stupid enough to cheat...

99
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,833
the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

100
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,368
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
See you in a minute.

101
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,631
Good morning, how are you?

102
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,804
Bitter, party of one.

103
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,438
You should try it sometime.

104
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,809
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

105
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:27,711
It was just what the doctor ordered.

106
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,307
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books...

107
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,115
flirted with my scuba instructor.

108
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:36,315
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

109
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,552
You should've taken someone with you.

110
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,821
Who am I gonna take with me?

111
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,193
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

112
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:47,792
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

113
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:50,872
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

114
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:52,900
I thought you were on vacation.

115
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,374
See if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour.

116
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:00,880
Besides, relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along.

117
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:03,314
Spoken like a true cynic.

118
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,550
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

119
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:10,147
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

120
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,886
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

121
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:14,552
She works here, remember?

122
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:17,324
No, she doesn't. Not for another four days.

123
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:19,229
- This couldn't wait.
- It could.

124
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,233
What are you doing? Go back to the beach.

125
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,203
- I don't want you here.
- No, really, you do.

126
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,331
You are becoming
a sick, workaholic lunatic...

127
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,137
and this is exactly...

128
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:33,408
the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior
that leads to...

129
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:36,381
Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette.

130
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:39,415
A very big raise.

131
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,022
Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

132
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,058
Comes with the job.

133
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:49,857
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

134
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,764
Can I help he was cheating on my beach?

135
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:55,426
I think it's great
that you're so good at your job.

136
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,198
I'm just a little worried as to why.

137
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,666
Let me worry about that.

138
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:05,036
Okay. I want that column on my desk
by lunch.

139
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,512
So you'll pay for my hotel?

140
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:10,051
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

141
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:23,963
- Come on.
- What?

142
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,532
- That's good, right?
- No.

143
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,226
No, it was in and it freaked out.

144
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:31,362
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

145
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:36,273
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

146
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:39,943
not what's necessarily best for you...

147
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:42,743
in the long run.

148
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:47,887
All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

149
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:51,550
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

150
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,595
So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty...

151
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:57,927
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

152
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:02,133
- I was talking about pool, but whatever.
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,000
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience...

154
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,837
the unconditional love, trust,
and openness...

155
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,842
that I share with Grace every single day.

156
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:14,608
- Is this really barroom talk?
- You need to listen to me. I'm serious.

157
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:17,412
Because when you get to a place
with a woman like that...

158
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
it's so beyond anything physical that...

159
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:22,150
when I think back to
when I used to run around with you...

160
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,259
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women...

161
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:30,330
I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic.

162
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,498
Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic.

163
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,345
So, how'd you meet him?

164
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,382
I was in La Perla
just buying some weekend thongs.

165
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,043
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

166
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,456
Actually, he said he was buying something
for his mom.

167
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:56,854
His mom?

168
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,821
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

169
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,226
Well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

170
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:06,898
Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

171
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:11,565
- I prefer the mother story.
- I know you do, but that's not the point.

172
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,971
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

173
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,704
- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...

174
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,039
Like me? Is that what you were gonna say?

175
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,651
No. I was gonna say, "Like you".

176
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,986
- What's his name?
- Why?

177
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,855
- I'm gonna Google him.
- No. Google your own guy.

178
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,925
Let's just see if his mother's still alive.

179
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,994
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

180
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,989
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

181
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,893
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

182
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:41,195
No, don't do that.

183
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:45,330
Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them
because you can't go home with them?

184
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,670
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

185
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,506
- Have you heard of the Date Doctor?
- Urban myth.

186
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,874
- Really?
- Absolutely.

187
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,607
I was hoping he also helped women.

188
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,774
Casey, you're not sick. You're single.

189
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,384
You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.

190
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,717
I haven't been ridden in months.

191
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:09,753
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

192
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:12,093
- You mean, besides me.
- Right.

193
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:13,723
Bye.

194
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:16,235
I'll go get those girls,
bring them over here...

195
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,568
and we'll have a conversation
like human beings.

196
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:22,404
Then you're gonna home,
and I'll take them back to my apartment.

197
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,970
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But you might want to get in line, pal.

198
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,982
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, how are you?

199
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:35,951
Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
at the pool table, please? Thanks.

200
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,456
Excuse me.

201
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:41,959
Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

202
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,463
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

203
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,707
I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart.

204
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:56,106
Just don't let it happen again.

205
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,769
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

206
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:02,371
How else was I supposed to get you away
from all those guys?

207
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,382
Why would you want to do that?

208
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:09,290
<i>Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.</i>

209
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,325
<i>They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.</i>

210
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:17,723
<i>Back in college, I was just not one of them.</i>

211
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,105
<i>I seemed to lack the basic understanding...</i>

212
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>that my peers just intuitively grasped.</i>

213
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:32,438
<i>But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.</i>

214
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:38,411
<i>Her name was Cressida Baylor.</i>

215
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:42,515
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

216
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,461
<i>And my life would never be the same.</i>

217
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,031
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

218
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,768
<i>What we had was beautiful.</i>

219
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:03,976
I love you.

220
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,511
I love you so much.

221
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,382
I love you, too, Alex.

222
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,819
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

223
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:24,797
But that's okay.
I'm just glad you love me at all.

224
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,232
<i>In retrospect,
I guess I may have come on a little strong.</i>

225
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
<i>But the experience taught me a lot.</i>

226
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,240
Cressida!

227
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,810
What are you doing?

228
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,315
I'm sorry, Alex.

229
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:47,821
But I love you. What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

230
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,081
You're doing it right now.

231
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,719
Alex, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:56,297 --> 00:15:00,495
<i>And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.</i>

233
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:08,536
<i>Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.</i>

234
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,571
<i>If ever a man born was without game...</i>

235
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:15,207
<i>it was Albert Brennaman.</i>

236
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:45,543
<i>My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.</i>

237
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,478
<i>And if there's one thing I've learned...</i>

238
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:51,312
<i>when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...</i>

239
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,921
<i>it's best to fly under the radar.</i>

240
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:34,359
I hope she's single
'cause I don't do break-ups.

241
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,464
Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

242
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:40,022
Yeah, no.
I mean, she just got out of a relationship.

243
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,528
Is that a problem?
Because if it is, that's fine.

244
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,969
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway.

245
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:50,306
Definitely been hurt a lot.
I had a lot of bad experiences.

246
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:53,869
Some good ones.
But definitely a lot of bad ones.

247
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:58,678
I'm desperate, basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

248
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,517
You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah.

249
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,357
Why don't you tell me about her?

250
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,621
Let's see, what can I say?

251
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,627
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

252
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,466
Well, I'm one of them.
I'm the junior man on the account.

253
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,005
- So does she know you're interested?
- No.

254
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,337
Alive?

255
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:26,880
I lent her my pen once.

256
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,680
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

257
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:33,309
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

258
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,946
Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra.

259
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,856
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

260
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,726
Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type.

261
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:48,666
Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden
or something.

262
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,499
And that guy was a bum.

263
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:53,665
He didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

264
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,734
You swing for the fence.

265
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:00,312
Look, you don't think I tried
talking myself out of this?

266
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:04,249
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I know, okay?

267
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:07,821
I just thought that maybe with your help...

268
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:13,884
You know what?
I'm really sorry I wasted your time.

269
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,365
Hold on a second, Albert.

270
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:34,007
You know what it's like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless?

271
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:37,707
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

272
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:42,722
But at the same time,
hoping that she still finds happiness...

273
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:46,057
even if it's never gonna be with you?

274
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:50,226
You are flat-out...

275
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,262
out of your mind. You know that?

276
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,605
That's good.

277
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:01,902
It is?

278
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,210
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

279
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,543
Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

280
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,550
Michelangelo.

281
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,044
Sistine Chapel.

282
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,050
You saying you can do this?

283
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:18,717
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

284
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,689
Take it easy.

285
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,492
Oh, my God!

286
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,897
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

287
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:48,879
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering is...

288
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:54,245
if I could have $500,000
to invest on my own.

289
00:20:56,257 --> 00:21:00,353
And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

290
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:06,493
Well, it's something
that I really have a passion for.

291
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,905
<i>Daydreams are for private time.</i>

294
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:24,282
My friend Maggie is a talented designer.

295
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:29,053
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

296
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:34,187
And I would really like to get involved.

297
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,461
I'll tell you what.

298
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:45,265
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

299
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:49,001
and next month,
we'll run the whole lot of them by you.

300
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,102
Okay.

301
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,738
Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

302
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:58,878
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

303
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,419
Shock and awe.

304
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,422
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

305
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,718
Shock and awe.

306
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,192
What is the objective?

307
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,793
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

308
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,705
I don't really agree with that.

309
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,300
You don't really agree with what?

310
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:34,386
I think if you want to invest $500,000
in your friend's business...

311
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:35,978
that's exactly what you should do.

312
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,921
You don't need us to tell you what to do.

313
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,086
We're a board of advisers,
not your kindergarten teachers.

314
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,426
If you want to be taken seriously
as an adult...

315
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:46,898
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult...

316
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,970
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money...

317
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,800
from a boardroom
full of your daddy's golf buddies.

318
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,669
- That's quite enough!
- I'm not finished.

319
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,007
I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

320
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:02,809
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

321
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,249
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

322
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:12,121
- Sit down...
- No! You know what? I quit!

323
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:23,868
Oh, my God.

324
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,711
Just breathe. How'd it go?

325
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:40,378
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

326
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,685
- What?
- You said...

327
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:45,617
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

328
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,489
Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine.

329
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:50,063
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no!

330
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:54,299
Just relax! Okay?

331
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:58,202
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

332
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,541
Relax.

333
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,812
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

334
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,481
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

335
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,190
Yes. Hi.

336
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:24,363
What's up?

337
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,599
Listen, Albert, right?

338
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:32,372
- People don't usually talk to me like that.
- Close your mouth, man.

339
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:35,067
Let me rephrase that.

340
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:38,042
People never talk to me like that.

341
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:40,841
Stand up.

342
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:43,712
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

343
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:48,420
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

344
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,724
But I was wondering...

345
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:56,058
do you think that you and I could
get together sometime this week?

346
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,794
You know, to go over things.

347
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,532
Financial things.

348
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:07,767
I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

349
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,240
- Check your schedule.
- I'll check my schedule.

350
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,780
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

351
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:16,108
I don't think I have one.

352
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,785
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

353
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:36,799
And call me Allegra.

354
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:42,104
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

355
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,143
Good job.

356
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,075
Oh, damn.

357
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,943
She's some kind of newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

358
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,102
What's her drink?

359
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:21,511
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

360
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,850
Hi.

361
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,490
I noticed your glass was getting low...

362
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,497
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

363
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,622
Thank you.

364
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:44,761
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

365
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,830
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

366
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:50,136
You can't get them to stop?

367
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,506
That was funny.

368
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:56,138
Listen, I understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room...

369
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,775
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air.

370
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:02,686
- So don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

371
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,025
Thanks. Try to listen.

372
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,119
This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

373
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,899
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

374
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,900
You're welcome.
So do you like Cuban food?

375
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,572
Chip, seriously, that was not code for,
"I wish you'd try harder".

376
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,838
Are you always so shut-down and afraid
that the right man might make you...

377
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,038
Feel like a natural woman?

378
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:31,045
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting?

379
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,848
Well, there was a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

380
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,257
Nice to meet you, Chip.

381
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,894
You, too.

382
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,595
On the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man...

383
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:52,433
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

384
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:55,770
But on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

385
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,401
So life's kind of hard all around.

386
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,378
Not if you pay attention.

387
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,185
You're sending all the right signals:

388
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:08,744
No earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back...

389
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:12,518
wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini...

390
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:15,891
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

391
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,361
If that wasn't clear enough...

392
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:21,594
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

393
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:26,035
Who'd believe there's a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn't know...

394
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,236
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

395
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:33,279
I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

396
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,438
So what would a guy like that say?

397
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,984
He'd say, "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant".

398
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,950
But she wouldn't be interested in that...

399
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,556
because she'd be counting the seconds
until he left.

400
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:46,148
Thinking he was like every other guy.

401
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:49,490
Which, life experience has taught her,
is a virtual certainty.

402
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,428
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living...

403
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,728
and she might blow him off.

404
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,732
Or she might say...

405
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:05,177
<i>I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard.</i>

406
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,281
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her...

407
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:11,613
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

408
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:12,777
No.

409
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,587
- No?
- He'd be interested.

410
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:19,152
But he'd see that there was no way...

411
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:23,093
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

412
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:28,328
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

413
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,636
Wouldn't help.

414
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:33,866
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

415
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,705
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward.

416
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:40,643
My guess is they'd do just fine.

417
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,810
It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas.

418
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:54,316
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

419
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,292
Is that for me?

420
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,230
What?

421
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,751
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

422
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,658
No, not a problem.

423
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,692
Wow, you're the...

424
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:34,362
- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

425
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,333
So, tell me about her.

426
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,501
Have you ever met someone...

427
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,405
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

428
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:46,945
Not just because of her looks,
but that X factor.

429
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,505
How'd you meet her?

430
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:53,017
Actually, I was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom.

431
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,020
And by that, of course, you mean...

432
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:58,057
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

433
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:03,055
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

434
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:06,289
And the lingerie is for a woman
I'm no longer seeing.

435
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:09,300
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

436
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:12,132
she's so sweet, funny, Southern.

437
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:15,298
She gives me her number.
Now she won't return my phone calls.

438
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:19,105
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her out of my mind.

439
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:23,273
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, they seem dull.

440
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:27,148
Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.

441
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,256
I think things aren't gonna snap back
unless I...

442
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,888
Unless I bang her.

443
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,461
Excuse me?

444
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:42,657
You know, bang her. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

445
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:48,738
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

446
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:51,572
No, I was told you help guys get in there.

447
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:53,612
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

448
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:57,115
My clients actually like women.

449
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:02,287
Hit it and quit it is not my thing.

450
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:06,325
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

451
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,258
Well, that is for damn certain.

452
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:14,258
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

453
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:20,332
You see what I'm doing?
This is what I'm about.

454
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,505
Power suit, power tie, power steering.

455
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:27,671
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

456
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,676
So that's, like, a metaphor.

457
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:37,121
Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy.

458
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,021
So when I do this...

459
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:45,327
this is more like me saying
that I will literally break your shit off...

460
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,299
if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin?

461
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,630
Got it.

462
00:32:57,678 --> 00:32:59,646
No.

463
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:04,012
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

464
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:07,052
No, somebody famous. You know that.

465
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:08,981
- Sara Melas?
- No.

466
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,482
Okay. Bye.

467
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,391
I need your signature.

468
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,274
<i>I hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.</i>

469
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:36,848
<i>So this is me not calling. Over.</i>

470
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,919
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

471
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:42,920
I've been thinking about
that sign on your forehead.

472
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:47,049
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

473
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:50,793
I can't. I have a couple of parties
I have to hit.

474
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,126
<i>Gossip never sleeps.</i>

475
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,625
Not till about 4:00 a.m.

476
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,433
Saturday.

477
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,930
I have a date.

478
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:06,378
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance", Miss Melas?

479
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,573
An excuse to be obnoxious?

480
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,740
<i>Continuing in a course of action...</i>

481
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:15,117
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

482
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,582
Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you?

483
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,660
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

484
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:24,662
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

485
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:29,931
Come on.

486
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,805
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

487
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,741
You forgot to say "over". Over.

488
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:41,271
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

489
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:44,350
7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina. Over and out.

490
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:48,686
7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy?
I don't do 7:00 a.m.

491
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,022
- Hello?
- Sign here.

492
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,086
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

493
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:55,320
Yeah.

494
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:00,766
What if I would have said Friday?

495
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,095
Sunday.

496
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:09,036
So I guess you're not going to church.

497
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,551
Do you really expect me to wear this?

498
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,618
It'll be awful cold out there without it.

499
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:31,857
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

500
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,567
You're a lot taller than I remember.

501
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,639
You ever ride one of these?

502
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,402
Not on the Hudson.

503
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,534
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

504
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,306
If there's time.

505
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:50,376
- But you might need these.
- All right.

506
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:51,882
- Bam.
- Wow.

507
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,576
How do I look?

508
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:57,153
Fabulous.

509
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,688
All right, I give.

510
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:03,155
Where do I change?

511
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:08,727
So we'll go past the wall, then take a left.
It's pretty much a straight shot from there.

512
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,100
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

513
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,900
What you do with these babies is...

514
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:17,238
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

515
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,816
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

516
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,613
Did you put gas in it?

517
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:39,147
No. You know, I think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something.

518
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,727
Gross. Try it again.

519
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,124
You want me to call AAA?

520
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,725
Come on around
and let me hop on with you.

521
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,567
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

522
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:57,370
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,502
All right, hop on.

524
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,878
- Scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

525
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,214
But you don't know where we're going.

526
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:09,049
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

527
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,485
Man, male egos.

528
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:16,426
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

529
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,656
What? It is not my ego.

530
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:21,529
I just don't want to ruin the surprise.

531
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:34,375
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

532
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,418
There. I always keep a few of those around.

533
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:40,577
Thank you.

534
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,679
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

535
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,125
No. That's a fresh one.

536
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:50,690
So, Ellis Island.

537
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:55,094
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

538
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:56,759
I figured that. Most people haven't.

539
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,463
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

540
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:01,597
- Great!
- Anything for Hitch.

541
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:06,474
It was originally known as Oyster Island.

542
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,275
The island was expanded
to its present size...

543
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:13,546
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

544
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:15,879
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

545
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:19,220
- Did you know this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought you here.

546
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:24,127
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry...

547
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:28,291
back to a single man, woman, or child
on the ship's manifest...

548
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,460
to an inspector's ledger.

549
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:35,997
By 1910, 75% of the residents of New York...

550
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:39,441
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston...

551
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,344
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

552
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:46,009
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities...

553
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:50,248
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

554
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:52,852
It's called The Kissing Post.

555
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:57,762
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

556
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:01,964
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

557
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:03,867
I mean...

558
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,172
- That count?
- No.

559
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:15,010
I actually had a relative come through here.

560
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,106
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,445
What?

562
00:40:21,354 --> 00:40:24,517
- What?
- What was that thing?

563
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:29,161
No. You know, I was just thinking...

564
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:33,464
you can't really know where you're going
until you know where you've been.

565
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:36,467
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

566
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,197
That's kind of deep for a first date,
don't you think?

567
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,144
What is that?

568
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,493
Oh, my God!

569
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:16,737
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That's his signature.

570
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,867
Jesus, it's right here!

571
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,940
How did you know?

572
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:27,910
Hitch did the search. I just found the page.

573
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:52,942
I'm sorry.

574
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:05,486
I saw that going differently in my mind.

575
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:12,387
So my family never saw him again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

576
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:15,132
Look, I'm really sorry.

577
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:19,594
When I saw it on the computer,
it said, "the Butcher of Cádiz".

578
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:26,074
I thought it was a profession,
not a headline.

579
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,144
It's just one of those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

580
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,317
But thank you.

581
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,785
No, it was...

582
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,982
- A train wreck.
- No.

583
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,591
Let me get you a cab.

584
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:45,659
Thanks.

585
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,867
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

586
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,805
Taxi!

587
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:07,077
Poor guy.
Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble.

588
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:12,022
It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

589
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,287
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

590
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:19,789
Right?

591
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:23,460
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait. You're seeing him again?

592
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:28,804
Well, look, you said that
I'm always expecting men...

593
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:31,968
to let me down, right?
Assuming that they're gonna fail?

594
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:33,545
Which he did.

595
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,372
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

596
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,417
I mean, Case, he really tanked.

597
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:44,752
And that's a desirable trait?

598
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:48,323
Yeah. Weird, huh?

599
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:53,458
Now, just keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

600
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,090
We're just leaving a message.

601
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:58,432
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

602
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,135
<i>Hello?</i>

603
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:05,505
She's on the phone!

604
00:44:08,114 --> 00:44:10,082
<i>- Yes. Hello, Miss Cole?
- Yeah.</i>

605
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:12,276
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

606
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,853
- One moment, please.
- No. Tell her I'm at lunch.

607
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:17,889
We called her to tell her you're at lunch?

608
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:26,590
Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman.

609
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,361
Hi, how are you?

610
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,799
Good. I'm doing good.

611
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:35,265
The reason I'm calling
is about our appointment this Wednesday.

612
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:37,739
Not gonna be able to make it.

613
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,938
Well, when can you make it?

614
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,014
When can I do it?

615
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:49,785
I don't even know,
because my whole next week is slammed.

616
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:53,185
Right. But it's all good.

617
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:58,223
No, we're gonna make it happen though,
that's for sure.

618
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,730
We're going to make it happen. Yes.

619
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:10,976
What's going on over there?

620
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:13,477
Just moving some things around.

621
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:16,845
Sky Studios.

622
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,351
Tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

623
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:21,715
Designer friend.

624
00:45:21,854 --> 00:45:25,915
I just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in.

625
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,390
Yeah, definitely.

626
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:31,258
Well, great.
Then I will put you back on with my...

627
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:52,180
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

628
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:53,616
Great. One more.

629
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,848
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

630
00:45:57,156 --> 00:45:59,522
I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie?

631
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,583
Late as usual.

632
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:07,529
<i>Tonight I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.</i>

633
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,731
<i>Do you know why I want you to do that?</i>

634
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,698
Because I'm cool?

635
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:13,635
- No.
- I know, I'm not.

636
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:16,272
I'm saying that you are an iceberg...

637
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:20,402
in that over 90% of your mass
is below the surface.

638
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,207
I know I'm heavy. I am.

639
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:26,752
<i>I'm talking about who you are.
It's a metaphor.</i>

640
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,218
<i>Accounting, business...</i>

641
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:32,917
<i>all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.</i>

642
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,457
One more.

643
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:38,126
It's gonna be loud in there...

644
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,892
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier...

645
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,262
<i>in a non-sleazy way.</i>

646
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:45,394
<i>So get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.</i>

647
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:47,939
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back...

648
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,838
and say it in her ear like a secret.

649
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:53,377
<i>Watch your hand placement.
Too high says, "I just wanna be friends".</i>

650
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:55,845
Too low says, "I just wanna grab some ass".

651
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,577
Friends. Ass. Me.

652
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:07,348
Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity...

653
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,951
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

654
00:47:11,064 --> 00:47:12,827
<i>She's classy, so she'll introduce you.</i>

655
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:16,492
When she does, shake hands hard
and speak up. Let them know you're there.

656
00:47:16,602 --> 00:47:18,467
Show her you can handle being her escort.

657
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:21,768
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doing?

658
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,204
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

659
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:26,509
These guys are friends with Maggie.

660
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:29,806
- Been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am...

661
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:32,510
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

662
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:35,813
Did you see the new installation at MOMA?

663
00:47:36,055 --> 00:47:38,785
- Yes, did you think...
- Disgusting.

664
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:43,624
Women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

665
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,422
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

666
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:51,134
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

667
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,505
What was your name? Eggnog?

668
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:56,467
Egon.

669
00:47:56,976 --> 00:48:00,912
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

670
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:03,745
Let me guess. Disgusting?

671
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,550
Think it over. We'll be back.

672
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:12,083
Thank you. I can't stand those guys.

673
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:14,420
Really? I kind of liked them.

674
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,357
But when all is said and done...

675
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:19,156
tonight is not about Allegra.

676
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:22,662
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

677
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:26,994
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

678
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:28,868
So you can't afford to mess this up.

679
00:48:28,975 --> 00:48:31,443
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

680
00:48:31,978 --> 00:48:34,811
Hi, Maggie.
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

681
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:36,312
I'm Maggie.

682
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,378
- No, you're not.
- Actually, I am.

683
00:48:40,853 --> 00:48:44,289
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

684
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,686
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

685
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,397
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

686
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:57,435
So tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

687
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:58,702
Maggie.

688
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:02,398
- Where does your inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

689
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:04,800
Anything I see.

690
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:08,975
Something in a magazine,
out on the street...

691
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:10,673
in an old movie.

692
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:15,279
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

693
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:17,680
Anybody want any spring rolls?

694
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,123
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
This whole thing, it just works.

695
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,826
Thank you.

696
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:27,261
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

697
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:29,924
I like him.

698
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:34,769
About the deejay.
Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy.

699
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:37,775
But if she asks, you cannot say no.

700
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:40,744
I'm not worried about dancing.
But if there are people there...

701
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:45,307
I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler,
but I need to be thorough.

702
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:49,077
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

703
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:51,418
Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do.

704
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:56,620
That's what it's all about, right there.

705
00:49:57,363 --> 00:49:58,660
See how it gets bigger?

706
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,458
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

707
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:07,603
But the feet are going.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

708
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:09,169
Hips are always going.

709
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:12,139
Can't get enough hip.

710
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:14,846
From there, the Q-Tip.

711
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:19,248
Q-Tip. Throw it away.

712
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:22,011
That's not working, hit them with this.

713
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:33,527
Don't ever...

714
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:35,559
do that again.

715
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,430
Do you hear me?

716
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:41,137
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

717
00:50:42,608 --> 00:50:45,805
Not like that, you're not, all right?

718
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:50,247
This is where you live.

719
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,549
Right here.

720
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:55,644
You live right here, okay? This is home.

721
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:57,313
None of this.

722
00:50:57,957 --> 00:50:59,618
I don't wanna see none of that.

723
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:01,818
Don't need no pizza. They got food there.

724
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:13,130
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

725
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:15,970
Don't you bite your lip. Stop it.

726
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:38,653
Women relate dancing to sex, all right?

727
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:41,756
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these.

728
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:45,428
Okay, now that's what I need to be learning.

729
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:57,846
Can't stop it.

730
00:51:58,517 --> 00:52:00,382
You cannot stop it.

731
00:52:02,822 --> 00:52:03,982
Next subject.

732
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,081
Get out.

733
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:13,459
Thanks.

734
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,992
So, are you a Knicks fan?

735
00:52:18,037 --> 00:52:19,732
When they're good.

736
00:52:26,278 --> 00:52:28,439
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

737
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:32,115
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch of messages.

738
00:52:32,618 --> 00:52:34,245
My phone fell in the Hudson.

739
00:52:34,387 --> 00:52:35,752
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

740
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:40,750
I don't believe this.

741
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,796
- I thought he was a bodyguard.
- I'm the only one who will need protection.

742
00:52:45,197 --> 00:52:47,597
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

743
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:51,726
When I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

744
00:52:52,705 --> 00:52:55,173
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

745
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:58,905
- Tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

746
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,104
Does this even look like dancing to you?

747
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,414
That's just a little bit of me being me.

748
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:08,111
No, that's you being a lot of something
you don't need to ever be again.

749
00:53:08,454 --> 00:53:09,978
- It's just one dance.
- No.

750
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:15,150
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

751
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:18,023
Just one shot to make the difference...

752
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,621
between happily ever after and:

753
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:24,495
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once".

754
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,460
All right?

755
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:34,874
- What?
- You said "kiss".

756
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,073
Is that a problem?

757
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:42,613
It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole.

758
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:45,054
Eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss...

759
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:48,183
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship.

760
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:51,730
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

761
00:53:52,198 --> 00:53:54,530
- She has?
- Of course.

762
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:58,262
Not that she's gonna act on it.
So it's no real big deal.

763
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:01,496
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal!

764
00:54:01,607 --> 00:54:03,074
- Huge.
- Monumental!

765
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:05,143
You are not listening...

766
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,739
I need you to wrap your head around this.

767
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:11,646
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

768
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:15,647
could have her last first kiss.

769
00:54:26,632 --> 00:54:28,930
All right, come on,
just show me what you got.

770
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:32,431
- What do you mean?
- Just show me how you would kiss me.

771
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:34,365
I wouldn't kiss you.

772
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,273
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

773
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:40,772
But you're really not, so...

774
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,748
Okay, Albert, end of the night,
you're dropping me off at home.

775
00:54:44,984 --> 00:54:47,578
- Show me the magic.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

776
00:54:47,686 --> 00:54:51,281
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

777
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,085
Yeah, how about those Knicks?

778
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:58,621
You see what I'm doing?
This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.

779
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:00,323
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

780
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:03,299
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

781
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:05,495
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

782
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,204
I'm fiddling.

783
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,171
Okay, you have a good night now...

784
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,740
- You see what I'm doing?
- Robbing me?

785
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:14,904
No.

786
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:18,011
This is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

787
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,908
But you're not most guys.

788
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,815
<i>See, the secret to a kiss
is to go 90% of the way...</i>

789
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:27,152
and then hold.

790
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:34,325
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

791
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,731
<i>for her to come the other 10%.</i>

792
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,734
<i>Okay, 90% - 10%. Got it.</i>

793
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:42,170
Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn.

794
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:48,277
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

795
00:55:50,883 --> 00:55:54,114
I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra...

796
00:55:56,088 --> 00:55:57,555
with a beard.

797
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,023
What's up?

798
00:56:32,925 --> 00:56:35,758
<i>- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you mean? I came 90%.</i>

799
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,920
I'm not feeling like you want it.

800
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:42,524
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

801
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:46,401
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

802
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:48,803
Now, show me the magic, Albert.

803
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,675
- What the hell was that?
- I'm showing you the magic!

804
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,903
<i>No, I said come 90% and then I come 10%!</i>

805
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:55,571
<i>You don't go the whole 100%!</i>

806
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:59,173
My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...

807
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:04,188
Other than that, how was it?

808
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:08,387
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

809
00:57:08,894 --> 00:57:11,362
He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way.

810
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,521
For all I know, he's adorable.

811
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:16,096
But him dating her is...

812
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:17,792
You seem stressed.

813
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:19,666
You and I had an understanding.

814
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:22,263
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

815
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:23,931
I didn't invite her.

816
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:26,703
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

817
00:57:26,812 --> 00:57:29,110
- So you invited Albert?
- No.

818
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:33,809
Look, it says here the tickets
went to some guy named Alex Hitchens.

819
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:34,943
What?

820
00:57:46,432 --> 00:57:47,694
Machine.

821
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,697
Hi, it's Sara.

822
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,908
I just wanted to say thank you...

823
00:57:59,044 --> 00:58:03,743
for an unforgettable experience...

824
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,209
the other day.

825
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,119
And if you ever want to see
your shirt again...

826
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:13,180
you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00.

827
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,527
Okay, bye.

828
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:21,430
- Do you think he'll show?
- Yeah.

829
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,600
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

830
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:27,770
Is this a source or a date?

831
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:30,271
A source.

832
00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:32,937
Well, it sounded like a date.

833
00:58:33,979 --> 00:58:35,446
Well, it was supposed to.

834
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:41,814
So it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date...

835
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:45,315
- but it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

836
00:58:46,525 --> 00:58:47,685
Just checking.

837
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,542
Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message.

838
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:15,311
I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
You must be a glutton for punishment.

839
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:18,416
Either that or I really wanna pay you back.

840
00:59:18,824 --> 00:59:20,689
I think this is yours.

841
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:24,994
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

842
00:59:25,464 --> 00:59:27,523
Really? There's a whole wall?
