1			
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:35,312			 
			
			
2			
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,678			
It started with a chair.			
			
3			
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,944			
I've wanted this for a really long time.			
			
4			
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:17,585			
I know.			

5
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:20,931
Wizard.

6
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,771
Jeez Banana, shut your freakin' gob OK?

7
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:38,376
This is the most magnificent discarded
living room set I’ve ever seen.

8
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,531
Well, well, if it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog.

9
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:12,921
Back for another test?

10
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,248
I think the first one was defective,

11
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:19,640
The plus sign looks more like a division symbol, 
so I remain unconvinced.

12
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:26,016
Third test today, Momma Bear, 
your eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.

13
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,979
It's really easy to tell, is your
nipples real brown?

14
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:33,384
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms,
knocked you up twice.

15
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,759
Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank 
my weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.

16
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,383
Well, you know where the lavatory is.

17
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,167
Pay for that pee stick when you're done.

18
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,805
Don't think it's yours just 'cause 
you marked it with your urine.

19
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:21,422
What's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle: 
Minus or plus?

20
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,593
I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.

21
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,107
I'll take some of these.

22
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,857
There it is.

23
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,655
The little pink plus sign is so unholy.

24
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:42,450
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch, this is
one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.

25
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,697
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

26
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,294
I'm a suicide risk.

27
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:09,590
Juno?

28
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,424
No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you have any 
bones that need collecting?

29
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,736
Only the one in my pants.

30
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,332
I'm pregnant.

31
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,346
What? Honest to blog?

32
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,361
Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

33
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,985
It's probably just a food baby,
did you have a big lunch?

34
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,736
This is not a food baby, I've taken three 
pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.

35
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,645
How did you even generate enough pee for 
three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.

36
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:41,502
I don't know, I drank like ten tons of SunnyD.

37
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:46,064
I'm telling you I'm pregnant and 
you're acting shockingly cavalier.

38
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,546
Is this for real? 
Like for real for real?

39
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,626
Unfortunately yes.

40
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh, my God!

41
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,295
Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

42
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,313
That was kind of the emotion that I was
searching for on the first take.

43
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:06,501
Are you going to Havenbrook or Women Now?
You need a note from your parents for Havenbrook.

44
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:11,437
Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women Now,
just 'cause they help out women now.

45
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,142
Do you want me to call for you? 
Because I called for Becky last year.

46
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:18,343
No, I can call myself. Oh, but I do need your help 
with something, it's like critically important.

47
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,344
You know, heavy lifting can really only 
help you at this point.

48
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,031
Seriously.

49
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,641
So, you were bored? That's how
this blessed miracle came to be?

50
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:33,238
No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the sex,
not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.

51
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:38,682
So, when did you decide that you were 
gonna do Bleeker?

52
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:40,762
I don't know.

53
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,088
A year ago in Spanish class.

54
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,371
You love him.

55
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,306
It's actually really complicated, OK?

56
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:58,605
And I don't feel like talking about it
in my fragile state.

57
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:00,901
So what was it like?

58
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,073
Humping Bleek's bony bod?

59
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,401
Magnificent.

60
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,537
Hey, Bleek.

61
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:47,911
Wicked tiger.

62
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:49,754
It looks proud.

63
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,535
I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.

64
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:57,286
Wow, your shorts are like 
especially gold today.

65
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,425
My mom uses color-safe bleach.

66
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,114
Go Carole.

67
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,441
I'll tell her.

68
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:11,208
When I see them all running like that,
with their things bouncing around in their shorts,

69
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,768
I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to,
all I see is pork swords.

70
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:18,629
I'm supposed to be running.

71
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,956
So guess what.

72
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:23,519
What? I don't know.

73
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:26,582
I'm pregnant.

74
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:39,379
What should we do?

75
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:48,157
Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just nip it 
in the bud before it gets worse.

76
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,268
Because they were talking about it in health class,

77
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,501
how pregnancy can often lead to an infant.

78
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,128
Typically, yeah, yeah.

79
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,893
That's what happens when
our moms and teachers get pregnant.

80
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,924
So, you're cool with that then?

81
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,595
Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,

82
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,516
do whatever you think you should do, you know?

83
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,297
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,

84
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,143
I know it wasn't your idea.

85
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,438
Whose idea was it?

86
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:26,375
I'll see you at school , alright?

87
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,594
Whose idea was it?

88
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,023
Hey, your book fell apart.

89
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:01,867
Right.

90
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,508
It must have looked at your face.

91
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,430
The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo
secretly wants me.

92
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,023
Jocks like him
always want freaky girls.

93
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:16,817
Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan
footwear and Goth makeup.

94
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,505
Girls who play the cello and read McSweeney's 
and want to be children’s librarians when they grow up.

95
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,522
Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.

96
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,083
They just won’t admit it, because they’re 
supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders you know,

97
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,915
Like Leah, who incidentally is into teachers.

98
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,431
Me too, I love Woody Allen!

99
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:42,258
Alright people.

100
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,022
We're doing chromatography lab today, 
so find your partners and break into  groups of four.

101
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,694
Well, there's nothing like experimenting.

102
00:12:56,836 --> 00:13:00,632
I did the prep questions for this lab last night, 
so you can just copy my answers if you want.

103
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:01,896
I couldn’t copy your work.

104
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,867
You copy my work every week.

105
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,367
True, I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, aren't I?

106
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,649
No, no, I don't mind.
I think you definitely bring something to the table.

107
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:09,865
Charisma.

108
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,397
Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?

109
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,820
I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't 
really look at bright lights today.

110
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,741
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary 
and lie down. You never listen.

111
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,883
No, Josh, because I don't take orders.
Not from you and not from any man. 

112
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,209
You know, you've been acting like this ever since 
I got back from visiting my brother in Mankato.

113
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,303
I already told you, nothing happened.

114
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,242
Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.

115
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,007
Juno, do you want to plug in the Bunsen burner?

116
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:37,428
It's my pleasure.

117
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,459
I’m going to the infirmary.

118
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:39,770
Good. Call me when you get off the rag.

119
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,256
Fine, call me when you learn how to love someone,
instead of cheating at your brother's college,

120
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:47,287
Just because you've had four Smirnoff Ices and 
a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone’s!

121
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,007
Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to do that, 
I'll make a note of it.

122
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:57,472
I've actually heard that the Snow Peak Peach flavor
is the best flavor of Boone's.

123
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,888
Isn't that right, Bleek?

124
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,239


125
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,583
Oprimo numero dos.

126
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,800
Yeah, I'm just calling to 
procure a hasty abortion.

127
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,662
What?

128
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,847
Can you just hold on for a second,
I'm on my hamburger phone.

129
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,316
Okay, now I can,

130
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,883
Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.

131
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,347
Yeah, I need an abortion.

132
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,848
Sixteen.

133
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,896
I'm gonna say it's been about two months and
four days since the sex,

134
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,627
Mind you, that's just like a guestimation.

135
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,331
Sorry, how long have I been what?

136
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,814
Oh, I hate it when adults use the term
"sexually active".

137
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,629
What does it even mean?

138
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,143
Can I deactivate someday, or is this a
permanent state of being?

139
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:15,143
I guess Bleeker went live that night we did it, 
I guess that’s why he got that look on his face.

140
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:23,096
You should have seen this octopus furnace at work. 
I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get into the thing.

141
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,768
My dad used to be in the Army, but
now he’s just your average HVAC specialist.

142
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,660
He and my mom got divorced when I was five,

143
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,595
She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona 
with her new husband and three replacement kids.

144
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,191
Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus 
every Valentine’s Day.

145
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:42,329
And I’m like, “Thanks a heap, Coyote Ugly. This 
cactus-gram stings even worse than your abandonment.”

146
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:47,252
That’s my stepmom, Bren, 
she's completely obsessed with dogs.

147
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,328
Owns a nail salon and always smells 
like methylmethacrylate.

148
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,408
So Juno, how was your little maneuver last night?

149
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,815
Which maneuver, sir? The one where I moved 
an entire living room set from one lawn to the other,

150
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:03,051
or the one where I downed a sixty-four 
ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

151
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,250
Juno, did you by any chance barf in my urn?

152
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,454
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, 
the one I got up in Stillwater?

153
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:14,561
There was some blue shit,

154
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,219
I mean, gunk, stuff in there this morning.

155
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,765
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.

156
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:25,048
I mean, maybe L.B. did it.

157
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:31,216
Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that potato, 
I’m gonna kick your little monkey butt.

158
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:38,579
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

159
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,265
All babies want to get borned!

160
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,155
Hey Su-Chin.

161
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,060
Hi, Juno.

162
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:48,640
How are you?

163
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,225
You know, pretty solid.

164
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:55,250
So did you write that paper for Worth's class yet?

165
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,018
No, not yet.

166
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,297
I tried to work on it a little last night, 
but I’m having trouble concentrating.

167
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,375
I'll sell you some of my Adderall.

168
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,784
No thanks, I'm off pills.

169
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,377
That's a wise choice 'cause I knew this girl, 
she had this crazy freakout.

170
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,360
She took too many behavioral meds at once and she 
ripped off her clothes

171
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,736
and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall like,
“Blaaaaah! I’m a kraken from the sea!”

172
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:24,640
I heard that was you.

173
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,329
It was good seeing you, Su-Chin.

174
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,920
Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know?

175
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,080
It can feel pain,

176
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:38,672
And it has fingernails.

177
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,969
Fingernails? Really?

178
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,640
Welcome to Women Now, where
women are trusted friends.

179
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,685
Please put your hands where I can see them
and surrender any bombs.

180
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:08,515
Hey, I’m here for the big show.

181
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:10,639
Your name, please?

182
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:12,919
Juno MacGuff.

183
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,311
She thinks I’m using a fake name.
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

184
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:25,983
I need you to fill these out, both sides.
We need to know about every score and every sore.

185
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,343
Would you like a free condom?

186
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,014
They’re boysenberry.

187
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,169
No, I’m off sex.

188
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:38,623
My boyfriend uses them every time we have intercourse.

189
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,157
They make his jocks smell like pie.

190
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,687
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

191
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,000
God appreciates your miracle!

192
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,312
Dude, what are you doing here?

193
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:27,921
I'm supposed to come get you at four.

194
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,141
I couldn’t do it, Leah!

195
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,544
It smelled like a dentist office in there, 

196
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,657
And there were these horrible magazines 
with water stains.

197
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:39,797
And then the friggin' receptionist is trying to give me 
these condoms that looked like grape suckers,

198
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,673
and just babbling away about 
her friggin' boyfriend’s pie balls.

199
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,751
Yum!

200
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:49,296
And Su-Chin was there, and she was like, 
"Oh hi! Babies have fingernails." 

201
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:50,501
Fingernails!

202
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:51,751
That's gruesome.

203
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,421
You think the baby can scratch your 
vag on the way out?

204
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,358
I’m staying pregnant, Leah.

205
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:03,124
Dude! You gotta keep your voice down, my mom is inside.
She doesn’t know that we’re sexually active.

206
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,592
What does that even mean?

207
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,296
I've been thinking.

208
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,154
I was thinking that I could have this baby and 
give it to someone who totally needs it.

209
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,950
You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or
a couple of nice lesbos.

210
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:17,529
But then you’re gonna get huge and your 
chest is gonna milktate. 

211
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:23,761
- And you have to tell people that you’re pregnant.
- But maybe they’ll canonize me for being so selfless.

212
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:29,874
Maybe they’ll totally shit and be really mad and not 
let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.

213
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,826
I was going to go to
Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.

214
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:36,637
You should look at adoption ads,

215
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,433
I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.

216
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:41,107
They have ads for parents?

217
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:47,357
Yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." Right next to
terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.

218
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,059
It’s totally legit.

219
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:58,059
"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple 
have found true love with each other."

220
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,042
"All that’s missing is your bastard."

221
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:02,951
I want a parakeet.

222
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,012
You’re totally not even listening to me.

223
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:10,276
No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby to a family 
that describes themselves as "wholesome."

224
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,793
- Why?
- I want something a little more edgier.

225
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:17,653
- Okay, what did you have in mind exactly?
- I was thinking a graphic designer,

226
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:22,670
mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who dresses 
awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.

227
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,747
But I don't want to be too particular.

228
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:28,088
OK, how about this?

229
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:32,418
"Educated, successful couple seeking
infant to join our family of five."

230
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:36,901
"You will be compensated. Help us
complete the circle of love."

231
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,650
That sounds great.

232
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:43,713
They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they already 
have three kids, they're greedy little bitches.

233
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,884
Oh, Juno! How about this one?

234
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:51,479
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,

235
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,791
And they were beautiful even in black and white.

236
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,025
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

237
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:08,572
No, I don’t think so.

238
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,821
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

239
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,416
I’m not hungry, oddly.

240
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,759
But it’s breakfast for supper.
It's your favorite, Paul.

241
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:17,836
Yeah.

242
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,120
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running today.

243
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:24,149
You know how I feel about her.

244
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,260
You’ve mentioned it a couple times.

245
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,853
She is just ...

246
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:31,790
... different.

247
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:34,071
Yeah.

248
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,808
I 'm not really sure how I'm gonna spit this out.

249
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:04,510
Hon, did you get expelled?

250
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,871
No. The school would most likely contact you 
in the event of my expulsion.

251
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,432
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.

252
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:14,384
Do you need a large amount of money?
Legal counsel?

253
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,729
No, I’m not asking for anything.

254
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,402
Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would be 
friggin' sweet if no one hit me.

255
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,791
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit 
someone with the Previa?

256
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:24,935
No.

257
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,024
Dude, I think it's best to just tell them. 

258
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,617
I'm pregnant.

259
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:38,008
Oh, God.

260
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:42,118
But I’m going to give it up for adoption. 
I already found the perfect couple.

261
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,664
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

262
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:49,914
In thirty-odd weeks we can just pretend that this
never happened.

263
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,273
You're pregnant?

264
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:54,648
I'm sorry.

265
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:58,601
I’m sorry. 
And if it is any consolation,

266
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,615
I have heartburn that’s 
radiating down to my kneecaps

267
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,280
and I haven’t take a dump since Wednesday.

268
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,389
Morning!

269
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,125
I didn’t even know you were sexually active!

270
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:10,499
Who is the kid?

271
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,951
The baby? I don’t really know much about it. 
It has fingernails, allegedly.

272
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:16,855
Nails? Really?

273
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:17,934
Yeah.

274
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,139
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

275
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:25,529
It's Paulie Bleeker.

276
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:27,717
Paulie Bleeker?

277
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:30,294
What?

278
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,574
I didn’t think he had it in him!

279
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,952
I know, right?

280
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,716
Right, this is no laughing matter.

281
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,091
No, it's not.

282
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:40,792
And Paulie is actually great.

283
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,104


284
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:42,595
In chair.

285
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,793
You were thinking about adoption?

286
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:52,748
Yeah, there’s this couple. 
They’ve been trying to have a kid for five years.

287
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,152
We found them in the Penny Saver next to the 
exotic birds.

288
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:00,137
They have a legitimate lawyer and I was
going to go meet with them next weekend.

289
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:05,997
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. 
Probably tougher than you can understand right now.

290
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,574
I know ...

291
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,638
... It's just that I’m not ready to be a mom.

292
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,294
Damn skippy, you’re not!

293
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:17,151
You don’t even remember to give 
Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

294
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,824
That was once! And she did not die, if you recall!

295
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:25,744
Honey, had you considered, you
know, the alternative?

296
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:27,572
No.

297
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,918
Well, you’re a little Viking!

298
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,010
First things first,

299
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:34,869
we have to get you healthy.

300
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,056
You need prenatal vitamins,

301
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:40,275
Incidentally, they do incredible 
things for your nails, so that’s a plus.

302
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,183
Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor’s appointment. 
Figure out where you’re going to deliver.

303
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,385
Juno, I'm coming with you to meet this adoption people.

304
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,824
You’re just a kid. I don’t want you to get
ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.

305
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:53,728
Thanks, Dad.

306
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,946
I thought you were the kind of girl
who knew when to say when.

307
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,587
I don't really know what kind of girl I am.

308
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,758
Tell it to me straight, Bren. 
Do you think this is my fault?

309
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:24,540
I think kids get bored and have intercourse.

310
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,961
And I think Junebug was a dummy about it, Mac.

311
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,464
I am not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

312
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,009
You’re not going to be a Pop-Pop.

313
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:36,632
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing 
from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.

314
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,243
Did you see that coming when she sat us down here?

315
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,117
Yeah. But I was hoping she
was expelled or into hard drugs.

316
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:47,149
That was my first instinct too. 
Or D.W.I. Anything but this.

317
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,882
And I’m going to punch that Bleeker kid in
the weiner the next time I see him.

318
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:55,179
Mac, no. 
You know it wasn’t his idea.

319
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:06,197
Hi! I’m Vanessa. You must be Juno
and Mr. MacGuff.

320
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,027
Vanessa.

321
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:09,480
It's Vanessa, right?

322
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:13,399
Thanks for having me and my 
irresponsible child over to your house.

323
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:14,918
Oh no. Thank you.

324
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,184


325
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,589
Come on in.

326
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,216
Can I take your coat or your hat?

327
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:21,668
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.

328
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:27,856
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. 
Not like those people with fake woods in the background,

329
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:30,089
Honestly, who do they think they're fooling?

330
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,011
You found us in the Penny Saver?

331
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:34,260
Hi. Mark Loring. I’m the husband.

332
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,743
- How you doing? Mac McGuff.
- Nice to meet you.

333
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:38,620
Hi.

334
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,744
This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.

335
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,009
Gerta Rauss.

336
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,198
Hi, pleased to meet you.

337
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,416
And this, of course, is Juno.

338
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:50,933
Like the city in Alaska.

339
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:51,980
No.

340
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:53,354
No?

341
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,635
Hon?

342
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,571
Shall we sit down and get to know one another?

343
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,071
I thought I'd get some drinks.

344
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:02,479
What would anyone like? 
I have Pellegrino or Vitamin Water or orange juice.

345
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:04,946
A Maker’s Mark, please. Up.

346
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:07,820
She’s kidding.

347
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:11,977
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, 
just one of her many genetic gifts.

348
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,070
I see.

349
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:19,602
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?

350
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:20,898
I’m a junior.

351
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,946
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

352
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,741
Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday to the doctor 
and they said I was twelve weeks.

353
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:32,134
Oh, that’s marvelous.

354
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,242
So you’re into your second trimester?

355
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:38,116
Yeah, apparently.

356
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,212
I’m due on May 4.

357
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,211
Great.

358
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,760
My girlfriends tell me the first couple 
months are the hardest.

359
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,584
I didn't notice it at all.

360
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:52,163
I’m more concerned about when they have to 
put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.

361
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,633
I think pregnancy is beautiful.

362
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,927
Well, you’re lucky it’s not you.

363
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:03,208
So, let’s talk how we’re gonna do this...thing.

364
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:05,741
Well, don't I just have the thing?

365
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,928
Squeeze it on out and hand it over?

366
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,022
Mark and Vanessa are willing to
negotiate an open adoption.

367
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,507
What does that mean?

368
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:20,054
It means they’d send annual updates, photos, 
let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up.

369
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,445
Whoah. I don’t want photos or any kind
of notification.

370
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:32,395
Can’t we just kick this old school? I stick the baby 
in a basket and send it your way. Like Moses in the reeds.

371
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:35,209
Technically, that would be kickin’ it Old Testament.

372
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,224
Exactly! Right? 

373
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,411
Do you know what I mean?

374
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,803
Like in the good old days. 
When it was quick and dirty.

375
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:48,803
Well, then we all agree a traditional closed adoption 
would be best for all involved?

376
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:52,161
Shit, yes, just close her on up.

377
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:55,363
Obviously, we would compensate you for
all your medical expenses.

378
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,520
Are you looking for any other
type of compensation?

379
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:01,536
Excuse me?

380
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,083
No.

381
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,738
No, I don't want to sell the thing, I just ...

382
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:10,753
... I want ...

383
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,707
... I just want the baby to be with people 
who are gonna love it,

384
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,456
And be good parents, you know?

385
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,957
I’m in high school. 

386
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:26,518
I’m ill-equipped.

387
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:31,832
You’re doing a beautiful and a
selfless thing for us.

388
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:34,518
Vanessa has wanted a baby ever since we
got married.

389
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,082
I want to be a mommy so badly!

390
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:38,456
You don’t say.

391
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,128
Have you ever felt like
you were just born to do something?

392
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:42,767
Yes.

393
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,191
Heating and air conditioning.

394
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,737
There you go.

395
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:47,909
I was born to be a mother.

396
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,455
Some of us are.

397
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:54,050
How about you, Mark, 
are you looking forward to being a dad?

398
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:56,096
Betcha, yeah.

399
00:31:57,439 --> 00:32:00,956
Every guy wants to be a father. 
Wants to coach the soccer team and

400
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:04,938
help out with the science fair and the 
volcano goes off.

401
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,191
Yeah, all that.

402
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:12,502
Maybe Gerta could take us through the 
preliminary documents that you have drawn up.

403
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:19,142
Could I use the facilities first? Being pregnant 
makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

404
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:25,313
The downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled, but if you go
upstairs, then to the right ...

405
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,001
Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.

406
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:29,312
Is she alright?

407
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:17,983
Sorry.

408
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,481
Sorry, I didn’t expect to see you up here.

409
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:20,904
I just came up to get something.

410
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,530
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?

411
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:24,904
No.

412
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,576
Do we come off as 
paranoid yuppies or something?

413
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,685
I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.

414
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:33,890
Really?

415
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:35,828
It's Clinique Happy.

416
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:38,046
Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!

417
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:41,045
Is that supposed to make me feel happy?

418
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:42,903
You should feel happy, Holmes.

419
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:47,700
I’m giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. 
Sweet, screaming, pooping life!

420
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,078
And you don’t even have to be there when it 
comes out all covered in ...

421
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:51,355
Viscera?

422
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,686
Blood and guts.

423
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,216
Is that a Les Paul?

424
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:00,670
Yes, it is.

425
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,888
Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff.

426
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,107
She gave you your own room in your 
whole house for your stuff?

427
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:11,152
She’s got you on a long leash there, Mark.

428
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:13,699
Oh, it's beautiful.

429
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:16,935
You know? I always loved
Gibson way more than Fender.

430
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:19,262
What do you play?

431
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:21,073
I rock a Harmony.

432
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,278
So is it mahagony?

433
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:29,732
What happens if you crack the neck?

434
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:33,029
Tell me about it. I used to play in this really tight band
when I lived in Chicago and one night we opened up 

435
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:37,229
for the Melvins and I busted that thing right on stage 
and it cost me $800 just to get it fixed.

436
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:40,606
When was that?

437
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,620
‘93. Best time for rock and roll.

438
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:48,543
Nuh-uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.

439
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:49,979
You're crazy. 

440
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:51,307
You weren’t there, 

441
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:52,978
You couldn't understand the magic.

442
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,418
You weren’t even alive!

443
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:57,557
What’s that?

444
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:02,152
It's a Pilates machine.

445
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:05,697
What do you make with it?

446
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,371
You don’t make anything. It’s for
exercising.

447
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,792
My wife ordered one of those

448
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,541
Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.

449
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,496
You know, from the guy with the ponytail?

450
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,104
That guy just doesn’t look right to me.

451
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll be right back.

452
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:33,964
Excuse me.

453
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:43,852
Hi.

454
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:45,241
Hi.

455
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:46,648
You're playing music?

456
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:48,959
Juno wanted a little closer look at
Kimber.

457
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:51,193
Your guitar is named Kimber?

458
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:52,196
Yeah.

459
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:57,631
That’s cool. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, 
not Ted. He was the hot one with polio.

460
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:02,304
Gerta is downstairs, we still have 

461
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,256
a lot of stuff to go over.

462
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:06,774
I got it.

463
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,382
Not to interrupt the jam session.

464
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:16,787
So, just look these over and if you have any questions,
call me at my office.

465
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:22,145
We would really appreciate it if you would just keep us 
updated on any doctor’s appointments,

466
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,178
Ultrasounds,
anything of that nature.

467
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:28,395
For sure. You want to
know how your kid is cooking, I get it.

468
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:31,115
You think you’re really
going to do this, then?

469
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,302
Yeah. I like you guys.

470
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,131
How sure would you say you are? 

471
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:44,456
Would you say you’re 80% sure, 90% sure?

472
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,739
I’m going to say I’m about 104% sure.

473
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,363
Really?

474
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:55,896
Seriously, if I could just have the thing and
give it to you now, I totally would,

475
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,381
But I'm guessing it looks probably like a
Sea Monkey right now,

476
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,036
And we should let it get a little cuter, right?

477
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,473
- Yeah.
- Great.

478
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:05,816
Keep it in the oven.

479
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,050
I think that's a great idea.

480
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:08,222
Nice to meet you both.

481
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,207
Please, drive carefully.
Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.

482
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:13,691

483
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,575
- Take care.
- Buh bye.

484
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:50,986
Hey, man.

485
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,735
Hey, Vijay.

486
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,472
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

487
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:55,941
Yeah.

488
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:58,518
- Like our moms and teachers!
- Yeah.

489
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,861
Did you hear it’s yours?

490
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,722
Yup.

491
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:04,752
What a trip, man.

492
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,861
I don’t really know too much about it.

493
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:08,984
You should grow a moustache.

494
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:10,766
I can’t.

495
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,908
Me neither.

496
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,673
But I’m going to stop wearing underpants. 

497
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,189
Raise my sperm count.

498
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:43,501
Juno, hey.

499
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:44,407
Hey, Bleek.

500
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:47,324
Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies after 
school and we're gonna donut that flick

501
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:50,032
with the guy who has eighteen kids.

502
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,501
Do you want to come?

503
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:54,858
Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.

504
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:56,733
Oh, really?

505
00:38:58,267 --> 00:38:59,048
Can I ...

506
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,703
... Should I come?

507
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:05,859
Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,

508
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,921
But maybe I could drop by later.

509
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,811
Okay, cool.

510
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,703
- Later, Bleek.
- See ya.

511
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:17,296
I'll save you a seat.

512
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,124
There's your baby.

513
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,154
Oh, my God.

514
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,563
There's a hand.

515
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,232
And an arm.

516
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,047
And there's the feet.

517
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,576
Would you look at that?

518
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,732
Check out Baby Big-Head. Dude, that 
thing is freaky looking!

519
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:57,138
Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.

520
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,390
All you’ve got in your stomach is Taco Bell!

521
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,279
It's amazing that there's actually saps that
cry at this.

522
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,389
What? I'm not made of stone.

523
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:09,000
Well, there you have it.

524
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:11,125
Would you like to know the sex?

525
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,342
- Yes.
- No.

526
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,311
- Please, Junebug?
- No sex.

527
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:16,966
Planning to be surprised when you deliver?

528
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,639
I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if 
you told me, I'll just ruin everything.

529
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,951
Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school?

530
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:25,433
No, they’re the adoptive parents.

531
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

532
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,638
What’s that supposed to mean?

533
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:34,261
I just see a lot of teenage mothers
come through here.

534
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,512
It’s obviously a poisonous environment 
to raise a baby in.

535
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:39,544
How do you know that I’m so poisonous?

536
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:43,138
What if these adoptive parents
turn out to be evil molesters?

537
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:45,356
Or like stage parents.

538
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,991
They could be utterly negligent.
Maybe they’ll do a far shittier job 

539
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,091
of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter 
ever would. Have you considered that?

540
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,464
No, I guess not.

541
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:56,183
What is your job title, exactly?

542
00:40:57,214 --> 00:41:00,059
I’m an ultrasound technician, ma’am.

543
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:04,010
Well I’m a nail technician, and I think we both 
ought to stick to what we know.

544
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:05,323
Excuse me?

545
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,543
You think you’re so special because you get to play 
Picture Pages up there?

546
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,807
My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, 
she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.

547
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:16,121
So why don’t you go back to night school in Manteno 
and learn a real trade!

548
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:23,558
Bren, you’s a dick!

549
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:26,010
I love it.

550
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:31,288
Juno? Wow, I didn’t expect to see you here.

551
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:34,602
I have something really cool to
show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

552
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,182
No, actually she’s working late tonight.

553
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,040
She’s trying to accrue as much
time off as she can before ...

554
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,164
Oh right. I hear these are quite the time-suck.

555
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:46,631
Wanna come in? I was just having a Ginseng Cooler.

556
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,211
Would you like one?

557
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,587
What is it with you rich people and your 
herb-infused juices?

558
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,678
It's probably got something to do with those 
forty four-packs they come in.

559
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:57,492
They’re not bad, though.

560
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,616
Why aren’t you at work?

561
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:02,227
I work mostly from home. I’m a composer.

562
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:04,882
No shit. 

563
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:06,819
Like Johannes Brahms?

564
00:43:07,178 --> 00:43:08,991
No, more commercial stuff.

565
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:10,570
Like what?

566
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,054
Commercials.

567
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,647
Have you seen the ads for the
Titanium Power men’s deodorant?

568
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:28,147
Paid for this kitchen.

569
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:31,929
You’re quite the sellout, Mark.

570
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:35,397
What would the Melvins say?

571
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:38,255
Did you say you had something to show me.

572
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,726
Behold, good sir! Your future child.

573
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:44,647
Hey, look at that.

574
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,272
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

575
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:53,692
Is he also bald and amorphous?

576
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,082
No, he’s the dad.

577
00:43:58,537 --> 00:43:59,552
Can you tell if it’s a boy or a girl?

578
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,490
I can't, the doctor can. 
But I kind of want it to be a surprise.

579
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:08,020
Well, it can only go one of two ways.

580
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:14,723
That’s what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might 
end up with one of those scary neuter-babies that’s born without junk.

581
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,317
Junk, huh?

582
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,441
You know, it’s parts.

583
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:19,755
I know what junk is.

584
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:20,724
Yeah, right.

585
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,036
We definitely want it to have some junk, please.

586
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,192
Well, you don’t need to worry about a thing.

587
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,195
My stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy.

588
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:31,081
I can't stand in front of the microwave 
and no red M&Ms. 

589
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:33,878
I hope you're ready.

590
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:37,332
Ooh... do you hear that?

591
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:39,222
What?

592
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:43,658
This is my favorite song. It’s Sonic Youth doing 
"Superstar" by the Carpenters.

593
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:43,973


594
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:45,753
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.

595
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:49,471
Chick drummer, freaky dude. Not
unlike the White Stripes.

596
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:52,144
You haven’t heard the Carpenters like this. Just listen.

597
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:03,741
Yeah, I like this.

598
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:06,130
What did you say your favorite band was?

599
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:11,709
Didn’t. It’s a three-way tie between the Stooges, 
Patti Smith and the Runaways.

600
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,520
I definitely need to make you some CDs. 
At least while my kid's in there.

601
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,208
The Wizard of Gore?

602
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,567
That is Herschel Gordon Lewis. 
He’s the ultimate master of horror.

603
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:29,505
Please. Dario Argento is so the ultimate
master of horror.

604
00:45:30,848 --> 00:45:31,817
Argento?

605
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:35,472
He's alright, but Lewis is
completely dimented.

606
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:42,505
We’re talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup
all over the place. Fake brains coming out the yin-yang.

607
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,692
Quite frankly, this looks a little stupid.

608
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:48,597
Give me the tape.

609
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,646
This is even better than Suspiria.

610
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:06,926
What'd I tell ya?

611
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,800
You have decent taste in slasher movies.

612
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:13,064
Here’s to dovetailing interests.

613
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,370
Have you guys thought of
any names for the baby yet?

614
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:23,558
Sort of, yes. Vanessa likes
Madison for a girl.

615
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:28,946
Madison?

616
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:33,994
Isn't that a little, gay?

617
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:39,885
Well, pretentious much? Should everyone just have a 
mysterious name like Juno?

618
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,776
My dad went through this huge obsession with
Roman and Greek mythology.

619
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:50,181
He decided to name me after Zeus’s wife,

620
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:55,259
Zeus had tons of lays, but I’m pretty sure
Juno was his only wife.

621
00:46:56,711 --> 00:47:00,463
She was supposed to be really beautiful but
really mean. Like Diana Ross.

622
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:03,244
That suits you.

623
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:06,196
Thanks?

624
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,853
You’re something else.

625
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,103
Vanessa. You'd better go.

626
00:47:20,383 --> 00:47:22,544
She hates when I sit around watching movies 
and I don't contribute.

627
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,663
I’ll handle this. I’m really good
at diffusing mom-type rage.

628
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:28,648
No, Juno, no.

629
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:32,806
Juno, what's going on?

630
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:34,508
- Nothing.
- What are you doing here? What's wrong?

631
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:35,976
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

632
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,163
Is there something wrong with the baby?

633
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:40,334
The baby is great. It’s the right size and everything. 
I even saw its phalanges today! 

634
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,232
Here.

635
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,569
It's the baby.

636
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,292
It's your baby.

637
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:52,915
It kinda looks like it’s waving.

638
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:57,275
Like it’s saying "Hey, Vanessa. 
Will you be my mom?"

639
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,504
Yeah, it kind of does.

640
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,712
Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.

641
00:48:02,938 --> 00:48:04,764
I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo 
off my pelvis.

642
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,300
It was crazy actually,

643
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:13,140
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech
so we got escorted off the premises.

644
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,275
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?

645
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,288
Mall madness, huh?

646
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,007
It’s just some stuff I picked up for the baby.

647
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,224
Don't you usually get all that
stuff at a baby shower?

648
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:31,317
When my stepmom was pregnant with my little sister 
she got a million gifts.

649
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,256
But I wasn't jealous 'cause they all were super lame.

650
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,255
I doubt anyone’s gonna throw us a shower.

651
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:38,460
Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?

652
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,302
I don't think people know how to feel about this 
situation because it’s not set in stone.

653
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,175


654
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:46,583
What isn't set ...

655
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,473
You don't think I’m going to flake out on you?

656
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:52,972
No, I don’t, Juno.

657
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,974
We went through a situation before 

658
00:48:56,724 --> 00:48:57,662
where it didn’t work out.

659
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,989
Cold feet.

660
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,583
You should have gone to China.

661
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:09,787
I hear they give away babies like free iPods.

662
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,739
They put ‘em in those T-shirt guns

663
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:14,972
and shoot them out at sporting events.

664
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,317
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.

665
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:22,363
Naah. I’m already pregnant,

666
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:24,924
so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?

667
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:27,879
I should probably bounce.

668
00:49:28,378 --> 00:49:29,378
Hey, don’t forget your bag.

669
00:49:29,957 --> 00:49:30,816
Ah, bag!

670
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,316
Okay, take care.

671
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,177
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

672
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,006
I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.
I ended up staying for a couple of hours.

673
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,177
A couple of hours? Why are you
going over there in the first place?

674
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:15,552
They wanted to know about this stuff. 
I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!

675
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,547
You could have mailed it to them. 

676
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:20,498
Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?

677
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,703
I don’t know, I just did.

678
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:28,295
And while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa, 
we watched The Wizard of Gore,

679
00:50:29,888 --> 00:50:32,592
And he burned me a couple of CDs of this weird music.

680
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:34,530
He’s kind of cool.

681
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:40,343
Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that. 

682
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:45,153
No, it was not a big deal.
He was totally cool with it.

683
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:46,453
You don't understand.

684
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:48,733
Mark is a married man, there are boundaries.

685
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:50,829
Oh, come on.

686
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:52,000
Listen,

687
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:53,325
Bren-duhhh.

688
00:50:54,312 --> 00:51:00,656
You’re acting like you’re the one who has to go through this 
and get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.

689
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:05,310
What does it even matter if he’s married? 
I can have friends that are married.

690
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:09,342
It doesn’t work that way, kiddo. 
You don’t know squat about the dynamics of marriage.

691
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:10,794
You don’t know anything about me!

692
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:11,951
I know enough.

693
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:15,827
We don't even have a dog!

694
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,935
Yeah, because you’re allergic to their saliva.

695
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:23,761
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno.
But in a couple years when you move out

696
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,810
I’m going to get Weimaraners.

697
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:27,481
Wow, dream big!

698
00:51:27,778 --> 00:51:29,136
Oh, go fly a kite.

699
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,713
Hi, Juno.

700
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:56,559
What can I do for you?

701
00:51:58,464 --> 00:51:59,417
Bleeker home?

702
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:02,135
Bleeker’s mom was possibly attractive once. 

703
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:03,856
But now she looks a hobbit.

704
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:07,824
You know, the fat one that was in The Goonies.

705
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:16,743
Hey, man,

706
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:19,402
Don’t concentrate so hard. 
I think I can smell your hair all burning.

707
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:21,558
Hey, what’s up?

708
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:28,511
Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.
I miss hanging out with you on school nights.

709
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,152
Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker’s one and only vice.

710
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:37,573
The day I got pregnant, 
his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.

711
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:48,964
You seem to be getting ...


712
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:50,776
... pregnant-er these days.

713
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,430
Ya know, I set up this whole
private adoption ...

714
00:52:57,026 --> 00:53:01,775
... and this married couple in Saint Cloud 
are going to be the parents.

715
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:02,991
Really? 

716
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,368
What are they like?

717
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,336
The guy, he's awesome.

718
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,367
His name is Mark and

719
00:53:11,196 --> 00:53:13,697
he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar.

720
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:15,775
We actually hung out this afternoon.

721
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:17,616
Is that normal?

722
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:19,712
Probably not, but ...

723
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:24,680
I talked to dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't
narc you out to your folks,

724
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,635
So,

725
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,819
I think we should be cool.

726
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,711
That's a relief.

727
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:38,524
I’m gonna start looking

728
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:40,210
like a pretty big dork soon.

729
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,462
Will you still think I’m cute when I’m huge?

730
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,288
I always think you’re cute.

731
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:49,228
I think you’re beautiful.

732
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:50,896
Jeez, Bleek.

733
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,102
I do.

734
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,805
Hey Junebug, when this is all over we should get 
the band back together.

735
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,163
Yeah.

736
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:04,209
That would be awesome.

737
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:06,496
Once Tino gets a new drumhead

738
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:08,632
we're just, like, ready to rock.

739
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:12,381
We could always get back together too.

740
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,239
That's an option.

741
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:20,492
Were we together?

742
00:54:21,193 --> 00:54:22,241
Yeah, we were once.

743
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:25,569
That time.

744
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:33,379
What about Katrina De Voort?

745
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:36,019
You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.

746
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:38,299
I don’t like Katrina.

747
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:39,924
She smells like soup.

748
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:41,642
Her whole house smells of soup.

749
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:52,055
Okay.

750
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,806
So we have Custard, Cheesecake.

751
00:54:57,977 --> 00:54:58,914
They're yellow.

752
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,289
I wanted to pick something that was gender-neutral
until we get the baby and then we can add a more decisive palette.

753
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:10,337
Why does everyone think yellow is gender-neutral?

754
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:11,756
I don’t know any guy with a yellow bedroom.

755
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,993
I'm thinking more Custard with this light.

756
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,101
I don’t know. Maybe I should paint a larger swatch ...

757
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:26,677
Or you could wait a few more months.

758
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:31,146
It’s not like the baby’s going to storm in here
demanding dessert-colored walls.

759
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:42,441
"What to Expect" says that readying the baby’s room 
is an important process for the woman.

760
00:55:42,913 --> 00:55:45,068
Especially if you're adopting.
It’s called "nesting."

761
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:47,383
Nesting?

762
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:51,351
Are you going to build the crib 
out of sticks and spit?

763
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,850
You should read the book. I
flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.

764
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,505
I think it’s too early to paint. 

765
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,052
That’s my opinion.

766
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,410
I disagree.

767
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:10,036
This wall is going to need something.

768
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,552
Our first family photo right in the middle.

769
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,708
Right up there.

770
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:22,318
Can you see it?

771
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,864
Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin’ donut!

772
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,333
Share the love, sweetness!

773
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,583
You can't have any.

774
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,551
She's assaulting me!

775
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,770
She’s denying me fresh-baked goodness!

776
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:38,739
Oh, my God.

777
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:41,987
That’s her. That’s Vanessa Loring.

778
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,705
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

779
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:50,268
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

780
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:52,395
You sound totally shocked or something.

781
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,662
She’s totally gonna steal that kid for her collection.

782
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,252
Right, seriously.

783
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:09,004
Boring!

784
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:23,863
I could so go for a huge cookie right now
with like, a lamb kebab, simultaneously.

785
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:27,408
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

786
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,956
It's like, never-ending for you.

787
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,143
Juno!

788
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,239
Hi, Vanessa!

789
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:36,688
What brings you to the mall today?

790
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:39,331
I was just shopping with my girlfriends.

791
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,283
You're gay?

792
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:42,267
No.

793
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,848
Just ignore her.

794
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:45,515
Well, how are you feeling?

795
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,627
Great! Everything's stupendous.

796
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:50,860
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

797
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:54,221
That’s incredible.

798
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:56,408
Oh, God.

799
00:57:57,704 --> 00:57:58,548
What?

800
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,172
Kicking away.

801
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,235
Could I feel it?

802
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:07,453
Are you kidding?

803
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:13,015
At school everyone's just grabbing my belly all the time. 

804
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,752
I’m a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

805
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,437
I can’t feel anything.

806
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:25,860
It’s not moving for me.

807
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:33,438
You should try talking to it. They can hear you, 
even though it's all ten thousand leagues under the sea.

808
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,015
Hi, baby.

809
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,406
It’s me. It's Vanessa. 

810
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,311
I can’t wait to meet you.

811
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,624
Can you hear me, baby?

812
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,310
Sweet angel?

813
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:28,810
I felt it!

814
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:32,359
That was magical.

815
00:59:37,856 --> 00:59:38,856
Thank you.

816
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:40,356
Thank you.

817
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,617
Hello?

818
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:34,912
Hey!

819
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:38,930
So, I’ve been listening to 
that really weird CD that you made me.

820
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
Yeah? What’s the verdict?

821
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:42,070
Well, it’s cute.

822
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,744
It's cute?

823
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:46,844
When you’re used to listening to the raw power 
of Iggy and the Stooges,

824
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:50,244
everything else just sounds kind of precious 
in comparison.

825
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:53,976
I imagine you have a collection of
punk chestnuts to prove your point.

826
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:55,585
Well ...

827
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:57,678
... consider it your musical education.

828
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,071
I can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.

829
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:02,710
Stop surfing porn and get back to work. 

830
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,759
Just wanted to call and say hi.

831
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:08,132
Go learn something.

832
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:14,224
- Oh, a little trip down Mexico way. 
- And Greece and China apparently.

833
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:16,445
How many months has it been now?

834
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:17,881
You're getting huge. 

835
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:21,505
It's homing in on the eight.
You should see how weird I look naked.

836
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,038
I wish my funbags would get bigger.

837
01:01:24,616 --> 01:01:27,367
Trust me, you don’t. I have to actually 
wear a friggin' bra now 

838
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:33,412
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff 
on myself so my skin won't explode.

839
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:34,755
Hot!

840
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,304
Why is everyone always staring at me?

841
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:41,662
Well, you are kind of convex, you know?

842
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,551
Whoah! Who's been doing
their geometry homework for once!

843
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:50,083
I have no choice. Keith has been
grading me so hard lately.

844
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:52,681
Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".

845
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,240
'Cause my barf reflex is
really enheightened these days.

846
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:56,974
But Keith’s hot.

847
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,709
Eww, he’s all beardy!

848
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:05,989
Did you hear that Bleek is going to the prom
with Katrina De Voort?

849
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:09,224
Katrina?

850
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,879
No way, he doesn’t like Katrina.

851
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:13,582
Must be like a pity date or something.

852
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,271
I heard he asked her and that the're going to Benihana, 
and then prom, and then Vijay’s parents’ cabin.

853
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,848
He told me that Katrina’s house smells like soup!

854
01:02:22,178 --> 01:02:23,613
Oh my God, it totally does. 

855
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:27,473
I was there four years ago for her birthday party and it 
was like Lipton Landing.

856
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:30,894
But you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

857
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,424
Oh, please.

858
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,753
There is no way that they’re having sex,

859
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:37,408
They wouldn't even be holding hands.

860
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,315
I wouldn’t be so sure,
he did it with you.

861
01:02:39,896 --> 01:02:41,520
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.

862
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:43,254
We’re best friends.

863
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:44,878
Are you jealous?

864
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:48,348
I thought you said you didn’t care what he did.

865
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:49,675
Not jealous, don’t care.

866
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:54,145
I know Bleek doesn’t like Katrina and he shouldn't
toy with her emotions like that. She seems pretty nice.

867
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:56,864
Uh-huh, I’m really convinced.

868
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:58,894
Prom is for wenises, anyway.

869
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:01,190
As soon as you’re old enough to go, 
it’s so not cool anymore.

870
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:13,849
Are you honestly and truly going to the prom 
with Katrina De Voort?

871
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:16,471
Uh, hi?

872
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:18,844
Leah just said that you were gonna go with her.

873
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,221
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.

874
01:03:22,205 --> 01:03:27,074
A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, 
then go the prom, then go to Vijay’s parents’ cabin.

875
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,231
We’re getting a stretch limo.

876
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:35,136
Your mom must be pretty stoked that you’re
not taking me.

877
01:03:37,353 --> 01:03:38,259
You’re mad. Why are you mad?

878
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:41,462
I’m not mad. I’m in a great mood.

879
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:46,557
Despite the fact that I’m in a fat suit I can’t take 
off, despite the fact that pretty much everyone is making

880
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:52,322
fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your 
girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday.

881
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,245
Katrina’s not my girlfriend! And I doubt 
that she gave you  the stinkeye. 

882
01:03:57,507 --> 01:03:58,681
That's just the way her face looks.

883
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:07,400
Just take Soupy Sales to prom, I can think of so 
many cooler things to do that night.

884
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:14,837
I might pumice my feet or go to Bren’s Unitarian church, 
maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice.

885
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:18,869
All those things would be exponentially cooler than
going to the prom with you.

886
01:04:22,352 --> 01:04:23,555
You’re being really immature.

887
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:31,248
You have no reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. 
I should be royally ticked off at you.

888
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,118
I should be really cheesed off. 
I shouldn’t want to talk to you anymore.

889
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:40,616
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you, 
and then I didn’t wanna, like, marry you?

890
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:44,103
Like I’d marry you! 
You'd be the meanest wife ever.

891
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:45,616
And I know that you weren’t bored that day

892
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:50,381
because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch 
Project was coming on Starz, and you were like,

893
01:04:50,648 --> 01:04:56,380
"I haven't seen this since it came out, 
but we should make out instead. La la la."

894
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:03,632
You just take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. 
I’m sure you two will have a real bitchin’ time!

895
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:07,601
I still have your underwear.

896
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:09,442
I still have your virginity!

897
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:11,256
Would you shut up!

898
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:13,208
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

899
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:15,135
- No.
- 'Cause at least 

900
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:17,445
you don’t have to have the 
evidence under your sweater.

901
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:20,975
I’m a planet!

902
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,647
Wait, let me get your bag.

903
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:29,068
What’s another ten pounds?

904
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,001
Hi.

905
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:18,751
Wow. That shirt's working hard.

906
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:20,091
Is Vanessa here?

907
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:22,155
No. We are safe.

908
01:06:24,388 --> 01:06:25,906
I'm glad you're here, I actually have something for you.

909
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,833
Almost there.

910
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:38,303
Whoah, Mark! Is this the baby’s room? It’s beautiful!

911
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:40,396
Hilarious.

912
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:42,770
This is where I keep all my old comics, 

913
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,428
And I want to show you one.

914
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:46,740
You’re one of those guys?

915
01:06:46,832 --> 01:06:48,098
Take a look.

916
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:53,269
“Most Fruitful Yuki”?

917
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,145
Is this a pregnant superhero?

918
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:57,661
Isn’t that great?

919
01:06:57,957 --> 01:06:59,878
I found it in Japan when I was there with my band. 
It reminds me of you.

920
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:01,879
Hells, yeah!

921
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,960
This actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.

922
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:11,398
Yuki is a real bad ass. 
You should be very proud being in the same condition.

923
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:13,683
Thank you.

924
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:16,073
Oh, how about some tunage?

925
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:19,182
Alright, don't look, no matter what.

926
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:28,602
This one is actually kinda slow. But it’s 
Mott the Hoople so it’s still totally rad and hardcore.

927
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,150
I know this one.

928
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,323
- You do?
- Yeah, this song is older than I am.

929
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,587
I danced to this at my senior prom.

930
01:07:42,008 --> 01:07:43,383
Who'd you dance with?

931
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,914
Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner. 
She let me put my hands all over her butt.

932
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:49,321
- Hot.
- Very hot.

933
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:53,148
I can just, totally, picture you dancing,

934
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:55,352
Like a total dork!

935
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,960
Her hands there,

936
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:03,915
And my hands down here.

937
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:06,289
This is how we did it in '88.

938
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:07,679
Like this?

939
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:08,994
Just like this.

940
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:10,552
You’ve never been to a dance before?

941
01:08:10,806 --> 01:08:12,118
Dances are for nerds and squares.

942
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:14,445
What are you?

943
01:08:15,475 --> 01:08:16,444
I don't know.

944
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:20,179
I feel like there’s something between us.

945
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:39,102
I’m leaving Vanessa.

946
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:43,444
What?

947
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:48,195
I’m getting a place in the city. 
It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time.

948
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,158
No!

949
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:50,519
No?

950
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:52,504
No! You definitely can't do that. 

951
01:08:52,784 --> 01:08:53,909
That’s one big, fat sack of no!

952
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:55,611


953
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:57,301
What is the matter?

954
01:08:58,691 --> 01:09:01,642
You guys are supposed to take care of this.

955
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:05,815
I thought you'd be cool with this.

956
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:12,250
I want things to be perfect. I don't want them 
to be shitty and broken like everyone else’s family.

957
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,716
Look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa is 
going to be so happy.

958
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:20,225
A baby is not going to fix everything.

959
01:09:20,568 --> 01:09:23,085
Besides, I don’t know if
I’m even ready to be a father.

960
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,641
But you’re old!

961
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,267
How do you think of me?

962
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:32,610
Why are you over here?

963
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,471
I ...

964
01:09:38,314 --> 01:09:41,640
I just like being a piece of 
furniture in your weird life.

965
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:49,531
This is what my life has become. I got stuff 
in boxes. I'm underground. That's appealing to you?

966
01:09:49,956 --> 01:09:51,112
- This is my fault.
- No.

967
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,158
Is Vanessa mad 
at you because of me?

968
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:55,915
That’s got nothing to do with it. 
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.

969
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:58,280
You were in love when
you married her!

970
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:04,286
If you're in love once, you can be in love again. My friend Leah has been with the same guy four different times.

971
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,443
You’re just not trying hard enough.

972
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:07,755
I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe
what an idiot I am.

973
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:08,849
No, you know what, Mark.

974
01:10:09,395 --> 01:10:11,519
Do not divorce your wife!

975
01:10:12,832 --> 01:10:16,099
Will you please just do me a solid and stay
with Vanessa?

976
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:19,378
You’re so young.

977
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:24,457
I'm not that young. I’m sixteen. I’m old enough to know 
when someone's acting like a total a-hole!

978
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:26,504
Oh, and you know what,

979
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:30,942
I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks!
It’s just noise!

980
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:38,148
Juno? What’s going on?

981
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:40,443
Nothing.

982
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:42,271
Why are you crying?

983
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,128
I’m not crying. I’m just allergic to fine home furnishings. 

984
01:10:47,896 --> 01:10:48,600
What’s the matter?

985
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:50,426
What’s the matter?

986
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:55,271
She’s just a little hormonal. Right, Juno? 
It’s part of the process.

987
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:00,608
What did you do?

988
01:11:03,142 --> 01:11:04,047
I didn’t do anything ... 

989
01:11:06,187 --> 01:11:07,015
Just...

990
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,609
I’ve been thinking.

991
01:11:13,656 --> 01:11:16,392
- What?
- Just thinking if this is the right thing.

992
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,281
What are you talking about?

993
01:11:21,437 --> 01:11:22,390
Just wondering if it's,

994
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:24,219
Just wondering if we're ready.

995
01:11:25,844 --> 01:11:26,937
Yeah, we're ready.

996
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:32,297
We’re ready. We've read the books, we’ve taken all the 
classes. We have a nursery that is completely ...

997
01:11:32,763 --> 01:11:38,014
Vanessa, I know we’re prepared. 
I'm just wondering if ... I’m ready.

998
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:44,233
Wait a minute.

999
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,890
Juno, don’t listen to him. 
He's just got cold feet.

1000
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:49,437
He's just being a guy.

1001
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:53,014
The books all say the same thing. 
A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.

1002
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,607
A man becomes a father when
he sees his baby.

1003
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,616
He’s going to get there. 

1004
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,067
It just happened so fast. We put the ad in the paper 
and I thought it was gonna take months if at all and then,

1005
01:12:04,644 --> 01:12:06,834
Two weeks later, she’s on that couch.

1006
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,458
She answered our prayers.

1007
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:11,507
Ever since then it’s been like a ticking clock.

1008
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:16,999
What are you saying?

1009
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:21,640
That it feels a little like bad timing.

1010
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:27,256
What would be a good time for you, Mark?

1011
01:12:29,444 --> 01:12:31,196
There’s just some things that 
I still want to do.

1012
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:33,507
Like what? Be a rock star?

1013
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:35,865
Don’t mock me.

1014
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:38,774
I'm just saying that this is,

1015
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:41,428
This is something that's never going to happen.

1016
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,288
Your shirt is stupid.

1017
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:49,880
Grow up.

1018
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,132
If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, 
I’m never going to be a mother.

1019
01:12:58,771 --> 01:12:59,990
I never said I’d be a good father.

1020
01:15:56,445 --> 01:16:02,149
I called Gerta Rauss and she said that she can represent 
both of us. It's called a "collaborative divorce."

1021
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:05,194
It’s all the rage right now, supposedly.

1022
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,867
And it would be pretty easy because 
we don’t have any children.

1023
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,055
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1024
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,366
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1025
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:22,878
- Yeah, downtown.
- A hotel?

1026
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,383
No, it's not a hotel. 
It’s a loft.

1027
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,584
Aren’t you the cool guy?

1028
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:34,944
I wanted a baby so bad.

1029
01:16:36,474 --> 01:16:37,583
I know.

1030
01:16:57,724 --> 01:16:59,535
- It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.
- It’s for me.

1031
01:17:42,302 --> 01:17:46,690
I never realize how much I like being home unless 
I’ve been somewhere really different for a while.

1032
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:56,861
Hey, Dad.

1033
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:58,425
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.

1034
01:18:00,019 --> 01:18:00,862
Where have you been?

1035
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:04,379
Dealing with things way beyond my
maturity level. 

1036
01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:08,862
Where is everybody?

1037
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,173
Bren took Liberty Bell to her 
tot ice skating class.

1038
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:16,096
When will you guys learn that tots can’t ice skate? 

1039
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,409
You're looking a little morose, honey.

1040
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,222
What’s eating you?

1041
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:23,721


1042
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:32,174
I’m just, like, losing my faith with humanity.

1043
01:18:33,348 --> 01:18:34,722
Can you narrow that down for me?

1044
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,471
I just ...

1045
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:38,752
... wonder if ...

1046
01:18:40,485 --> 01:18:42,423
... two people can stay together for good.

1047
01:18:44,018 --> 01:18:44,924
You mean like couples?

1048
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,127
Yeah, like,

1049
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:47,626
People in love.

1050
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:53,876
Are you having boy trouble 'cause I gotta be honest; I don’t really much approve of you dating in your condition, 

1051
01:18:54,892 --> 01:18:56,205
That’s kind of messed up.

1052
01:18:56,324 --> 01:18:57,168
No, dad!

1053
01:18:57,808 --> 01:18:58,701
I mean, that’s pretty skanky.

1054
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:00,956
Isn’t that what you girls call it?
Skanky? Skeevy?

1055
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,262
Please stop.

1056
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:03,418
Tore up from the floor up?

1057
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,807
That's not what it's about.

1058
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:16,463
I just need to know that it’s possible that 
two people can stay happy together forever.

1059
01:19:18,073 --> 01:19:19,339
It’s not easy, that’s for sure.

1060
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:23,871
I don't have the best track
record in the world, I know, but,

1061
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,948
I've been with your stepmother 
for ten years now, 

1062
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:29,384
and I’m proud to say that we’re very happy.

1063
01:19:31,776 --> 01:19:32,635
Look ...

1064
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:34,964
... In my opinion ...

1065
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,431
The best thing you can do is find a person 
who loves you for exactly what you are.

1066
01:19:43,306 --> 01:19:46,168
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,   

1067
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,573
Handsome, what have you,

1068
01:19:50,384 --> 01:19:52,696
the right person is still gonna think 
the sun shines out of your ass.

1069
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,024
That’s the kind of person that’s worth
sticking with.

1070
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:00,261
Yeah.

1071
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,352
I think I've found that person.

1072
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:08,820
Yeah, sure you have. Your old D-A-D!

1073
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,962
You know I’ll always be there to love you, support you, 
no matter what kind of pickle you’re in.

1074
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:16,839
Obviously.

1075
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,055
Dad, I think i'm just gonna, 

1076
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:25,588
shove out for a sec, but, 

1077
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,540
I won't be home late.

1078
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:28,976
Okay.

1079
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:31,476
You were talking about me, right?

1080
01:20:32,759 --> 01:20:33,475
Oh, yeah.

1081
01:20:57,375 --> 01:21:00,157

1082
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:31,059
Hi.

1083
01:21:33,465 --> 01:21:35,917
Did you put like a hundred things
of tic tacs in my mailbox?

1084
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:37,916
Oh, yeah, that was me.

1085
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,106
Why?

1086
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:41,902
They’re your fave. 

1087
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:45,572
You can never have too many of your
favorite one-calorie breath mint.

1088
01:21:46,056 --> 01:21:48,120


1089
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,386
Yeah, well thanks, I ...

1090
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:51,526
... I think I’m pretty much set until 
college on the tic tac front.

1091
01:21:52,888 --> 01:21:54,072
You know, Bleek, I was thinking.

1092
01:21:54,621 --> 01:21:58,385
I’m sorry I was such a huge bitch to you.
You don't deserve it.

1093
01:21:59,635 --> 01:22:01,736
It’s okay.

1094
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:04,469
Also, 

1095
01:22:06,831 --> 01:22:07,892
I think I’m in love with you.

1096
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:11,831
What, you mean as friends?

1097
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:13,408
No.

1098
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:15,611
I mean, for real.

1099
01:22:16,548 --> 01:22:19,925
Because you're, like, the coolest person I’ve ever met. 

1100
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:22,424
And you don’t even have to try.

1101
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:24,735


1102
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,331
I try really hard, actually.

1103
01:22:26,784 --> 01:22:28,187
You’re, like, naturally smart.

1104
01:22:29,329 --> 01:22:30,424
You're not like everyone else.

1105
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:33,578
You don't stare at my stomach all the time,
you look at my face.

1106
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:34,658


1107
01:22:34,252 --> 01:22:39,890
And every time I see you,
the baby starts kicking super hard.

1108
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,031
It does?

1109
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:57,223
I think it’s because my heart
starts pounding everytime I see you.

1110
01:22:58,799 --> 01:22:59,626
Mine too.

1111
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:04,252
That’s all I could ask for.

1112
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:08,828
You’re golden, man.

1113
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:13,735
Can we make out now?

1114
01:23:15,184 --> 01:23:16,390
Yeah.

1115
01:23:28,732 --> 01:23:32,389
You know, you can go into early
labor sucking face like that!

1116
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:57,539
Dad!

1117
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,430
What?

1118
01:24:00,304 --> 01:24:02,228
Dad, either I just peed my pants or ...

1119
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:04,961
Or?

1120
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,710
Thundercats are go!

1121
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,819
All out, all out!

1122
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,431


1123
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:11,039
Do you have the admittance form?

1124
01:24:11,383 --> 01:24:12,871
What about the parking stickers?

1125
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:14,148
Have you got Liberty Bell?

1126
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:16,367
Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

1127
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,072
Here we go.

1128
01:24:24,415 --> 01:24:25,774
Hurry! Start the car, go!

1129
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:27,617
Gas!

1130
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:34,383
- Wait, wait!
- Out of the way!

1131
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,430
- Don't do that.
- What?

1132
01:24:39,818 --> 01:24:41,399
- That.
- But it's fun!

1133
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,865
Bren, when do I get that friggin' Spinal Tap thing?

1134
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:51,023
It’s called a spinal block, and you can’t have it yet, honey. 
The doctor said you’re not dilated enough.

1135
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:56,807
Come on! I have to wait for it to get worse? 
Why can’t I just have the friggin' thing now?

1136
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:01,000
Honey, doctors are sadists who like to 
play God and watch lesser people scream.

1137
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:01,180

1138
01:25:02,368 --> 01:25:03,195
Oh, shit.

1139
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:07,272
Excuse me! Can we give my kid the damn
spinal tap already?

1140
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:14,069


1141
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:37,800
And then ...

1142
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:40,112
... out of nowhere ...

1143
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:42,144
... there it was ...

1144
01:25:43,844 --> 01:25:45,096
There he was.

1145
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:54,438
I decided not to call Bleeker to
tell him that I was having the baby. 

1146
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:59,201
He had a big meet against Manteno and I didn’t 
want him to get all worried about me.

1147
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:06,077
But he figured it out anyway.

1148
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:25,703
Someday you’ll be back here, honey.

1149
01:26:28,498 --> 01:26:29,531
On your terms.

1150
01:26:42,014 --> 01:26:43,092
Hey.

1151
01:26:43,856 --> 01:26:45,825
Nice legs.

1152
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:29,297
Bleeker decided he didn’t want to see the baby. 

1153
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:34,173
Neither did I, really. He didn’t feel like ours.

1154
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,391
I think he was always hers.

1155
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:49,591
Would you like to meet your son?

1156
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:53,827
I have a son?

1157
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,905


1158
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,796
How do I look?

1159
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,404
Like a new mom. 

1160
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,449
Scared shitless.

1161
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,024
It ended with a chair.

1162
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:05,695

1163
01:29:23,347 --> 01:29:27,457

1164
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:57,296
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss. 
He is the cheese to my macaroni. 

1165
01:29:59,689 --> 01:30:02,344
I know people are supposed to fall in love 
before they reproduce, but, 

1166
01:30:03,547 --> 01:30:05,156
I guess normalcy’s not really our style.

1167
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,078
Hey.

1168
01:30:13,592 --> 01:30:14,795
Hey.

1169
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:20,437
Ready?

1170
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:22,077
Yeah.
