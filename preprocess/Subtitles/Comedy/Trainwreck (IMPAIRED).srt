1
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,289
Girls, your mother and
I are getting divorced.

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,009
Don't cry. I know you're
upset, I know you're confused.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,844
I don't know what
your mother told you,

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,524
but let me explain it
from my side,

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,007
in terms you can understand.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,720
You got your
doll, right?

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,767
You got your
doll there.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,807
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,968
You got your doll, you like
your doll, right? Yes.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,565
You love your doll. Yeah.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,244
Yes, you love the doll.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,561
But what if
I told you

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,210
that was the only doll
you're allowed to play with

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,770
the rest of your life?

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,811
How would you feel?

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,601
Sad.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,364
You'd feel sad!
Of course!

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,204
Because there's a lot of
other dolls on your shelves.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,566
And if you play
with the other dolls,

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,005
you can't have
that doll anymore.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,241
Even though that
doll doesn't really

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,845
want to play with
you at this point.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,002
You're both
living a lie!

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,929
There's other
dolls you like,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,729
and they're making
new dolls every year.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,926
You want a
stewardess doll?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,081
BOTH: Yeah.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,083
What about a slightly overweight
cocktail waitress doll?

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,127
BOTH: Yeah.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,611
What about a doll
who happens to be

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,091
best friends
with your main doll'?

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,161
BOTH: Yeah.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,890
It could happen, right?
BOTH: Yeah.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,765
What about a doll you only play
with one day and never see again?

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,001
BOTH: (EMPHATICALLY) Yeah!

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,287
What about a doll where your
friend's playing with the doll,

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,046
and he needs you to kind of
man up with the other doll.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,286
You don't even want
to play with that doll,

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,203
but you do it because your
friend's playing with that doll.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,442
You don't wanna sit there and
leave the other doll unattended.

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,567
BOTH: Yeah.

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,520
So that's why me and Mom
are getting divorced.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,371
Monogamy isn't realistic!

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,171
BOTH: Monogamy
isn't realistic!

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,521
Again!

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,841
BOTH: Monogamy
isn't realistic.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,921
Again!

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,446
(KISSING)

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,806
(MOANING)

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,726
AMY: I never do this.
This is so weird for me.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,005
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,767
I really like
these ones.

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,330
Oh, no!

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,488
Shit! That's your dick? Uh-huh!

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,882
Too big! Your dick
doesn't end.

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,007
Why doesn't your dick end?
(CHUCKLES)

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,447
Have you ever
fucked someone before?

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,885
Where is she buried?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,571
That looks like the whole
cast of Game of Thrones.

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
Come here.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
You know what?

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,921
I'm, like, really shy, Uh-huh.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,843
So we should probably
do this first

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,809
so I feel
comfortable with you.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,445
Yeah, all right.

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,365
A little warm-up. I know.
Yeah, a little warm-up.

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,441
You taste
like mango.

68
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Just stop talking, okay?
Just, like...

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,688
Just do the alphabet.

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,887
Just hang up
at the top.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,008
Everything important
is up at the top.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,281
Yeah, that's good.

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,921
Okay.

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,805
(INHALING SHARPLY)

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960

77

MAN: Hey,
you like that, right'?

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,647
(WHISPERS) Amy?

79
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,521
Hey.

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,771
I think it's
my turn, baby.

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,724
Amy, seriously,
my turn.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
Muffin, remember you
said you were gonna...

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,448
(CONTINUES SNORING)

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,846

ever let them sleep over.</i>

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,924
I got a couple of ticks
to The Black Keys,

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,081
Thursday, if you want... Ooh...

92
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,447
Thanks. Bye!

93
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,844
AMY: All right, good night.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,251
All right, bye.
Good night.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,321
Oh...

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,649
I guess I do love pussy.
(CHUCKLES)

97
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,921

What time is it?

113

in the morning.

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,484
I didn't know if I should
let you sleep or not.

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,721
Or make you breakfast.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,961
I chose breakfast.

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,687

NOAM: Hey! Amy,
where are you going?

129
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,290
This isn't
Planned Parenthood.

130
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,769
Oh, my God.
Shut up!

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,569
You have to tell me
everything about last night.

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,087
I went on your lnstagram.
That guy is like, so hot.

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,447
He looks kind of like
a white Drake. No.

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,124
He was like
a Puerto Rican Gollum.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,326
I'm not talking
about it.

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,482
AMY: Do you have to pee?
Yeah, totally.

AMY: Did you hear Johnny Depp is
coming into the office today?

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,645
NIKKI: Oh, yeah.
I'm all overthat.

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,724
Which version
of Johnny Depp

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,921
would you most
wanna have sex with?

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,525
Which one does it
for you the most?

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,090
Because I can't
stop thinking about it.

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,446
<i>For me, 'Ks
Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,444
I love a fully
made up, long hair,

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,363
almost feminine-looking
Johnny Depp.

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,364
Not almost. He looks like a
beautiful woman in that movie.

148
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,209
Yeah. Who would be yours?

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm thinking, like, an Edward
Scissorhands Johnny Depp.

150
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,930
You would get
totally cut up.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,968
Yeah, but he'd feel
so bad about it

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,451
that he'd be like,
"I'll never leave you."

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,568
And I would get,
like, a sick haircut.

154
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,641
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,724
But also, guess what?
Willy Wonka, bring it on.

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,290
Oh, my God, totally.
Right?

157
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,885
Yeah. I would
fuck the shit

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,968
out of Willy Wonka
Johnny Depp.

159
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,602
DIANNA: Okay, my babes,
I want your undivided.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,850
I've been looking
at your pitches

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,046
and these are
my thoughts.

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,680
Nikki.

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,891
Why are you smiling?

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,567
I'm not smiling,
I'm just very nervous.

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,728
DIANNA: Stop smiling.
Stop smiling.

166
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,602
That's even more.
Nikki.

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,047
The more nervous I get,
the more I smile, so...

168
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
Stop smiling.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,684
Stop it. Stop it.

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,091
Nikki, shut it down. Come on.
Bring it down, bring it down.

171
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,881
That's it.

172
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,969
I'm sick of your
ginger nonsense.

173
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,725
I don't wanna see
those gnashers. No.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,331
Stop it.
What's this?

175
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,243
BRYSON: That's our
new intern, Donald.

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,322
I thought we were getting
a chick, but he's here.

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,402
Okay.
Welcome, Donald.

178
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,801
Welcome to S'nuff where we are
teaching the strong-willed man

179
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,763
how to dress,
think, eat, fuck.

180
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,564
Do you like the
magazine, Donald'?

181
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,087
Oh, yeah, it's pretty much all I read.
Good answer.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,721
Look, this is ours. This is ours.
Right? We made this.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,650
What's our demographic?

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,688
ALL: Every-fucking-one.

185
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you.
You can go now.

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,686
Yeah, thank you.
It's a big opportunity.

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,842
Right, pitch me.
Pitch me hard. Schultz?

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,604
So I was thinking
of something called

189
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,648
the "S'nuff Guide to
Beating Off at Work."

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,245
Where to do it,
how to do it,

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,651
how not to
get caught.

192
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
How to get caught.

193
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,246
SCHULTZ: Makes it more fun.

194
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,482
I already started
the research, you guys.

195
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,050
(CHUCKLING)

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,690
DIANNA: Bryson?
Okay, I got one.

197
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,762
"You're not gay.
She's boring."

198
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,841
DIANNA: Good.
Yeah?

199
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,724
Fantastic! I can see it.
Thank you.

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,564
Okay. I have
another to pitch.

201
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,369
Maybe a cover,
I don't know.

202
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,487
Uh...

203
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,403
"You call those tits?"

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,845
That's good. Yeah.

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,127
And then maybe like a
"Where are they now?" piece

206
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,044
about the kids Michael
Jackson gave settlements to.

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,326
DIANNA: Good.
Ooh...

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,481
I want to know.

209
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,561
That's good, yeah.

210
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,802
I play ice hockey with one of them.
I'll get an email.

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,961
DIANNA: Yeah, that's good.

212
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,485
Right. So, assignments.

213
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,484
Schultz, you're on
the Ryan Phillippe piece.

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,607
Oh! What?

215
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,681
Yes! Crash
was epic.

216
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,445
I was thinking I would take a
stab at the Phillippe piece.

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,171
No. Ryan, I tell you, he's
in a major funk right now,

218
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,049
and he will respond
much better

219
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,646
to a male who is neither
attractive nor masculine.

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,927
Blam! That's me
right here.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,401
Bryson, I've got
a red mark by your name.

222
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Why would that be?
Yes, okay.

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,491
I am pitching
Dr. Aaron Conners.

224
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,925
He works with
some of the Knicks.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,766
He's this incredible, young
sports physician on the rise,

226
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,649
and he just created
this revolutionary

227
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,927
knee insert that cuts
recovery time in half.

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,082
He's about to perform it
on Amaﬂe Stoudemire.

229
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,447
It will be the first time it's
ever been done on a pro athlete.

230
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,045
If we get this,
we'll have access

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,565
to the biggest
names in sports.

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,166
LeBron, Durant,
Blake Griffin.

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,891
I've heard of this guy. He did
D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?

234
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,086
YES.

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,326
Yeah, and Metta
World Peace's too.

236
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,051
Yeah. Thabo Sefolosha owes his
whole career to this guy.

237
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,605
Are these
real names?

238
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,523
What's that, Amy?
Your thoughts?

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,726
AMY: I'm sorry, I just...

240
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,727
I don't know why we treat
these athletes like heroes

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,643
just because
they can skate fast

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,210
or kick a ball in a net.

243
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,850
I just think it's weird.
No offense.

244
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,844
I just think that
sports are stupid,

245
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,809
and anyone who
likes them

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,043
is just, like,
a lesser person.

247
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,363
And has a
small intellect.

248
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,170
Killer. I want you
to write the piece.

249
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,051
What?
What?

250
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,566
0h, no, I literally
can't stomach sports.

251
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,802
Yeah, I know. Your
opposition is perfection.

252
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,644
This really feels
like a Bryson article.

253
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,007
Yeah, this feels like a "me" article.
Ipﬂchedit

254
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,610
Yeah, you pitched it.
I'm giving it to Amy.

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,330
What are you saying? You
giving me some attitude here?

256
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,289
This isn't a fucking
medical journal.

257
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,169
I can do opposition,
I can do sexy.

258
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,005
I want that.
I want that hatred.

259
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,161
I'm giving it to Amy.

260
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,163
Don't sulk at me.
I'm not sulking.

261
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,129
This is my decision.
I'm giving it to Amy.

262
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,770
Sure. Fine.

263
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,365
BRYSON: I can do sexy though.
Sorry?

264
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,920
Huh? Nothing. I'm fine.
DIANNA: What?

265
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,524
I'm just having fun.
(CHUCKES DRYLY)

266
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,327
DIANNA: Nikki,
I want you to research

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,841
whether garlic makes semen
taste any different.

268
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,925
Oh... Um...

269
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,400
How am I supposed to get the...
DIANNA: Thank you.

270
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,209
You inspire me.

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,125
It tastes the same.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,411
Am?-

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,444
I'm not trying
to punish you.

274
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,045
Does it feel
a little like I am'?

275
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,407
No, no,
I appreciate the...

276
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,687
I know you want to branch
out and cover more,

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,848
and you do know
I'm looking for a new

278
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,570
executive editor,
don't you'?

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,847
I do know that, and I'm
very, very interested.

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,809
Hmm. I'd love to be considered.

281
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,885
Especially my dad's
house isn't selling

282
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,610
and my sister and I
just had to put him

283
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,569
in this assisted
living place,

284
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,166
and you would think it was like
the Waldorf. It's so expensive.

285
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,890
Is this your one-woman
show right now'?

286
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,564
Because I ain't
got a ticket.

287
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,124
You know, just
eviscerate the piece.

288
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,408
I'm giving you an assignment.
Right, yeah.

289
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,771
Hmm? And, Amy, if you would
teach this about this.

290
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,243
So, does she have
a foreign accent

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,731
or is she just
awesome?

292
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,404
Don't talk to me
for two weeks.

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,528
AMY: <i>That's my sister Kim.
She's cute, right?</i>

294
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,326
<i>Well, back off! She's
totally married as fuck!</i>

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,650
<i>Our dad's MS has
gotten really bad,</i>

296
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,449
<i>so he can't live
by himself anymore.</i>

297
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,284
<i>We're cleaning out his house.</i>

298
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,081
KIM: There's your box.

299
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,924
That stuff's Goodwill,
that stuff's eBay,

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,445
and the stuff
up front is trash.

301
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,921
AMY: This stuffs eBay?
KIM: Yeah.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,764
Iwanna go
through this.

303
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,966
No, don't go
through it.

304
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,883
That's stuff we can
make money off of.

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,530
Why are they here?

306
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,685
KIM: They're picking me up.

307
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,127
Hey, Mother, look,
we got a croquet set!

308
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,531
Great job, sweetpea!

309
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,929
He calls you Mother?
That's not creepy.

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,001
Yeah, it's
his choice.

311
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,451
Have him call
you Stepmother.

312
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,760
It's more accurate.

313
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,126
I've raised
that child!

314
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,406
Mom, lfound
a glove.

315
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,482
Hey, buddy, how you doing? Good.

316
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,568
What are you
studying in school'?

317
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,971
I'm learning
about space

318
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,361
and all the
celestial objects

319
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,606
and how there are

320
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,409
planets and
solar systems,

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,643
and sometimes there could
be multiple universes

322
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,449
but people don't know
how to describe that yet,

323
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,601
but it's a new theory,

324
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,411
and I'm so excited to see if
they figure it out or not.

325
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,721
Great.

326
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,086
See you around.

327
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,561
Okay.

328
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,490
Why is he dressed
like Colonel Sanders?

329
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,130
He got to dress himself
and that's what he chose.

330
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,561
That's what the inside of his
heart looks like. Be nice.

331
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,926
Can you just be
real for a second?

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,163
If you just met
that dude at a CVS,

333
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,571
you'd have a real
problem with him.

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,286
Can you just
pretend to like him?

335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
I am pretending.

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,445
Ooh, I like
Tom's sweater.

337
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,331
He's doing the
To Catch a Predator look.

338
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
Amy!
What?

339
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
TOM: Amy, what's up?

340
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,923
Hey! Looking sharp.

341
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,488
Looking sharp, man. Thanks.

342
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,050
TOM: Nice to see you.
AMY: Nice to see you'

343
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,201
I was reading
your article about

344
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,282
how to talk your girlfriend
into a three-way.

345
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,686
You read that one? Yeah.

346
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,761
Wow!

347
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,841
Would you do that? No.

348
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,921
No.

349
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,121
That got off
the table quick.

350
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,201
Yeah.

351
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,281
Lei him do
what he wants.

352
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,361
You guys should
make a sex tape.

353
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,851
I would.
Uh...

354
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
I did high
school theater.

355
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,601
I think I'd be pretty good.
(LAUGHING)

356
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,288
AMY: This nursing home is nice.
KIM: Yeah.

357
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,523
Ifs too nice and
it's too expensive

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,682
and we should've
put him in a shithole.

359
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,808
We did. I mean,
it's a shithole.

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,326
It's just the nicest shithole.
Yeah.

361
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,446
Places where the nurses don't
fuck the patients are expensive.

362
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,601
That's what
you're paying for.

363
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,841
It's not the food,
sister.

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,286
Ew!

365
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,721
"Condoms ribbed
for his pleasure"?

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,767
(Gas PS)

367
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,887
I better hold on
to these.

368
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,689
Is this coke?

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,046
No. Dad didn't
love coke.

370
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,322
He was just a
full-blown alcoholic.

371
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,811
(SNORTING)
(GASPS)

372
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,764
No. It must just be from
a Halloween costume. Oh.

373
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

374
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,761
KIM: Moving on.
AMY: Let's just...

375
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,881
Amy, don't touch it.

376
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,246
These are
his memories.

377
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,766
No, don't do that!
Toss it away.

378
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,205
What? He needs
his wallet.

379
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,806
We've got so much stuff to go through.
Please stop...

380
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,563
Oh! He loves
that poster.

381
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,005
I know.

382
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,841
Kimberly! Stop it!
Stop it! Girl!

383
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,243
Come on!
Not cool, girl!

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,771
That felt good.

385
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,081
It's not right.

386
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,161
Alaska.

387
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,805
No. Don't throw
away his snow globes.

388
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,611
These are his memories. He got
one of these everywhere he went.

389
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,967
Does he have one for every
one of ou r teachers?

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,246
I don't see them.

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
He didn't fuck
all our teachers.

392
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,801
He fucked all
of my teachers.

393
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,882
No, he never
fucked Mr. Hecht.

394
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,126
I did.

395
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,201
I'm just kidding.
(LAUGHS)

396
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,520
You know,
he wouldn't, but...

397
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,921
(GAS PS)

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,367
Oh, man!
Look at this.

399
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,845
AMY: Morn was
so fuckable then.

400
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,484
She had
the best tits.

401
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,050
When she would lay down,
they would just stay put.

402
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,610
Mine are just like,
"See ya!"

403
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,681
(CHUCKLES)

404
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,603
My titties are
like, "Peace!"

405
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,930
KIM: Dad was
such a dick.

406
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,806
(SIGHS)

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,531
I don't really
see it that way.

408
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,161
Can we mix it up
a little bit?

409
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,924
Will you talk
dirty to me?

410
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,246
Come on. Come on!

411
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,209
Amy, no. It's not
something I do well.

412
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,406
I'm not really
verbal, okay'?

413
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,323
I'm more physical
in how I communicate.

414
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,925
You're gonna be great at it.
I'm gonna sound stupid.

415
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,684
I don't wanna sound stupid.
You're not gonna sound stupid.

416
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,161
Clear your mind and say
whatever pops in it, okay?

417
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,641
Just try it.
Say anything.

418
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,246
All right.

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,209
I'm gonna give you
my full pecker. Yeah.

420
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,731
Okay.

421
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,290
Because of
the pecs,

422
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,488
but "pecker" is
kind of like my dick.

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,285
Yeah, I got it. I understood
what you meant by "pecker."

424
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,410
(GRUNTING) I'm gonna
fill you with protein.

425
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,205
I'm gonna give you
the protein you need

426
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,169
to survive when
you're making muscles.

427
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm gonna put my
green drink in you.

428
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,003
Yeah. Beta-carotene
and vegetable mix.

429
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,451
Can it not be
about protein

430
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,682
or energy
or nutrition?

431
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,087
Can you just talk
about sex stuff?

432
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,646
All right. Yes. Just sexy stuff.

433
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,286
Talk to me.

434
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,207
There's no
"F, in "team"

435
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,805
but there's an
..l.. in "Win...

436
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,570
Can't spell "victory"
without "T-R-Y."

437
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,524
Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

438
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,570
Okay, these are
just sports phrases.

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,768
Are these Nike slogans?
Please just...

440
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,445
You want the "Just do it"?
Do you want that one?

441
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,763
No! Just have sex with me
and say some dirty shit.

442
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,482
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)

443
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,561
What is that?

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,722
Talking to you dirty in Chinese.
That's what I'm doing.

445
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,004
What? I've been studying
Mandarin in my off time.

446
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,525
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)

447
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,170
"Do you need to go
to the bathroom?"

448
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,402
Please don't speak Chinese
or whatever during sex.

449
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,606
Okay, no problem.

450
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be so picky.

451
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,288
You look discouraged
and you're doing great.

452
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,646
I told you I wasn't
gonna be any good at this.

453
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,881
Can we try
something else?

454
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,009
Yeah. Talk about
the first time you saw me.

455
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,641
Okay?

456
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,722
That's easy. I remember
it like it was yesterday.

457
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,245
Yeah?

458
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,685
I was just getting
done in the gym.

459
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,725
You were leaving that
pizza place, remember?

460
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,801
Yeah.

461
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,042
And you were holding on to that box.
(MOANING) Mmm-hmm.

462
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,284
And you walked out. You
were wearing those jeans.

463
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,488
0h' God! They looked
so good from behind.

464
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,891
Uh-huh!
Oh!

465
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,962
From behind...
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,565
...you looked like a dude. What?

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,086
Oh!

468
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
(GRUNTING)

469
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,810
Don't move! Don't move at all!
Anything!

470
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,450
Ah! You're moving
your arm.

471
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,451
Fudge ripple
ice cream!

472
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,881
Ah!

473
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,160
(GRUNTS)

474
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,844
Oh! Yeah!

475
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,881
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

476
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,127
Oh...

477
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,009
That was great.

478
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,648
We gotta make that part of our program.
For sure.

479
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,125
Really onto something.

480
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,561
(SIGHS)

481
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,722
STEVEN: Amy, don't forget
to hydrate, babe.

482
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,364
We went verbal!

483
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,329
The boys make
the noise!

484
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,562
NOAM: What's up, brother?
Yes, I'm loving it.

485
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,770
Rastaman! Digging it with the rolling bag.
Mixed messages.

486
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,361
Come back over here.
I love you on Glee.

487
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,528
How's it going? Amy,
what's happening?

488
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,761
You got a new sign?

489
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,969
Yeah, I'm working
a couple of ideas out.

490
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,281
Yeah. I'm going to
visit my dad.

491
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,805
Oh. How is he'?

492
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,248
We put him in an assisted
living facility.

493
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,129
I don't know how
nice it is, actually.

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,887
Oh. I know exactly
how you feel.

495
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,121
The car I take
a shit in,

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
they towed it.

497
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,007
Yeah.

498
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,560
Sucks. Sorry, man.
All right. I'll see you later.

499
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,051
I'll see you later.
I'll be here.

500
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,407
Hey, I'm digging
that back camel toe.

501
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,889
NORMAN: What a
ridiculous statement!

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,885
You're talking about the most
talented player on all levels.

503
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,804
None of these bums
are the equal of Babe Ruth.

504
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,605
Norman, Babe Ruth was awful.
Stop it!

505
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,091
How can you
negate facts?

506
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,207
Just be nice to him.

507
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,567
I am nice to him.
He's not nice to me.

508
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,723
Babe Ruth was a superhero.
He was Superman!

509
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,968
Easy to be a Superman when
you never played against

510
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,166
a black guy
your whole life.

511
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,327
What does white/black
got to do with it?

512
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,402
Every 12-year-old kid in the
Dominican Republic right now

513
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,606
can probably
beat Babe Ruth.

514
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,330
Blah, blah, blah!

515
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,244
GORDON: Before 1947,
it's one big asterisk. Norman!

516
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,245
Can you just keep a low
profile for two weeks, here?

517
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,407
GORDON: Oh, I'm sorry.

518
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,323
I don't want to offend
any of these people

519
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,767
fucking each other with Viagra
day and night, God forbid.

520
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,046
Can you just be
nice and make friends?

521
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,281
After T300...

522
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,771
After dinner,

523
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,161
it turns into Caligula
around here. Trust me.

524
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,131
Please.
It's a madhouse.

525
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,407
Ifs like the Playboy
Mansion, for Christ's sake.

526
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,403
This place?
Yes.

527
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,521
(SIGHS)

528
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,690
You got my Mets stuff?

529
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,441
Yeah.

530
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,601
Am?-

531
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,727
I'll bring it by.

532
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,647
Amy. Look at me.

533
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,761
Amy?

534
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,729
Kim made me throw
a lot of it away.

535
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,285
Kim made you? Your little sister?
Yes.

536
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,771
She's mean <i>as</i> a dog.

537
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,966
Jesus!

538
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,042
I tried. I'm so sorry.

539
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,168
What do I care? It's all
memorabilia, anyway.

540
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,810
I'm memorabilia
at this point.

541
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,251
Don't say that.

542
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,966
<i>ANN". Dr. Gunners'?</i>

543
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,243
Hi. Hey.
Hi.

544
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,367
Amy Townsend.

545
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,487
<i>Aaron Gunners.</i>

546
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,005
Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

547
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,491
Thank you so much
for letting me come in.

548
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,925
No worries.

549
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,968
Um, so...

550
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,121
How does
this work?

551
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,728
0h, uh, today is really
just to go over schedules.

552
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,926
Okay.

553
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,002
AMY: If that's cool.
Yeah, that's great.

554
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,401
Uh, I have never
been interviewed

555
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,561
for a magazine.

556

<i>Hey . AARON". Hey , Lemon .</i>

557
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,841
Sorry, I don't mean
to interrupt.

558
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,251
Did I leave my
sunglasses here'?

559
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,683
I don't know.
Did you?

560
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,762
I was sitting...
Oh, here they are.

561
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,363
Did you just drive
40 minutes back here

562
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,487
to look for
your sunglasses?

563
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,846
Yeah, of course.
You think I'm gonna give

564
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,610
Sunglass Hut
another $30 for these?

565
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,681
You crazy?

566
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,250
Hey, how you doing? Hi.

567
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,641
Wait, your watch costs
more than my apartment.

568
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,085
Oh, this thing?
That was a gift.

569
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,650
We watching
Downton <i>Abbey</i> later?

570
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,127
Uh, if I get out of here on
time, yeah, we could watch it.

571
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,850
If not, let's do it tomorrow.
LEBRON: What?

572
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,921
I'm watching it tonight,

573
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,604
because I'm not gonna go to
practice in the morning,

574
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,842
and all the guys are talking
about it and I'm left out.

575
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,724
Hey, do what
you gotta do.

576
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,370
Can you validate
my parking, please?

577
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,562
I don't validate. You
should talk to Cheryl.

578
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,165
Okay, take care.
Nice meeting you.

579
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,730
AARON: Bye, LeBron.
Thanks, buddy.

580
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,007
LEBRON: Cheryl, can you
validate my parking, please?

581
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,049
Tall! Yeah, I know, right?

582
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,881
Do you know
who that was?

583
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,566
A basketball player.

584
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,530
He's LeBron James. He's kind
of "the" basketball player.

585
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,728
Oh, yeah. I think lsaw one
of his soda commercials.

586
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,801
Yeah.

587
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,046
Do you follow sports?

588
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,971
Oh, my God.

589
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,042
Sports? I love them.

590
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,281
Who are your
favorite teams?

591
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,769
I like smaller teams.
Not the big leagues.

592
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,605
I like the Long
Island Mediums.

593
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,002
The Acorn Pine Cones.

594
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,440
Haven't heard of them. The
Fire Island Penguins.

595
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,403
I like the Cincinnati
Thunder-Wizards.

596
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,766
You can stop.

597
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,205
The Orlando...

598
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,286
Blooms.

599
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
You can stop.
You don't follow sports.

600
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,322
I'm sorry, I don't.

601
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,765
I don't know
anything about sports.

602
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
You know what? That's okay, though.
Don't be embarrassed.

603
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,124
I'm sorry. No, don't
be embarrassed

604
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,362
because I actually didn't follow
sports until I got thisjob.

605
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,930
Really?
Yeah.

606
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,482
0h, my God! You have no idea
what a huge relief that is.

607
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,403
I was assigned this.

608
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,686
This was not
even my pitch.

609
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,130
Right. So you're
doing the article on me?

610
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,247
Mmm-hmm.

611
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,287
AWGSOMG.

612
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,728
I think they're kind of weird
and it's just strange.

613
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,724
Grown men wearing jerseys with
another man's name on it.

614
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,290
Like, are you in jail?
Are you his bitch?

615
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,606
Right. Kind of
like that one?

616
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,567
That's different,
because it's in a frame.

617
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,284
I think sports brings
people together.

618
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,725
It kind of forms
a community.

619
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,326
That's what I'm saying.
Right. Yeah. Obviously.

620
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,323
I'll tell you another thing
that's great about this job,

621
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,765
is that I get to
work with athletes,

622
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,161
which means that I
work with a lot of...

623
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,520
Black people?
...injuries.

624
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,523
What did you just say?
Did you say "black people"?

625
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,721
No.

626
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,326
Do you have a problem
with black people?

627
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,004
(CHUCKLING) No.
I love black people.

628
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,320
I prefer black people.

629
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,447
Do you have
black friends?

630
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,851
Endless black friends.

631
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,407
Can you show me pictures of your
black friends on your phone'?

632
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,251
You want 10 see pictures on
my phone of my black friends?

633
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,731
Amy, you gotta have
a lot of them.

634
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,009
I have so many. I'm deciding which
one, because there's so many.

635
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,048
Oh! Here we go. Oh, great.
Let's see it.

636
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,963
You're gonna be eating yourwords.
Oh, good.

637
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,121
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

638
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,289
Okay, get ready.
Black friend.

639
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,481
AARON: That is you
and a white friend,

640
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,291
and that is a black
waiter pouring your water.

641
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,211
Let me find another one.
Oh. My phone died.

642
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,204
Um, I'm gonna let you
get back to doctoring.

643
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,361
Oh, thanks.

644
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,044
I'll talk to your...
Cheryl.

645
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,607
Cheryl about when we can meet again.
Yeah.

646
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,926
Great.

647
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,931
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: No,
we're not going into the park.

648
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,770
<i>We've been in
the park already.</i>

649
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,050
Sorry I'm late.
No, it's okay.

650
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,964
It's a wonderful film
Daniel Radcliffe is in.

651
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,250
What is this movie?

652
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,765
Radcliffe is
a dog walker,

653
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,404
but he's got a chip on his
shoulder, a real edge.

654
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,686
Sundance loved it.

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,968
<i>I need help
with my dog.</i>

656
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,890
<i>I can see that.</i>

657
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,131
<i>I would love to be the one
to help you with your dog.</i>

658
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,729
<i>What's your technique?</i>

659
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,881
<i>I put them on
a leash and walk them.</i>

660
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,404
<i>You talk a big game.</i>

661
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,607
<i>That's because
I walk a big dog.</i>

662
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,451
<i>MAREMQMEY.
She looks lime...</i>

663
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,126
Am?-

664
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,771
What's up?

665
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,171
Is that wine
in a box?

666
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,521
Mmm-hmm.

667
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,647
I have red, too.

668
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,721
STEVEN: You have red, too?

669
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,365
Is this guy
ever gonna shut up?

670
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,489
Please watch
the movie.

671
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,488
Stop. That's not right.
Don't do this to me.

672
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,846
Why is he yelling?

673
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,045
Listen, you always
do this to me.

674
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,282
You show up to these places,
you put me in a situation.

675
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,327
I'm a big guy.

676
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,044
Everybody wants to fight the big guy.
Yeah, you are.

677
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,487
Hey, Mark Wahlberg,
shut your bitch up.

678
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,049
Mark Wahlberg? Me?

679
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,886
Who else looks like Mark Wahlberg?
Your girl?

680
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,681
Mark Wahlbergs, like, 150 pounds.
I'm 250, lean.

681
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,604
I look like Mark Wahlberg
ate Mark Wahlberg!

682
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,603
Your muscles aren't
the fucking problem.

683
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,444
It's your
yapping girlfriend.

684
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,449
Just say "Fuck you." Yeah?

685
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,726
I will fuck you,
all right?

686
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,165
I will enter you!

687
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,483
You're gonna
"enter" me?

688
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,641
Did you hear
what he said?

689
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,370
What are you talking
about right now?

690
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,771
(WHISPERING) I'm just
trying to intimidate him.

691
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,524
You're talking
about raping him.

692
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,882
You're not about that life, champ.
I can see it.

693
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,530
Oh, I am about that life!
MAN: No, you're not.

694
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,807
No,no,no. I will get
crazy up in here.

695
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,729
You like movies?
We'll make a movie.

696
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,569
We'll <i>make Mama
Said Knock You Out</i>

697
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,404
starring my fist
and your dick hole.

698
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,881
MANI Oh, Shit!

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,121
What the fuck is
wrong with this dude?

700
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,281
He wants you.

701
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,647
Babe, your threats, I'm telling
you, they're super gay.

702
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,926
Too sexual?
Yeah.

703
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,850
This has to be the corniest,
muscled white dude

704
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,604
I've ever seen
in my fucking life.

705
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,290
Okay, Koko B. Ware,
you know what?

706
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,084
You're being
an asshole, all right'?

707
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,889
You know what I do with assholes?
I lick them.

708
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,361
What the fuck?

709
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,930
He wants
to fuck you.

710
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,367
<i>My pooch has been
hurt more than enough.</i>

711
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,124
<i>I will make sure no one ever
hurts your pooch again.</i>

712
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,207
TOMEI: <i>I/ike when you're
taking control of your dogs.</i>

713
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,170
<i>RADCLIFFE:
I thought you would.</i>

714
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,486
I'm back.

715
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
What did I <i>miss?</i>

716
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,441
Amy, what did I miss?

717
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,444
They pre-butter it.

718
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,246
Who's Brody?

719
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,441
What?

720
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,568
Who's Oli?
Who's Brody?

721
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,365
Why do you have
my cell phone?

722
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,726
Why are you smiling?

723
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,450
I got a little
high outside.

724
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,249
Like, barely
at all high.

725
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,082
Okay, while you were
outside getting high,

726
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,049
I was putting your phone
on silent for the movie,

727
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,406
and when I did that,
I noticed you have

728
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,686
all these guys
in your phone.

729
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,683
There's Brody. There's a guy
listed as "Hot as Balls."

730
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,921
Who the fuck is
"Hot as Balls"?

731
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,370
Stop smiling!
I'm not smiling.

732
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,601
Those are
guys from work.

733
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,566
Can we just
watch this movie?

734
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,330
You know what?
No, I can't.

735
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,970
Because as I was
turning off your phone,

736
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,565
lgot a picture
of somebody's dick.

737
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,920
Itwas mine.

738
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,923
Fuck you, Tone-Léc. You want to
take it to the parking lot? Fine!

739
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,731
You can't find me? I'll be
the closest one on Grindr.

740
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,446
That's 93Y-

741
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,083
Steven, please. lam not
in shape for this.

742
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,282
Stop walking like the Hulk.
I can see that you're mad.

743
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
You are being crazy!

744
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,286
Am I? Because I think you owe
me an explanation for this.

745
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,044
Do I have to worry
about you with other guys'?

746
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,246
I'm so high
right now.

747
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,891
Can we please talk about this tomorrow?
I'm too fucked up.

748
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,121
Amy, you're always
fucked up.

749
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,451
Answer the question. Are you
hooking up with other guys?

750
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,450
We never said we
were exclusive.

751
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,921
Fuck, Amy! "Exclusive"?
It's not high school.

752
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,727
You know, every single guy I
work outwith, every single guy,

753
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,130
says that all
you're gonna do

754
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,725
is mess with my
emotions and hurt me.

755
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,604
You guys talk
about that at the gym'?

756
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,486
Fuck, Amy! Do I have to worry
about you with other guys?

757
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,688
Yes, I hook up with other guys.
(GROANS)

758
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,521
I don't go to
the movies with them.

759
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,089
That's, like,
our special thing.

760
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,810
This is so
fucking stupid.

761
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,166
You know what
the sad part is'?

762
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,040
I was gonna ask
you to marry me.

763
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,966
Really?

764
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,481
I didn't even think
you liked me very much.

765
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,403
Why are you making me
feel bad about this?

766
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,925
You can sleep
with other girls.

767
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,604
It's like every
guy's dream.

768
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,685
It's not this
guy's dream.

769
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,044
Yeah, this guy's
got a dream,

770
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,081
and it's us
making it!

771
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,570
Getting married,

772
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,369
moving out to the
countryside, having a family.

773
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,647
Three boys and
two more boys.

774
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,842
Enough for a
basketball team.

775
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,005
And I'll develop a CrossFit
program and patent it.

776
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,600
And I'll rule
the CrossFit world.

777
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,204
With you by my side.

778
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,842
<i>You can be my
Cross?“ Queen.</i>

779
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,441
That's my dream.

780
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,121
Hey.

781
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,681
Hey.

782
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,685
Can I leave?

783
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,203
Or, like, can you leave?

784
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,089
I just, like...
I'm very high,

785
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,367
and I just kind of need
this interaction to be over.

786
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,530
You serious?

787
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,606
Fuck you, Amy.
You are not nice.

788
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,810
I'm totally nice.

789
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,360
Maybe you should consider
changing your ways.

790
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,848
My "ways"?
Mmm-hmm.

791
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,405
You would love
having a family.

792
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,561
You sound
like Steven.

793
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,364
I wish I could
break up with you.

794
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,084
Having a family is fun.

795
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,764
That's fun?
Yeah.

796
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,081
They're having
a boys' lunch.

797
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,161
Here?

798
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,045
AMY: Hi!
Hi, ladies.

799
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,328
Urn, we're gonna have two mimosas.
Okay.

800
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,847
Okay.
Mmm-mmm.

801
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,520
No, you're right. Hold the orange juice.
No orange juice.

802
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,766
It's sugar.

803
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,251
So, champagne?

804
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,686
Ooh! Okay.

805
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,364
No, no.
No champagne for me.

806
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,442
Uh, yeah, we'll have
two champagnes.

807
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,965
Two champagnes.
Thanks.

808
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,889
Okay. We'll
see you in a bit.

809
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,211
Oh, my God. He's dying to fuck me.
Mmm-hmm.

810
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,361
Wait, why aren't
you drinking?

811
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,885
Have a drink with me.

812
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,927
Wait. No!

813
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,451
You're pregnant?

814
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,851
I'm pregnant.

815
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,321
Ugh!

816
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,606
Goa!

817
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,651
Tom's the father.

818
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,881
Ew!
(LAUGHS)

819
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,650
God. They look like
they're on a speed date.

820
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,210
Say "Congratulations."

821
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,481
(SCOFFS)

822
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,641
We're telling Dad.

823
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,291
I'll tell him at the
new nursing home.

824
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,407
The one that's cheaper.

825
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,168
It's not okay.
You're telling him.

826
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,242
GORDON: Kim,
are you serious?

827
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,163
Oh, my God.
Congratulations!

828
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,447
You're pregnant.
(LAUGHS)

829
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,249
Oh, my God.
Come here, come here.

830
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,485
GORDON: Oh!

831
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,404
My God! Oh, my God.

832
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,167
I'm tingling right now. I feel high.
(LAUGHING)

833
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,083
GORDON; I feel high!
That's incredible.

834
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,685
KIM: Thank you.

835
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,081
I'm finally gonna
be a grandfather.

836
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,370
You're already
a grandfather.

837
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,840
Not yet.

838
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,126
You're already
a grandfather.

839
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,890
Allister.
What's that?

840
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,121
Allister.
What about him?

841
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,486
That's your grandson.

842
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,244
Allister? (LAUGHS)

843
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,681
No, I mean, Allister's
your step-child

844
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,524
and my step-grandkid,
lguess.

845
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,045
But I'm talking
about your kid.

846
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,003
Our bloodlines!
That's... Yeah.

847
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,849
I was the first
person on my block

848
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,445
to own a television set.

849
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,489
That's really not
relevant right now, Norman.

850
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,005
It's not relevant.

851
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,525
Come on, that's more
like Tom's kid.

852
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,967
Ifs Tom's kid,
who you help with.

853
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,491
Dad, you love Allister.

854
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,891
GORDON; I like Allister.

855
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,406
I care for him,
I fear for him.

856
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,130
I know what happens to a kid
like that in the schoolyard.

857
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,248
We had a kid
like that. Stewie.

858
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,800
We used to beat him
mercilessly.

859
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,881
Oh!

860
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,604
Some of the beatings
I almost feel bad about.

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,684
That's gonna
happen to this kid.

862
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,723
I'm trying to protect him, trying
to teach him how to be a man.

863
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,801
I don't know what
you're talking about.

864
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,245
You were the
worst father ever.

865
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,001
Come on.
I wasn't a bad father.

866
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,570
Mom did everything
when we were growing up.

867
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,244
You wouldn't understand
because you weren't there.

868
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,288
So, now your mother's a saint?
Of course she's a saint.

869
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,886
Of course, because once you
die, everybody's a saint.

870
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,246
Dad, just shut up.

871
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,448
We were talking about
this yesterday, right?

872
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,726
About Allister.
KIM: Amy?

873
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,087
No! He's lying.
Amy'?

874
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,844
Amy, come on, you said
he's the kind of kid

875
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,127
who drops his
pants to the floor

876
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,361
when he pees
in the urinal.

877
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,408
AMY: No, you said that!
GORDON: That's funny to guys.

878
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,130
AMY: I said he
pees sitting down.

879
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,402
(LAUGHS) That was funny.
AMY: Itwas a joke.

880
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,369
I cannot believe
that you guys

881
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,851
are teaming up
against me again.

882
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,964
Oh! No! I'm on your side!

883
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,849
I'm on your team.
You're not on my team!

884
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,446
Sorry if I'm excited more about my
grandkid than some step-grandkid.

885
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,807
They're both your
grandkid, God damn it!

886
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,563
What the...
Kimberly, come...

887
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,525
Is that your wife?

888
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,523
What is this speech
you have to make

889
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,204
for Doctors
With Borders?

890
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,124
"Without."
Without Borders.

891
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,281
Ifs "Doctors
Without Borders."

892
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,327
on. Right.

893
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,164
Yeah, it's Doctors
Without Borders.

894
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,322
It's a really
good organization.

895
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,483
Basically, we go to places
with the most conflict,

896
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,449
places with the
biggest disasters,

897
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,249
and we go in
and help people.

898
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,125
So, you help
people by choice,

899
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,406
and that's
what you like'?

900
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,566
Yeah. It's great work. It's very
rewarding, helping these people.

901
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,721
Wow!

902
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,565
What's your story? Are you a
Division One athlete or something?

903
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,804
Me? No, no. I was on the
Xbox that I was playing,

904
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,565
and then I got really high
and tripped on my bong.

905
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,967
Are you high?

906
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,041
Yeah.

907
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,764
(GUFFAWS)

908
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,841
Wow.

909
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,410
So high.

910
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,691
I think you got your
new article right here.

911
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,807
Here we go.

912
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,370
All right.

913
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,284
So, this is our Sports Medicine
and Performance Center.

914
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,327
Wow.

915
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,686
This is where most
of our athletes come

916
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,325
and do the
rehabilitation.

917
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,890
What does this do?

918
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,801
Come on.

919
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,885
So the HBM shows
how your muscles

920
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,883
are working
and moving,

921
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,327
so your rehab is
most effective.

922
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,801
It could help you with
your gait, your posture.

923
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,086
My gait?
(MACHINE BEEPS)

924
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,924
Mmm-hmm.
AMY: Okay.

925
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,570
So, just walk
normal for a second.

926
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,369
AMY: That looks pretty good.
Okay, okay.

927
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,761
Just walk naturally
for one second, please.

928
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,641
AMY: Like this'?

929
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,041
I walk like Beyoncé. People
always think I'm her.

930
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,844
We share on Instagram.

931
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,649
Is that how you walk down the street?
AMY: MMm-hmm.

932
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,046
No, this is how I walk.

933
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,964
I think the screen's doing different
stuff than what I'm doing.

934
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,884
What we can do with this,
is we could show

935
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,090
how you can, um, fix your
posture and your gait.

936
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,448
I really wouldn't
do a Hitler march.

937
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,730
Just walk the way you
walk down the street.

938
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,965
AMY: Like this'?

939
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,005
AMY: All right.
Sorry, I'm listening.

940
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,491
Okay. We good? You good?

941
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,681
All right. Thank you.

942
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,491
Wait, who is this? Watch the screen.
Who is this?

943
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,401
Who? Kevin Spacey at end

were, like, super small.

some Chipotle,

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,090
Holy shit.
(REMOTE CLATTERS)

1100
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,605
Hi.
Hi.

1101
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,564
(KISSING)

1102
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,124
So we're gonna
do this now?

1103
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,929
We are gonna
do this now.

1104
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,081
Okay, that's...

1105
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,641
Is that okay?

1106
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,767
That's cool, yeah.

1107
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,841
Whoa!

1108
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,088
Do you own this place?
Are you renting it?

1109
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,571
I own it.

1110
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,369
Cool, that's
really nice.

1111
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,771
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

1112
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,205
We're doing this
right now?

1113
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,611
We are doing
this right now.

1114
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,091
We are off
to the races.

1115
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,208
Yeah, it's happening. Okay.

1116
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,004
All right.
That's nice.

1117
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,081
Oh, man.
Oh, God!

1118
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,044
0h, my God!

1119
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,321
Good for you.

1120
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,050
Yeah, thank you.

1121
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,207
I didn't see
this for you.

1122
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,406
<i>Uh , yeah'?
Mmm-hmm.</i>

1123
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,045
(BOTH SIGH)

1124
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,041
Okay.

1125
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,086
I'm gonna head out.

1126
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,321
Oh, no.

1127
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,731
Thank you.

1128
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,009
Why don't you
stay over?

1129
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,647
Yes. No, I'm not gonna
stay here. I just...

1130
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,370
You have an
early day, I bet.

1131
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,010
No, it's fine.

1132
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,085
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1133
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,365
Are you comfortable?
No. No, I'm not.

1134
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,204
I don't really
like to spoon.

1135
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,281
Oh.

1136
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,645
Okay. Yeah, sorry. Can we...

1137
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,321
If I stay here,
can we just sleep

1138
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,010
in a realistic position?

1139
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,684
Sure, yeah.

1140
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,285
Because I'm
a light sleeper,

1141
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,410
and if I feel you
move or sweat or breathe,

1142
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,050
I'll wake up
and just lay here

1143
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,242
resenting you
all night.

1144
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,526
So, yeah, can we...

1145
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,602
Actually, could we put
this pillow in between us?

1146
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,768
That'll be good. Put
the pillow between us?

1147
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,171
Yeah, that's not
your main pillow

1148
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,526
that you use, is it'?

1149
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,931
No.
Okay, cool.

1150
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,241
Let's kind of
get that in there.

1151
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,560
Thank you.
Okay.

1152
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,801
Yeah.

1153
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,446
I'm sorry
I'm nit-picking,

1154
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,921
but you're breathing on me
pretty hard right now.

1155
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,286
Yeah, it's like
a strong wind.

1156
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,566
What do you
need me to do?

1157
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,689
Breathe up towards the sky
and not at me. (SIGHS)

1158
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,046
Yeah, you got it.

1159
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,281
Sorry, it's
just a lot.

1160
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,047
Like this? Are you
feeling better?

1161
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,930
Let me see. Do it and <i>I'll
</i> tell you if I can feel it.

1162
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,769
I'm still getting
a little bit of a wind.

1163
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,410
Oh... Jesus.

1164
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,366
Do you want me
to go home?

1165
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,646
I can sleep at home.

1166
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,484
No, this is
so worth it.

1167
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,641
(SIGHS)

1168
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,488
Nikki, just hurry up
and get here.

1169
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,807
When you're
writing an article,

1170
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,370
do you always use
a tape recorder?

1171
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,601
No.

1172
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,769
Um, when you're
writing an article,

1173
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,366
what are the 10 biggest
mistakes you could make?

1174
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,522
Plagiarizing, getting
drunk, fucking someone.

1175
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,608
Have you ever seen any kind
of article about a fetish

1176
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,365
where guys like to
masturbate to hockey fights?

1177
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,290
That's not a thing.
Not a thing.

1178
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,044
Then Why'd it
work for me?

1179
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,284
We're in the middle
of something, so...

1180
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,885
Yeah. Seriously, right?

1181
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,961
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1182
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,286
Okay, so, that
actually brings me

1183
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,124
to an interesting
line of questioning.

1184
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,601
You know what? Uh, they're
gonna want you to just do

1185
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,603
a bunch of web stuff
because you're younger.

1186
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,081
Everyone has a boner for young
people on the Internet, okay?

1187
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,531
They think you have the key to it.
DIANNA: Amy!

1188
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,841
That's why we'll do anything
we can to help you here.

1189
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,285
Right, but when you're
writing an article...

1190
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,407
Sorry, talk to me
about it later.

1191
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,447
Just write
them all down.

1192
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,521
I'll be
helpful later.

1193
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,681
Okay.

1194
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,968
I like you, Amy. I do, you know?

1195
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,122
You're clever, but
you're not too brainy.

1196
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,807
You're pretty-ish and you're not gorgeous.
You're approachable.

1197
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,961
Thank you.
Yeah.

1198
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,122
I want this promotion
for you, Amy, you know'?

1199
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,009
I want you to
help me to help you.

1200
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,923
I need to go up there,
to the men upstairs.

1201
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,327
I need you to provide
me with the ammo

1202
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,085
to get them to know that you
can handle their workload.

1203
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,929
Can you handle
their load, Amy?

1204
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,128
I can handle all their loads.
That's it.

1205
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,481
Nikki.

1206
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,604
Hey. Where have you been?

1207
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,886
Sorry, I was
getting a smoothie.

1208
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,121
Can you sit, please?

1209
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,447
I slept at the doctor's
place last night.

1210
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,847
Oh, my God, because you
were blackout drunk?

1211
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,641
No, that's the thing. I was dead sober.
I had like two drinks.

1212
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,131
Three, max.

1213
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,044
Four, now that I'm tallying.
But I was sober.

1214
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,009
So you barely drank?
Barely.

1215
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,445
Because you're on
antibiotics or something?

1216
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,443
No, lspent the
night on purpose.

1217
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,409
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1218
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,561
When you think
about the sex,

1219
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,926
are you just
kind of like...

1220
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,164
No. I'm like...

1221
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,601
So, you're like...

1222
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,609
No, that's not what I'm doing.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1223
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,165
Oh, my God!
He's calling.

1224
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,368
Why would he call?
You guysjust had sex.

1225
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,487
It's probably a mistake.

1226
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,210
It's a mistake.
He's butt-dialing you.

1227
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,361
Hello.

1228
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,726
<i>AARON: Oh.
Hey, there. It's Aaron.</i>

1229
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,450
Oh. This is Amy.

1230
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,965
I think you
butt-dialed me.

1231
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,804
No, ldialed you
with my fingers.

1232
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,285
What's she saying? What did she say?
(SHUSHING)

1233
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,407
He called me
on purpose.

1234
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,801
Hang up. He's obviously
sick or something.

1235
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,447
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

1236
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,124
I was calling to say I had a
really good time last night.

1237
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,487
I was wondering if you wanted
to, um, hang out again.

1238
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,329
Will you say
that again, please?

1239
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,844
<i>I was wondering
if I could see you again.</i>

1240
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,410
You know what? I'm
gonna call the police.

1241
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,084
Hold on, hold on.

1242
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,525
I'll just talk
to you about it

1243
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,045
tomorrow at
the interview.

1244
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,202
<i>Okay? Oh, yes! She said yes!</i>

1245
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,566
<i>okay, We-</i>

1246
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,165
All right, I'll
talk to you then.

1247
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,171
Oh! Man!

1248
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,085
That's pretty
cool, man.

1249
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,810
I didn't get 10 hear the
whole conversation, though.

1250
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,609
We're gonna
talk about it

1251
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,841
when we see each
other tomorrow.

1252
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,126
That's great, man.

1253
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,690
Yeah, she's got
a sexy voice.

1254
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,087
Did you guys
make love?

1255
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,161
Yeah.
Oh!

1256
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,041
<i>Whom!</i>

1257
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,525
My boy got intimate. Yeah.

1258
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,846
Sexual intercourse!
Whoa!

1259
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,888
Do you want to just
announce it to everybody?

1260
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,726
My boy got a girlfriend.
Man, it's been forever!

1261
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,087
Yeah. I'm not gonna lie.
It's been a while.

1262
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,561
Yeah, it's been
six years since Sheila.

1263
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,569
And that only lasted five weeks.
Yep.

1264
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,641
There was Debbie.

1265
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,609
Debbie didn't even
tell you where she lived.

1266
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,681
Yeah, she thought
I was a psycho.

1267
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,250
She kept calling
me "Dexter."

1268
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,725
What I'm saying is,
you got to go for it.

1269
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,569
You need to focus if you want
to take it to the next level.

1270
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,607
Right.

1271
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,085
You have to. You got
to give it everything

1272
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,400
if you want
this one, man.

1273
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,444
It like, when I lost the
Championship in 2011,

1274
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,284
I worked on my
game twice as hard,

1275
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,044
worked on my
post-up game,

1276
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,242
and we wound up winning
the Championship, twice.

1277
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,486
Yeah. Yeah.

1278
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,800
I don't feel like
that applies to me.

1279
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,247
But I appreciate
the thought.

1280
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,801
Aaron, you have to take a risk.
You have to. Yeah, you're right.

1281
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,962
Ifs like, when I decided
to go back to Cleveland,

1282
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,611
I wasn't totally sure they was
gonna welcome me back, man.

1283
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,170
But they did.
They welcomed me back

1284
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,129
with open arms
and an open heart.

1285
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,406
Yeah, they did. Again, I feel
that applies more to you.

1286
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,764
I don't even
live in Cleveland.

1287
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,524
But, again, I
appreciate the thought.

1288
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,681
Cleveland, Ohio?

1289
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,842
You're talking about the home of
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1290
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,048
Or maybe we go down lo Canton to
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

1291
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,531
Did you know Superman
was created in Cleveland?

1292
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,443
Yeah, I know Superman
was created in Cleveland.

1293
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,010
You've told me that
a number of times.

1294
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,884
You ever seen a Cuyahoga sunset?
No.

1295
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,325
Do you know Cleveland's
great for the whole family?

1296
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,131
Yes. Yes, I do. You tell
me that all the time.

1297
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,288
You randomly just text me that.
And what's wrong with that?

1298
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,966
Which is weird. It's weird.
I got free texting.

1299
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,769
Why are you trying to always
sell me on Cleveland?

1300
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,291
When are you gonna
come to Cleveland?

1301
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,130
(STAMMERING) I'll come
when I have the time.

1302
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,321
I just don't have
the time right now.

1303
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,204
I'll come when I have the time.
I've just been really busy.

1304
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,691
You visit me in
Miami all the time.

1305
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,330
Yeah, but that's
Miami. I mean...

1306
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,448
What's the difference between
Miami and Cleveland?

1307
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,641
It's the same.

1308
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,006
You're right,
it's the same.

1309
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,411
Exactly.

1310
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,004
Okay, so you had the salmon.
That's about 14 dollars.

1311
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,963
What are you doing, man?
You had two Cokes.

1312
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,809
Dude, are you trying
to split the bill'?

1313
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,360
Look, I told you those
refills weren't free.

1314
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,646
No, no, no, we're
not splitting the bill.

1315
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,801
Pick up the check.

1316
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,647
Why do I have to
pick up the check'?

1317
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,767
Because you're
LeBron James.

1318
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,649
Listen, don't look at
me no differently now

1319
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,290
just because
I got a little money.

1320
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,683
Look, I don't know how
long this could last.

1321
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,290
Anything can happen.
Right.

1322
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,283
I'm not about to
end up like MC Hammer.

1323
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,010
Listen, you
owe $32.43.

1324
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,889
You know what?

1325
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,611
I'll pay it, but you got to pick
up a check every once in a while.

1326
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,886
No, don't pay
the whole thing.

1327
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,126
Just pay your part.

1328
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,124
Ifs better for our friendship.
Equals forever.

1329
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,009
All right, fine.
All right.

1330
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,081
I'll put my
credit card in.

1331
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,083
Put a credit card in,
we'll split it.

1332
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,170
That's what I'm talking about.
(SIGHS)

1333

Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1334
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,400
I think I left my wallet.
Fuck you.

Yeah.

Why Billy Joel?
Why Uptown <i>Girl?</i>

1341
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,965
I love that song.

1342
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,646
That's probably the worst
Billy Joel song.

1343
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,449
I'm pretty sure
Billy Joel hates that song.

1344
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,210
Oh, he shouldn't.
It's great.

1345
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,201
Okay.

1346
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,887
So, uh,
off the record,

do you wanna maybe

Um...

Actually, Aaron,
I think you're so great,

but I'm a writer.

I'm your writer,
you're my subject,

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,523
and from now on, we need to
just keep it professional.

00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,647
Okay.
You know'?

1354
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,046
Yeah.
Okay.

1355
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,451
I think we really
like each other

1356
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,681
and we should
start dating.

1357

No, I'm saying...

1358
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,041
I'm confused.

1359
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,043
Am I not communicating
this right?

1360
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,122
No, I hear you. I'm
just saying I disagree.

1361
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,202
Do you like me?
Yeah.

Yeah, see,
I really like you.

No.

Okay, I'm on my way.

Nothing.

Is that right?

01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,006
All right,
I get it.

1564
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,121
Hey, Noam.

1565
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,281
Hey, guys!

1566
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,601
Whoa! Inside sex!
I'm digging that.

1567
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,489
<i>AMY: Even my dad likes him.
My dad doesn't like anyone.</i>

1568
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,245
<i>He thought Mother Teresa
was M! oi shit.</i>

1569
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,250
<i>That's my "Aaron 's apartment" toothbrush.
I have two toothbrushes.</i>

1570
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,567
<i>I hope this love montage
ends like Jonestown.</i>

1571
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,448
Ooh! <i>I</i> think <i>this</i> is where
Woody Alien met Soon Vi.

1572
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,329
<i>Okay, e65'!-</i>

1573
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,169
<i>That was a dare, okay?</i>

1574
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,641
<i>I was dared to do that.</i>

1575
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,084
So what's up with you and Amy?
How's that going?

1576
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,288
Amy? Things are
going awesome, man.

1577
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,771
Yeah?
Yeah.

1578
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,366
Yeah. lfs going
real good.

1579
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,044
I mean, I really,
really like her,

1580
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,487
but she's got
some issues, you know'?

1581
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,771
I mean, that's gonna happen.

1582
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,330
AARON; Yeah.

1583
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,129
Like, last night we
went out drinking.

1584
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,969
You? Yeah, lwent out drinking.

1585
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,166
And she...

1586
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,201
I don't drink.
I got hammered.

1587
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,647
And then she drank a lot,
but she barely got...

1588
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,567
(SNEAKERS SQUEAKING)

1589
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,563
But she didn't
get drunk at all.

1590
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,408
You use
protection, right'?

1591
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,447
Yeah.

1592
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,522
Yeah, yeah. She's got
little bowls of condoms

1593
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,601
all around
her apartment.

1594
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,761
Condoms?

1595
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,887
I'm not talking
about condoms.

1596
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,088
I'm talking about
protection, like a lawyer.

1597
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,845
Like a nondisclosure
agreement, you know'?

1598
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,170
No penetration
without representation.

1599
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,450
Yeah, you're right.

1600
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,961
What happened?

1601
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,769
Nothing, man.

1602
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,001
Listen, I'll tell
you one thing.

1603
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,241
You don't wanna
have a baby mama.

1604
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,481
The next thing
you know,

1605
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,607
you're paying
for a Ferrari.

1606
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,762
You're getting her a big
house, a big mansion.

1607
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,251
She's gonna want to
start a jumpsuit line,

1608
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,646
and you're gonna
have to pay for it.

1609
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,051
You wanna
go through that'?

1610
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,167
You gotta convince
one of your friends

1611
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,123
to say he's the dad
and raise the child.

1612
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,605
Who wants to
go through that?

1613
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,886
Kid end up
being 67",

1614
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,445
your best friend only 5'2".
Mmm-hmm.

1615
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,931
Eighteen years later,
the kid comes

1616
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
and he writes
a book about you

1617
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,404
saying how much of
a jackass you are.

1618
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,603
Eighteen years, man.
18 years.

1619
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,331
Your baby mama's car and
crib is bigger than his.

1620
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,402
You could turn on
the TV any given Sunday.

1621
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,404
Win the Super Bowl
and drive off in a Hyundai.

1622
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,086
She was supposed to get the
shorty Tyco with your money.

1623
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,447
Then she went to the doctor,
got Iipo with your money.

1624
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,760
What are you
talking about?

1625
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,649
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1626
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,687
It's Kanye.

1627
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,489
You're quoting
Kanye West to me?

1628
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,642
You know what?
Amy's not like that.

1629
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,087
Amy's not like that at all.
She's awesome.

1630
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,241
And this is
gonna be great.

1631
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,408
I think she's cool, and I don't
think I have to worry about that.

1632
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,811
All right.

1633
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,767
Oh!

1634
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,966
Did you
let me do that?

1635
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,451
Did I just score on you?

1636
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,888
Yes! You are my bitch,
LeBron James!

1637
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,450
But not really.
Not really.

1638
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,962
You gotta admit, that was a good shot.
Come on, man.

1639
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,485
I scored on
LeBron James.

1640
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,800
I'm never playing
basketball again.

1641
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,490
Lunch is on
you, buddy!

1642
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,561
LEBRON: Where are
you going, Aaron?

1643
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,641
AARON; Whoo!

1644
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,081
Aaron?

1645
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,366
<i>Lemon .</i>

1646
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,401
<i>Whom!</i>

1647
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,765
God damn it!

1648
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,605
How's work?

1649
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,080
Work's great,
actually.

1650
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,969
I think I'm gonna
get that editorjob.

1651
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,123
Aaron's been kind of pushing
me to think bigger.

1652
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,686
Can I just
do this, please?

1653
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,366
Aaron was telling me
about this acupuncturist.

1654
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,521
She's supposedly amazing.

1655
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,523
She helps a lot of his
patients with pain management.

1656
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,001
I really want herto take a look at you.
Will you do that?

1657
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,048
I have no desire
for an Oriental woman

1658
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,610
to touch me
above the waist.

1659
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,211
Don't say that.
That's disgust...

1660
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,406
It's Asian.
Just say Asian.

1661
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,006
Why does Aaron
all of a sudden

1662
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,445
know everything
about everything?

1663
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,248
He's a doctor.
He knows something.

1664
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,721
He's a sports doctor. He's not
a real doctor, let's face it.

1665
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,167
A real doctor
tries to cure diseases.

1666
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,561
He's trying to get courtside
<i>seats</i> for the playoffs.

1667
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,688
You're saying sports doctors
aren't real doctors?

1668
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,364
Yeah. When they say, "What
do you wanna focus on?"

1669
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,044
"I wanna focus on MS."

1670
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,407
"What do you wanna focus on?"
"I wanna focus on cancer."

1671
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,527
"What about you?"

1672
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,365
"Whatever gets me closest
to men's locker rooms."

1673
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,407
Okay.

1674
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,246
"I want giant, athletic
penises close to my face,

1675
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,084
"while I'm pretending
to look at their knees."

1676
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,366
He's a good doctor,

1677
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,566
and he does a lot with
Doctors Without Borders.

1678
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,687
He's a great guy.

1679
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,286
I'm not saying
he's not a good guy,

1680
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,771
but he's got
about a month left

1681
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,803
before you give
him the boot, right'?

1682
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,567
What does that mean?

1683
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,450
He's a reaction from the
muscle-bound Knucklehead,

1684
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,363
so now you go for
the nerdy brainiac.

1685
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,602
I know the way your
pattern works, Amy.

1686
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,886
It's my pattern.

1687
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,564
No, Dad,
lreallylike him.

1688
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,007
I want you to be nice to him, and
I want you to take it seriously.

1689
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,081
Will you do that'?

1690
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,650
I think we have
a real shot.

1691
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,721
That's great.

1692
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,404
You sound like
a Lifetime movie.

1693
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,768
One of the happy ones,
not the murder ones.

1694
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,808
Don't you want
me to be happy? I mean...

1695
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,850
You're building him up, and you're
gonna let yourself in for a big fail.

1696
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,686
He's gonna
break your heart.

1697
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,447
I'm leaving.

1698
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,650
AMY: I'll talk to you later.

1699
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,324
I'll tell Temembe
to come get you.

1700
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,244
GORDON: Amy,
don't leave like this.

1701
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,969
I don't like it when you don't
talk to me for a while.

1702
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,084
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

1703
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,322
No, lwanna be
doing this with you.

1704
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,963
Ifs the only one I've ever
done that we've framed.

1705
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,280
WENDY: It looks great.

1706
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,561
It seems like a
regional thing.

1707
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,767
Girl!

1708
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,366
Hey.
Hi.

1709
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,805
Hi.
Hey, I'm Aaron.

1710
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,530
I'm Kim. So nice to meet you.

1711
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,601
Ifs really nice
to meet you.

1712
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,484
You're Tom? Pleasure
to meet you.

1713
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,801
Hey, Amy.
How are you'?

1714
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,531
Congrats on trapping my
sister with your seed.

1715
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,171
Well, not all sex ends with a
ﬂush and a cry. (CHUCKLES)

1716
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,368
Sometimes you get this. (LAUGHS)

1717
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,885
That's killer.
KIM: Come on in!

1718
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,007
I'll get you
guys a drink.

1719
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,570
Anything that
you want.

1720
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,290
I haven't been to a
baby shower in years.

1721
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,361
We're so glad
you made it.

1722
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,124
Yeah. Hey,
congratulations, man.

1723
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,283
So I hear that you
work with athletes.

1724
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,328
Yeah, I'm a physician
and a surgeon.

1725
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,289
Mostly work with
the Knicks right now.

1726
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,044
ALL: Ooh. TIM: That
sounds very cool.

1727
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,804
Yeah, yeah.

1728
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,723
And other athletes.

1729
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,321
Really?
Like, which ones?

1730
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,767
Specifically,
which athletes?

1731
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,366
Uh... Tom Brady.

01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,165
Yeah.

1734
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,481
Any other athletes
that you, uh, work with'?

1735
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,563
Uh... Jay Cutler.

ALL: Whoa! Yeah, lwork with him.

1737
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,566
Do you guys
follow tennis?

1738
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,641
ALL: Yeah.

1739
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,881
<i>Roger Fewer.</i>

TOM: lagree.
KEVIN: Yeah.

1752
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,609
Amy, he's great.

did you find him?

(STAMMERS) Work.

1755
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,043
Well, you two are
really cute together.

1756
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,606
You two would have
the most perfect babies.

1757
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,842
I could just eat you up.
You know'?

1758
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,968
Yeah, it seems a little early
for this kind of talk.

1759
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,087
It's not.

1760
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,286
If anything,
it's late.

1761
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,524
My life did not begin
until I had kids.

1762
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,045
Your life has not begun.

1763
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,408
Yeah, you know, I'm pretty
happy right now, so...

1764
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,209
LISA: Aaron, do you
want a family?

1765
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,244
Um... Yeah.

1766
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,401
I think I'd like
to have two kids

1767
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,244
by the time I'm
40 at least, right?

1768
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,287
Yeah.
Oh, that's great.

1769
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,249
Two is tight.
It's tight.

1770
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,924
WENDY: If I were you,
I would start thinking

1771
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,604
about having them
as soon as possible.

1772
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,409
Just breathe. Just breathe.
It's fine.

1773
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,686
He wants to have kids. Amy.

1774
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,091
Right now. People
talk about that.

1775
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,321
Not really.
It's fine.

1776
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,606
I don't know anyone
that talks about that.

1777
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,284
He's great.
It's normal.

1778
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,805
I think Aaron's great.
I really like him.

1779
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,882
Can you tell the members of
Heaven's Gate in there to relax?

1780
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,564
No, he's too nice.
He's not too nice.

1781
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,244
Yes, he is. He's too nice for me.
You know it.

1782
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,446
No, Amy.

1783
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,965
He's the perfect amount
of nice that you deserve.

1784
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,088
Yeah, but there's deal-breakers
across the hoard with him.

1785
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,447
Like the sex is good.
It's really good.

1786
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,091
It's great, but it's not the
best I've ever had. You know?

1787
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,690
Right. You don't want
best-sex-that-yowve- ever-had guy.

1788
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,411
No, you wanna stay with the
best-yowve-ever-had guy.

1789
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,891
No, you don't.
That's a creepy guy.

1790
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,961
You don't wanna
be with that guy.

1791
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,805
Best-sex-that-yowve-
ever-had guy is in jail.

1792
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,041
You know what I mean?

1793
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,246
Yeah.

1794
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,209
But I've been thinking about
maybe reaching outto him.

1795
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,281
(LAUGHS) Stop.

1796
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,129
Amy, breathe. It's fine.
He's great.

1797
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,201
You're ridiculous.

1798
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,401
ALLISTER: Mother.
I'm not ready for.“

1799
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,764
lfl kiss the belly
hard enough,

1800
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,444
will the baby feel it?

1801
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,405
You wanna try?

1802
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,561
I think that the
baby did feel it.

1803
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,921
No.

1804
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,001
Kim's great, man.

1805
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,650
Oh, yeah. She's really awesome.

1806
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,846
Kim's the best.

1807
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,331
I'm glad I finally
got to meet her.

1808
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,722
Yeah, and Amy's great,
too, by the way.

1809
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,003
I just love her.

1810
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,844
But keep her away
from those pro athletes.

1811
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,684
You know what I mean?
(LAUGHING)

1812
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,364
Wait, what does
that mean?

1813
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,846
Um...

1814
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,649
<i>No. “was a 'yoke.</i>

1815
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,529
Like, that she'd
sleep with them.

1816
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,090
I don't get
the joke angle.

1817
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,168
No, not that
she would, but...

1818
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,681
Those are the kinds
of jokes she tells.

1819
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,286
Like, "I'm loose! I'm a
whore!" or whatever.

1820
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,361
That's my
girlfriend.

1821
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,966
No! I know.
It's not myjoke.

1822
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,844
Those are the kind
of jokes she tells,

1823
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,088
which I'm not
for at all.

1824
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,049
I'm always like, "Don't
tell these kinds of jokes."

1825
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,884
And then she does,
and I'm like,

1826
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,610
"There she
goes again."

1827
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,045
But I'm
just like...

1828
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,121
Just forget
I said this.

1829
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,690
Just drag that
one to the trash

1830
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,206
and empty
the trash.

1831
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,328
The game is “Skeletons
in the Closet."

1832
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,441
Okay.

1833
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,090
We all have
to admit things

1834
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,083
we've never
told anyone before.

1835
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,400
KAT: No! Wendy!

1836
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,845
Yes!
Yes, we have to.

1837
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,244
WENDY: We have to do it.
KAT: Okay, okay.

1838
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,722
Sometimes, after
Kyle falls asleep,

1839
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,484
I get up and eat Skinny
Cow ice cream pops.

1840
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,561
No!

1841
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,529
LISA: No, you don't.
You should be asleep!

1842
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,080
I know! Sometimes
I have the whole box.

1843
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,241
LISA; What?

1844
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,961
That's like a whole regular-size ice
cream if you eat the whole box.

1845
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,088
I know.
Your turn.

1846
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,924
Okay. Um...

1847
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,449
Last week, I let my
six-year-old watch Glee.

1848
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,760
(ALL GASP)
LISA: I know. I know.

1849
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,966
Too SOON!

1850
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,405
KIM: That show is very racy.

1851
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,251
There were some homosexual undertones.
I will say that.

1852
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,971
There were two girls
kissing in this episode.

1853
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,805
And I haven't even explained
to them what gay people are.

1854
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,326
Uh, they're people.

1855
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,690
Okay, okay.
Amy, your turn.

1856
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,086
Um...

1857
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,931
I don't know how I'm gonna follow these.
They were so good.

1858
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,490
You guys are
really brave.

1859
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,207
Thanks for trusting.

1860
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,921
Um...

1861
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,328
Onetime, I had
sex with this guy,

1862
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,004
and we couldn't
find the condom.

1863
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,927
So, three days later, I found out
it was attached to my cervix.

1864
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,128
It had been kind of
pounded up there.

1865
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,451
And so I googled
what do I do, right'?

1866
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,205
So it said just
kind of bear down.

1867
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,201
Just fish it out.

1868
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,968
Make your finger a hook.

1869
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,409
So I just hooked

kind of beared down,

Not that great of a guy.

1902
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,801
He was
kind of racist,

1903
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,080
and homophobic.

1904

went over there

he loved her
a lot. But...

1933

He was really sick
for a really long time.

Which isn't fair

because I don't
think anyone else

was more alive than him
when he was younger.

1937
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,682
He thought it was payback.
He thought it was karma.

1938
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,000
And that's why
he got sick,

01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,445
but I don't think so.

1940

I think he was
the greatest dad.

a dream or something.

talking about this?

Don't.

Do not grieve?
No.

There's no tension.

01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,965
in the middle of
my speech anyway.

2182
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,042
That was just so
disrespectful, Amy.

2183
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,567
All right, goodbye.

2184
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,608
No, Amy! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What
are you talking about, "goodbye"?

2185
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,920
What? I'm leaving!

2186
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,048
We're fighting. We're not
gonna talk for a while.

2187
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,360
That's how this works.

2188
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,885
What are you
talking about?

2189
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,564
No! We're just
having a fight.

2190
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,291
What are we doing?
What do you want?

2191
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,646
Why are you with me?

2192
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,881
I love you.

2193
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,291
WhY do you keep
Saying that?

2194
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,362
Because I mean it! I love you!
I'm crazy about you!

2195
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,646
What do you
want me to say?

2196
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,610
We're just having a fight.
You insulted me,

2197
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,444
and we'll talk about it,
and we'll work through it.

2198
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,807
What's wrong with you
that you want to be with me?

2199
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,166
I'm a drinker.

2200
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,401
I don't care!

2201
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,720
I've been with
a lot of guys.

2202
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,802
I don't care!

2203
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:49,881
How many?

2204
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,041
I don't know.

2205
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,649
How many girls
have you slept with?

2206
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,881
I've slept with
three women.

2207
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,961
Me, tOO.

2208
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,122
I have slept with
three women, too.

2209
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,086
How many guys?

2210
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,567
What, this year?

2211
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,846
This year?

2212
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,490
Fuck this. I'm not
talking about this.

2213
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,686
Come on. Don't say "fuck this."

2214
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,330
Don't follow me.
Amy!

2215
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,880
I'm tired.
Iwanna go to sleep.

2216
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,327
You can go to your apartment.
It's nicer than mine.

2217
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,210
No. Look, my parents had a
saying, "Don't go to bed angry."

2218
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,567
We're angry, let's resolve this.
Okay?

2219
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,926
Your parents
weren't that happy.

2220
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,161
They're very haPPY-

2221
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,321
Fine. You wanna
talk about it?

2222
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,640
You want to get into it? Yes!

2223
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,085
Let's get into all of it right now.
Yes, please.

2224
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,400
Okay, let's do it.
Okay.

2225
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,527
I'll start.

2226
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,170
You go down
on me too much.

2227
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,527
What?
Yeah.

2228
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,567
It's selfish.

2229
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,523
No, it is actually selfish,
because you act...

2230
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,766
Don't look
like I'm crazy.

2231
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,285
You act like
it's for me,

2232
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,522
but really, it's just to
show how great you are.

2233
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,125
Like, you're always
helping people.

2234
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,725
So I shouldn't go
down on you as much?

2235
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,086
Don't try and
spin this as a way

2236
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,161
to not go down
on me as much.

2237
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,446
That's ridiculous.

2238
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,568
Of course, I want you to
go down on me that much.

2239
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,766
So take it
down a notch?

2240
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,330
No, keep going
down on me.

2241
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,482
Forget this whole part
of the argument, okay'?

2242
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,686
Forget that.

2243
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,050
I'm so glad
you apologized.

2244
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,451
I didn't apologize!

2245
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,567
Wow!

2246
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,687
I did not
apologize.

2247
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,444
Are you serious
right now?

2248
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,568
I've been through
a lot this year,

2249
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,291
and of course I'm gonna have
some ups and downs,

2250
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,488
but that's why I need
to stop and then say,

2251
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,971
"Am I gonnajust
follow the river

2252
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,690
"or am I gonna make
decisions in my..."

2253
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,000
You're sleeping!

2254
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,206
You were just asleep.

2255
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,044
No, lwasn't.
Okay, good.

2256
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,088
Because I am not even close to done.
Okay.

2257
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,447
I have a lot of thoughts and I'm
thinking very clearly right now.

2258
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,763
I'm so glad that I feel comfortable
enough with you to talk like this.

2259
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,251
This is the time
when you have to look

2260
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,401
at yourself and say...
(SNORING)

2261
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,925
"Am I living the
best life I could?"

2262
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,729
"Am I the best
version of myself

2263
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,370
"that I could
possibly be?"

2264
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,169
That's why I need
to stop and then say,

2265
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,891
"Am I gonna just follow the
river or am I gonna..."

2266
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,684
Wake up, Aaron!

2267
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,524
You're totally sleeping!
Mmm-mm.

2268
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,647
You said we were
gonna stay up

2269
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,449
until we figure it out,
like your parents.

2270
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,646
I'm listening.

2271
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,051
AMY: What did I just say?

2272
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,929
You said, "Wake up."

2273
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,250
Amar'e.
What's up, Doc'?

2274
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,970
How you feeling, buddy? Good.

2275
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,564
You ready to do this? Yeah.

2276
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,880
We're gonna do this.
It's gonna be great.

2277
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,961
AWGSOMG.

2278
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,280
You met Rachel?
Yes.

2279
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,964
We've been acquainted.

2280
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,809
Okay. What do we have here?

2281
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:18,167
This is just a little more
sedative to relax you.

2282
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,401
Hey, the good stuff.

2283
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,686
Yeah.

2284
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,091
Okay. Oh, whoa!

2285
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,920
All right, buddy.

2286
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,607
Okay. So, we're gonna be replacing
your cruciate ligament.

2287
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,081
And, um...

2288
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,530
Uh, do you want a coffee?
Hey, could we get a coffee?

2289
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,284
I can't. I'm not supposed
to drink before...

2290
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,441
Right. Don't
worry about it.

2291
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,807
Just one coffee,
for me. Um...

2292
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,606
Are you okay, Doc?

2293
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,365
Me? I'm great.
I'm great. Yeah.

2294
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,925
Me and Amy got into
a little bit of an argument,

2295
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,287
but I think
I'm doing okay.

2296
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,084
Yeah, this is gonna
go really well.

2297
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,128
She really lit
into me last night.

2298
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,807
Wow.
AARON: Like really...

2299
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,644
A side of her I've
never seen before.

2300
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,926
It got dark, fast.

2301
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,161
It really fucked me up.

2302
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,241
Are you sure
you're okay?

2303
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,526
AARON: I'm good' I'm good.

2304
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,601
We're gonna
get this going.

2305
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,330
AMAR'E: Okay. Perfect.

2306
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,207
(CLATTERING)

2307
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,251
I'm gonna mark the knee that we're
gonna do the surgery on, all right?

2308
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,401
Doc, this is the
wrong knee.

2309
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,209
I'm marking this as
not the knee to do.

2310
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,807
This is not the knee.

2311
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,370
Not this knee.

2312
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,721
Not this knee.

2313
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,926
Are you sure
you're okay, Doc?

2314
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,240
Amar'e, I'm great.

2315
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,688
This is gonna go great. This is the
bad boy we're gonna split open.

2316
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,250
You know what?
This is a bad idea.

2317
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,890
Amar'e, you're nervous.
Everyone gets nervous.

2318
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,041
I don't think
you get it, Doc.

2319
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,121
We need to
reschedule this.

2320
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,287
AARON: No, no, no.

2321
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,249
We're not doing that. I'm gonna
get you back out on the court.

2322
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,651
We gotta get you
back out on the court.

2323
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,846
I wanna see you
play. Okay?

2324
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,724
I'm here for you, okay?

2325
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,564
You're nervous,
I'm nervous.

2326
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,166
Amy was acting like
a psycho last night.

2327
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,810
I don't know what I did.

2328
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,249
I really,
really like her,

2329
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,128
but she's like
a fucking demon.

2330
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,321
She's like the
fucking Exorcist.

2331
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,961
I said, "You gotta let me go to sleep.
I have a surgery."

2332
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,201
And you know what she said?
She said,

2333
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,327
(MIMICKING DEMONIC VOICE)
"NO!"

2334
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,925
I'm taking a rain check.

01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,767
"Mommy"?

2515
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,171
Mommy, my 9Y3-

2516
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,368
He is 16 years old!

2517
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,965
Fuck!

2518
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,846
So,

2519
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,804
you had
quite a night.

0h, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

2524
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,643
I once fucked three-quarters

You're a very
strong writer.

I will go so far
as to say

2530
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,608
that you are my
most valuable writer.

2531
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,160
Thank you.

2532
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:49,528
I reread your latest draft of the Dr.
Conners piece,

2533
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,648
and I have to confess,
I spoke too soon.

2534
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,324
It is very good.

2535
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,165
Really?
It really is.

2536
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,605
Really?
Yeah, it's very good.

2537
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,524
Thank you. You won't
regretthis, Dianna.

2538
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,125
I know you said, don't...

2539
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,611
I won't regret what?

2540
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:03,966
I'm not gonna
publish it here.

2541
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,327
No, no, no.
Amy, you're fired.

2542

Amy, how could
you not get that'?

2543

You are so fired.

My love, I can't have
one of my employees

2545
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,366
having sex with
someone underage

2546
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,726
and beating them up.

2547

You know? One or the other,

2548

but not the combo.

See what I'm saying?

2550
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,570
Hey, Dianna,

You're
doing it now'?

2553
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,444
Sorry. Should we come back,
or did it already happen?

already happen'?

Amy fucked Donald.

2557

Amy... I didn't fuck Donald.
I tried...

up the winners you fucked?

while she was quarantined

for we don't even know what.

2567
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,043
I'm sorry about that.
That's so inappropriate.

2568
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,771
Anyway, nice news. I know
you're close with Nikki.

2569

Oh, that's great.

turn down the position

Tom Brady good?

than Brady good.

so why don't you just
gel some sleep, all right?

Chris Evert
hitting on Aaron hard.

2654
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,651
LEBRON: Chris,
don't hit on Aaron.

2655
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,326
LeBron, don't be
a cock-blocker.

2656
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,402
Evert is still
at it and, frankly,

2657
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,005
it's making me
uncomfortable.

2658
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,569
BRODERICK: You know what
I think the issue might be?

2659
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,842
You're probably focusing
on her problems

2660
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,160
instead of looking
in the mirror.

2661
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,481
Aaron is playing
the blame game.

2662
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,607
Thank you, Marv.

2663
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,886
BRODERICK: I bet you're
not the easiest person

2664
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,086
to have a relationship with.

2665
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,447
Broderick, cutting
deep with his insights.

2666
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,885
He is on fire.

2667
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,724
His best work
since WarGames.

2668
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,847
AARON: You guys
don't understand.

2669
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,207
I tried. She didn't
want to be a part of it.

2670
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,486
You can't just run
when you get scared.

2671
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,686
AARON: She pushed me away.

2672
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,206
Aaron is fearing
engulfment and intimacy.

2673
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,327
You know what?

2674
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,051
You're not helpful, you're not
helpful, you're not helpful.

2675
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:06,283
And you are really not helpful, Marv.
Really not helpful!

2676
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,362
Marv Albert apologizes.

2677
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,681

No, I'm really sorry.

I want you to know that I act

2692

like everything
you do in your life

2693
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,851
is so wrong and stupid.

2694
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:12,447
But it's just because I don't
think that I can have that.

2695
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,209
I'm not okay.

2696
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,686
I'm not okay, Kim.

I know what I am,

2698
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,725
I know who I am,

01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,685
Yeah.

2708
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,167
<i>Minecraft.</i>

2709
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:04,484
It's a game where you can
build a whole virtual world,

2710
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,210
and put whatever
you want in it,

2711
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:11,525
and make it big or
small or whatever.

2712
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,443
Let me see.
Yeah.

2713
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,648
AMY: If it's a video game,
why is it in a notebook?

2714
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:19,441
Oh, I draw it out
first to plan it,

2715
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,161
so I know what to build
and what to put in it

2716
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,242
instead of just
winging it.

2717
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,001
What's this?

2718
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,891
Oh, this is our house.

2719
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,851
Here's my bedroom,
here's the baby's room.

2720
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,684
What's that rectangle?

2721
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,082
It's the mattress for you and Aaron
to stay in once the baby's born.

2722
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,644
That's for me?

2723
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,530
You and Aaron. Yeah.

Thank you.

I don't think

2727
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,684
Aaron's gonna be
around much anymore.

2728
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,364
So...

2729
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,444
Oh. You don't
like him anymore.

2730
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,885
I like him more
than anybody.

2731
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:02,281
He's my best friend.

2732
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:03,964
Then we should
have him come over.

2733
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,682
Yeah. Yeah.

2734
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,811
We should.
