you're going, young man?

Hmm.

You better take this then,
hadn't you?

I gotta get going.

Really? Well,
I tell you what.

jump in the van

with the squad.

you for the trials, I'm afraid.

It's not all about speed.

It's about what school
you went to, is it?

Frankly, Eddie...

123

a career, is it? Skiing.

I mean, how much does a
downhill skier earn? Huh?

Hmm?

So, you're
the mystery elf

334
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,030
who's been hacking up
my slope, huh?

335
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,917
Just you? No pickaxe?

336
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,958
You do realize
the time to start jumping

337
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,109
is when you're
five or six?

Thanks.

339
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,956
The Norwegians
already told me that.

340
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,679
Did they also tell you you
look ridiculous in that gear?

341
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,277
At least I'm wearing a jacket.

342
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,628
This is my jacket, pal.

343
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,789
Maybe you should
wear one, too.

344
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,478
No. Drinking doesn't
agree with me.

345
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,073
Neither does ski-jumping.

346
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,435
Yeah, well, when I want advice
on how to drunkenly plow snow,

347
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,953
I'll look you up.

357
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,870
PETRA: Yeah.
The great American coach.

358
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,155
Peary was his star jumper.
He broke records.

359
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,118
He was really
a gifted flyer

360
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,232
with a very
special style. But...

361
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,190
...he was too crazy,
you know?

362
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,515
And now he's just crazy,
but in a different way.

363
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,631
Bronson Peary. How come
I've never heard of him?

364
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,398
They kicked him out.

365
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,112
What for?
(SIGHS)

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,710
Arrogance. Bad discipline.
Drunkenness. Fornication.

367
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,077
What you probably call
"being a total loser."

368
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,712
EDDIE: Definitely him.

369
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,076
Petra, do you mind
if I borrow this?

370
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,709
Yeah, take it.
Okay, thanks.

371

EDDIE: I thought we could
have a little chat about

372
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,955
me being an
Olympic ski-jumper.

373
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,160
You've more chance of being
a ballerina than a jumper.

374
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,359
(CHUCKLES) Good one.

375
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,271
I was just after
a few tips, really.

376
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,873
Give up,
there's one for free.

378

Petra told me
you used to jump for America.

379
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,988
Yeah, Petra has
a lot of stories, man.

380
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,589
She gave me
this book, actually,

381
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,830
by your old coach
Warren Sharp.

382

For as long as
I can remember,

384
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,990
it has been my ambition
to become an Olympian.

387
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,909
Britain doesn't have a ski-jumping
team so I was thinking...

388
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,912
Okay. Now I know
you're crazy.

389
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,513
Look, I know we didn't get
off to the best of starts...

390
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,158
...but you shouldn't be
fixing rust-buckets.

391

if I had your pedigree and experience...

394
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,156
Yeah, well you don't.
I'm busy.

I'm gonna get any better.

so if you could just
land one jump, you are...

644
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,231
BOTH: Going to the Olympics.

645
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,277
Exactly. Get better soon.

646
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,279
All right, coach.

647
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,998
I'm not your coach. Okay?

648
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,514
Seriously. A coach teaches
you how to jump properly.

649
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,079
I'm just teaching you
how to land

650
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,479
so I can get you
out of my hair

651
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,915
as soon as possible.
Got it?

652
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,918
EDDIE: Peary.
What?

653
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,228
Thanks.

654
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,351
Fine. Get better.

655
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,989
If you're really
gonna do this,

656
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,798
we should run through
a couple of things.

657
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,154
Are your knees better?
Mmm-hmm.

658
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,468
They better be.

659
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,677
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

660
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,759
Okay, before we start,

661
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,876
who's your favorite
female movie star?

662
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,752
Honestly?
Yeah.

663
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,189
Bo Derek.
Bo Derek? Okay, good call.

664
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,073
Okay, every jump
from here on in...

665
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,118
...I want you to approach it
as though you are making love

666
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,430
to the beautiful Bo Derek.

667
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,834
Okay?
Right.

668
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,279
Starting gate
is your foreplay.

669
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,796
The in-run is where you
build your rhythm. Okay?

670
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,279
And the take-off,

671
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,874
that's your special moment.
All right?

672
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,274
Same facial expressions.

673
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,237
Same straining
of the muscles.

674
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,596
The same peaceful
feeling of release, okay?

675
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,914
If you do it right.

676
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,520
Of course, with any
act of love-making

677
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,154
there's only one way to be
sure you've done it right.

678
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,309
Right?

679
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Yeah.

680
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,832
You fall asleep?

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,591
Am I going down there?
Yeah.

Brilliant.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eddie.

695

I think a little bit
of wee came out.

710
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,554
So, all you have to do is make
this landing and you qualify.

711
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,153
One jump away
from the Olympics, man.

712
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,037
Get your skis.

713
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,199
Okay. Stay focused.

Do everything I told
you to do only better.

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,549
Let's do this.

807
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,911
So, if this is you now...

808
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,391
...how much more
are they asking you to jump?

809
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,079
(SCOFFS)
Oh.

810
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,071
That's you up poo creek.

811
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,589
JANETTE: Terry.

812
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,917
If I'm gonna go
on the European circuit

813
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,991
I'm gonna need to raise
some serious cash.

814
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
Yeah, well, don't ask us,
we ain't got any.

815
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
I know.

816
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,679
What about the money
for the van?

817
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,591
Can't that wait
till next year?

818
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,034
TERRY: No.
I am not spending

819
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,759
any more money
on this rubbish.

820
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,793
It's a matter
of time before

821
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,560
he walks through that
door in a wheelchair.

822
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,870
So you've gotta stop taking
all these stupid risks, son,

823
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,916
and come back and do
a little bit of plastering.

824
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,350
You tried your best.
Fair play to you. Well done.

825
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,271
But it wasn't
good enough, was it?

826
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,749
So it's got to stop.
All this has gotta stop. End of.

827
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,199
Okay.

828
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,111
Come on, son, hurry up.
I don't wanna be late.

829
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,469
What are you doing?

830
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,874
He's coming
to work with me.

831
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,791
Is he?
Yeah, he is.

832
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,871
Oi, come on, son, up you get.

Oi.

What the hell
are you playing at?

836
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,392
I just need to borrow
it for a few weeks.

837
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,835
Get out of that van. Now.

838
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,234
I'll take really good
care of it, I promise.

839
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,595
Thank you. Love you.
TERRY: I'm warning you.

840

Oi. Come back here!
You thieving little git!

841
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,069
TERRY: Did you
know about this?

842
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,673
Mmm. Yeah.

843
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,200
And you're not gonna like what I
did with our savings, either.

844
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240

00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,715
The wanderer returns, huh?

850
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,195
Mum gave me some money and
I sorted out the transport.

851
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,874
Is that what you call it?
Come on, let's get a drink.

852
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,353
Hang on.

853
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,109
I don't wanna get
snow on the seat.

854
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,071
This window is a bugger.
(SQUEAKING)

855
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,711
I think it's a good thing they
turned you down, man. It is.

856
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,389
I mean, 61 meters
is a genuine distance.

857
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,755
Means you gotta
do this for real.

858
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,354
Well, it's easy for you to say,
you were a champion.

859
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,550
You were always
really good.

860
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,351
I was kicked off
every team I was ever on

861
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,120
before I even got
a chance to prove myself.

862
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,998
Believe it or not, I do know what
it's like to be written off, Eddie.

863
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,914
Of course,
my solution was

864
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,639
just to crawl inside
the bottle here, but...

865
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,953
I was in hospital for a
year when I was a kid.

866
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,632
Dodgy knees.

867
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,473
All the doctors said
I should give up sport.

868
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,112
Take up reading.

869
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,594
First book I got:

870
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,188

871

BOTH: <i>Moments of Glory.</i>

872
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,072
Yeah, I know it.

873
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,589
Well, anyway,
that is the book

874
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,558
that made me realize
I needed my own moment.

875
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,556
That one thing I could do
to prove them all wrong.

876
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,831
Do you think I'm mad?

877
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,149
Yeah.

878
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,675
(CHUCKLES)

879
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,797
You're completely
mad, man. But, hey...

880
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,354
...you kinda gotta be mad
to do this sport, right?

881
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
Yep.

882
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
So...

883
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,431
...if you want your moment,
Eddie Edwards,

884
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,317
I can get you your moment.

885
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,959
But it's gonna
hurt like hell.

886

some proper equipment.

Perfect.

891
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,715
Mm-hmm.

892
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,432
Oh, wow.

Peary, is this not theft?

894
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,878
It's the Lost and Found, man.

895
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,757
Come on. Some guy dropped
10 bucks on the street

896
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,353
and you were to pick it up,
would that be theft?

897
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,515
EDDIE: Yes.

898
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,039
What if he didn't know
it was missing?

899
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,190
Then I'd give it
to charity or something.

900
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,915
Eddie, you are a charity.
Your needs are much greater.

901
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,678
What about you?

902
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,549
Me? I'm just
stealing these.

903

Any better?
It's not better. It's crap.

to apologize. Okay?

on my knees

to let me jump again.

01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,516
<i>Don't live here,
I'm visiting</i>

1584
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,673
<i>To go where I've never been</i>

1585
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,399
<i>I'm reaching</i>

1586
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,155
<i>'Cause this isn't far enough</i>

1587
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,676
<i>There's more
in this heart than love</i>

1588
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,271
<i>Won 't stop
till I'm high above</i>

1589
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,750
<i>I'm cursed with anticipation</i>

1590
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,389
<i>I have no time
for conversation</i>

1591
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,036
<i>Look at me,
I'm free to do what I want</i>

1592
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,429
<i>What I want</i>

1593
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,956
<i>Come on, thrill me
Come on, kill me</i>

1594
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,350
<i>Feel the blood rush
Round the body</i>

1595
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,830
<i>Can 't hold it in
and I can't fight it</i>

1596
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,549
<i>Can 't turn away
and I can't hide it</i>

1597
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:56,076
<i>Come on, find me
Come on, blind me</i>

1598
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,630
<i>Look, the fear
is far behind me</i>

1599
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,076
<i>What was just a dream
now will be</i>

1600
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,709
<i>I'm calling to the world,
Come on, come on, thrill me</i>

1601
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,715
<i>Come on, thrill me</i>

1602
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,634
<i>I feel alive
when you're with me</i>

1603
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,429
<i>I feel the endless
possibilities</i>

1604
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,717
<i>You give me something
You give me something</i>

1605
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,634
<i>You give me everything</i>

1606
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:40,110
<i>And I will make it
all worth it</i>

1607
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,988
<i>Yeah, I will reach
the summit white as snow</i>

1608
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,152
<i>You make me wanna
You make me wanna</i>

1609
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,198
<i>You make me wanna be yours</i>

1610
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:53,909
<i>'Cause we were honestly</i>

1611
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,515
<i>We were nothing
more than each other</i>

1612
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,036
<i>But I needed you
Yeah, I needed you</i>

1613
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:05,511
<i>Like you needed me</i>

1614
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,716
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1615
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,634
<i>Traveling high
Learning to fly</i>

1616
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:16,951
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1617
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,874
<i>Out of the sky
For you</i>

1618
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,316
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1619
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,234
<i>Out of the sky
I'm on a ride</i>

1620
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,790
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1621
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:35,668
<i>Learning to fly
For you</i>

1622
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,038
<i>I can see the eagle landing</i>

1623
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,950
<i>It's all I wanna do now</i>

1624
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,870
<i>Didn 't think
I'd ever get so high</i>

1625
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,872
<i>Take me to that
hallowed ground</i>

1626
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,996
<i>High above
So safe and sound</i>

1627
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:22,077
<i>Do your best
to clip my wings</i>

1628
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:28,599
<i>You see, my skin
is thicker than you think</i>

1629
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,195
<i>So I lock away that madness</i>

1630
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,670
<i>Keep emotion in a tight fist</i>

1631
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:42,598
<i>Gonna hold my head up high
until I reach the summit</i>

1632
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,671
<i>Ascension</i>

1633
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,675
<i>Just sky holding me</i>

1634
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:02,550
<i>Oh to rise like an angel</i>

1635
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:06,235
<i>Just to kiss every star</i>

1636
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,432
<i>See the cloud's
silver lining</i>

1637
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,956
<i>Flying high and far</i>

1638
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,910
<i>Oh, ascension</i>

1639
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:25,559
<i>Ascension</i>
