1
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,310
The world of investing.

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,316
Can be a jungle.

3
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,446
Bulls, bears, danger at every turn.

4
00:00:54,487 --> 00:01:00,357
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont.
Pride ourself on being the best.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,225
Trained professionals.

6
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,288
To guide you through
the financial wilderness.

7
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,323
Stratton Oakmont..

8
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:13,465
Stability, integrity, pride.

9
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,438
1, 2, 3!

10
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,344
[ALL CHEERING]

11
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:29,477
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

12
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,356
come on! Let's go!

13
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:38,294
One, two, three!

14
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,357
My name is Jordan Belfort.

15
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,335
Not him, me.
That's right.

16
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,429
I'm a former member of the middle
class raised by two accountants

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,431
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

18
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,242
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,

19
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,407
I make 49 million dollars.

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:00,408
Which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

21
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,315
No, no, my Ferrari was white
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,328
Not red.

23
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,291
See that humongous estate down
there?

24
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,360
That's my house.

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,262
My wife, Naomi.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,505
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

27
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,447
Yeah, she was the one loop my
cock in the mouth in the Ferrari.

28
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,316
So put your dick back in your pants.

29
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,253
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,

30
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,482
I own a mansion, private jet,

31
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:44,294
six cars, three horses, two
vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.

32
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:54,498
I also gamble like a degenerate, I drink like a
fish, I fuck hookers maybe five-six times a week.

33
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,442
I have three different Federal
agencies looking to indict me.

34
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,308
- Yeah, baby..
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,439
And I love drugs.

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,411
Okay..

37
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,353
- Oh, yeah..
- One more.

38
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,346
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,418
Later that night..

40
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,336
Pull up! Pull up! We're gonna
crash! For christ sake!

41
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,203
Come on!

42
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,402
Just relax!

43
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:41,253
Oh.. Fuck..
Are you okay?

44
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,312
Yeah, I'm alright.

45
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,289
- Alright, good.
- Good job.

46
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,257
Good..

47
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
You got in there save, alright?

48
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,485
- Until next time, brother.
- Until next time.

49
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,297
Yup, on a daily basis I consume
enough drugs to sedate Manhattan.

50
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,242
Long Island, and Queens.

51
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,505
For a month.

52
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,444
Oke, Mr. Jordan.

53
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,415
I take Quaaludes, 10-15 times a day,
for my back pain.

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,249
I had the role to stay focus.

55
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,413
Xanax to take the eye pot ot mellow me out,

56
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,255
Cocaine to wake me back up again,
and morphine, well..

57
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,248
Because it's awesome.

58
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,487
Good morning, Lycon.

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,395
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

60
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,396
there's one that's my absolute favorite.

61
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:39,344
See? Enough of this
shit'll make you invincible.

62
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,438
Able to conquer the world.

63
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,314
And eviscerate you enemies.

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,353
And I'm not talking about this.

65
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,289
I'm talking about this.

66
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,453
The money doesn'tjust buy you a better life.

67
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,363
Better food, better car, better person.

68
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,424
It's also makes you a better person.

69
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,369
You can give generously to the
church or the political party

70
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,465
of your choice. You can save
the fucking spotted owl with money.

71
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,412
I always wanted to be rich.

72
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,505
So let me go back.

73
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:20,418
I'm 22 years old, newly married,
and already a money crisis little shit.

74
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,477
So what do I do?

75
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:27,357
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions..

76
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,431
You are lower than fucking pond scum.

77
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,470
You got problem with that?
Jordan?

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,505
- No, no problem at all.
- Good!

79
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,484
Because that's it what you are.
Pond scum.

80
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,249
You job is ''Connector'', which means

81
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,280
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day.

82
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,293
Trying to connect me with
wealthy business owners.

83
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,388
And until you pass your Series 7,
that's all you gonna be fucking doing.

84
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,298
Sit. Sit!

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,336
Just so you know, last year
I made over $ 300.000.

86
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,431
The other guy you'll be
working for, he made over a million.

87
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,377
A million dollars? I can only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

88
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,314
- Jordan Belfort? Mark Hanna.
- Yeah, sir.

89
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,307
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And you as well,

90
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,319
I see you already meet the village asshole.

91
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,411
Smile and dial.

92
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,321
And don't pick up your
fucking head until one.

93
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,382
Hey, fuck him.

94
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,451
I'm the senior broker here,
dia isjust a worthless piker.

95
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,360
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

96
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,423
I heard you really pitched a stock
in yourjob interview.

97
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,333
I had to do something to stand out, right, sir?

98
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,428
I fucking love that!

99
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,372
- Lunch, today.
- Ya, alright.

100
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:53,402
Oh, we don't start dinning at 9:30, because
our clients, they're already answering the phone.

101
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,313
3, 2, 1!

102
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,408
Let's fuck!

103
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,219
You want to know what money's sound like?

104
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,313
Go to the trading floor on wall street.

105
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,291
Fuck this shit that, cunt, cock, asshole.

106
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,261
I couldn't believe how this
guys talk to each other.

107
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,364
I was hooked within seconds.

108
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,433
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

109
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,333
Fuck face! Look where
you start at today, huh?

110
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,237
Motherfucker, you can't get anywhere,
and at 40..

111
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,298
- Pick up the cock sucking phone!
- Yes, sir.

112
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,276
- Yes, sir.
- Market has been raise well.

113
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,303
You are such a fucking dougchebag, Hanna.

114
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,338
We don't give to shit about
how technology work.

115
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,250
Because all we care about is
getting fucking rich!

116
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,277
- Solid!
- Jordan Belfort

117
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:37,517
I got it!

118
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,354
Time to play the tape!

119
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,327
Wow! a 20.000 Microsoft!

120
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,454
Go in the hole!

121
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:49,332
Come on! It's alive, it's alive.
I want you to hold on, that is hot.

122
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,304
Here! In, in! Shut that
motherfucker! Shut it! Shut it!

123
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,466
Salut!

124
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,391
Tootski?

125
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,403
Oh, no, no thank you, thou.

126
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,372
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

127
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,273
Well, Hactor heres the game plan.

128
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,336
You gonna bring us two absolut
martinis, you know how I like em.

129
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,316
Straight up, and then precisely seven and a half
minute after that you gonna bring us two more,

130
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:44,483
And then two more after that every 5
minutes until one of us passes the fuck out.

131
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,321
An excellent strategy, sir.

132
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,384
Oh, I'm good with water for now, thou.

133
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,485
Thank you.

134
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,360
It's her first day on
wall street.

135
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,364
Give him time..

136
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,460
Thank you. Thank you.

137
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:02,374
Mr. Hanna, you're able to drugs
during the day and still function?

138
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,399
And still do yourjob?

139
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,275
Well, how the fuck else would you
do these job?

140
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,507
Cocaine and hookers, my friends.

141
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,447
Right..

142
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:15,285
I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm, I mean..

143
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,417
- Your.. The clients you have were absolutly..
- Talked the clients.

144
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,361
Your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table.

145
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,496
You got a girlfriend?

146
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,263
I'm new married, I have a wife,
his name Theresa. She cut hair.

147
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,428
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,233
Think about Theresa.

149
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,366
Named a game, move the money from your
clients pocket.

150
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,273
into your pocket.

151
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:42,509
Right. But if you can make the clients
money, at the same time, isn't that
advantageous everyone, correct?

152
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,418
No, okay, number one rule of wall street.

153
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,447
Nobody.. Okay, if you Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet, nobody knows.

154
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,393
If a stock's going up, down
orsideways fucking in circle,

155
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,363
At least of all stock brokers, right?

156
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,456
It's all in ''Furgazy''.
you know what Furgazy is?

157
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,263
Yeah, ''Furgazy''..
It's a fake..

158
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,397
Yeah, Furgazy, it's
fegazy, it's a wuzzy, it's..

159
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,373
Fairy dust, it doesn't exist.

160
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,434
It's never landed, that is no matter,
it's not on the elemental charge.

161
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,537
It's not fucking real! Alright?

162
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,479
Alright.

163
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,449
Stay with me.

164
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,419
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

165
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
- No.
- So, if you got a client.

166
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,414
who brought a stock at 8,
and now it's at 16.

167
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,257
He is all fucking happy, he is
want to cash it, and liquidate.

168
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,488
Take his fucking money and run home.

169
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,359
You don't let them do that.

170
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,365
- Okay.
- Because that would make it real.

171
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
- Right.
- Now, what do you do?

172
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,359
You got another brainer idea.

173
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,462
The special idea.

174
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,408
Another situation, another stock,
to reinvested his earning in this stock.

175
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,470
And he will, every single time.
As they're fucking addicted.

176
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,505
And you just keep doing this,
again, and again, and again.

177
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,213
Meanwhile, he think,
he is getting shit rich.

178
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,515
Which he's is, on papper.

179
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,386
But you and me, the brokers?

180
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,391
We taking the whole hot cash.

181
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,292
The via commision, motherfucker!

182
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,262
Right!

183
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,431
That's incredible, sir.

184
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,330
I can't tell you how excited I am.

185
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,334
You should be.

186
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,395
There is two keys, to success,
in broker business.

187
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,464
First of all..

188
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,436
- You gotta stay relax..
- Yeah.

189
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:25,246
- You jerk off?
- Do I jerk off? Yeah.

190
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,309
Yeah, I jerk off, yeah.

191
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,286
How many time a week?

192
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,481
Like, 3-4 time, maybe..

193
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,290
Gotta pump those numbers out, those
are rookie numbers in this racket.

194
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,355
I, myself, I jerk off, at least twice a day.

195
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,263
- Wow!
- Once in the morning.

196
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,394
Right after I work out,
and then once right after the lunch.

197
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,368
Really?

198
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,464
Well, I want to,
that's not the way I do it.

199
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,408
I do it, because I fucking need to.

200
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,468
Think about you doing with numbers,
all day long.

201
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,380
Desk more point, high frequensy, bang-bang.

202
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:02,480
Fucking digits kick, kick, kick,
and all very asidick above the shoulders.

203
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,453
Right?

204
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,390
You can't go weeks the people out.

205
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,393
Right? You got to feed the gizz
to keep the blood flowing.

206
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,419
And keep the ryhtme below the belt.

207
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,430
Done.

208
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,365
This is not a tip, this is
a perscription. Trust me.

209
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,369
If you don't, you'll fall out the balance.

210
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,462
Glicth your differasion,
and the tip fuck over.

211
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,461
Or more shit.

212
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,462
I've seen this happen.

213
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,496
In blood.

214
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,305
- No, I don't want blooded, sir.
- No.

215
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,336
- No you don't. Ya.
- I in for a long run, you know?

216
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,506
- Implusion are ugly.
- Ya.

217
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,278
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on that anytime you can.

218
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,272
And when you get really good at it.

219
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,412
You'll be fucking stroking it,
and you'll be thinking about money.

220
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,415
Second key.

221
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,413
To success.

222
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,451
In this rackets, is this little
baby right here, it's called Cocaine.

223
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,394
Right.

224
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,421
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

225
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,230
You'll also got your finger dial faster.

226
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,361
And guess what.

227
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,370
That's good for me.

228
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,339
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,307
- Revolution, you follow?
- Revolution.

230
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,470
Keep the client on the fairys will.

231
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,346
And it goes, the park is open 24/7365.

232
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,409
Every decade, every goddamn century.

233
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,318
That's it.

234
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,345
Named the game.

235
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,347
How tickity?

236
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,293
Mmm... Thank you.

237
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,496
Come on.

238
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,240
With combine of dominator

239
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,217
Keep that for me.

240
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,518
# The CEO

241
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,492
# Had the money comes in

242
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,517
# The pray comes down.

243
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,462
# Going down to Broadway.

244
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,431
# It's a one way street.

245
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,490
# Which is a way I go.

246
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,466
For the next six months I got to know
in and out of Wall Street.

247
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,343
Earning shit money, as I
gear up, to take my series 7.

248
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:14,343
Ow! Oh God!
That was..

249
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,419
Then I was an licensed brooker at last.

250
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,455
Ready to make my fotune.

251
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:31,492
My first day as a future
master of the universe.

252
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,266
October 19, 1987.

253
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,245
I've X on 86 from six month ago.

254
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,306
Today is draining to 36 in the half.

255
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,375
Mr. Buns! Mr..

256
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,479
They called it, The black monday.

257
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:56,358
No shit, by 4 PM, the market
has dropped 508 poin.

258
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,354
The biggest plomits since the crash of 29.

259
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,229
I know you family,
you know mine!

260
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,202
No, I don't know, from fucking
country are you or shit.

261
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,328
Let them do what they want fucking do.

262
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,303
Our market are out.

263
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
Sir, this is not something you want to sale!

264
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,265
You know what happened?
A fucking Tsunami.

265
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,375
Yeah, I.. Yes, I will talk to your wife.

266
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,280
You not answering the phone,
alot of people gonna be calling you.

267
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,339
Trying to get your dirty laundy.

268
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,407
You don't know what's going on here.

269
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,408
I know, I know.

270
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:36,367
Holy fucking shit.

271
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,436
Unbelieveable..

272
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,303
My first shity day as a brooker.

273
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:48,440
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild, an institution
since 1899, closed it's doors.

274
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,441
Wall street did swallow me up,
and shit me right back out again.

275
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,514
We can pawn our engagement ring.

276
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,383
If we needed to.

277
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,483
- Baby..
- Beside that is mine..

278
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,427
- If we need to, I'm just saying.. Okay.
- You listen to me..

279
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,488
You're not pawning anything, okay?

280
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,294
- Okay.
- What I always tell you?

281
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,357
You going to be a millionaire.

282
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,394
That's right, okay? So let me look,
I'll find something.

283
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,269
- How about this?
- What?

284
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,365
''Nobody beats the wiz''

285
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,466
Electronic store, stock boy.
What'd you think?

286
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,273
You not gonna work at that place.

287
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,508
- Yeah, but you know, you start off..
- Jordan, you're gonna be miserable at that place.

288
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,445
If you go there.

289
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,473
It's sales, it work a way out,
I'd be a gentleman.

290
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,313
You're not gonna be stock boy.

291
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,479
- Why not?
- Because you are a Stock brooker.

292
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,354
Do you understand there is nobody
hiring stock brooker right now?

293
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,482
You understand that?

294
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,458
Okay?

295
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,262
Ah, this place is.

Jordan, what do you get
from that Blue Chip stock?

353
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,216
I make 1 percent.

354
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,415
Well, I didn't make 1 percent.

355
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,481
Pink sheets is 50.

356
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,223
It's 50 percent?

357
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,489
50 percent commission?

358
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,431
- Yeah.

359
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,458
It's our market price services.

360
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:37,237
So if I sells stock at $ 10.000,
my commission is $ 5.000?

361
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:42,475
If you sell $ 10.000 worth on this stock, I
will personaly give you a blow job for free.

362
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,441
And I hope it's happens.

363
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,253
Hallo, John, how are you doing today?

364
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,484
You mailed my company a post card
for a few week back.

365
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,459
requesting information on Peny stock
that had huge upside potential?

366
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,327
With very little down side risks.
Is that ringing a bell?

367
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,354
Oh, yeah, I interesting on that.

368
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,262
Okay, great.

369
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,392
Well, the reason for the call today, John, is..

370
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:08,362
Something just come across my desk,
John, it is a packs is the best thing
I've seen in all last 6 month.

371
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,376
If you have 60 seconds, I'll like to share
the idea with you, you got minute?

372
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
- Say it, I really interesting on that.
- Name of the company..

373
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,372
Aerotyne International, it is
a cutting edge high tech firm,

374
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,476
Out of the midwest.
Awaiting imminent path approvall

375
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,515
On a next generation of radar detectors that had
both huge military and survilliance application.

376
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:31,394
Now, right now, John, the stock trade
over the count of 10 cent a share.

377
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,488
And by the way, John.

378
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,297
Our analysis indicated it can go
way hack of lot higher than that.

379
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:42,365
Your profit, on a mare $ 6.000 investment,
would be up to $ 60.000.

380
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,308
- Jesus! That's my Mortage, man.
- Exactly.

381
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,469
You could pay off your mortage.

382
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,240
This stock would be safe, right?

383
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,374
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market.

384
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,509
Is that I never asked my
clients to judge me on my wins

385
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,488
I asked them to judge me on my loses,
becuase I have so few.

386
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,354
And in the case of Aerotyne.

387
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,293
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

388
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,422
We're looking at the grandslam homerun.

389
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,522
Okay, let's do it.

390
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,294
I'll do $ 4.000.

391
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,392
$ 4.000, that'll be $ 40.000 share, John.

392
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,394
Let me lock in that trade right now,
and get back to my secretary

393
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,463
with exact information,
sound good, John?

394
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,441
- Yeah, that's sound good.
- Great.

395
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,241
Hei, John, thank you for
your vote of confidence.

396
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,439
And welcome to the Investor Center.

397
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,347
- Yeah, thanks alot, man.
- Bye-bye.

398
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,321
How'd you fucking do that?

399
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,220
Just like that I made 2 grand.

400
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,456
The other guys looked at me like
I just discovered 5.

401
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,423
Great! Even better!

402
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,490
I'm selling garbage to garbageman.

403
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,501
And making cash hand over the fish.

404
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,494
the only problem you can have
is you can't buy more.

405
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,234
Boom shoot!

406
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,331
So I was salling them shit.

407
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,239
Way to go!

408
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,300
The way I looked at it.

409
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,402
Their money was better off from my pocket.

410
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,504
I knew how to spend it better.

411
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,311
Excuse me.

412
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,509

413
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,280

415
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,520

416
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,318

Don't tell fucking Susan,
It's not her business.

457
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,479
And there is another thing about him too,
like his phosphorescent white teeth

458
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,283
Wife? I gotta fucking deal with you wife?

459
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,314
and the fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lensesjust to look more Waspy.

460
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,488
Then with these rumors

461
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,225
I've heard some stupid shit,
I don't know..

462
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,459
Look, I don't want to bring it out.

463
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,331
This isjust stupid.

464
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,357
It's was with me?

465
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:02,499
You know, people say shit, I don't know,
I didn't listen to them talk.

466
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,407
What they say?

467
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,410

Every person you had on phone, they want to
get rich, and they want get rich quickly.

568
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,476

00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,354
Yeah, there is one time, that I
was selling a pot, on this Amish dude,

The smartest from a bunch,
was Nicky Kascov.

620
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,332
He actually went to law school.

621
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,326
I called him, Rugred, because
of his piece of shit hair piece.

622
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,239
Still give them to me,
young, hungry, and stupid.

623
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,472
And in no time, I'm make them rich.

624
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,475
Oh, my God.

625
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,348
- Jordan that..
- You like it, baby?

626
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,478
Ya, I mean, it's beautiful.

627
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,422
They're not the biggest stone in the world,
but I promised they're really high quality.

628
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,360
It beautiful.. I..
That so beautiful..

629
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,520
Yeah, why?

630
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,498
- What?
- I know that look..

631
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,501
- What is it? Go ahead..
- I don't know.. It's you know..

632
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,404
This stock that this company..
They're.. They're like crappy companies.

633
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,306
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

634
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,502
Yeah, they're terrible.

635
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,246
Don't worry about it, I've told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

636
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,410
Yeah, I know, but they're still not
gonna making more money, thou, right?

637
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,309
Well, sometime they do, sometimes they don't.

638
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,411
You know, how it goes.

639
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,355
Well, won't you feel better if you
sell this to rich people

640
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,484
who making fortune from their money?

641
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,362
Of course.

642
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,297
But rich people
didn't buy penny stocks.

643
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,527
They're just don't.

644
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,263
Why not?

645
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,362
Because they're too smart.

646
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,430
That's why not.

647
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,375
I mean, what person that collage education.

648
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,368
Will trust this bunch of jerkoff.

649
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,310
Tell him to call back!

650
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,372
- We have 5 fucking grand on, right now.
- Hey!

651
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,384
But what if they didn't sound like
a bunch of jerkoff?

652
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,252
What if I can teach them how
to sell to the people with money.

653
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,257
Real money.

654
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,350
So I decided to reinvented the company.

00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,455
With a new name.

670
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,366
A company, that our clients can believe in.

671
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,303
A company that our clients can trusted.

672
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,272
A firm whoes roots,

673
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,399
are so deeply in betting on wall street.

674
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,410
That our very founders..

675
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,344
Sale over of the mail flower.

676
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:05,373
And chizel the name Stratton Oakmont
right into a fucking rock!

677
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,281
You got it?

678
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,250
What are we gonna do are these.

679
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,347
First we pitch them Dysney, TNT, IBM.

680
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,381
Blue Chip Stock's exclusively.

681
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,451
Companies this people know.

682
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,394
Once we sucked them in.

683
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,489
We unload the dark shit.

684
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,296
The pink sheets. The penny stocks.

685
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,426
Where we make the money.

686
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,268
50 %% commission, baby.

687
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,274
Now the key to making money
in this situation like this.

688
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,243
Is the position of yourself
now before the settlement.

689
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,474
Because the time we read it
on the wall streetjournal.

690
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,346
It's already too late.

691
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,351
And you wait.

692
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,318
You wait.

693
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,252
And whoever speak first.

694
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,448
Loses.

695
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,519
Sorry, I.. I appriciate the call..

696
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,256
I really had to give this some thought.

697
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,230
And go talk to my wife about it.

698
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,288
Em, can I call you back?

699
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,492
They don't know, right?
They got to think about.

700
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,400
They are gonna talk to his fucking
wife, to the fucking tooth fairy.

701
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,268
The point is doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

702
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,467
The only real objection of what
they have is they don't trust you guys.

703
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,442
Why should they trust you,
I mean, looked at you.

704
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,377
You're bunch of slazy salesman, right?

00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,313
So, what do you say?

706

I'm complete agree with you,

00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,439
And I planned to being on of the top brookers
at my firm in the next year.

720

And I not gonna get there by being
below of standard.

721
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,511
I won't say that, you sound like..
You sound like sincerely guy.

722
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,387
Because I'm gonna make you rich,
and it's not gonna make you poor.

723
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,449
But what Stratton will do in it's serving

724
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,223
is bend the mark for future busines, Kevin.

725
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,353
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

726
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,389
And then you'll know, for sure, that you

And who can consitetly make you money.

Kevin, you give me one shot here
on the blue chips stock like Kodak.

735
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:30,484
And believe me, Kevin, the
only problem you're gonna have,

736
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:35,398
is that you didn't buy more, sounds fair enough?

737
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,303
Shit, well...

738
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:46,243
Ah... My wife might divorce me,
but yeah, let's do it. Oh, yeah.

739
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,474
Excellent choice, Kevin, how
much you wanna go for this time?

740
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,448
- Let's do $5.000 dollars or something...
- We'll try $8.000, Kevin.

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,460
I make you in the words of my grandfather,

00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:55,499
FYI boys, Danielle promised to use her $10.000
for breast implant, she already got C cups,

774
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,270
but now she wants fucking double D!

775
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,506
Is this a great fucking comedy or what?

776
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,307
This is the place to be the wild!

777
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,417
Done it! Blow the roof of this motherfucker!

778
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,290
Do it!

779
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,372
Word about us spread through out Wallstreet.

780
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,484
Even to places I didn't wanted to.

781
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,488
Wasn't long before Forbes Magazine, the flagship
of Wallstreet call to do a profile on me.

782
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,298
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future, for Stratton Oakmont?

783
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,304
We'll work...

784
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,339
- Diversification.
- Sounds good.

785
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,310
Thank you so much, I have more
than enough, I appreciate your time.

786
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,278
- Fantastic!
- Can we get a quick picture?

787
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,439
A total fucking hatchetjob.

788
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,349
This knitting little twad! Look at this!

789
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,344
''The Wolf of Wallstreet,'' they call me. Look!

790
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,221
- Your hair looks good. Yeah.
- My hair looks good.

791
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,350
Jordan Belfort...
(pushing dicey stock)

792
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,351
sounding like a kind of ''Twisted
Robin Hood,'' who takes from the rich...

793
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,355
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers. Read that, read it.

794
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:41,303
Listen, there is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweet heart.

795
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,533
- Big article, babe.
- Jordan, you look great.

796
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,265
You're in a huge magazine.

797
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,331
The fucking deal I will.

798
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,345
Mr. Belfort! Just give me a chance!

799
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,246
Mr. Belfort! Excuse me, excuse me, Sir!

800
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,274
[CROWD]

801
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,445
Shut the fuck up!

802
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,276
What's all this?

803
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,223
It's the Forbes article, they
all want to work for you now.

804
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,282
Hey! What did I say?

805
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,360
Hey! You want a job, you talk to me!

806
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:10,231
- Mr. Belfort!
- Forbes make me a superstar.

807
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:16,270
Everyday, dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door.

808
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,432
If we hired them, they drop
straight outta college overnight...

809
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,504
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton taylor.

810
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,277
Are you fucking serious right now?

811
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,445
I mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs,

812
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,456
And here comes thisjerk off snffing around.

813
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,290
But you know, everytime
someone rises up in this world,

814
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,490
there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.

815
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:45,458
Within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices.

816
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,471
It was a mad house.

817
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:59,541
A greed fest, with equal parts,
cocaine, testoterone and body fluids.

818
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,409
Yeah!

819
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:07,357
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7.

820
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,415
But I'm counting even that didn't enough.

821
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,491
Actually the madness started
on our very first day.

822
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,488
When one of our brokers Ben
Jenner, christens the elevator,

823
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,400
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

824
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:22,498
Her name was Pam and her credit,
she did have this amazing technique,

825
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,237
with this wild, twist and jerk motion.

826
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,269
By the month later, Donnie
and I decided to double team...

827
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,239
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses..

828
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,386
Eventually Ben marriage,
that which was pretty amazing,

829
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,221
considering she blew every
single guy in the office.

830
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,383
He ain't got the present and
killed himself 3 years later.

831
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,490
Anyway I hired my Dad, Max to
maintain order as The Enforcer.

832
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,432
Stratton very own Gestapo.

833
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,327
We called him ''Mad Max. '' because
of his hair trigger temper.

834
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:58,364
Which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone.

835
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:05,279
Who the fuck has the Goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night?

836
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,250
Goddamn it!

837
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,273
You're gonna missed it!

838
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,287
Oh, please, tell me something I don't know!

839
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,313
I wait all wek for The fucking Equalizer!

840
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,349
And I have to fucking... Hello?

841
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,292
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

842
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,454
Jean? How are you Jean?

843
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,463
He defect his weird British accent.

844
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:24,230
Why, yeah, Jean, that would be great. Cherio!

845
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,360
It was absolutely bizarre.

846
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,460
Fucking half wit!

847
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:30,269
- And hang up and then he's Mad Max all over again
- You missed it!

848
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,433
Damn!

849
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,240
What, tell me what happened, what happened?

850
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,269
Well, he discovered it was the Mother's sister.

851
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,245
Who's he? Who?

852
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,339
- Tell me who he is?
- The main guy.

853
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,247
- You know who the main guy,
- The main guy...

854
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,219
it was his Mother sister, she showed up dead.

855
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,456
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we were doing at Stratton.

856
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,450
Then there's a big target and we...
They get lunge at the target, they stick.

857
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,226
There's a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign,

858
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,357
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points.

859
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,232
I so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing.

860
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,292
Yeah, you have to hear yourself talk.

861
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,395
So, if he gets hurt, what happens?

862
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,461
Yeah, we're gonna a get fucking knock.

863
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,236
I don't think he's gonna get hurt, they're like...
They got like super human strenght.

864
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,333
I think he's gonna be fine.

865
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,311
You can't look him right in the eyes.

866
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,471
You can't look him at in the eye?

867
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,310
That's a fact, I saw it on PBS.

868
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,373
They get confuse, their they wires get cross.

869
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,319
You gotta look like, the chin Like it's looks like
I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at your chin.

870
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,221
I feel like you addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

871
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:23,249
They're like The Monalisa, they find eye
contact, like wherever you standing in the room,

872
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,385
the minute they lock in, you know.

873
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,420
No, but there is a limit to
what we could do with them.

874
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,263
I mean, we're allowed to throw shit at em'.
We allowed to throw food, bananas...

875
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,289
I know crack button.

876
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,270
But, for example, what I wouldn't do
is maybe like tell the police cock out.

877
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,273
and like to get some of the girls
to, you know... Fun or shit like that.

878
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,241
- That would be... That's unacceptable.
- I mean we can, let's keep that in our pocket.

879
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,369
But this guy is more about
thrown, thrown at the dartboard?

880
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,436
Correct, yes, yes.

881
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,212
The thing is this is their gift, okay?
They're built to be thrown like a long dart.

882
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,309
They're top heavy like a long
dart, so they're built for accuracy.

883
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,445
Oh, My God, this is...
Can we bowl with this guy?

884
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,512
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.
He brothers the bowling ball.

885
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,323
The brother you put a skateboard on,
strapped him onto a skateboard.

886
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,486
you toss him down on alley at some pins.

887
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,257
No shit, that's intersesting.

888
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,354
- Can we get that guy?
- We can get, we'll get that guy too.

889
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,366
But it says here, this guy will show his cock.

890
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,265
Yeah, instead of going up, yeah.

891
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,261
They are very armory, by the way, so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys.

892
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,273
Safety first, safety is first, alright?

893
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,401
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun, ready to knock this fucker out.

894
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,503
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace tasers gun.

895
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,309
A pellet gun manybe? Just like the...

896
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,282
No, pellet gun, is gonna hurt him,
I just want him out, knocked out cold

897
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,514
I say we stick with the loophole, right, okay?

898
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,517
We don't considered him a human,
we just considered it an act.

899
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,491
I think we're in the clear, like a flying,
you know a lot of those guys died.

900
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,514
but they never sued anybody.

901
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,285
The important thing, you
guys gotta keep in mind is...

902
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,288
is that these things gossip,
they get together and they gossip.

903
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,526
- It's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need is...

904
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,430
them getting together and then saying ''Oh,
listen, they made fun of us'' like...

905
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,372
- like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.
- That's why I love you.

906
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,374
You think of shit like that.

907
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,398
That is a come in?

908
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,467
We treat itjust like one of us, okay?

909
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:51,242
One of us, we're gonna treat them like one of us!

910
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:54,375
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

911
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,386
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

912
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,410
Jordan!

913
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,287
Your Dad's coming, something
about The American Express bill?

914
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,383
- Hey, can you get him outta here? I'm not...
- Yeah, lick my toe.

915
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,326
No, I'm serious, get...

916
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,521
Fuck! Okay, guys, act like we're working on stuff.

917
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,399
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

918
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,491
Make some shit off.

919
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,468
I think we're short at visor...

920
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:17,473
$430.000 dollars in one month, Jordy, huh?

921
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:23,276
Four hundred and fucking thirty thousand
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

922
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,281
Good morning, they're businness expenses, relax!

923
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,477
Business expenses? Jordy, look what you got here!

924
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,416
- What?
- Look at this,

925
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,320
$26.000 dollars for one fucking dinner!

926
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,290
Okay, no, no, no this could be explained.

927
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,452
Dad, we had client, we have the Visa client.

928
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,358
Right, the porter house from Argentina.

929
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,420
The expensive champagne and
wine, we have to buy champagne...

930
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,262
And you go it all the fucking sides.
Tel him about the sides order.

931
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,358
- I ordered the sides, so...
- Sides?

932
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,235
Sides? $26.000 dollars, worth the sides?

933
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,329
What are this sides? That cures cancer?

934
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,242
This sides did cure cancer, that's the
problem, that's why they were expensive.

935
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,438
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm serious...

936
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,377
- I know...
- Stop!

937
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:00,440
EJ Entertainment, what the
fuck is EJ Entertainment?

938
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,283
Well, that's a...

939
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,254
- Jordan what's EJ entertainment?
- How I describe this...

940
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,252
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

941
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,453
- That's what it is!
- That's... That is what it is.

942
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,394
That's the perfect decription for it!

943
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,296
It is what it is, but none
of this were charge to me,

944
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,492
This is all of them.

945
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,465
Oh, that was all of us.

946
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,368
It wasn't me though, fucking
explain the shit to him!

947
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,429
These all of your fucking charges right here!

948
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,441
You guys, The IRS, they
allow for T&A, it's fine.

949
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,501
- T&A, T&A?
- Yeah, I said T&E.

950
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,445
- No, no you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

951
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,244
- Yeah you did, you say T&A!
- When did I say that?

952
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,250
It's T&E, alright?

953
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:38,381
I know you're upset about the dinner and that
make sense because we did spend too much money.

954
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,389
But I said T&E...

955
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,391
Don't tell me what you
said, I heard what you said.

956
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,357
- I...
- Dad, he said T&A.

957
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,417
- Yeah, he said T&A.
- Yeah, absolutely no question. I heard it.

958
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,359
Jordan, I'm trying too...

959
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,386
- I'm fucking sweating.
- I'm getting this close.

960
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,226
- Dad, relax!
- I'm getting this close!

961
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,426
That's what I'm saying, why you open up more, Max?

962
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,399
He's gonna fucking kill you.

963
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:55,269
Why do you hold it in? Max, why do you hold it in?

964
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,263
That's it, that's it! Get the fuck out!

965
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,365
- No, no, no, no!
- Hold on!

966
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,399
Get out asshole!

967
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,412
- What kind of hooker takes credit card?
- A rich one!

968
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,210
At Stratton, there were 3 kinds of hookers,

969
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,341
the blue chips, top of the line, model material.

970
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:12,254
They cost between $300-$500 and you had to
wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip.

971
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,483
Which of course I always did.

972
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,357
Then came the Nasdaq, who are pretty not great.

973
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,488
They cost between $200 and $300 bucks.

974
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,327
Finally there were the pink sheets skanks.

975
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,266
They cost about $100 or less.

976
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,361
And if you didn't wear a condom, you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day...

977
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,269
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

978
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,264
Not that we didn't fuck them too.

979
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,401
Believe me, we did.

980
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,276
Aw! I slip this thing again.

981
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,406
I know what it is, you know too much...

982
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,449
with EJ Entertainment.

983
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,248
- Pops...
- How are things at home?

984
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,314
Well, not the best, she just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

985
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:52,488
It's like this smell, a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while itjust kinda fades away.

986
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,363
- Yeah, well it supposed to fade away.
- Supposed to?

987
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,230
- That's marriage, you know...
- That so...

988
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
- Your Mother and I we've been
married a long long time. - I know

989
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,438
What do you think? We, we, we...
jumpin' into bed every 2 minutes?

990
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,465
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death, I want to stay married, but

991
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,402
It's crazy out there, some of these
girls. You should see them, oh my God.

992
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:16,442
They're fucking... The things they doing
now, Pops, I mean it's on a whole new level.

993
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,351
- Really?
- And they're all shaved too.

994
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,355
Get outta here!

995
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,220
- All shaved and nice.
- Are you kidding me?

996
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,227
- Yeah, bald as a China doll.
- No bush? No bush?

997
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,489
- No bush, I know...
- Oh, My God.

998
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,394
All of the sudden like, one week...

999
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,332
- Nobody had anything down there anymore.
- It's a new world.

1000
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,336
- They bald from the eyebrows down.
- Wow.

1001
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,362
- Nothing, not a stitches, like lasers.
- Wow. New world.

1002
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:40,309
I was born too... Too early.

1003
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,368
I've never been a fan of the bush to be honest.

1004
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,504
- Really?
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,276
I don't mind it.

1006
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,443
Dad, I don't want you
stressin' out about any of this.

1007
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,387
How can I not get stressed out? Look at
the knuckle heads you got working for you.

1008
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,323
I know they're knuckle head, but I need
them to want to live like me, you get it?

1009
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,224
To live like me.

1010
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:02,288
Jordy, one of these days, the
chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1011
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,495
You looking at me like I'm crazy.

1012
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:09,232
Crazy? This is obscene.

1013
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:15,370
It was obscene, in the normal world.
I mean who the fuck wanted to live there?

1014
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,313
The party are fucking cast off!

1015
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:36,322
We got planes up here, that's gonna take
this company into the fucking stratosphere!

1016
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,337
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

1017
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,241
Fuck Lynch, fuck them!

1018
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,335
Why should they be taking all of our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1019
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,436
That's why we became underrun.

1020
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:54,507
It was our next big move, finding
companies to take public, IPO's.

1021
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,478
It was the only way this Wallstreet pricks...

1022
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,456
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kick a bucket shot.

1023
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,254
We got an unclip international.

1024
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:07,355
See we're a little different, we like to get as
fucked up as possible during our businness powers.

1025
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,491
in order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.

1026
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,264
Which is why we're popping
this ludes like they were M&M's.

1027
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,496
You mad...

1028
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,500
We own the fucking company...
We own the company...

1029
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,534
Don't know what a ludes is?
I'll tell you.

1030
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,236
Wait, wait, wait...

1031
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:29,378
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie, right now.

1032
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:06,354
The Quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to,

1033
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:11,520
was first synthetize in 1951 by an
Indian doctor, that's not feathers.

1034
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:17,364
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders.

1035
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:23,462
But pretty soon, someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 15 minutes...

1036
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,442
you got a prety kick ass high from it.

1037
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,378
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course.

1038
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:35,373
And in 1982 The U.S Government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world.

1039
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,347
Which meant there's only a
finite amount of this things left.

1040
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:45,520
No shit, you can't even buy them
anymore, you people all shit out of luck.

1041
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,493
- Steve Madden...
- Steve Madden.

1042
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,428
- Steve...
- Steve.

1043
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,232
You remember those ads?

1044
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,331
Those giant headed girls with the bug eyes,
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1045
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,311
- My friend from school, Steve Madden.
- His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1046
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,246
Steve Madden was the name
in women shoes at the moment...

1047
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,376
and all of Wallstreet was begging
to take his company public.

1048
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,283
Go ahead, what is it?

1049
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,379
- Except, guess who grew up with them?
- Women shoes!

1050
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,480
Women shoes.

1051
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,288
My very own Vice President.

1052
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,258
Women shoes.

1053
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,354
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1054
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:23,230
- Madden... Steve...
- Steve.

1055
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,333
Jordy, Jordy, Jordy, Jordy... You
better come check this fucking chic' out.

1056
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,394
Look at this, look there.

1057
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,245
- That was hot.
- That girl, if she was my sister,

1058
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,373
I would let that girl give me fucking 8.

1059
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,475
Can the wolf handle it?

1060
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,216
She's hot!

1061
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,256
Christy...

1062
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,292
Jordan, this is my friend, Naomi.

1063
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,356
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1064
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,525
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1065
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,226
Nice to meet you, you got an awesome place here.

1066
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,397
I don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1067
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,406
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1068
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,305
There's a beautiful beach out there,

How many times you gonna ask
her, if she's never on a jetski?

1076
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,316
I don't know, I might ask

1077
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,417
Okay...

Just tell her I'll be there in couple of minutes.

1081
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,362
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1082
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,202
How am I gonna do that? While
I'm having a conversation...

1083
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,434
You know what? I think we should get going.

1084
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,272
Wait, wait, where you guys going?

1085
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,402

00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,469
- No, no, yeah stay for a drink.

1087
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,313
No, no, we got to other parties
we supposed to get to, so...

1088
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,314
Why don't you let her stay for a while?

1089
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,410
- Let her stay for a while, what's the big deal?
- Perfect...

1090
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,478
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1091
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,252
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1092
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,400
You gonna have to excuse my friend, he gets...

1093
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,405
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Jordan, you gotta fuck her, she so hot!

1094
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:16,403
Fuck you Donnie, let him finish
it Hildy, that's fucking rude.

1095
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,510
So, Bay Ridge. That's near Staten Island, right?

1096
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,347
Brooklyn across The Verrazano bridge.

1097
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,448
- Southern island territory.
- That's right.

1098
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,360
You mean gulge, go to Verrazano
bridge and see the plank.

1099
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:35,330
Right, so I presumed you're Italian?

1100
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:41,271
On my Dad side, I'm also Dutch,
German, English, I'm a mutt.

1101
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,274
- You're a mutt?
- Yeah, I still have family over there, in London.

1102
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,403
My Aunt Emma, she's the
best, very British you know?

1103
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:52,347
- She's a classy lady.
- That explains it then.

1104
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,349
Explains what?

1105
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,310
Explains you, I mean you're Duchess, right?
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1106
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,519
Excuse me, can I get a straw, please?

1107
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,490
Thank you.

1108
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,270
So, I was a little surprise
you ask Christy for my number.

1109
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,373
Why is that?

1110
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,404
Aren't you married?

1111
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:27,511
Well, yeah, but what? Married
people can't have friends?

1112
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:32,285
We're gonna be friends?

1113
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,517
Yeah. You don't wanna be my friend?

1114
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,331
We're not gonna be friends.

1115
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,467
And then I worked on my designs.

1116
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:58,379
I have an entire an entire line of
lingerie, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1117
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:03,443
She designs woman panties too? Oh, My God!

1118
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,423
Come on Jordan, think of a
way to get up to her apartment.

1119
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,407
You want to come up for some tea or something?

1120
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,343
Tea? Yeah, like hot tea?

1121
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,346
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, sounds nice, yeah.

1122
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,213
Tea, fuck yeah I wanna come up for tea.

1123
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,480
Like rosehips or something like that.

1124
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,350
This is Rocky.

1125
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,388
- Who is this? say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1126
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:46,488
- Okay. - Why don't you light a fire or
something, I'll be right out.

1127
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,293
- Yeah, fire, yeah.
- Sure.

1128
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,495
I like your painting, it's uh...

1129
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,243
God, help me how do I fuck this girl?

1130
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,410
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah I just try to light the fire in here.

1131
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,353
That's it, that's it! You leave and
don't get involved, go home to your wife.

1132
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:34,376
As you can probably guess, I
fuck her Goddamn brains out!

1133
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,242
Oh, Jesus Lord!

1134
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,307
For 11 seconds.

1135
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,295
- Did you just cum?
- Oh, yeah I just came.

1136
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,392
- Did you? Did you cum?
- No.

1137
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,366
No?

1138
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,396
Okay, I'm still hard, just give me a second.

1139
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,270
- Sure.
- Yeah...

1140
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,243

1141
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,404
Hold me, oh yeah... Oh yeah...

1142
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,348
- Oh, God!
- Fuck off, Rocky!

1143
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,382
- Do you have biscuits or something like that?
- It's okay.

1144
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,359
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1145
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,420
Gom play Rocky, go, go...

1146
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,291
- You're crazy.
- I couldn't get enough.

1147
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,236
I mean her pussy was like heroin to me.

1148
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,501
And it wasn'tjust about the sex
either, Naomi and I got along.

1149
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,476
I mean we... We had similiar interest in shits.

1150
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,477

00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,295

1154
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,372

01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,362

1162
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:46,273
- Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1163
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,470
I thought you're at the fucking beach!
i didn't know you were here.

1164
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,413
That's who you fucking been?
With that fucking whore from the party?

1165
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,437
What are you doing here? I
thought you were at the beach!

1166
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,417
How could you do this to me?

1167
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,477
- Sweetie, come on!
- I don't know who the fuck are you Jordan.

1168
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,289
You're like a completely different fucking person.

1169
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,316
I made a mistake, I don't know
what to tell you, babe, I...

1170
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,486
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1171
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,430
Is that what you want?

1172
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,339
Do you love her?

1173
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,512
Answer me.

1174
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,399
I felt horrible.

1175
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:56,342
3 days later I filed for a divorce
and move Naomi into the apartment.

1176
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,512
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.

1177
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,250
She brought in an decorator,
feng shui the whole place,

1178
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,315
she even hired a gay butler.

1179
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:14,262
This guy was smart, sophisticated,
professional, I mean really, really great.

1180
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:18,495
- Jasmine? - Yes, Sir, I try to stump
you this evening, really good.

1181
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,264
Very good, great nose.

1182
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,396
Except for that one time.

1183
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,470
Oh, My God!

1184
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,247
Oh, hey...

1185
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,307
Is it wednesday already?

1186
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:39,287
What the fuck? That is fuck up!

1187
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,314
He must thought we still at The
Hamptons this weekend, you know?

1188
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,383
- Where are they doing it, sweet heart?
In the bed room? - They were everywhere!

1189
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,453
There were 2 guys over there on
the table, there are more over here.

1190
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,330
- There were 4 right here.
- Oh, God! Are you fucking serious?

1191
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,392
Right there? Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1192
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
Baby, that worst.

1193
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,373
After they're left they checked the apartment.

1194
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,433
Right, what? What is it, baby? What?

1195
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,241
- Where's my money?
- I don't know where your money...

1196
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,339
zWhere's my fucking money, where is it?

1197
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,284
I don't know where your money is
Mr. Belfort, I didn't do anything.

1198
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,513
- You don't know where my money is? - He's
lying Jordan, he's lying to his fucking teeth.

1199
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,285
Let's start from the beginning!
Let's start from the beginning, right?

1200
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,291
- You invited some friends over, right?
- Yes.

1201
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,259
One thing led to another, things got outta hand,

1202
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:23,221
We understand that, we do blow all the time, we
fucking degenerates us, so look at us, right?

1203
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,462
My money were stolen from my
apartment, right from my socks drawer, alright?

1204
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,460
Like I say, I don't know where your money is.

1205
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,369
Just start from the beginning, who came over?

1206
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,498
It's a normal day, I knew
you coming home the next day,

1207
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,476
so everything will be fine, it will be cleaned up.

1208
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,407
I got a little high at breakfast, I
got a little happy and made some eggs.

1209
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,507
had a little bit ice cream, and then I
say, who do I know who likes ice cream.

1210
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,281
- My friend Rudy, so I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1211
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,378
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1212
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,253
You know who Rudy is, come on.

1213
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,261
- He know who Rudy is?
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1214
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,286
- I don't know anyone named Rudy.
- You know, last month, The Lollipop club.

1215
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,319
You know who Rudy was.

1216
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,357
You know Rudy?

1217
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,393
I don't know about, fucking know anyone...
What do you mean?

1218
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,373
- So he went to The Lollipop club?
- Oh, he was at The Lollipop club for sure.

1219
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,307
On the stage aquintance with everybody.

1220
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,470
I got fucked up, I like the dance, I don't
know... Maybe I met them, maybe i didn't.

1221
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,479
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1222
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,440
- $20.000 dollars was stolen from my fucking
sock drawer! - What are you saying?

1223
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,348
All my girlfriends know that!

1224
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,410
I don't know who Rudy is, what the fuck!

1225
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:22,323
You little faggot friend, Rudy,
take my shit, did he? Answer me!

1226
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,418
Okay, now I get it, now I get why I'm...
This is a gay thing.

1227
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,293
- Oh!
- I see all of you.

1228
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,425
This is because you're a fag?

1229
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:34,266
My cousin is a fucking faggot and I go on
vacation with him and his boyfriend! I love faggot

1230
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,270
You're like being charged, right?

1231
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,464
I will not be stolen from, you get that?

1232
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,497
I fucking like gay people, I don't like you!

1233
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,472
You should hire a fucking Mexican
like I hired in my fucking house.

1234
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,313
Shit!

I'm gonna drop you, you fucking!
Where is it?

1238
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,349
Chester and Toby, they
went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1239
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,484
You know, they got crazy.

1240
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,316
I really appreciate your help.

1241
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,229
I had to call the copsjust to
keep them from killing the poor guy.

1242
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,459
I gave them each $2.000 bucks and
told them what Nicholas have done.

1243
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,462
They naked his ass.

1244
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,374
It's not like I care about the $50.000 anyway.

1245
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,344
I was making that much almost everyday
through one rat hole or another.

1246
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,414
A rat hole, is a friend, like Brad here.

1247
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,282
Who held stock in his name for me.

1248
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,343
How are you doing? Goodbye...

1249
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:29,313
I drive the price up, then he'd sells
and kick most of the profit back to...

1250
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,259
you guessed it, me!

1251
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,363
All cash, none of it's on the books.

1252
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,401
A big no no of course in the eyes of the law.

1253
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,236
Enter our new security attorney, Manny Riskin.

1254
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:47,299
$700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1255
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,471
You pissed up the SEC's leg, you
end up with your tits in the ringer.

1256
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,379
Do not worry about it, I
have The SEC under control.

1257
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,409
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1258
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,319
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

1259
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,254
We got The SEC in here!

1260
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,326
The Security of Exchange Comission
sent 2 lawyers down to review our files.

1261
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,352
So I set them up in our conference room.

1262
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:12,424
And I had it bugged and the air conditioning
turn up so high that it felt like antartica there.

1263
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,403
- Is it always this cold in here?
- I don't know.

1264
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,464
Then, while they were looking
for a smoking gun in that room,

1265
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:25,469
I was gonna fire off a bazooka
here, offering up our latest IPO.

1266
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,483
An IPO is an initial public offering,

1267
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:32,351
It's a first time a stock is offered
for sales to the general population.

1268
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,516
Now as the firm taking the company
public, we set the initial sales price...

1269
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,226
then sold those shares right back to our friends.

1270
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,424
Yet... Look, You're not gonna
following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1271
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,499
That's okay, that doesn't matter.

1272
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,368
The real question is this, was all this legal?

1273
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,463
Absolutely fucking not.

1274
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,373
We will making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1275
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,508
And what do you do when you making
more money than you knew what to do with?

1276
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,285
Oh, My God.

1277
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,349
Will you marry me?

1278
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,417
Oh, My God.

1279
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,451
Is that a yes?

1280
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,390
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1281
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,425
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1282
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:33,414
I held my bchelor party
at The Mirage in Las Vegas.

1283
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,249
They flight there alone was a buck and all.

1284
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:40,245
One last blow out fior the God
before I settle down for good.

1285
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:45,249
A hundred staff, 50 hookers plus
50 more waiting once we landed.

1286
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:50,331
All in drugs, I mean I tell you, up
plane was like a pharmacy with wings.

1287
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:24,261
All told, that we came
across nearly 2 million bucks.

1288
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,494
Including the cost of
refurbishing the entire 28 floor.

1289
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,430
Kiss the bride.

1290
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:36,501
Ah, but the wedding was
something out of a fairy tale.

1291
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,379
With Naomi, my Duchess.

1292
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:44,284
Meet her handsome Duke in the Bahamas ocean club.

1293
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:59,458
Of course after the bachelor party, me,
The Duke needed a few pennicilin shots,

1294
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:03,495
so we could safely consumate the marriage.

1295
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,301
I'm Barry Klineman, filming the wedding.

1296
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,472
A few words, huh? For your son.

1297
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:17,453
Jordan, remember what I told you, it
involves your penis and her vagina...

1298
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,422
and you know what to do, Jordy.

1299

Oh, My God! Aunt Emma?

1300

- Aunt Emma, hey, how are you doing?
- Jordan, how are you?

- Just one more step.
- Where are we going?

1311

Keep your eyes closed, 1, 2, 3!

1312
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:37,363
- What is this?
- It's your wedding present.

- What?
- It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

A pricy pleasure boat offer the most fun of love.

1319

It's no coincidence that it's 150 feet
of green hull is the color of passion.

1320
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,407

01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:17,315
You're father now, and yet you still acting
like an infant!

1366
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:22,260
God damn it! Baby, you know, you got really
anger issues!

1367
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,357
- You got so many emotional problem..
- Who was the one who threw in here..

1368
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,369
At three in the morning on that stupid helicopter?

1369
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,268
And woke up Skylar.

1370
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,434
- That was you.
- Skylar, that fucking bullshit!

1371
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:49,448
Does it matter to you, that I just hit that
driving range, sided with bermuda grass..

1372
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,358
- Oh, My God, bermuda Grass.
- You fucking ridiculous!

1373
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:56,491
No, you didn't research the whole thing, and
you with the fucking gold course!

1374
01:13:56,532 --> 01:14:00,366
Oh my God, you had the deal with the golf
course people too!

1375
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,304
What a great tragedy, honey, oh My God.

1376
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:07,366
You probably had to pay them in cash,
with you hand, what a fucking burns!

1377
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:11,505
And actually do some work besides swiping
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1378
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,345
'Cause I can't keep tracking you profession,
honey!

1379
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,340
'Cause last month you're one connoisseur..

1380
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,445
And now you aspiring landscape architect,
let me get that right?

1381
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:23,356
- Fuck you!
- No, no fucking dare throw that fucking
water at me!

1382
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,360
Don't you fucking dare!

1383
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,428
All right, honey?

1384
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,398
And we can just, we can talk this on, all right?

1385
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,264
Just use our words, you know..

1386
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,427
Communicating, okay?

1387
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:39,466
Come one sweetheart, talk to me.

1388
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:43,377
Stop flexing your muscle Jordan, you look
like a fucking imbecile.

1389
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,243
Babe, come on, you should feel..

1390
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:50,479
...should feel happy you gotta husband
who's in such a great shape like this, huh?

1391
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:55,517
Come here, come on give me a kiss, you look
so beautiful right now, come on.

1392
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,247
- Kiss you?
- You look so beautiful..

1393
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,352
- Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one..

1394
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,455
Fuck you!

1395
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,363
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1396
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:08,427
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi about
whatever is I did the night before,

1397
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,463
Next was a steam so I could sweat out the
drugs that still in my system..

1398
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,374
Then I assess the damage.

1399
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,312
Drowned out my eyeball, take my back pill
to get the day started,

1400
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,373
Then seek to make up with Naomi.

1401
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,476
Good morning daddy.

1402
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,352
Where's my kiss?

1403
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,450
Hey, sweetheart..

1404
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,452
Could daddy get a kiss from
both of you little girls?

1405
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:42,369
Oh no, no, daddy doesn't even get to touch
mommy, for a very very very long time

1406
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,432
Daddy is really sorry about what he said
in the other room, he didn't mean any of it.

1407
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:49,375
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1408
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:58,285
And from now on, it's gonna be nothing but short,
short skirt around the house.

1409
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,321
And you know something else, daddy..

1410
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:10,298
Mommy isjust so sick
and tired wearing panties

1411
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1412
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:26,269
In fact, she is decided to throw them
all away.

1413
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,478
So take a good look daddy,

1414
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,486
You gonna be seeing all of this
around the house.

1415
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,417
Yeah, mommy.

1416
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,354
But no touching.

1417
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,466
- What's wrong daddy?
- oh, baby..

1418
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,468
God..

1419
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,403
Look at this shit.

1420
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,346
Okay, mommy likes to play game with daddy.

1421
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,216
Mommy..

1422
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:10,350
Have you ever notice anything odd about
Mr. Fuzzybear over there?

1423
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,260
His eyes seems to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1424
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:19,424
Yeah, there's something little bit different
about his eyes.

1425
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,362
Yes, I think it's true,
say hi mommy!

1426
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,237
Say Hi to Rocco and Rocco,
say hi.

1427
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,241
Are you fellas see that, huh?

1428
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:31,336
Of all the fucking days, she chooses today
to give me blue balls.

1429
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,246
I mean today was the biggest day
in Stratton history..

1430
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,342
And I needed to be thinking straight.

1431
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,409
Jordan, welcome!

1432
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,452
Steve here yet?

1433
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:43,254
This was the day that we launch the Steve
Madden IPO.

1434
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,249
Should be around here,
everyone are rallied, excited..

1435
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:48,285
Everything had to run tight, and had
to be perfect.

1436
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,389
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1437
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,296
What is he doing?

1438
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:57,268
The biggest IPO in the firm's history,
what the fuck is he doing?

1439
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,337
Is he.. is he wearing a bowtie?

1440
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,436
Hi, How are you doing?

1441
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,343
Good.

1442
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,382
Are you cleaning the fish bowl?

1443
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:15,223
- I just, I had a minute and I..
- You gotta minute, and today you need to clean
the wish bowl? today?

1444
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,487
I have finished my paperwork, and I was
thought that I just have couple minutes.

1445
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,360
Okay, nice to meet you.

1446
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,231
On the issue day!

1447
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,340
You cocksucker! Why the fuck in the issue day?!

1448
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,239
This is what you do?!

1449
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,471
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1450
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,407
This is what happen when you fuck with
your pet on the Issue day!

1451
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:57,391
Take your little bowtie, get your
shit, and get the fuck outta my office.
You understand?

1452
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,390
Get the fuck out!

1453
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:07,465
Everybody on port! We are here
to make money, everybody on port

1454
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,380
The real wolf pit, which
is exactly how I liked it

1455
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,315
Jordan, When I came to lobby I caught a genius.

1456
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,318
Enter, Steve Madden.

1457
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,455
Red hot ladies footwear impressario.

1458
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,289
And thanks to Donnie, we were taking
this company public

1459
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,251
Stratton Oakmont was crawling at the
primordial Oz.

1460
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,524
Pawn Scam no more.

1461
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,396
That's why they gotta see your face.

1462
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:34,300
Get them fired up so they push the
shit outta this stack, okay?

1463
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:39,364
Not only that, Donnie and I secretly own
85%% Steve Madden's shoes.

1464
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,432
Which illegally speaking was a big no, no.

1465
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,311
But we get filthy fucking rich
of our troops got behind it.

1466
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,473
Ourjob was to get them worked up.

1467
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,512
But not too worked up.

1468
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:57,247
Hello, for those who don't know me, I uhhh,

1469
01:19:57,259 --> 01:20:00,422

- Your name is on the bucks.

1470
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,396
The shoe, show them the shoe,

1471
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:06,265
Okay, yeah, anyway, you know,

1472
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,269
This pretty cool, this is the Mary Lou

1473
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,330
Which is really the shoe who put me on the map,
without her, I wouldn't be here.

1474
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,398
- It's a fat girl shoe.
- Believe it or not..

1475
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:18,401
Believe it or not, though, Mary Loui is actually
the same as the Mary Jane but it's black Leather.

1476
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,378
Got back! Come on, will you, will you!

You're having good afternoon or what?

1481
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:50,307
I want to take a moment to tell you why Steve
here is so absolutely off the fucking wall.

1482
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:54,438
Is because this man is a creative genius.

1483
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,350
This ability, this gift that Steve has..

1484
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,446
.. goes beyond just, spotting the hottest shoe
trends.

1485
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:05,522
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1486
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,324
You understand?

1487
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:13,265
Oddest like Steve come along once every Decade,

Steve come over here for second.

1490
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,434
I don't think you're all realized.

1491
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:30,247
That Steve Madden is the hottest person in the
winning shoe industry with orders going through
the roof of every departmen store in North America

1492
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,479
We have him here at our office!

1493
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,290
We should thank our fucking lucky
star, this man is here.

1494
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:41,422
We should be on our hands in knees right

1495
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,488
Like this! Ok? I want to suck
you off, Steve!

1496
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:48,360
Everyone is going to suck you off.

1497
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:53,272
This is our golden ticket into the
fucking chocolate factory right here.

1498
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:57,244
And I want to meet Louis Vodka Wonka,

1499
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,476
And I want to meet with the fucking
Oompa Loompa like this!

1500
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,447
All right, get off this fucking stage,
get out of here.

1501
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,257
All right, I want you to focus
for a second.

1502
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,283
See those little black boxes?

1503
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,263
They call it telephone, I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret about this telephone.

1504
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,232
It not gonna dial themselves, okay?

1505
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:23,330
Without you, they just worthless
hungs of plastics.

1506
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:27,501
Like a loaded M-16 without a trained marine
to pull the trigger.

1507
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,370
And in the case of the Telephone,

1508
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:34,348
It's up to each and every one of you..

1509
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:43,517
My hightly trained Strattonites,
my killers who will not take no for an answer.

1510
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,289
My fucking warriors.

1511
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,285
Who'll not hang up the phone.

1512
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:55,259
until their client either buys or
fucking die!

1513
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,248
Let me tell you something.

1514
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,413
There is no nobility in poverty.

1515
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:19,417
I've been a rich man, and I've been a poor man,
and I choose to rich every fucking time!

1516
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:25,265
'Coz at least as a rich man, when I have to face
my problems, I show up in the back of the limo..

1517
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:30,397
Wearing $ 2000 suite, and $ 14000
gold fucking watch.

1518
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,402
Good boys, get him up! Hit him!

1519
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,502
Fuck off from me!

1520
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:42,279
If there anyone here thinks I am superficial
of materialistic..

1521
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:47,311
Go get a job in fucking McDonalds, 'cause
that's where you fucking belong!

1522
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:52,417
But before you depart this room
full of winners..

1523
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,395
I want you to take a good look at the
person next you, go on.

1524
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,460
'Cause sometime in not so distant future..

1525
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:06,430
You know, you pulled out to a red light and
you beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person
gonna be pulling up right along side you..

1526
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,409
In the brand new Porsche.

1527
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:14,474
With their beautiful wife by their side,
who's got big full up juiced tits.

1528
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,443
And who will you be next to?

1529
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:25,325
Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razor
stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in the
next you with a carload of groceries from the

1530
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,486
.. fucking price club!

1531
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,292
And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

1532
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,423
So you listen to me and you
listen well.

1533
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,266
Are you behind on you credit card bills?

1534
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,496
Good, pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1535
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:39,405
Is the landlord ready to evict you? Good!

1536
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:42,239
Pick up the phone, and start dialling!

1537
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,236
Is your girlfriend think you're fucking
worthless loser? Good!

1538
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,374
Pick up the phone and
start dialling!

1539
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:52,513
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1540
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,217
All you have to do today!

1541
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,384
Is pick up the phone.

1542
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:01,453
And speak the words that I have taught you.

1543
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:08,335
And I will make you richer than the most
powerfull CEO in the United States.

1544
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,298
I want you to go out there..

1545
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:19,344
And I want you to ram Steve Madden's stock down
to your clients throats..

1546
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,315
Till they fucking chokes on it.

1547
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:27,380
Till they choke on it and the buy a hundred
thousands shares, that's what I want to do!

1548
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,480

1551
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:41,527
Now let's start this motherfucker
rolling around!

1552
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:44,364
[ MUSIC ]

1553
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:15,358
At one PM, we opened the stock for sale
at 4 dollar and 15 cent a share

1554
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:18,396
By 01:03, it was over $18.

1555
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:21,374
Even the big wallstreet firms were buying.

1556
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:35,446
From the 2 million shares offered for sale, a
million belong to me held in phony accounts by my
ratholes.

1557
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,357
Now, once the price hit the high teens..

1558
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:42,327
You know what? Who gives this
shit? As always, the point is this.

1559
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:47,427
$ 22.000.000 in 3 fucking hours!

1560
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:50,301

1561
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,362
I get love this-

1562
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,339
Crazy account!

1563
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,241
Call for you! Berry Kleinman
on the phone from Future Video?

1564
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:59,371
- Who?
- I don't know, he shoot your wedding,
he said it's urgent.

1565
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,405
Urgent? Who the fuck is Berry Kleinman?

1566
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,214
Oh my God, you want to marry me?
You're in love with me?

1567
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,412
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1568
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,385
Berry, what's up?

1569
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:10,448
- Listen, uh, I got this Subpoena..
- Subpoena? What are you talking about?

1570
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,483
The FBI, they want to copy of your
wedding video.

1571
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,394
Fucking FBI? Are you fucking kidding me?

1572
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:19,423
Listen to me, his name is Denham, he is an
agent within the New York Office.

1573
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,425
What is his problem? He's a boyscout!

1574
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:24,233
Thinks you're fucking Gordon Gecko!

1575
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:27,441
What does he want from my wedding video?
It's like invasion to my privacy.

1576
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:30,343
You know what I am saying? It's like..
It's intrusive!, you know..

1577
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,313
He's got picture of your whole inner
fucking circle

1578
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,511
Pictures, name of the people, he is do what
is he wants to do, exactly what is he do.

1579
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:40,317
Look at your self, he's try to rattle you,
he's try to rattle your old lady..

1580
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,222
So she nagging you to turns become
a fucking witness.

1581
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,352
Oh, so he wants me to rat on my self, he wants
me to give information about my..

1582
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:50,262
- What your solution?
- The good fucking news, is I know everybody
down town.

1583
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:56,237
I called the justice department, the DEA, nobody
even know you fucking exist. So calm down!

1584
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,432
- They don't know I exist?
- No.

1585
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,373
That's Good.

1586
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,214
- But you.. you know who is he, right?
- Yeah.

1587
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:14,381
So if I just want to get some more information,
just find out what he know, you can.. you can go
his house, go to his house

1588
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:17,481
right, tap his phone, a little bit bug him..
you could get some information

1589
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:20,460
You don't fuck with these guys like this.

1590
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,259
You don't fuck with him like that, what do
nuts or something?

1591
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,526
What do you fucking do? What did I pay you for?

1592
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:27,296
I have a fucking PI license, you know?

1593
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,361
I am making living at this, I am not
a cop anymore.

1594
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,271
- They'll take my fucking license away from me,
all right? - Okay.

1595
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:37,404
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just
can I get the guy a call?

1596
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,338
- Why? Is that..
- Jordan, Jordan..

1597
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:44,283
Do me a favor, the only one who

1598
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,411
- Allright, okay..
- What would you do?

1599
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:51,518
I told you, whatever the fuck you say to him, he's
gonna use against you, don't you understand?!

1600
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:53,517
He is smart, you dumb

1601
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,289
- I am not allowing call-
- Are we fucking talking tonite or you gonna

The last time you took this fucking pills, you
put your head and fucking like a maniac, now
pick it up!

1603
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,368
All right.

1604
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,306
Okay, I won't call him.

1605
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:13,276
Hey fellas, come on board, plank's
around there.

1606
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,313
Welcome.

1607
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,375
Huh, what a nice day.

1608
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,448
Hey, welcome aboard

1609
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,391
Jordan, welcome to the Naomi,
nice to meet you.

1610
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,328
- Agent Denham, this is agent Hughes.
- Hi, how are you?

1611
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,296
Now, I'll introduce you..

1612
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,457
This Nicole, Heidi, come on,
don't be shy..

1613
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,264
Why do you guys shy for?
Don't be scared..

1614
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,360
These are friends of Stratton.

1615
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:37,462
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1616
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,367
- Come on..
- Your message said that..

1617
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,343
You want to speak privately.

1618
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:45,244
Right, I do want to speak privately.

1619
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:46,338
Give us some minute, hey ladies?

1620
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,373
- Let me know if I can get you anything.
- We'd be happy to help.

1621
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:56,314
You guys hungry? Want some to eat? We got some
pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey and kind
of Booze..

1622
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:59,451
You know what, the biro doesn't allow us
to drink while at sea.

1623
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,519
Duh, I forgot, of course.

1624
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,497
Ever been on one of these before?

1625
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,391
A boat?

1626
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,360
Learned to sail when I was six

1627
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,427
No shit? Is that right? All right.

1628
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,404
I mean, one like this.

1629
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:14,374
The whole front extended so it fit
the chopter up there.

1630
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,309
You see that?

1631
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,303
Any way, this is for you.

1632
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,509
It's uh, a complete list of every person
who was at my wedding..

1633
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:27,284
Yeah, I understand you want the whole wedding
video, figured this would help the whole process,
right?

1634
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,222
- There you go.
- Look..

1635
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,226
My point is that I know you're investigating
Stratton..

1636
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,491
But for the life of me,
I can't figure it out why

1637
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:41,366
I know we are little unorthodox, we are little
loud in the way we do things, we gotta understand
with the new guys on the block..

1638
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,235
You know, trying to make an impression, but..

1639
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:47,239
Now I want you to understand, we don't..

1640
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:50,438
do anything Illegal, whatsoever.

1641
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:55,313
You could talk to the SEC, there were at my
office 15 times for the last 6 month..

1642
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,216
I mean I got nothing to hide.

1643
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:02,416
Well, you know the SEC is civil right regulatory
agency, we pursue criminal activity.

1644
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,257
Exactly, you go after real criminals..

1645
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:10,458
Makes me wonder what.. what the hell are you
doing sticking me for?

1646
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:14,333
What is the thing that we did? or do?
I don't get it.

1647
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:18,361
Well, I.. Jordan I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.

1648
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:20,306
No, I get that, No I understand.

1649
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:24,335
With that said, this case got dumped on
my desk.

1650
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:26,370
- Did it?
- You know, by higher up who..

1651
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:29,383
needs to make a show looking in and the
new company on the block..

1652
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,317
- Loud guy..
- I got pressing and anything..

1653
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,413
And then I ended up be in the
smuch who does the local, exactly.

1654
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:37,424
Itjust, you know, bothers me..
We are the new guy..

1655
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,393
Where the one with bank there
in Wallstreet?

1656
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:44,330
Oh man, you should see what's going on the
bigger firms, I mean I know all the information.

1657
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:49,302
It's true, Goldman, Lehmann Brothers, Merryl,
collateralized debt obligation..

1658
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,431
Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking
travesty.

1659
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,468
I mean I can take you step by step, to what
exactly is occuring, you know..

1660
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:00,470
All you have to do is ask.

1661
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,346
It's exactly what I want to hear.

1662
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:07,481
- Hmm.
- I don't see why a little sitdown like this, can
be profitable for the both.

1663
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:11,253
- It should, right, it should profitable.
- It should.

1664
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:17,391
Look, I am gonna give my personal line, 5
days a week, you just call me, feel free.

1665
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:20,434
- I'll do that.
- Great.

1666
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:27,238
Are you sure you guys don't want some to
drink? I mean, you're not hungry? Nothing?

1667
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:28,297
- Nothing?
- Oh no.

1668
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:30,368
No.

1669
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,512
Mind if I ask you, and if you dont want to get
too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1670
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:40,352
Did you try to get your broker's license
at one time?

1671
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,516
Isn't that right? When you trying to take
a step at wallstreet?

1672
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,520
- No?
- Who have been told it to you?

1673
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,251
- Who the fuck you've been talking to?
- Why you investigating me..

1674
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:51,322
Hei, you see what I mean?

1675
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:56,326
You ever think about what would happen
if you're, you know, stay in the course.

1676
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:02,466
You know what? When I ridin' home on the subway,
and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the
same suit 3 days in a row,

1677
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:06,344
Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't rite?

1678
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,347
Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?

1679
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:10,283
I mean, what do you.. another personal question,
no need to answer if you don't like..

1680
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:11,342
No, that's all right, Jordan.

1681
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:14,378
Whattaya pull in? 50? 60'k?
something like that?

1682
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,413
A year? Low part?

1683
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:20,226
Let's put it this way.

1684
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:23,286
You get a free hand gun when you
sign up for the biro.

1685
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,399
No, but it is fucking pisses me off, you know.

1686
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:29,426
When you think about the people that build
this country, hardworking people like you..

1687
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,303
You know, fire fighters, teachers,
FBI agent..

1688
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:37,471
End of the day you guys get fucking skin-the-life
financially, fucking makes me angry.

1689
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:41,447
That's the one thing about Wall street, in this
market is, for me..

1690
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:46,284
I feel it's good to give back, you know,

1691
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,379
There's situation where I can..

1692
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:52,222
make those situations better for people.

1693
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:53,418
You know what I mean.

1694
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:56,362
Opportunity is everything.

1695
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:58,228
Exactly.

1696
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,460
Take for example I got this one
kid, right?

1697
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,337
He went to school for environmental
science something like that..

1698
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:09,309
He was bogged down by students loan,
turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery

1699
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,311
- Right, horrible situation.
- Sure.

1700
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:16,373
We got them minute, the market, the right time,
choose the right stock, we gave him the right
guidance..

1701
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:19,251
Bom, overnight, change his entire life..

1702
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,414
You know, He gotta put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

1703
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,418
It didn't work out for her, she passed
away unfortunately, but..

1704
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:29,419
We gave him that opportunity,
you know what I am saying?

1705
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:34,490
Itjust about sending up the right team and
then overnight your life can change.

1706
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:46,275
What if.. what is.. what is the intern to make
a deal like that?

1707
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,508
Oh that's the situation.

1708
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:51,484
I mean, that particular trade,
and one trade.

1709
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,288
North of half a million dollar.

1710
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:03,387
And I do that for anybody, you know, anybody
that needs the proper guidance.

1711
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:27,414
Can you say that again? Just the
way you said it.

1712
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:29,423
Just the same way.

1713
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:35,224
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No..

1714
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,422
- Oh come on, you know what I am talking about.
- No, I don't know..

1715
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,228
Say this, I think Jordan just did..

1716
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:40,324
- If I am not mistake
- No.

1717
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:43,428
- You just tried to bribe a federal agent.
- Oh, technically I didn't.

1718
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:46,372
I didn't bribe anybody, technically, I didn't.

1719
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:52,312
No, according to US criminal code, there needs to
be exact dollar to give for the exchange services.

1720
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:55,406
that would not hold up on the court of law..

1721
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,475
No, no, no, that's the truth, but..

1722
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,350
- I want to tell you this.
- Yeah.

1723
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:05,325
The same gentlemen that told me that you try to
get your brokers license also told me that you're
straight arrow.

1724
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:08,295
- You ran a security check on me?
- Well..

1725
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:13,427
Sail on the boat, fit for Bond villain,
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1726
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:18,235
I think it's time you both get the fuck
off my boat, what do you say?

1727
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:20,297
You know Jordan, I'll tell you something.

1728
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:23,435
- Most of the wallstreetjackasses that I bust..
- Yeah.

1729
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:26,310
They're.. they were the man for born.

1730
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,405
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1731
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:31,441
Their father is douchebag, just like the
fathers before them

1732
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,447
But you..

1733
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:38,481
- You got this all way on your own.
- Did I?

1734
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:41,325
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

1735
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,421
- Good for you.
- Me, the little man?

1736
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,330
Let me tell you something.

1737
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:47,300
No, let me tell you something else.

1738
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:51,236
Honestly, I am not bullshit here, this is one of
the nicest boat I've ever been on,

1739
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:52,364
- I got tell you this.
- I bet it is.

1740
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,341
And you know what I just thinking too?

1741
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:57,310
what a fucking hero that I am gonna
back at the office..

1742
01:36:57,378 --> 01:37:03,317
When the bureau seizes this fucking boat,
because I am being fucked this, fuck, fuck..

1743
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:06,512
It's beautiful, and you got the beautiful
girls there.

1744
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,286
- It's wonderful.
- Okay, get the fuck off my boat.

1745
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,382
I am sure we'll be seeing each other
real soon.

1746
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:16,420
I am sure, good luck on that subway ride home,
and your miserable ugly fucking wife

1747
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,490
I am gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off
my balls in the mean time..

1748
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,401
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters
for your ride home.

1749
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:27,373
Fucking miserable bricks, I know you can't
afford 'em, fucking cheap fuck.

1750
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,467
Fuck those people.

1751
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:33,310
Hey fellas, look what I found in my pocket!

1752
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,281
Your salary, right here!

1753
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:38,217
You know what I call 'em?
Fun coupon.

1754
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:39,344
See that?

1755
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,446
The fun coupon.

1756
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:52,298
What's hon? What the fuck is in switzerland?

1757
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,324
Swiss fucking bank, that's what.

1758
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:57,361
He was ask couple of time.
I had to hide my money.

1759
01:37:58,372 --> 01:37:59,498
Enter Rugrat.

1760
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,339
He knew this Swiss Banker from law school.

1761
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:07,473
But he was in Geneva, and there's no way I was
gonna make that flight sober.

1762
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,283
So I knew if I took my drugs right

1763
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,376
I could sleep to the entire flight.

1764
01:38:12,419 --> 01:38:15,354
But I had to take them just right.

1765
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:22,421
At 4 PM I pooped a few more ludes,
which is start kicking in by the time I
finished my sales meeting. My dingle face.

1766
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:27,389
By dinner, I popped a few more, on top
of some coctail and valium too.

1767
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,493
My slur phase

1768
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:33,433
By eight thirty, I took a few more ludes..

1769
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:36,307
I am pretty much lost all my motor skill.

1770
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,502
This was the drool face.

1771
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:44,445
And by ten, I didn't know who or what
the fuck I was.

1772
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:46,510
The Amnesia phase.

1773
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:49,313
And boarded to the plane just before
midnight.

1774
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:52,348
- Ah look at you, you're so beautiful.
- Excuse me..

1775
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,353
It's his sleeping pills, he's all right,
he's all right.

1776
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:58,422
- May I ask your boarding pass, sir?
- We have the boarding pass.

1777
01:38:58,532 --> 01:39:01,365
Jesus Christ, I am so sleepy.

1778
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,359
Hey, relax!

1779
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:06,237
Oh my God, you got your hand
on my fucking cock!

1780
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,299
Get in chair, this guy is touching
my dick again.

1781
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,369
- You got his hand on his dick?
- You gotta stop doing that..

1782
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:13,277
...in public space.

1783
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:14,440
Take it off.

1784
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:15,506
Take it off.

1785
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:18,416
I heard there's treasure map under this..

1786
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,284
- Excuse me sir.
- I know miss.

1787
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,482
Please sit down..

1788
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,320
- Watch him.
- Go back to your seat please.

1789
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:26,485
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

1790
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:28,353
I had been have to call the taxing.

1791
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:31,330
Please sir, please, sit down.

1792
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,232
- Please,Sit down!
- Okay, okay, I am going!

1793
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:36,463
- Stop!
- We apologize, we are going to sleep ma'am.

1794
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,494
We're sleeping as you question.

1795
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,335
Fasten your seatbelt, sir.

1796
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,309
- okay.
- We cannot take off if you haven't
fasten your seatbelt.

1797
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:45,312
Sit down, fasten it, I can do it for you.

1798
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:46,279
- What?
- I will do it for you.

1799
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,440
- Okay.
- You gotta speak english..

1800
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:49,414
We don't understand this languages, mam..

1801
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,247
I will help him fasten his seatbelt..

1802
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:52,479
I am not a fucking idiot.

1803
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:54,453
Sit back, sit back!

1804
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:57,288
There you go, yeah there you go!

1805
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:04,328
- Hilfa!
- Hilfa!

1806
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,501
Jesus christ, fuck.

1807
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:25,375
Donnie, this isn't funny, you
must untie me, buddy.

1808
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:27,377
I can't untie you.

1809
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:30,380
The captain tied you up, he almost
fucking teasing you.

1810
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:34,260
- Why?
- Why?

1811
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:49,365
You were screaming at the people.

1812
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:54,247
You are on the floor, like rolling
around and shit.

1813
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:58,308
- You called the captain the ''N'' word.
- I called the captain the ''N'' word?

1814
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:00,479
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

1815
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:03,388
- Luckyly we're in the first class.
- Oh jesus.

1816
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:07,358
Jesus christ, I think you have a fucking
drug problem!

1817
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:13,331
- Where the ludes?
- There're at my ass, don't worry about it.

1818
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:14,459
I got it.

1819
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,436
Thank god.

1820
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:20,372
Jesus Christ, what we gonna do when we
get to Switzerland buddy? This is bad.

1821
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:24,343
I think this belt are get on my chest,
I can't breathe, come on do something to calm me
down, please?

1822
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,369
Okay, Shut the fuck off, shut the fuck off.

1823
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,507
- Oh please?
- Okay, sshh

1824
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,441
That's good.
Go to sleep.

1825
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:34,318
- Harder buddy.
- You're all right.

1826
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,515
We're all love you..
Shut the fuck off!

1827
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:46,321
Mr. Belfort, you're free go.

1828
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:50,302
Really?

1829
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:53,473
- Hi, Donnie.
- Yeah?

1830
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:57,501
When we get up there, try not to act like
yourself, okay, let's make you even ass hole
version Donnie, all right?

1831
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,478
- Why phone and call me to come for?
- Hey listen.

1832
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,347
The only reason you sitting in this limo and not
a Swiss dale 'cause you're my friend,

1833
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,283
- Ok?
- Hilfa!

1834
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:07,454
- We're here, here, we're here.
- I am more calm down, come on.

1835
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,389
Jordan Belfort, at last..

1836
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:13,325
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

1837
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:16,421
- Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.
- Pleasure to make your acquiantes.

1838
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,328
Nice to meet you.

1839
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,229
You understand what we're talking?

1840
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:22,462
Oh, ok.

1841
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,404
- Couch, for desk.
- I don't understand, I am sorry.

1842
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:29,273
I am curious about your
bank secrecy laws here.

1843
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:33,439
Wait, yes, excuse me Jordan.

1844
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:38,513
- Swiss custom, we require 10 minutes of bla bla.
- Chit chat.

1845
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:41,488
Chit chat thank you, before business
can be discussed.

1846
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:44,417
Yeah.

1847
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:50,259
Of course, let's get down to it.

1848
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:52,265
What would you like to know?

1849
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:57,397
Under what circumstances would you be obligated
to cooperate with the FBI or..

1850
01:42:57,437 --> 01:43:01,339
US justice department investigations,
for example?

1851
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:03,241
Ca depend.

1852
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,404
- Ca depend?
- Yeah.

1853
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:09,372
Ca depend on what exactly?

1854
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:13,476
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in upcoming month.

1855
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:17,348
- So you want check the tank are rolling down
the Ru de La Croix? - Yes, Ru de La Croix

1856
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:18,483
- Ah, Croix!
- Yeah, Croix

1857
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:21,460
Not Croix, not even Ru de La Croix, Croix

1858
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:25,227
This is what we used to do back in law school,
Champagne - Champagna.

1859
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:28,530
- Yeah.
- yeah yeah, french fries or Frittes.

1860
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,294
And kind uh..

1861
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,464
- That kind of stuff.
- That's right.

1862
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,401
What I'm asking you, Swiss dick,

1863
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:38,377
is are you going to fuck me over?

1864
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:44,508
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

1865
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:51,289
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body

1866
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:55,386
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

1867
01:43:55,395 --> 01:44:00,458
But there are very few Swiss laws
which applied to your ''practises''

1868
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,468
from a financial standpoint.

1869
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:06,235
You are now in heaven.

1870
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,366
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

1871
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:12,275
If the US Justice Department
sent us as subpoena,

1872
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,373
it will become a,
um.. papier-toillette.

1873
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:19,285
- We will wipe our ass with it.
- [LAUGHING]

1874
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:23,222
Unless, of course, it was an
investigation into stock fraud

1875
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:26,249
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

1876
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:31,288
Then there would have to be co-operation,
on your part, if I'm not mistaken.

1877
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:34,266
Yes. Yes, we would

1878
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:37,493
Assuming the account is under your name.

1879
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:42,340
If it were another name

1880
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:45,411
- of friends, I get my..
- Cousin.

1881
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,436
Cousin, absolutely no.

1882
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:52,443
- Relative.
- Yeah.

1883
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:57,255
Was that yodeling I just heard or..

1884
01:44:57,257 --> 01:44:59,418
Did you just say what
I thought he said?

1885
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:02,292
Yes. Yes.

1886
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,491
He's telling me to use a fucking
rathole.

1887
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:08,491
But the US rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.

1888
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:13,370
What I needed was a rathole with a
European passport.

1889
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,308
[MUSIC]

1890
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,442
- Jordan.
- Hey.

1891
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:26,283
- How's my favourite aunt?
- Welcome, was the traffic terrible?

1892
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,345
Oh, no, not at all.

1893
01:45:30,257 --> 01:45:32,225
Jordan, Come on in

1894
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:35,251
Thank God, aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.

1895
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:37,456
Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.

1896
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:40,466
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

1897
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:43,231
How do you say ''rathole'' in British?

1898
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,431
.. If you gettin' any trouble whatsoever,

1899
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,340
I'll come for it immediately,
I'll say that I duped you.

1900
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:50,343
And I promise.

1901
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:53,312
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?

1902
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:59,376
Sometimes I wonder,

1903
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:02,411
if you let money get
the best of you, my love,

1904

It's chilly darling,
you're sweating bullets.

1908
01:46:17,404 --> 01:46:19,395
What can I say, I'm um..

1909
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,274
I'm a drug addict.

1910
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:24,334
I'm not really am, I, I mean..

01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:29,347
whatever it is, I'll fuckin' do it.

1913
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:31,347
That's the truth.

1914
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:34,479
I am.. I am sex addict too.

1915
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:38,382
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex. [LAUGHING]

1916
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:42,359
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
I am sorry.

1917
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:46,331
Because I'm very easy to talk to

You are. You are easy to talk to.

That's about it, it's..

1920
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:54,297
It'sjust my job, you know, it's uh..

1921
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:59,210
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know, it's..

1922
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:04,274
Sometimes I feel like I've bitten
off more than I can chew, you know?

1923
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:06,444
You're a man with large appetites.

1924
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:08,512
yeah.

1925
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,515
Is she fuckin' hittin' on me?

Yeah. Yeah, I am.

My decision.

1929
01:47:22,369 --> 01:47:23,427
It is hard, though..

1930
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:28,339
Hard to learn to control the
anxiety, sometimes, you know?

1931
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:30,275
You know, to..

1932
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:33,336
Learn to relax, and let go, and..

1933

To release the tension.

1934

She is hittin' on me. [LAUGHING]

Holy shit.

1936

I got to release the tension.

1937
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:51,390
Suppose we, uh.. We
all just need to learn.

1938
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:55,459
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

1939
01:47:57,437 --> 01:48:00,338
Is he fucking hitting on me?

else has European passport?

01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:44,510
Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

1952
01:48:45,252 --> 01:48:47,345
spent his winters in the south of France,

1953
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:49,378
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.

1954
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:52,358
A striper of Slovenian origin,

1955
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:56,226
born in, of all places, Switzerland.

1956
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:02,324
Well, this is fucked.

1957
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:04,303
Oh, no, shit!

1958
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:11,443
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.

1959
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:16,373
Yeah, a suicide work.

1960
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:19,316
But, how about her family? Right?

1961
01:49:19,352 --> 01:49:21,479
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?

1962
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:23,422
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

1963
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,220
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

1964
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:28,227
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

1965
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:30,456
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
''what are you doing?'', they could do that.

1966
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:33,330
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

1967
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:36,426
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

1968
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:40,296
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you

1969
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:43,299

1971
01:49:45,445 --> 01:49:47,504
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

1972
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,314
You give me a call?

1973
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:57,286
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

1974
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:59,224
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

1975
01:49:59,259 --> 01:49:59,520
Shh..

1976
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:02,393
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

1977
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,397
Okay? Technically you do work for me.

1978
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,231
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

1979
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:11,464
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.

1980
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:14,405
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

1981
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,306
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,

- If he comes correct.
- I will.

1984
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:24,279
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.

1985
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,285
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?

1986
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:28,219
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

1987
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:30,381
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

1988
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,357
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!

1989
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:34,293
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.

1990
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:35,385
I already told you this.

1991
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:39,330
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill

Hey pal!

1998
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:55,380
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.

1999
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:58,248
Two million in cash in her carry on.

2000
01:50:58,284 --> 01:51:01,253
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2001
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:05,348
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,

People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2096
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:10,298
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2097
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:11,303
I thought they were like a myth.

2098
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:14,238
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2099
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:17,437
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2100
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:22,346
He said he was saving these for a special
occasion, like a birthday, or being clapfree.

2101
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:24,350
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2104
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:31,285
So that night, I cleared my schedule,

2105
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:35,318
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2106
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:37,420
It was celebration time.

2107
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,226
Okay.

2108
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,391
We start off with one, see how it'll go?

2109
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,368
My guy says all we need is one.

2110
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:43,300
Here we go.

2111
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:46,302
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2112
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:49,274
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2113
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:53,206
Steve,Steve! I gotta get outta here.

2114
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:55,305
No! I think I got it figured out.

2115
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:59,284
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.

2116
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:00,343
Okay.

2117

01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,231
No.

after all these years, huh?

out, I can't feel shit!

2124

They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2125
01:56:45,365 --> 01:56:46,332

We're workin' out, honey.

2135
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:11,222
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2136
01:57:11,257 --> 01:57:13,384
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2137
01:57:15,328 --> 01:57:16,317
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2138
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:18,227
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2139
01:57:18,264 --> 01:57:20,391
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2140
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,231
We're gonna get outta
here. What's going on?

2141
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:25,396
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2142
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:29,306
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2143
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:30,434
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2144

- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:35,246
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:36,339
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2147
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:51,395
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2148
01:57:51,431 --> 01:57:53,399
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2149
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:56,231
Just a mile down the road from my house.

2150
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:08,372

on? I'm at the payphone, what's going on?

2151
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:09,348

here, Brad, your little buddy,

01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:15,478
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2155
01:58:15,488 --> 01:58:16,477
I don't know what he did.

2156
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:20,424
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2157
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:23,486
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?

2158
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,322
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2159
01:58:25,364 --> 01:58:28,333
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2160
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:30,267
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.

2163

tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2164

You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2168
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,284
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2169
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:51,415
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!

2170

I can't understand.

2171
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:54,483
Say that again!

2172
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:58,294
I said I won't, I know what
my feeling with this FBI agent.

2173
01:58:58,331 --> 01:58:59,491
What the fuck are you saying?

2174
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:03,358

- Are you fuckin' high?

don't wanna see more FBI!

2177
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:11,434
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,

2178
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:13,342
don't get behind the wheel of the car,

2179

After 15 years in storage,

2182
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:22,218
the lemons had developed a delayed fuse.

2183

and went straight to the drool phase.

I discovered a whole new phase.

didn't kill anybody else.

Irresponsble prick.

That you never eat Benihana again.

2743

I don't care who's birthday it is.

2744
02:33:09,246 --> 02:33:11,305
What is that Naomi actually doing?

2745
02:33:11,382 --> 02:33:14,408
She right in the house there, say

2746
02:33:14,485 --> 02:33:17,283
Naomi, sweetheart.

2747
02:33:20,324 --> 02:33:22,224

02:33:23,294 --> 02:33:26,354
Probably had to mortgage
the house to make bail.

- Alright, enough, enough.

2763
02:34:14,411 --> 02:34:17,244
- You wanna beer, pal?
- What do you drink?

2764
02:34:17,281 --> 02:34:19,306
We got this non-alcoholic shit.

2765
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:21,477
- What is that?
- It's non alcoholic beer.

2766
02:34:21,518 --> 02:34:23,452
It's got no alchohol.

2767
02:34:23,487 --> 02:34:26,320
- Is it beer?
- Ya, with no alchohol.

2768
02:34:26,357 --> 02:34:30,225
But you drink enough and you
drink a lot to get you fucked up.

2769
02:34:30,261 --> 02:34:32,320
No, it's no alchoholic fucking point.

2770
02:34:32,329 --> 02:34:35,355
I'm not a scientist, i dont get fuck target
but I can get you a beer, if you want..

2771
02:34:35,399 --> 02:34:38,300
I know, but i don't drink, you remember.

2772
02:34:38,335 --> 02:34:40,360
- I'm not drink anymore.
- Are you wanna go inside.

2773
02:34:40,404 --> 02:34:43,373
And blow some lime and baking powder..

2774
02:34:43,507 --> 02:34:46,374
Can't imagine ever not
enjoyed geting fucked up.

2775
02:34:46,410 --> 02:34:48,241
- Yeah.
- I loved it.

2776
02:34:48,245 --> 02:34:49,405
But i've been sobber.

2777
02:34:49,446 --> 02:34:50,435
Fucking sucks.

2778
02:34:50,481 --> 02:34:52,381
- Boring right.
- So boring.

2779
02:34:52,416 --> 02:34:54,384
Like kill myself.

2780
02:34:54,418 --> 02:34:58,479
There is a term and we dont like to
use it unless circumtances dictate..

2781
02:34:58,522 --> 02:35:03,516
.. I think they do dictate in this case and
term is Grenada, have you ever heard Grenada.

2782
02:35:03,527 --> 02:35:04,425
No i haven't.

2783
02:35:04,461 --> 02:35:14,359
Grenada very interesting because it is a small
island nation that was invaded by the United
States of America 1983 have 9000 people.

2784
02:35:14,405 --> 02:35:17,374
And essentially means is.

2785
02:35:17,374 --> 02:35:20,400
This case is unloseable.

2786
02:35:20,444 --> 02:35:25,381
So, you know, come in we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants, nobody gives a fuck.

2787
02:35:25,416 --> 02:35:27,316
I'm gonna win.

2788
02:35:27,351 --> 02:35:29,319
You Sir.

2789
02:35:30,254 --> 02:35:32,222
Are was known.

2790
02:35:32,456 --> 02:35:34,447
As a Grenada.

2791
02:35:37,328 --> 02:35:40,422
You're looking at real prison time.

2792
02:35:40,464 --> 02:35:44,230
Money laundering can get you as much 20 years.

2793
02:35:44,268 --> 02:35:48,398
And, our case gonna be stronger, if we
caught your shed and cash your mattress,.

2794
02:35:48,439 --> 02:35:50,270
Oh that right.

2795
02:35:50,374 --> 02:35:52,274
Hei Jordan.

2796
02:35:52,309 --> 02:35:57,406
Jordan, You're rotting away in
jail, 2 your kids get out the college.

2797
02:35:57,414 --> 02:36:00,281
That's not our ambition here.

2798
02:36:00,451 --> 02:36:03,249
There's other people involve in this too.

2799
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:06,483
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.

2800
02:36:08,525 --> 02:36:11,221
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

2801
02:36:11,261 --> 02:36:12,387
He's got good sense.

2802
02:36:12,429 --> 02:36:14,363
What are you, Craskin?

2803
02:36:14,531 --> 02:36:23,303
Full cooperation, he provides us with the
comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning
the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

2804
02:36:23,507 --> 02:36:26,408
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

2805
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:29,377
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

2806
02:36:29,413 --> 02:36:31,244
No, i want you to cooperate.

2807
02:36:31,281 --> 02:36:33,374
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

2808
02:36:33,417 --> 02:36:37,478
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

2809
02:36:41,425 --> 02:36:43,222
How is Christy's party?

2810
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:46,329
- Fine.
- Good.

2811
02:36:47,264 --> 02:36:49,357
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.

2812
02:36:49,433 --> 02:36:53,369
There is some really really great news.

2813
02:36:54,238 --> 02:36:57,435
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

2814
02:36:57,474 --> 02:36:59,339
I know that already.

2815
02:36:59,376 --> 02:37:04,507
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

2816
02:37:05,282 --> 02:37:11,448
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

2817
02:37:11,488 --> 02:37:16,289
You know.. turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the Wallstreet..

2818
02:37:16,326 --> 02:37:21,491
That i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars.

2819
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,234
It gets even better babe.

2820
02:37:25,269 --> 02:37:31,208
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.

2821
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:35,405
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

2822
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:39,280
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.

2823
02:37:39,316 --> 02:37:43,275
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

2824
02:37:44,288 --> 02:37:49,385
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

2825
02:37:49,426 --> 02:37:51,394
Give an information about my friends.

2826
02:37:51,495 --> 02:37:55,261
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.

2827
02:37:55,265 --> 02:37:56,357
Right.

2828
02:37:56,433 --> 02:38:00,426
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.

2829
02:38:00,471 --> 02:38:03,338
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

2830
02:38:03,373 --> 02:38:06,399
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

2831
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:10,403
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

2832
02:38:10,447 --> 02:38:12,506
I'm really happy for you.

2833
02:38:14,284 --> 02:38:17,412
What do you mean you happy for me?

2834
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:21,424
- You should be happy for the both of us right?
- Yeah right.

2835
02:38:21,458 --> 02:38:22,482
Alright.

2836
02:38:24,394 --> 02:38:26,225

2837
02:38:26,463 --> 02:38:29,432

2838
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:33,335

02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:35,497

02:38:52,489 --> 02:38:56,220

02:40:08,231 --> 02:40:10,290

02:40:10,367 --> 02:40:12,301
