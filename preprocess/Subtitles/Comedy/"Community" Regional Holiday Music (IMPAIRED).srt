has his knighthood revoked.

I think what we've learned,
Abed,

is that attempts to make
the holidays brighter

tend to give them
a certain darkness.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

478
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:13,884
This show is supposed to be
gleeful and bright and fun,

479
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,352
and you can let me do that,

480
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,437
or there can be
another bus crash!

[Gasping]

482
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,309
Well, figuratively.

483
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,861
[Chuckling] I'm not saying,

484
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,098
"I killed
the last glee club."

485
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:31,101
[Laughing] I'm saying
you not listening to me

486
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,572
is like metaphorically cutting
the brake lines on your own--

487
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:38,542
look, kings of Leon!
[Gasping]

488
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,977
What did he say?

489
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,313
Did Mr. Rad
kill the last glee club?

490
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:45,182
And to think
I trusted him enough

491
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:48,318
to captain a magic carpet
in that dream I had last night.

492
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,554
Maybe Jeff's right.

493
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,922
Maybe forcing things
to be bright just makes

494
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,323
the darkness underneath
even darker.

495
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:56,193
This was all my fault,
insisting we do the pageant.

496
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,195
Sorry.

497
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,530
Merry Christmas.

498
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:04,701
I guess I'll just see you guys
after the holidays.

It is tradition to give
one's constable a gift
