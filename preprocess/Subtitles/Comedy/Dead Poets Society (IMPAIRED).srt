00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:21,032
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

300
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:23,717
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with that?

301
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:27,762
<i>She's practically engaged</i>
<i>to Chet Danburry.</i>

302
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,401
- [ Groans ]
- That guy could eat a football.

303
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,474
- Too bad.
<i>- [ Knox ] ''Too bad''?</i>

304
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:33,997
It's worse than ''too bad,''
Pittsie. It's a tragedy.

305
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,722
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

306
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:39,158
All the good ones go for jerks.
You know that.

307
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,677
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out problem five.

308
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,072
I can't just forget her, Cameron.

309
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,916
And I certainly
can't think about trig.

310
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:49,073
- [ Radio Humming ]
- We got it!

311
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:51,802
All right, gentlemen.
Five minutes.

312
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,192
- [ Radio Continues Humming ]
- Let's go.

313
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:57,832
- Did you see her naked? [ Chuckles ]
- Very funny, Dalton.

314
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:00,756
<i>- [ Radio Static ]</i>
- That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,

315
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:05,075
<i>- would it, Mr Pitts?</i>
- No, sir. Science experiment.

316
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,154
<i>Radar.</i>

317
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:11,316
[ Radio Continues Humming ]

318
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:16,159
Gentlemen, open your text
to page 2 1 of the introduction.

319
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,519
Mr Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,

320
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,673
entitled
''Understanding Poetry.''

321
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:27,514
'''Understand Poetry'
by Dr J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

322
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,242
''To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent...

323
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:33,121
''with its metre, rhyme
and figures of speech.

324
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:35,034
<i>''Then ask two questions.</i>

325
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:37,273
<i>''One.: How artfully has the objective</i>
<i>of the poem been rendered?</i>

326
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:40,719
<i>'And, two.: How important</i>
<i>is that objective?</i>

327
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,634
<i>''Question one rates</i>
<i>the poem's perfection.</i>

328
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:44,634
<i>''Question two rates</i>
<i>its importance.</i>

329
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,032
<i>'And once these questions</i>
<i>have been answered...</i>

330
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,399
<i>''determining a poem's greatness</i>
<i>becomes a relatively simple matter.</i>

331
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,951
<i>''If the poem's score</i>
<i>for perfection is plotted...</i>

332
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,034
<i>''on the horizontal</i>
<i>of a graph...</i>

333
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,399
<i>''and its importance</i>
<i>is plotted on the vertical,</i>

334
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,600
''then calculating
the total area of the poem...

335
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:04,277
''yields the measure
of its greatness.

336
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:11,791
''A sonnet by Byron might
score high on the vertical,

337
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,681
<i>''but only average</i>
<i>on the horizontal.</i>

338
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,835
<i>'A Shakespearean sonnet,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

339
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,120
''would score high both
horizontally and vertically,

340
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:23,034
<i>'yielding</i>
<i>a massive total area;:</i>

341
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:26,320
''thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great.

342
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:30,999
<i>'As you proceed through the poetry in</i>
<i>this book, practise this rating method.</i>

343
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,677
<i>'As your ability to evaluate</i>
<i>poems in this manner grows,</i>

344
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:39,315
so will-- so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry.''

345
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,394
Excrement.

346
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,998
That's what I think
of Mr J. Evans Pritchard.

347
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,075
<i>We're not laying pipe.</i>
<i>We're talking about poetry.</i>

348
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:56,280
<i>I mean, how can you describe poetry</i>
<i>like</i> American Bandstand?

349
00:21:56,363 --> 00:22:01,039
''I like Byron. I give him a 42.
But I can't dance to it.''

350
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:04,081
<i>Now, I want you</i>
<i>to rip out that page.</i>

351
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:07,394
Go on.
Rip out the entire page.

352
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,391
<i>You heard me.</i>
<i>Rip it out.</i>

353
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,838
<i>Rip it out!</i>

354
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:16,959
Go on.
Rip it out.

355
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,592
<i>Thank you, Mr Dalton.</i>

356
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,594
<i>Gentlemen, tell you what.</i>
<i>Don't just tear out that page.</i>

357
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:27,313
<i>Tear out the entire introduction.</i>
<i>I want it gone, history. Leave nothing.</i>

358
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:31,521
Rip it out! Rip! Be gone,

359
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:33,958
<i>Rip! Shred! Tear!</i>

360

<i>Rip it out! I want to hear nothing</i>
<i>but ripping of Mr Pritchard!</i>

361

<i>- [ Boys Chuckling ]</i>

362
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,032
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.

363
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,398
<i>- [ Boys Chuckling ]</i>
- [ Mumbling ]

364
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,793
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.

365
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,158
<i>- [ Boys Chattering ]</i>
- We shouldn't be doing this.

366
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,598

00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:54,514

<i>Rip it! Yeah! Rip it out!</i>

370
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,839
[ Muffled Chattering, Laughing ]

371
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,801
<i>- [ Boy ] Rip it!</i>
- What the hell is going on here?

372
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:13,559
- I don't hear enough rips.
- Mr Keating.

373
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,918
Mr McAllister.

374
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:20,315
I'm sorry, I--
I didn't know you were here.

375
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:26,035
- I am.
- <i>Ah. So you are.</i>

376
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:28,114
Excuse me.

377
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,998
[ Keating ]
Keep ripping, gentlemen.

378
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,677
<i>This is a battle, a war.</i>

379
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,754
And the casualties could be
your hearts and souls.

380
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:38,674
Thank you, Mr Dalton.

381
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:41,721
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

382
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,634
<i>No! We will not</i>
<i>have that here.</i>

383
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,554
<i>No more</i>
<i>of MrJ. Evans Pritchard.</i>

384
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:48,760
<i>Now, my class, you will learn</i>
<i>to think for yourselves again.</i>

385
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:52,233
You will learn
to savour words and language.

386
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,518
No matter what
anybody tells you,

387
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:58,198
words and ideas
<i>can</i> change the world.

388
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,558
I see that look
in Mr Pitts' eye...

389
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,793
like 1 9th century literature
has nothing to do...

390
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,714
with going to business school
or medical school.

391
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:06,634
Right? Maybe.

392
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,714
Mr Hopkins, you may agree
with him, thinking,

393
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:11,920
''Yes, we should simply study
our Mr Pritchard...

394
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:14,801
''and learn our rhyme and metre
and go quietly about the business...

395
00:24:14,883 --> 00:24:17,841
of achieving other ambitions.''

396
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,721
I have a little secret for you.
Huddle up.

397
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:22,634
Huddle up!

398
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,519
We don't read and write
poetry because it's cute.

399
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:38,154
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

400
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:42,794
And the human race
is filled with passion.

401
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:45,351
Medicine, law,
business, engineering:

402
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,480
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life.

403
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:50,952
But poetry,

404
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:54,956
beauty, romance, love--

405
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,511
these are what
we stay alive for.

406
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:00,322
<i>To quote from Whitman.:</i>

407
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:04,282
<i>''O me, O life of the questions</i>
<i>of these recurring.</i>

[ All ] For what we are

Amen.

421
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,402
Quite an interesting class
you gave today, Mr Keating.

422
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:08,281
- Sorry if I shocked you, Mr McAllister.
- There's no need to apologise.

423
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:11,321
It was very fascinating,
misguided though it was.

424
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,234
You think so?

425
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,440
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists,John.

426
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:20,118
When they realize that they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

427
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,716
they'll hate you for it.

428
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:25,079
We're not talking artists, George.
We're talking freethinkers.

429
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,472
Freethinkers at 1 7?

430
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,394
Funny, I never pegged you
as a cynic.

431
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,317
Not a cynic.

432
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,280
<i>A realist.</i>

433
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:40,276
''Show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams,

434

'Twas always thus,

No. Keating.

<i>- [ Chuckling ] God.</i>
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

462
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:04,913
I doubt the present administration
would look too favourably upon that.

463
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,563
Why?
What was it?

464
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:14,322
- Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

465
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:21,881
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

466
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:25,080
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke
at the beginning of every meeting.

467
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,631
You see, we would gather
at the old Indian cave...

468
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:32,080
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley-- the biggies.

469
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:33,881
<i>Even some of our own verse.</i>

470
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:37,433
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

471
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:40,595
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around, reading poetry?

472
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:43,481
No, Mr Overstreet.
It wasn't just <i>guys.</i>

473
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:46,680
We weren't a Greek organization.
We were romantics.

474
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:51,598
We didn't just read poetry, we let it
drip from our tongues, like honey.

<i>Spirits soared, women swooned</i>

Not a bad way
to spend an evening, eh?

477
00:28:58,643 --> 00:28:59,917
Hmm.

478
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:02,676
Thank you, Mr Perry,
