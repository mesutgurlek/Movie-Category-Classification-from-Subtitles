1
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,875
<i>But really, he's like my brother;</i>

2
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,030
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>
<i>I'm a boxing promoter;</i>

3
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,756
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter</i>
<i>until a week ago, and then;</i>

4
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,110
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,911
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

6
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?</i>
<i>- Do we have a choice?</i>

7
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,755
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally;</i>

8
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,679
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve;</i>

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,876
<i>It's bound with moral fibre; ; ;</i>

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,596
<i>; ; ; but asking a grown man</i>
<i>to believe it?</i>

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,754
<i>What is it?</i>

12
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,353
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,157
<i>What you want I should do,</i>
<i>drop my pants?</i>

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,953
<i>Okay, go through;</i>

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,236
<i>It's a nice story;</i>

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,753
<i>It's just that; Just a story;</i>

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,271
<i>Catholic religion is based</i>
<i>on a mistranslation;</i>

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,869
<i>Enough already; Ruben, say something;</i>

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,594
<i>Listen; Are you busy?</i>
<i>I'll tell you the whole story;</i>

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,879
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated</i>
<i>the Hebrew word for "young woman"; ; ;</i>

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,196
<i>; ; ; into the Greek word for "virgin;"</i>

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,749
<i>It was an easy mistake to make; ; ;</i>

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,357
<i>; ; ; because there was only a subtle</i>
<i>difference in the spelling;</i>

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,990
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy;</i>

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,273
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive</i>
<i>and bear us a son; "</i>

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,399
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"</i>
<i>that caught people's attention;</i>

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,673
<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives</i>
<i>and bears a son;</i>

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,159
<i>But leave that for a couple</i>
<i>of hundred years to stew; ; ;</i>
