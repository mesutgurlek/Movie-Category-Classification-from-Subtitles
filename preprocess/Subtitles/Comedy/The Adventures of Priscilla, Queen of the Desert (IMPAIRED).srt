 SOMETIMES THE SUN
GOES 'ROUND THE MOON 

1498
01:39:59,457 --> 01:40:03,962
 I SEE THE PASSION
IN YOUR EYES 

1499
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:08,967
 SOMETIMES IT'S ALL
A BIG SURPRISE 

1500
01:40:08,967 --> 01:40:14,472
 'CAUSE THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN ALL I DID WAS WISH 

1501
01:40:14,973 --> 01:40:18,977
 YOU'D TELL ME
THIS WAS LOVE 

1502
01:40:19,477 --> 01:40:21,980
 IT'S NOT THE WAY I HOPED 

1503
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,483
 OR HOW I PLANNED 

1504
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:29,487
 BUT SOMEHOW IT'S ENOUGH 

1505
01:40:29,487 --> 01:40:33,992
 AND NOW WE'RE STANDING
FACE-TO-FACE 

1506
01:40:33,992 --> 01:40:38,997
 ISN'T THIS WORLD
A CRAZY PLACE 

1507
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:44,002
 JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
OUR CHANCE HAD PASSED 

1508
01:40:44,002 --> 01:40:50,008
 YOU GO AND SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST 

1509
01:40:57,015 --> 01:41:01,519
 ALL OF THE NIGHTS
YOU CAME TO ME 

1510
01:41:01,519 --> 01:41:06,524
 WHEN SOME SILLY GIRL
HAD SET YOU FREE 

1511
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:11,529
 YOU WONDERED HOW
YOU'D MAKE IT THROUGH 

1512
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:16,534
 I WONDERED
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU 

1513
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:22,040
 'CAUSE HOW COULD YOU GIVE
YOUR LOVE TO SOMEONE ELSE 

1514
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:26,544
 AND SHARE YOUR DREAMS
WITH ME 

1515
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:32,550
 SOMETIMES THE VERY THING
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 

1516
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:36,554
 IS THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T SEE 

1517
01:41:37,055 --> 01:41:41,559
 BUT NOW WE'RE STANDING
FACE-TO-FACE 

1518
01:41:41,559 --> 01:41:46,564
 ISN'T THIS WORLD
A CRAZY PLACE 

1519
01:41:47,065 --> 01:41:51,569
 JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
OUR CHANCE HAD PASSED 

1520
01:41:51,569 --> 01:41:57,575
 YOU GO AND SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST 

1521
01:42:01,579 --> 01:42:06,584
 SOMETIMES THE SNOW
COMES DOWN IN JUNE
