00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,290
I'm good.

164
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,877
You're starting early today.

165
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,921
Yeah, I'm gonna get chip-faced.
Want to join me?

166
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:21,258
I'd love to, but I have
a pressing social engagement.

167
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:22,968
Beth!

168
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:24,887
Brownie meeting.

169
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,598
- Mike, give me a beer and...
- Um...

170
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,433
Milk. Give her milk.

171
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,560
White wine spritzer.

172
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,229
Are most of the people in here agents?

173
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,526
As a matter of fact, here's
an agent. Gracie Hart.

174
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,278
Beth Carter.

175
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,323
Right back to you.

176
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:46,160
Beth is an undergrad at Vassar,
doing a paper on law enforcement.

177
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,245
I'm helping her get an inside look.

178
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,623
I bet she'll do the same for you.

179
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,126
Gracie, I would love to get
a woman's point of view.

180
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:57,671
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Right, Hart?

181
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,468
Do all the women have to wear
those really masculine shoes?

182
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:09,433
I get these made special by the guy
that put the tattoo on my ass.

183
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,436
We'll leave you with Ben and Jerry.
Catch you later.

184
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,314
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

185
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,652
Hope you have a good time at the mall.

186
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,570
Wohop is the place.

187
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,115
Wohop is good, but if you like
variety, you go to La Chinita Linda.

188
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,784
Their rice and beans are slamming.

189
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,703
I don't want variety.
I get pork fried rice every...

190
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,123
I figured it out! I tried to create
a content-based pattern...

191
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,625
...similar to his previous letters.

192
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,669
But this time, he used a signifier.

193
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:39,213
In this case, the word "miss"...

194
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:43,010
...in the subsequent letters.
Will you let me finish?

195
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,221
It's the Miss United States Pageant.

196
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,224
Yeah. Intelligence thought so too.

197
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,892
What do we got?

198
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,562
Miss United States from San Antonio,
Texas, home of the Alamo.

199
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,106
I forgot the Alamo.

200
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,484
The pageant lasts three days.
Preliminaries, conferences...

201
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:01,570
...the live telecast.
It's a logistical nightmare.

202
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,072
Not just a babe-fest.

203
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,659
Jesus, we've only got 48 hours.

204
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,995
Okay, gentlemen.

205
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,247
Where do we start?

206
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,669
I got a cousin in Texas.

207
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:21,007
You might want to call the network and
pageant people. Set up a meeting.

208
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,345
Because you'll probably need
their cooperation.

209
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,097
Yeah.

210
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,433
Yeah, I can do that. Let's do that.

211
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,268
What about jurisdiction?

212
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,021
The Citizen has been ours
from the start.

213
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,606
You might want to call San Antonio.

214
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,067
Grease some wheels so they like us...

215
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:41,861
...when we need manpower and tech.

216
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,446
While I'm at it, let's do that.

217
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Good idea.

218
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:47,744
He loves to make a splash.
His target will be public...

219
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,747
...like one of these outdoor prelims
or a TV broadcast.

220
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,790
Telecasters at the convention center.

221
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,753
We're gonna need surveillance
on the interior perimeter.

222
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:59,547
We'll need more.
There's a million places...

223
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:03,384
...only these bikini-stuffers can go:
Backstage areas, hotel rooms...

224
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,470
We need to get somebody in there.

225
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,889
Yeah! Now I'm thinking...

226
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,807
...undercover.

227
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,476
Good idea, boss.

228
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,061
I got just the girl.

229
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,899
- Huh? Huh?
- All right.

230
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,942
That's nothing. Check this out.

231
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:23,488
Compliments of my daughter:
The "Dress Up Sally" web site.

232
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,999
What did I tell you? Hot, right?

233
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,250
Yeah, baby.

234
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,753
You got a little problem.

235
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,296
She's perfect!

236
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,672
Look to the left.

237
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,176
Down... down...

238
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,221
HART: There you go.
ERIC: "On maternity leave"?

239
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,680
That's not gonna work.

240
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:52,602
Not unless it's
"The Miss Lamaze Pageant."

241
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,318
Can you do a search?

242
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:03,363
Female field agents under 35.

243
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,793
Jensen, Jensen!

244
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:21,047
[MUMBLING AND LAUGHING]

245
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:31,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it!

246
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:43,820
Oh, no!

247
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,321
That's right, that's right!

248
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,411
You think that's good?
Check this out.

249
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,079
I got the winner right here.

250
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:54,372
Scorekeepers ready?

251
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,257
This is the best part.

252
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,097
Oh!

253
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:16,438
He's right behind me, isn't he?

254
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,565
Not really my color, is it?

255
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:20,942
Sir, we were just...

256
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,279
...looking for someone
to go undercover at the pageant.

257
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,199
And I'm the best we have.

258
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,326
It doesn't inspire much confidence.

259
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,453
Get back to work.

260
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:35,624
- Hart, shouldn't you be at a desk?
- Yes, sir.

261
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,711
You don't say anything?
Made me look like an idiot.

262
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:42,547
HART:
Do I have eyes in the back of my head?

263
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,300
- He was standing right behind me.
- What were we gonna say?

264
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:46,593
- What?
JENSEN: This one.

265
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:48,970
ERIC:
Are you kidding? It's Hart.

266
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,556
Cut it off. Let's go back to work.

267
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:56,853
Very funny.

268
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,605
Hold on. That's not bad.

269
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:03,401
Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button
because you won't see that again.

270
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:11,495
- What do you say?
- No freaking way.

271
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:12,788
Why not?

272
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,832
I won't parade around in a swimsuit
like some bimbo...

273
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,920
...named Gracie Lou Freebush,
and all she wants is world peace.

274
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,589
It wouldn't be like that.

275
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,008
You'd be on the undercover team.

276
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,094
Right. In a thong.

277
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,681
In a tasteful one-piece!

278
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,433
You do a few butt-shaping exercises...

279
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,018
...you could pull this off.

280
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,812
You know what? Pull this off.

281
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,689
Is it because McDonald hates me?

282
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:41,024
Or is it, like, a woman thing?

283
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,905
Don't kid yourself.
Nobody thinks of you that way.

284
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,287
He's punishing me, isn't he?

285
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,872
I had to beg him to let you do this.

286
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,709
That's right. Like it or not,
you screwed up, pal.

287
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,294
Sit down, sit down.

288
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:10,222
I've never been in a beauty pageant.

289
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:13,559
I don't even own a dress.
I don't even own a brush.

290
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,352
Ow, Jesus. Oh.

291
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,565
Which part of that
is supposed to shock me?

292
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,242
Let's suspend reality for a second...

293
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:31,910
...and pretend I said yes.

294
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,204
I got to do everything? Like...

295
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:37,041
...the whole big hair
and the makeup and...

296
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Damn right.

297
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,713
The spinning, the twirling, the
smiling, the cute little tap number.

298
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:45,424
Hundred bucks on Matthews.

299
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:47,968
I don't know. She's got rage.

300
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:52,014
I'll take that bet.

301
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:03,359
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah!

302
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:05,277
Yeah, baby.

303
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:08,280
So you're saying...

304
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,866
...I have to wear the bathing suit?

305
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:14,370
Yeah, you have
to wear the bathing suit.

306
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,290
Okay.

307
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,461
You go, girl.

308
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,132
Where am I gonna put my gun?

309
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,885
No place I want to know about.

310
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:33,432
What could possibly motivate anybody
to enter a beauty pageant?

311
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,935
Scholarship money,
a chance to see the world...

312
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,020
...broaden your horizons...

313
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,565
So join the Marines. It's like
feminism never even happened.

314
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:45,820
Any woman that does this is catering
to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.

315
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,114
I dated Young Miss Scarsdale.

316
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,282
Can you really be this superficial?

317
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,159
Hard to believe, right?

318
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:53,411
Here we are.

319
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,664
ERIC: Therefore, we'd like to use
one of our team undercover.

320
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,582
Am I hearing this correctly?

321
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,170
Kathy, these people want
to put one of their agents...

322
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:04,839
...in the pageant.

323
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,173
They want her to win?

324
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,050
No, ma'am.

325
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,137
We will need your help
with the judging...

326
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,681
...so our agent is in the top five...

327
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:16,851
...to have access to
all the areas at all times.

328
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:19,353
- Absolutely not.
HART: Miss Morningside...

329
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:21,774
...we understand how important
this beauty pageant...

330
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,359
Excuse me.

331
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,778
This is not a beauty pageant.

332
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,030
This is a scholarship program.

333
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,992
And it has been ever since my reign.

334
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,203
I fully intend on maintaining
that credo.

335
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,830
ERIC:
Absolutely, Miss Morningside.

336
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,666
We're here to protect the girls.
Women.

337
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,126
Scholarship ladies.

338
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,631
There's nothing more important to me
than the safety of my girls.

339
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,718
I'd rather cancel the pageant
than have them blown up.

340
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,845
Especially without their knowledge.

341
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,724
We went to the network to cancel,
but they refused.

342
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,142
We can't force them.

343
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,853
I'm confused.

344
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,897
What state is she going to be from?

345
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,065
All the winners have been chosen.

346
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,904
We recently discovered some
information about Miss New Jersey.

347
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,741
And her performance in a little
film called Arma Get It On.

348
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,910
Was that her?

349
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,536
Oh, yeah!

350
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,415
She was gonna drop out pretty soon,
if you know what I mean.

351
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,090
Do you have an agent in mind?

352
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,930
Sorry.

353
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,518
Let me get you
Victor Melling's number.

354
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,727
Frank.

355
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,521
He's our pageant consultant.

356
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,231
Frank.

357
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:43,566
Maybe he can do something to help.

358
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,776
Frank!

359
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,362
Oh! Just one minute.

360
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:51,199
This is my assistant, Frank Tobin.

361
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,243
Hi, everyone.

362
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:56,246
Would you get these people
Victor's number, please?

363
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,789
And get me a spring water.

364
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,624
And tuck in your shirt.

365
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,962
That, that was... a water for you...

366
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,463
...and...

367
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,174
Victor Melling's number.

368
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:20,144
Thank you. Thank you.

369
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,566
Mr. Melling.

370
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,817
How are you?

371
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:34,119
If you are Grace Hart,
I quit here and now.

372
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,415
I'm having a bad hair day.

373
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,084
Bad hair decade, really.

374
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,003
I'm Eric Matthews. We spoke.

375
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:44,838
Your hair is perfect.

376
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,923
However, I can't accept this job.

377
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:50,010
There's no way I can make
this woman ready in two days.

378
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,763
Please, Mr. Melling,
give it a chance. Sit down.

379
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,224
Have lunch. Totally on the Bureau.

380
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,978
I suppose that would be
the civilized thing to do.

381
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:05,358
I'll take a rain check.
I got to take care of some FBI stuff.

382
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:08,361
That thing I told you
about that I gotta do.

383
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:11,531
But I'll see you later.
We'll hang out. You like caps?

384
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,367
I'll get you an official FBI cap.

385
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,244
See you later.

386
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,455
What a pity.

387
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,541
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

388
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,752
- Yes.
- Yeah.

389
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,380
It is always "yes,"
never "yeah." Sit down.

390
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,677
Miss United States is always
well-spoken and polite.

391
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,137
Do you understand?

392
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:35,680
Watch the hands, garçon.

393
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,517
- Excuse me.
VICTOR: It's all right.

394
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,229
I have a feeling we're going to need
a drop cloth later.

395
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:56,495
VICTOR: Could I have another
cabernet sauvignon?

396
00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:58,246
Another keg for you?

397
00:26:58,665 --> 00:27:01,333
- I'm good, thanks.
VICTOR: That's okay, Philip.

398
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:05,253
So, how long have you been doing
this pageant-training thing?

399
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,421
I'm sorry?

400
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:11,426
What was the question? I was
distracted by a half-masticated cow...

401
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:14,596
...rolling around
in your wide-open trap.

402
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,598
Excuse me? What is your problem?

403
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:17,933
- Problem?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:20,727
I mean, yes.
Have I offended you in some way?

405
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:24,940
You've been completely antagonistic
to me from the second I walked in.

406
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:27,901
I was once the most
sought-after, highly paid...

407
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,237
...consultant in pageant history.

408
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,447
I had no idea.

409
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:37,452
Every season, girls would plead
with me to train them.

410
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:39,913
Ten out of 11 years...

411
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,124
...my girls were crowned.

412
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,838
The year we lost,
the winner was a deaf-mute.

413
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,756
You can't beat that.

414
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,385
Then...

415
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:53,971
...in '96...

416
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,058
...my girl froze like a puddle halfway
through her aria from La Bohème.

417
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:01,895
Afterwards, she told
a reporter from Pageant Magazine...

418
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,856
...that I was a perfectionist...

419
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:07,735
...who had harangued her
to within an inch of her sanity.

420
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:11,488
Of course,
after that article came out...

421
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,825
...nobody wanted me.

422
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,665
Okay. With all due respect here...

423
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,376
...why did Miss Morningside
suggest you?

424
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:27,337
Because I am the best.

425
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,179
Or perhaps it's because everyone else
worth having had a contestant.

426
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:39,767
They had their Southern belles,
their Midwestern farmers' daughters.

427
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:42,895
Spunky Western cowgirls.

428
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,188
And I have...

429
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,106
[CRYSTAL HUMS]

430
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:47,816
...Dirty Harriet.

431
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,616
Will you desist?

432
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,992
Yeah.

433
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,786
Yes.

434
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,459
Oh, my God.

435
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,878
I haven't seen a walk like that
since Jurassic Park.

436
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,132
It's been working really well for me
for the past 30 years, all right?

437
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:12,301
Well, glide, now. Glide.

438
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:15,387
Don't look down, don't look down.

439
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:20,142
Don't look down, look up. Your chin
should be parallel to the floor.

440
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:21,936
Now glide. Glide.

441
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,064
It's not the bloody Ice Capades.

442
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,816
Gliding.

443
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:31,070
No, no. Don't pick your feet up.
Don't pick your feet up.

444
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,822
Why are you picking your feet up?

445
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:34,824
Because I'm preparing to run away.

446
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,700
- No, wait. Wait.
- What?

447
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:37,910
Watch me.

448
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,829
Glide. Glide.

449
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,167
See? Glide.

450
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:48,087
It's all in the buttocks.
Don't I look pretty?

451
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,257
It takes a very secure man
to walk like that.

452
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,597
Roll your hips.

453
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,684
Head up, head up. Keep gliding...

454
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:01,894
I'm gliding here!

455
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,187
CABBIE:
What are you, blind?

456
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:04,772
Asshole.

457
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:42,643
VICTOR:
Look how she walks. She's floating.

458
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:46,230
Lightly ascending
from cloud to cloud...

459
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,149
...towards heaven.

460
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:52,069
He takes one look at that fake rack...

461
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,155
...he's gonna send her right back.

462
00:30:57,117 --> 00:31:00,955
Look, she's gonna cry again.
"If I only had a brain!"

463
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,626
I am somewhat less than amused.

464
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,135
How's she doing?

465
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:17,555
With some intensive work...

466
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:21,100
...she'll be ready for the world's
finest trailer park.

467
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:23,311
Thank you!

468
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:29,192
Both painful...

469
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:30,944
...and grotesque.

470
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:32,695
Isn't it?

471
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,826
Oh, my God!

472
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:52,340
Mr. Vic, we got everything
you asked for. Where do we start?

473
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,676
Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure.

474
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:56,094
Which one first?

475
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:58,638
What are you gonna do to my teeth?

476
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:02,225
VICTOR: Hopefully, remove the beer
stains and steak residue.

477
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,231
Can't I get some Novocain?

478
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:07,899
It's only a cleaning.

479
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,402
Sweeney Todd, what are you doing?

480
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,529
Your hair should make a statement.

481
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:15,615
As long as it's not,
"Thanks for the Country Music Award."

482
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,909
You'll be lucky
if I can get it untangled.

483
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,160

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,153
- Look, he had a gun.
- Of course.

803
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,030
This is Texas, everyone has a gun.

804
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,824
My florist has a gun.

805
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:13,242
I don't have a gun.

806
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:15,119
My ancestors were Quakers.

807
00:55:15,328 --> 00:55:17,287
Stan, please!

808
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:20,249
We assume any man
with a weapon is a suspect.

809
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,084
We got the DNA results.

810
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:25,421
The envelope from the Citizen
was licked by a woman.

811
00:55:25,672 --> 00:55:27,464
There's never been DNA before.

812
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,342
He slipped up, or I should say "she."

813
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,261
This is preposterous.

814
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:34,680
You people are completely clueless.

815
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,308
If I ran my pageant like this, we'd be
holding it in someone's basement!

816
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:41,645
Every operation is bound
to have its screwups.

817
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:44,314
As far as I can see,
she's still with us.

818
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:46,984
Oh, God!

819
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:50,362
Could I have a moment alone
with Miss Hart, please?

820
00:55:50,572 --> 00:55:51,697
Sure.

821
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:56,493
Just for a tiny minute.

822
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,329
We'll just be a moment.
Shop talk.

823
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:00,622
Hair, gel, mousse.

824
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:06,547
Look, I know I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

825
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,137
I've been fighting all my life
against your type.

826
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:16,348
The ones who think we're
a bunch of worthless airheads.

827
00:56:16,892 --> 00:56:18,142
You know who I mean.

828
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,727
Feminists...

829
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:21,479
...intellectuals...

830
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,813
...ugly women.

831
00:56:23,356 --> 00:56:25,733
I refuse to give in to their cynicism.

832
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:30,571
That's why I have dedicated
my entire life to this scholarship.

833
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:32,865
No one's going to ruin that.

834
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,242
Not this year.

835
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:38,662
You get in my way, I will kill you.

836
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:41,624
Do you understand?

837
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:43,751
Yeah.

838
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:45,753
- Yes!
- Yes.

839
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:56,764
KATHY:
Frank!

840
00:56:57,724 --> 00:57:02,353
The interview is the single most
important part of the pageant.

841
00:57:02,562 --> 00:57:05,272
It accounts for 30%
of your total score.

842
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,775
What's the other 70%, cleavage?

843
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:13,241
Is this your idea of doing final preps
on the convention center?

844
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:17,078
Look. Liberace's got her
in a nice evening gown.

845
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:22,041
McDonald called. He saw Hart's anti-
smoking commercial. He's on his way.

846
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:25,753
Good, perfect. I'd hate for him
to fire me over the phone.

847
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,046
I can't believe this!

848
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:28,256
It'll be ugly.

849
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:29,465
No shit.

850
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:32,301
I gotta do something.
I'm gonna go do laps.

851
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,096
We'll go over tomorrow's assignments.

852
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:36,430
You got it.

853
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,099
Hands folded...

854
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,726
...ankles crossed.

855
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,061
Neck up!

856
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,272
And remember, smile.

857
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:48,109
Smilers wear a crown,
losers wear a frown.

858
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:51,153
I would so love to hurt you right now.

859
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:53,823
As long as you smile.

860
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:55,324
Now...

861
00:57:55,826 --> 00:57:58,202
Why is New Jersey called...

862
00:57:58,495 --> 00:57:59,620
...the Garden State?

863
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:04,333
You can't fit "Oil and petrochemical
refinery state" on a license plate?

864
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:07,003
I don't appreciate your immaturity...

865
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:09,171
...when I'm working as hard as I am.

866
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:12,967
What's the big deal?
It's fixed, I'm in the top five.

867
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:15,094
Congratulations to me.

868
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:20,018
Is that enough? Have you no pride
in yourself, in your presentation?

869
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:24,230
I'm an FBI agent, right? I'm not
a performing monkey in heels.

870
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,025
You're also a person,
and an incomplete one at that!

871
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:30,862
In place of friends and relationships,
you have sarcasm and a gun.

872
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,238
Oh, I have sarcasm?

873
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:35,950
When every word that comes out of your
mouth is dripping with disdain?

874
00:58:36,243 --> 00:58:40,705
That is because I am a miserable,
grumpy elitist, and that works for me.

875
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:43,750
I don't have relationships
because I don't want them.

876
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:47,545
And I don't have friends
because I work 24-7.

877
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:51,049
And you have no idea why I am
the way that I am.

878
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,385
As we're practicing interviews,
why are you the way you are?

879
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:56,346
None of your damn business.

880
00:58:56,555 --> 00:58:59,390
The judges probably have
never heard that before.

881
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:01,559
We have more to do here.

882
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:05,521
No, we are finished.

883
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:08,274
Finished.

884
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:14,072
- Give me a 20 on Matthews.
- Be advised he's at the pool.

885
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,078
"How do you feel about gun control?"

886
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:21,788
Favorable.

887
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,677
Thought I'd let you know
I was quitting. Take care.

888
00:59:34,345 --> 00:59:36,179
Hold on. Wait a minute.

889
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,933
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you got the wrong girl.

890
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:41,184
All right?

891
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:42,519
I do not need this now.

892
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:46,439
That's what I'm saying!
I'm totally screwing up in there!

893
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:48,900
I don't feel
like a real agent anymore.

894
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,611
I mean, Vic says
this thing that's so...

895
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:55,407
I don't care what he said, you know?
I don't care.

896
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:57,117
Because I am the job...

897
00:59:57,368 --> 00:59:59,911
...and I'm okay with that.
You're the job?

898
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:02,455
Yeah, I'm the job.
We're all the job.

899
01:00:02,623 --> 01:00:04,582
Then what's wrong with me?

900
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:08,461
I date. I know everyone thinks
I haven't had a date in 10 years.

901
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:09,963
Is that what you think?

902
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,132
I think you date.

903
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:13,883
Damn right I do.

904
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:16,428
But both times it was screwed up.

905
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:19,973
I don't even care.
All I want to do...

906
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:22,058
...is my job.

907
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:25,478
For the last three days
I feel like I'm completely lost.

908
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,481
I've been waiting five years
to run my own op.

909
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,778
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl?
- You picked me...

910
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:34,948
...because I looked good
and wasn't on maternity leave.

911
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:38,160
No, that's why they let me pick you.
Know why?

912
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:40,162
- Lost a bet.
- You're smart...

913
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:44,791
...and funny and you're easy
to talk to when you're unarmed.

914
01:00:45,752 --> 01:00:48,920
Give yourself a break
and cut Vic some slack.

915
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,590
Because if they see
what I see, then...

916
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,176
...they'll love you.

917
01:00:58,181 --> 01:00:59,514
So, what do you say?

918
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:07,189
I won't let you down.

919
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:09,191
Good, that's what I want to hear.

920
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,444
In all honesty, I might let you down.

921
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:15,906
But I'll try my best not to.

922
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,619
Do not mess with the dress.

923
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:30,045
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you.

924
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:32,672
You in big trouble.

925
01:01:32,882 --> 01:01:34,510
Why? You fell.

926
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,220
- You look good wet.
- Shut up!

927
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:53,237
Whoa, guys, Hart's
in the dressing room. Come on.

928
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,573
HARRIS: You see the legs on that girl?
CLONSKY: Who's your daddy?

929
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,258
Those better be candy dishes!

930
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:15,759
Turn around.

931
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:19,596
Open.

932
01:02:21,182 --> 01:02:23,600
This guy's like an inch from death!

933
01:02:24,894 --> 01:02:27,020
AGENT:
But what a way to go!

934
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,940
- Break it up. Nothing to see.
- What do you mean?

935
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,067
She's a federal agent.
Come on.

936
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:38,240
Guess it's time to apply
at my local Hooters.

937
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:42,288
Hemorrhoid ointment? You think
the judges will look that closely?

938
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:44,623
It's for the baggies under your eyes.

939
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,000
Really?

940
01:02:47,419 --> 01:02:50,004
Good, hair spray.
Finally something I recognize.

941
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:52,506
What are you doing?

942
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:54,884
It stops the suit from riding up.

943
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:56,093
Riding up where?

944
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:58,304
Just up!

945
01:02:58,471 --> 01:02:59,513
That's enough!

946
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:01,140
Why do you make things hard?

947
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,894
I can see this is an incredibly
embarrassing situation for you.

948
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:08,564
Why does Georgia get to wear
a one-piece and I have to wear this?!

949
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:12,735
If you can do this, then you can
convince anyone that you belong here.

950
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,528
Places, everybody! Let's go!

951
01:03:14,738 --> 01:03:20,075
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts
for 15% of the total score...

952
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:23,829
...and tests the grace,
athleticism and poise...

953
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,582
...of each lovely woman.

954
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:30,669
The last time I was naked in public,
I came out of a uterus.

955
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:34,089
I don't have breasts, my thighs...
I should wear a muumuu.

956
01:03:34,299 --> 01:03:36,550
I have avoided this experience
all my life.

957
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,553
And here it is.
You must achieve a Zen-like state.

958
01:03:39,763 --> 01:03:42,348
Listen to your breathing,

01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:15,021
I think we have reason
to monitor Morningside.

1118
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:18,608
Why don't you jump on her
dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake?

1119
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,569
You're the reason I had
to drag myself down here...

1120
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:23,947
...and I don't want to hear anymore!

1121

You're absolutely right, sir.
Not another damn word.

But she's getting fired this year,
which she didn't tell us.

1124
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:35,041
You're already in enough
trouble with the review board.

1125
01:13:35,253 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant,
the only reason she won was...

1126
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:42,801
...because the winner got
food poisoning. How bizarro is that?

1127
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,261
- "Bizarro"?
- Oh! Oh!

1128
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:48,265
She threatened me. According to Mary
Jo, she has a history of violence.

1129
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:49,683
Who is Mary Jo?

1130
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,477
Are you getting your information
from a pajama party?

1131
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,062
Would you shut up?

1132
01:13:54,313 --> 01:13:56,481
You're shutting up enough
for both of us.

1133
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:57,732
- Matthews.
- Yes, sir?

1134
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:00,068
Is there any reason
to suspect Morningside?

1135
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:08,076
No, sir.

1136
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,164
There.

1137
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:16,585
I request permission to stay
with a small contingent.

1138
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:20,338
- Denied.
- Then I request permission to stay alone.

1139
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:25,010
You know what, I don't care
what you do. You want to stay, stay!

Don't look at me like I betrayed you.

1144
01:14:39,483 --> 01:14:41,445
Betrayal implies action.
You stood there.

1145
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:43,155
You got nothing to go on.

1146
01:14:43,364 --> 01:14:45,532
I know everyone thinks I'm a screwup.

But I feel like I'm in the right
place at the right time.

I have to protect those girls.
It is my job.

1149
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,041
Part of it is following orders.

1150
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:58,170
The other part is using your brain.
Throw out the rule book...

1151
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:01,381
I like the book. I like knowing
what I can and cannot do.

1152

You're not the only one who lives
for the job.

Okay, that was bad luck.

about the swimsuit competition.

Any one of these

1274
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:18,391
- Anything?
- Not even a traffic ticket.

1275
01:25:18,642 --> 01:25:23,187
Model citizen. Beauty contestant,
pageant director, loving mom.

1276
01:25:23,397 --> 01:25:25,690
- She's married?
- Widow. One son.

1277
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:28,943
A sniveling, obsequious
weasel of a human being.

1278
01:25:30,028 --> 01:25:33,155
- You know her son?
- So do you. It's Frank.

1279
01:25:33,365 --> 01:25:36,033
- Her assistant?
- Asshole Frank?

1280
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:37,203
One and the same.

1281
01:25:37,454 --> 01:25:40,456
She never mentioned anything.
Anything come up on the CCH?

1282
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:42,041
Nothing on Frank Tobin.

1283
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:44,419
There wouldn't be.
His name is Morningside.

1284
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,463
He changed it to cover
his many indiscretions.

1285
01:25:48,215 --> 01:25:49,841
Wait. How do you know that?

1286
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:53,219
I've been around this pageant
for many years.

1287
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,723
I could shock you with the intimate
details I'm privy to.

1288
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:15,241
Good job! Good job

1289
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:18,328
Keep going, everybody. Keep moving.

1290
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:23,666
Hey, hey.

1291
01:26:23,876 --> 01:26:25,335
I got you something.

1292
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,254
Oh! Oh.

1293
01:26:28,505 --> 01:26:29,589
I couldn't...

1294
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,425
You ate pizza, you stole panties,
you're wild.

1295
01:26:32,676 --> 01:26:34,677
We worked on this, remember?

1296
01:26:35,262 --> 01:26:36,596
You're gonna be great.

1297
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:46,399
- Can I see your ticket?
- Federal officer.

1298
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:48,735
I'm with him.

1299
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:54,407
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS]

1300
01:27:20,893 --> 01:27:22,602
Gentlemen, you can't go in...

1301
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,812
Victor!

1302
01:27:24,814 --> 01:27:26,147
He's with me.

1303
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,818
Wait. I'm not "with him" with him.

1304
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:31,653
Come on, muffin.

1305
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:49,172
Thank you! She certainly lit my fire.

1306
01:27:50,925 --> 01:27:53,301
Now you can wear Satan's panties!

1307
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:58,098
Oh, my God, I gotta go on!

1308
01:28:02,812 --> 01:28:04,813
- Hey, Hart.
- What are you doing here?

1309
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:08,692
I think you might have been right.
Frank is Kathy Morningside's son.

1310
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,444
Disgusting, perverted Frank?

1311
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:12,946
He cleared under another name.
I ran a new CCH.

1312
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:15,699
DUI, assault, even a weapons charge.

1313
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,284
Are we doing full deployment?

1314
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:20,162
McDonald didn't want to hear about it.
It's just us.

1315
01:28:20,997 --> 01:28:23,206
Interview set change, five minutes.

1316
01:28:23,374 --> 01:28:25,208
Good show, Mr. Tobin.

1317
01:28:26,169 --> 01:28:29,671
Get ready.
Interview set change, five minutes.

1318
01:28:33,009 --> 01:28:35,135
You're up next, New Jersey.

1319
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:36,887
I gotta get my glasses.

1320
01:28:38,556 --> 01:28:40,807
Hey! You're drinking my talent!

1321
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:43,143
You got to make it into the top five.

1322
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,061
- Can you whistle?
- No!

1323
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:47,189
- Make hand puppets?
- No!

1324
01:28:47,398 --> 01:28:49,399
I had a girl who rearranged furniture.

1325
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,110
You said all I have
is sarcasm and a gun.

1326
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:54,031
That and a right hook.

1327
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:59,828
And now, the musical stylings
of Gracie Lou Freebush.

1328
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,250
Good evening.

1329
01:29:05,502 --> 01:29:09,379
The program says I'm supposed to play
the water glasses for you...

1330
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:11,089
...but the girls got dehydrated.

1331
01:29:12,759 --> 01:29:13,884
No water glasses?

1332
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:16,720
You want me to go to a commercial?

1333
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:19,264
No, stay on her. Go with it.

1334
01:29:19,516 --> 01:29:23,894
I believe no woman should be without
a basic knowledge of self-defense.

1335
01:29:24,103 --> 01:29:28,190
So in order to show you this,
I'm gonna need a little help.

1336
01:29:28,691 --> 01:29:32,528
I would like to bring out
my assistant, Eric Bob.

1337
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:39,618
More changes?
Follow her. Stay on her.

1338
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:42,663
- How to inflict damage
with the least amount of force.

1339
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:48,627
In some cases, your attacker might
come at you in a frontal assault.

1340
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:56,969
Use the heel of your hand and thrust.

1341
01:29:57,178 --> 01:30:00,683
This will cause the nose to break
and your assailant's eyes to tear...

1342
01:30:00,892 --> 01:30:02,476
...giving you a chance to get away.

1343
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:06,730
All right. Let's say your assailant
comes at you from behind.

1344
01:30:12,195 --> 01:30:13,821
Attack me!

1345
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:15,489
Oh.

1346
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,409
Little Eric looks a little scared.

1347
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:24,081
Maybe he needs a little applause.

1348
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,625
Yeah! Eric!

1349
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:42,308
She's kicking his ass!

1350
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:46,228
LESLIE:
You were the best queen ever.

1351
01:30:46,438 --> 01:30:48,522
Thank you, that is so sweet.

1352
01:30:48,773 --> 01:30:51,358
Ladies, give Lori
some room to breathe.

1353
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:53,027
Go on, now.

1354
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:54,945
You need some powder.

1355
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:57,114
You don't have to hold
the crown all night.

1356
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:59,783
My God, that is disgraceful.

1357
01:30:59,951 --> 01:31:00,993
Frank!

1358
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:04,540
Take this to the prop master.
See if you can't get it to shine.

1359
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,753
If all else fails, go for the four
sensitive areas of the body.

1360
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:10,630
But just remember to "sing."

1361
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,757
S-l-N-G.

1362
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:18,679
Solar plexus, instep...

1363
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:20,973
...nose, groin!

1364
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:23,392
SING.

1365
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:32,234
Cue Stan.

1366
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,695
Whoa.

1367
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:37,281
Welcome to the Garden State!

1368
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:42,536
When we return, we'll find out
who those lucky final five are.

1369
01:31:44,998 --> 01:31:46,540
Let's go find Frank.

1370
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,417
Take left. I'll take this side.

1371
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,294
No, evening gown. Now.

1372
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:01,430
STAN: Ladies! In one moment,
five of you...

1373
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:03,933
...will be one step
closer to the crown.

1374
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:07,937
And one of those five...

1375
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:09,691
...is...

1376
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,319
...California!

1377
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,907
Leslie Williams is a music major.

1378
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:21,911
She believes in the healing power
of music. Loves opera, reggae...

1379
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:25,832
...and, like any true California girl,
the Beach Boys.

1380
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,710
Rhode Island!

1381
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:32,797
Cheryl Frasier is a science major.
Her field is...

1382
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:37,135
...nuclear fission with a minor
in elementary particles.

1383
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:40,388
STAN:
Nebraska!

1384
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:45,101
For Kelly Beth Kelly,
all the world is a stage.

1385
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:47,311
A theater major...

1386
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,482
...she helps run a drama program
for underprivileged children.

1387
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:53,568
New Jersey!

1388
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:58,448
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes
to become a pediatrician.

1389
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,950
Gracie, it's you. Go!

1390
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,496
KATHY: Her hobbies include
figure skating, water ballet...

1391
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:08,666
...and taking long,
luxurious bubble baths.

1392
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:12,503
You go, Gracie Lou.

1393
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:15,675
And our fifth finalist:

1394
01:33:15,885 --> 01:33:17,844
Texas!

1395
01:33:18,512 --> 01:33:21,181
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major.

1396
01:33:21,432 --> 01:33:24,684
In her spare time,
she works in a homeless shelter...

1397
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:26,478
...and eats Mexican food.

1398
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:31,900
Thank you, ladies.
You were magnificent.

1399
01:33:37,114 --> 01:33:39,199
I want all the lesbians to know...

1400
01:33:39,408 --> 01:33:41,701
...if I can make it to the top 10,
so can you!

1401
01:33:41,911 --> 01:33:43,661
Big out to Brooklyn! Yo!

1402
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:45,705
Get her off of there!

1403
01:33:45,956 --> 01:33:47,207
Go to Stan!

1404
01:33:48,209 --> 01:33:49,959
Tina, I love you, baby!

1405
01:33:50,169 --> 01:33:52,504
I love you, Karen!

1406
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:57,300
Whoo! Yeah!

1407
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:02,180
And we'll be right back with our
final five lesbians. Interviews.

1408
01:34:02,389 --> 01:34:05,517
Bumper. Commercial.
Can we say "lesbians"?

1409
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:07,310
You got a problem with that?

1410
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:12,065
In a way, America is like a big ship.

1411
01:34:12,358 --> 01:34:15,568
When we work together
and respect each other...

1412
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,404
...that's when the ship
gets safely home.

1413
01:34:19,448 --> 01:34:21,076
Terrific answer.

1414
01:34:21,327 --> 01:34:22,369
Damn it.

1415
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:26,581
New Jersey.

1416
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:29,876
As you may know,
there are many who consider...

1417
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:35,257
...the Miss United States pageant
to be outdated and antifeminist.

1418
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:37,259
What would you say to them?

1419
01:34:37,593 --> 01:34:38,927
Oh, my God.

1420
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:42,264
I would have to say,
I used to be one of them.

1421
01:34:44,475 --> 01:34:46,768
And then I came here...

1422
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:48,603
...and I realized that...

1423
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:53,358
...these women are smart,
terrific people...

1424
01:34:53,568 --> 01:34:58,113
...who are just trying to make
a difference in the world.

1425
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:01,867
We've become really good friends.

1426
01:35:02,785 --> 01:35:07,205
I know we all secretly hope the other
one will trip and fall on her face...

1427
01:35:08,124 --> 01:35:10,876
Wait a minute!
I've already done that!

1428
01:35:15,798 --> 01:35:20,010
For me, this experience has been
one of the most rewarding...

1429
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:24,139
...and liberating experiences
of my life.

1430
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:28,729
My God.

1431
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:30,606
I did it.

1432
01:35:33,818 --> 01:35:35,068
And if anyone...

1433
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,820
...anyone...

1434
01:35:37,322 --> 01:35:39,531
...tries to hurt one
of my new friends...

1435
01:35:40,074 --> 01:35:41,575
...I would take them out.

1436
01:35:42,243 --> 01:35:45,662
I would make them suffer so much,
they'd wish they were never born.

1437
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:49,833
And if they ran,
I would hunt them down.

1438
01:35:54,547 --> 01:35:55,672
Thank you, Kathy.

1439
01:36:00,803 --> 01:36:04,765
A brief, shining moment,
and then that mouth.

1440
01:36:06,267 --> 01:36:08,518
Helps if you pull it out.

1441
01:36:09,854 --> 01:36:11,855
Good luck, ladies.

1442
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:14,274
Where's the crown?
I wanted to rub it for luck.

1443
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:16,151
Frank took it to get it polished.

1444
01:36:16,361 --> 01:36:19,154
I'll have it by the time
they announce the winner.

1445
01:36:20,365 --> 01:36:21,865
My God! It's the crown!

1446
01:36:22,116 --> 01:36:24,159
Yes, it is. You can taste it now...

1447
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:25,577
No, no, no!

1448
01:36:25,787 --> 01:36:29,998
It goes Texas, Rhode Island
and New Jersey. Let's go.

1449
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,336
Not the...
This. In the...

1450
01:36:32,545 --> 01:36:34,171
SCOTT:
Finale positions.

1451
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:39,385
Yes. Wear the crown. Be the crown.
You are the crown.

1452
01:36:44,557 --> 01:36:49,895
And now, the moment
of truth and beauty.

1453
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:52,398
STAN:
The envelope, please.

1454
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:06,870
What?

1455
01:37:07,998 --> 01:37:09,915
A lot of tension.

1456
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,001
The fourth runner-up is...

1457
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:13,752
...California!

1458
01:37:22,595 --> 01:37:24,346
KATHY:
The third runner-up is...

1459
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:28,100
...Nebraska!

1460
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:38,946
- Am I in danger here?
- Wait here.

1461
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:41,449
STAN:
The second runner-up is Texas!

1462
01:37:56,423 --> 01:37:57,715
Drop it!

1463
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,592
I mean it! Drop it!

1464
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:00,885
This is it.

1465
01:38:01,094 --> 01:38:02,136
The moment.

1466
01:38:02,304 --> 01:38:06,307
One of these two ladies
will wear the crown.

1467
01:38:07,434 --> 01:38:09,310
Listen to me!

1468
01:38:09,478 --> 01:38:11,645
I'm gonna reach for my badge, slow.

1469
01:38:11,813 --> 01:38:13,689
You do, and you're dead.

1470
01:38:16,151 --> 01:38:17,485
STAN:
The first runner-up...

1471
01:38:17,736 --> 01:38:20,988
...who will have to take the winner's
place if, for any reason...

1472
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:23,199
...she cannot fulfill her duties is:

1473
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,952
New Jersey! Which means...

1474
01:38:27,162 --> 01:38:28,496
...our new Miss United States is:

1475
01:38:28,705 --> 01:38:29,789
Don't take the crown.

1476
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:31,665
Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier!

1477
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:35,961
- Don't take the crown. Trust me.
- I can't hear you. What?

1478
01:38:39,216 --> 01:38:41,967
STAN:
She reigns over all she sees

1479
01:38:42,846 --> 01:38:44,847
She's beauty and she's grace

1480
01:38:45,015 --> 01:38:49,727
She's queen of 50 states
She's elegance and taste

1481
01:38:50,354 --> 01:38:52,647
She's Miss United States

1482
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:56,734
Hold your crown up high

1483
01:38:58,779 --> 01:39:02,281
Go ahead, hold your crown up high

1484
01:39:04,827 --> 01:39:06,494
Raise it to the sky

1485
01:39:08,372 --> 01:39:09,831
Jersey's gone berserk!

1486
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:11,833
Get her off the stage!

1487
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,709
Get away! Get away!

1488
01:39:14,545 --> 01:39:16,963
STAN:
Hold your crown up high

1489
01:39:18,507 --> 01:39:21,551
Raise it to the sky

1490
01:39:22,553 --> 01:39:26,514
Hold your crown up high

1491
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:34,564
She stands for all that's good

1492
01:39:35,357 --> 01:39:38,067
She loves her neighborhood

1493
01:39:40,154 --> 01:39:43,156
She's friends with everyone she meets

1494
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:47,326
She's beauty and she's grace

1495
01:39:47,578 --> 01:39:49,706
She's queen of 50 states

1496
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:54,377
She's elegance and taste

1497
01:39:54,545 --> 01:39:57,422
She's Miss United States

1498
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,716
Hold your crown up high

1499
01:39:59,884 --> 01:40:00,925
Gracie!

1500
01:40:01,218 --> 01:40:05,722
Hold your crown up high

1501
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:28,119
She's Miss United States.

1502
01:40:30,456 --> 01:40:31,915
Okay.

1503
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:35,126
Good show, everybody.

1504
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:39,923
- I was right in the middle of my song!
- There she is!

1505
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:45,303
You got nothing on me.
This is ridiculous.

1506
01:40:45,554 --> 01:40:49,098
Where you're going, they'd love
to meet a former beauty queen.

1507
01:40:49,308 --> 01:40:51,476
When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T.

1508
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:55,482
Miss Hart, you don't understand.

1509
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:59,361
All I'm guilty of is trying to make
the world a more beautiful place.

1510
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:00,820
Look at yourself.

1511
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:04,157
When I met you, Dennis Rodman
looked better in a dress.

1512
01:41:04,408 --> 01:41:06,743
But now you're a lady! I did that.

1513
01:41:06,953 --> 01:41:11,164
Vic did that, and a team of highly
specialized federal manicurists...

1514
01:41:11,374 --> 01:41:13,875
...and people who make you beautiful.

1515
01:41:14,085 --> 01:41:15,460
Get in the car.

1516
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,587
You think you saved something.

1517
01:41:17,797 --> 01:41:22,133
All you did was to destroy the dream
of young women all over the country.

1518
01:41:22,343 --> 01:41:23,969
Their dream is to get blown up?

1519
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:26,179
You got a good shot
at that insanity plea.

1520
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:27,806
I earned it!

1521
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:30,642
Years of bitching beauty
queens and what do I get?

1522
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:34,771
Fired! They steal my life,
they steal my beauty pageant.

1523
01:41:34,981 --> 01:41:39,192
Hey! It is not a beauty pageant.
It is a scholarship program.

1524
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:40,902
Yeah, yeah.

1525
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:42,112
"Yes."

1526
01:41:47,535 --> 01:41:52,330
Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio
Women's Correctional Facility Pageant!

1527
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,920
- Get it? The Women's Correctional...
- Hey.

1528
01:42:00,216 --> 01:42:01,717
That was good work.

1529
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,429
Right back at you.

1530
01:42:08,558 --> 01:42:10,934
So, how does it feel?

1531
01:42:11,644 --> 01:42:13,520
Throwing the rule book
out of the window?

1532
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,480
Pretty good, actually.

1533
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:18,066
I was thinking...

1534
01:42:18,234 --> 01:42:19,651
...when we get back...

1535
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:23,238
...after we write up our reports
and you get all ugly again...

1536
01:42:23,656 --> 01:42:25,741
...maybe we could have dinner?

1537
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:28,410
What? You asking me out on a date?

1538
01:42:29,078 --> 01:42:30,746
No. Just a casual dinner.

1539
01:42:30,997 --> 01:42:33,915
If we happen to have sex afterwards,
so be it.

1540
01:42:37,503 --> 01:42:40,422
You think I'm gorgeous.

1541
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:43,467
You want to date me...

1542
01:42:43,676 --> 01:42:46,511
...love me and marry me.

1543
01:42:57,982 --> 01:42:59,900
ERIC:
A part of you is gonna miss this.

1544
01:43:00,109 --> 01:43:02,277
The heels.
They do something for my posture.

1545
01:43:02,528 --> 01:43:04,696
I'm suddenly very aware
and proud of my breasts.

1546
01:43:04,908 --> 01:43:07,284
- Funny, me too.
- Agent Matthews! Gracie!

1547
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:08,869
Thank God you're still here.

1548
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:10,621
There's been an emergency.

1549
01:43:10,872 --> 01:43:14,291
Somebody found some
sort of incendiary device.

1550
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:16,293
Come on, quickly!

1551
01:43:16,878 --> 01:43:17,920
Excuse me. FBI.

1552
01:43:18,088 --> 01:43:22,132
CHERYL: She saved the pageant,
she saved our lives, and here she is!

1553
01:43:25,512 --> 01:43:26,804
That's not gonna work for me.

1554
01:43:27,889 --> 01:43:29,139
I can't go up there!

1555
01:43:29,432 --> 01:43:30,766
It was his idea, Gracie Lou.

1556
01:43:30,975 --> 01:43:33,811
I'd never get you here unless
you could shoot someone.

1557
01:43:34,062 --> 01:43:35,813
You'll get yours, Henry Higgins.

1558
01:43:36,523 --> 01:43:37,564
Come on.

1559
01:43:37,774 --> 01:43:39,149
Come on!

1560
01:43:42,028 --> 01:43:47,116
Ladies and gentlemen,
agent Gracie Hart of the FBI!

1561
01:43:50,537 --> 01:43:51,829
Not so fast!

1562
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,165
Because even though
you're a federal officer...

1563
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:59,169
...to us, you will always be
Gracie Lou Freebush.

1564
01:43:59,337 --> 01:44:04,174
The nicest, sweetest,
coolest girl at the pageant...

1565
01:44:04,426 --> 01:44:07,177
...and this year's Miss Congeniality!

1566
01:44:24,197 --> 01:44:25,364
I, uh...

1567
01:44:25,782 --> 01:44:27,825
I don't know what to say.

1568
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:30,953
Except for...

1569
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:33,122
...I can't wear this at work.

1570
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:38,377
I never thought anything like
this would happen to me.

1571
01:44:38,879 --> 01:44:42,590
I kind of hoped it wouldn't.
But now that it has...

1572
01:44:43,049 --> 01:44:44,592
...I just want to say that...

1573
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:46,218
...I'm very...

1574
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:50,473
...very honored.

1575
01:44:51,975 --> 01:44:53,017
And...

1576
01:44:54,227 --> 01:44:55,227
...moved.

1577
01:44:55,896 --> 01:44:57,104
And...

1578
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:01,400
...truly touched.

1579
01:45:05,197 --> 01:45:06,363
And...

1580
01:45:13,622 --> 01:45:15,498
...I really do want world peace.
