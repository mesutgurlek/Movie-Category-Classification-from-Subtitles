00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm sorry. I can't seem
to find my purse.

2
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,556
I must have ten of them.

Can you just
ring mine first, please?

There's someone
ahead of you, sir.

00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,259
- I usually keep my change in
my little change bear, but--
- That's almost interesting.

How much is hers?

- 5.26.
-Just add it on, please.

Hold on, hold on.
If it's not in this one,
it'll be in another one.

- That'll be 9.65.
- Thank you very much.

have to do that for me.
- I didn't do it for you.

Waaah!

- Somebody call
the ''waaambulance''!
- What? What did you say?

00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,061
Governor, do you know
what the number one killer...

- No.

21
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,628
Self-pity. Governor,
I'll be more than happy
to help you out of this mess...

22

that you so willingly
seem to have stepped into.

- But you ought to do something.
- What's that?

- Stop crying.
- I'll try.

No, I mean right now.
You're giving mea headache.

Excuse me, folks,

Do y'all have any

You wanna tell me
about it?

Genetic engineering, maybe, huh?

- I'm an image consultant, okay?
- Okay.

37

So you sort of
troubleshoot for folks?

when they need revamping, right?

39
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,918
Right.

40
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,153
Hey, look,

41

I'm flying to L.A. to start
an anchor job in the local news,

42
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,626
and I do not think that it's an accident
that I'm sitting next to you.

43
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:01,469
I see.
So the cosmic purpose of our meeting
is for me to give you free advice.

44

What do I get out of it?

45

We don't know yet.
But I'll owe you.

- Quiet as the dead.

[ Sighs ]

Your hair's too big,
your brows are too dark,
your nails are too long...

00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,674
and your foundation's
too orange.

50
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,234
Your perfume's too sweet.
It's the news, honey, not the prom.

51
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,509
- I like your eyes--
- Oh. Thank you.

Bluer.
Try the tinted contacts.

53
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,487
But only when you're
anchoring or in L.A.

54

- When you're on assignment,
take them out.
- What about my accent?

55
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,289
I'm always being warned
to stop saying ''y'all.''

56
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,795
Don't ever stop saying ''y'all.''
Your ''y'all'' is your trademark.

57
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,627
Say ''y'all,'' and you'll be
promoted in six months.

58
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,759
Say ''y'all'' with a smile,
you'll be famous in 1 2.

59
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,398
Well-- [ Chuckles ]
Thank you.

You're welcome.

Now, will you please
shut up?

00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:36,401
All right, let me have him.
Hello, Your Honor. How are you?

Your Honor,
was this mannequin inflatable?

66
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,077
You know if the press--

Dodged one bullet.

gonna blow over.

[Woman] Twelve cream pies
are on their way over to the stadium.

in the owner's box at3:00.

75
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,320
Amy will meet you there.
And why are you
wearing a yellow tie?

76
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,586
Janet, how could you know
I'm wearing my yellow tie?
You can't even see me.

77
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,718
I can hear the stress
in your voice.

78
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,728
Whenever you're stressed,
you wear the yellow tie,

79
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,697
which makes you feel
all-powerful, so you're
probably gonna yell at me,

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,292
which I'm not in the mood for,
so don't.

81
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,397
- Nice tie.
- I am not stressed.

82
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,567
There is nothing wrong
with me.

83
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,304
I just didn't get enough
sleep last night. Can I
have today's work, please?

84
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,643
Take your phone off.
You're with a human now.

85
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,774
I did the ones and twos.
There's a three, a four.

86
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,321
I flagged the five in your mail.
There's an eight on
your desk to sign.

87
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,084
And there's a ten
standing in your office.

88
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,626
Why did you let him
in my office, Janet?

89
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,639
He threatened me
with a machete.

90
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,868
He's your father, Russ.

91
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,677
Wait 60 seconds
and come in and tell me
I'm late for something.

- That's a nice photo
of you and Al De Niro.

It's a nice photo of you
and Robert De Niro.

Well, it would be,
except that's Al Pacino.

So, Dad,
what can I do for you?

99
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,103
Did you get the check
I sent over this morning?

100
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,646
Yes, yes, I did.

101
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,780
But I didn't ask you
for a check.

102
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,445
I asked you to come over
and help me lift a few things.

103
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,889
[ Sighs ]
Well, time is money, Dad,

104
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,255
and my time is worth
a lot more than a mover's,

105
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,261
so I'm afraid the check
is gonna have to do.

Your sister and her family are coming
over for dinner tomorrow night.

You haven't seen your niece

- Uh, you may want some
of those things in the attic.
- Like what, Dad?

-Some more of my
childhood memorabilia?
- You never know.

How many times in the last 20 years
that you lived in that house...

00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,481
have I ever asked you
for anything, hmm?

112
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,614

Um, you're late...

Dozens of irate and
highly important people
are clamoring for you.

There is pandemonium,
I'm sure, somewhere.

And you really must go--

Besides, we're about to have
lobster in cream sauce.

133

I don't want lobster in cream sauce.
I want hot dog in mustard sauce.

Please stop biting
your nails, Amy.

I care because
you work for me.

When you bite your nails,
you're advertising weakness.

my sorry behind.

- Good luck.
- Yeah.

158
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,191
Hi. I'm Josh,
Mr. Riley's assistant.

159

- If you need anything--
- I do.

160
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,670
I need you to go up in
the bleachers and find me
a dozen 8- to 1 2-year-old kids.

161
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,609
Eight boys, four girls.
Five white, four Latino,
three black.

162

- Have 'em back here in three minutes.
- Okay.

I need to use
your Hi-8 for this one.

So why is everybody
busting my chops?

And the way
I see this thing,

166
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,781
it's just a little
misunderstanding.

167
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,621
[ Laughs ] Okay, Bob,
let me see if I can explain to you...

168
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,025
how other people
see this little thing.

169
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,188
You see,
to Joe Baseball Fan out there,

170
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,289
you're the guy that promised
you would give five percent...

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,962
of each ticket sold this season
to establishing a baseball
camp for inner-city kids.

172
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,906
You're also the guy that gave
pictures to the press of kids
actually attending this camp,

173
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,909
which, in fact,
does not exist.

174
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,913
Yet. I was intending
to get around to it, uh, eventually.

175

- Ah.
- I'm a very busy guy.

176
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,286
- [ Laughs ]
- No, Bob, you're not a busy man.

177

is a ''stoopid'' man.

A very stupid guy who only played
Mr. Charitable...

179
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,829
because you wanted to suck up
to City Council...

180
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,492
so they'd build you
a brand-new baseball park.

Bye-bye, ballpark.

to get me out of this mess?

No. The kids are gonna feed you
cream pie and get you out of this mess.

handled tastefully, okay?

- No, I promise.

- No.

by our client, Bob Riley.
- I love him.

200
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:20,227
Russ, today we shamelessly exploited
innocent children...

just to help some crook
with his cash flow problems.

Are you gonna finish
this last piece of yellow tail?

203

Russ, you should be concerned
about this. You're turning 40 in--

Thank you so much for bringing that up.
And you're not at an age--

- Yeah, I'm finished.

- What, only four? Did you get up late?
- Excuse me.

214

I'm asking Toshiya.

215
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,475
Just four times, a pattern.
It have to be five times
to be a fact.

You're right.
I shouldn't go in there.

Come on. I'll give you a boost.

that the universe
does not revolve around you.

Tell me if you think this is cute.

Oh! Look at the moon!
It's so big and round,

00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,845
and when I look at it,
I'm all perky and excited!

And no one would ever know
that I'm almost 30! Ooh!

00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,391
Cute or just stupid?

249

You know, Russ,
just when I think I've seen the worst,

250

Okay, hallucination, get out!

Am I having a nightmare?

No. You are not having
a nightmare, you see.

462
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,300
You do not exist.

I am having a nightmare, okay,
and my nervous breakdown.

464
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,770
This is my first nervous breakdown,
so I'm not quite sure
how this is supposed to go.

465
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,606
But I'm pretty sure that I'm dreaming,
you understand? Dreaming! Dreaming!

Dreaming! Dreaming! Okay?

467
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:42,285
I don't think you're dreaming
'cause you're talking
and your eye is sort of twitching.

Hey! I don't have time
to go crazy, okay?

469
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,822
So if you want me to go crazy,
you're gonna have to get on the phone...

and call Janet just like everybody else
and schedule an appointment!

Ah. Ah, good. Okay.

Hi, Janet. It's Russ.
No, no, good.

Uh-huh. Nothing. Fine.

You are just a hallucination!

You better disappear.

I'm sitting on the floor.

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,147
I'm taking
the very powerful medication.

Just waiting for it to kick in.

Do you remember when I had you sign
those confidentiality papers
at the office?

498
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,293
- Yeah.
- And do you remember me telling you...

499
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:08,229
that if you ever said anything
to anyone about anything
that happens in this company...

Yes, I, um, can.

This little boy
is me at age eight.

to make him disappear.

Figure it out, okay?

You yelled at me! That is great.

more clearly.

fell off the roof last year.

That's the bush
we fell onto.

crawled under the house.

And it had really long teeth.

really good tonight!

hanging out with Vince...

and these other creepy guys.

He threw a rock at me
and we haven't been friends since then.

- Oh, yeah.

- Why? What happened?
- Oh, those guys get together...

1226
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,812
every recess in the corner
of the playground yard...

1227
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,889
where they like
to pick on kids.

your life a nightmare!

And the worst thing
about them is they're
really mean to animals.

The fight!

It was my eighth birthday.
It was 32 years ago.

- Am I home! Is it really 1 968?

1250

No doubt about it, kid.
What time's recess?

- 1 0:30.
- Hang on, kid.

We've got 1 5 minutes
to change our life.

1253

Okay, now listen.
This is gonna happen real fast,

1254
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,983
so you gotta remember
what Kenny told you, all right:
one, two, one, two.

[Bell Ringing]

1257
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,806
Look, look, look!
There's the really big slide, remember?

1258
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,376
[Russ]
It used to be a lot bigger.

1259
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,470
Here's what I remember:

1260
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,018
Some really bad guys
tie up that three-legged dog, Tripod.

1261
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,087
When you try to stop them,
you get really thrashed.

1262
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,179
Oh, no.
Do I save him?

1263
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,418
No. You go down
after only one punch,

1264
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,551
thereby solidifying
your reputation as a loser...

1265
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,687
for the next eight years,
all the way through high school...

1266
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,527
and ruining our life
from that moment on.

1267
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:21,067
Oh, holy smokes.

1268
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:24,969
Any second now, Vince Kajinski
and his cohorts are gonna
come around that corner.

1269

- Look. There they are.
- Hey, boo!

1270
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,773
They're gonna say something to you
to get you to come over there.

1271
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:36,180
Once you get back there,
they have Tripod tied up.

to do this at all.
