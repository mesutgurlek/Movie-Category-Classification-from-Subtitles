[piano playing soft, pensive melody]

00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,879
[engine revving, tires screeching]

[chuckles]

[car horns blaring]

6
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,777
- [in French throughout]
- Outta the way!

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,864
[horns honking, tires screeching]

8
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,089
[siren approaching]

9
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,339
Here they come.

10
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,384
Philippe, 100 euros
says I can lose them.

11
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,345
- Philippe.
- You're on.

12
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,888
Here we go.

13
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,605
- [engine roaring]
- [siren blaring]

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,158
[siren continuing]

15
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,296
- You're in shape. God!
- [chuckles]

16
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,639
- [laughs]
- [tires screeching]

17
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,383
Shit!

18
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,019
Fuck!

19
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
So you lost them?

20
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,895
Get out! Hands on the hood!

21
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,606
- Get out!
- Two hundred says I get an escort.

22
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,396
You'll lose again.

23
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,109
- Two hundred, an escort!
- You're on.

24
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,819
Let's see your hands!

25
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,529
Your goddamn hands!

26
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,653
Let me explain.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,869
Shut your mouth
and put your hands on the hood!

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,032
Hold on.

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,374
- Let go!
- I said get out!

30
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,666
He can't get out!
He can't even open the door!

31
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,925
- What?
- Look at the sticker!

32
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,553
There's a wheelchair in the trunk!

33
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,089
Go and check!

34
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,677
Take a look.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,308
Let go of me.

36
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,807
Yeah.

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,517
Well?

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,057
What is this?

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,193
You think I drive that fast
for the hell of it?

40
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,194
We're heading for the hospital.

41
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,321
He's having a fit, OK.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,777
It's an emergency!

43
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
- He can't move! I'm his caregiver.
- [panting]

44
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,656
We have a problem.

45
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,530
Look.

46
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,540
[grunting]

47
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,534
What do we do?

48
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,124
[driver] Know what? Think it over.
Take your time.

49
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,666
Then call his kid and say
you killed her dad!

50
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,837
In five minutes, he'll be a goner,
dead as a dodo.

51
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,348
- So take your time.
- [grunting, coughing]

52
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,259
Go on, think it over!
While he croaks.

53
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,595
OK, get going.

54
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,731
[panting continues]

55
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,693
[engine starts]

56
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,989
[window opens]

57
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,028
- Where are you heading?
- The ER.

58
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,163
We'll escort you, it's safer.

59
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,666
We're escorting them. Let's go!

60
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,869
[panting softly]

61
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,414
- It's OK, they're splitting.
- [mutters]

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
- This is really gross, Philippe.
- [laughing]

63
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,712
Freaks me out.
How do you produce this stuff?

64
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,132
Maybe you should take
that driving test now.

65
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,552
Yes, but for now,
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

66
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,186
An escort at 200 euros.

67
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,643
I never wager such large sums.

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,268
- This calls for a change of mood.
- [turns on stereo]

69
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,061
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

70
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,357
Come on, I helped you out.

71
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,783
Philippe, the escort...
The escort, it's safer.

72
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,788
[Earth, Wind & Fire's
"September" playing over stereo]

73
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,200
We'll escort you, it's safer!

74
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,376
[singing along with song]

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,245
[song continuing]

76
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,046
- [song fades out]
- [engine revs]

77
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,381
- [laughing]
- Here he comes.

78
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,796
[panting]

79
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,091
They're bringing a stretcher.
You'll be OK?

80
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,884
- Yes, fine.
- Good luck.

81
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,052
Goodbye.

82
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,597
- [panting stops]
- [laughing]

83
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,611
What do we do now?

84
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,205
You let me handle it now.

85
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,408
[engine starts]

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,248
[piano playing soft, light melody]

87
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,187
[light melody continuing]

88
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,538
[music plays over dialogue]

89
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,892
[music fades]

90
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,477
Any references?

91
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,563
[man] Yes, I have a DAHC,

92
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,821
a Diploma in Advanced Home Care.

93
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,076
I backed it up with training
at the Bayer Institute in 2001.

94
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,202
[man 3] I studied social work at school,

95
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,786
then did a course
in social and family economics.

96
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,417
Actually, the thing is...

97
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,999
I've done more studying
than working.

98
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,714
What is your key motivation?

99
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,715
Money.

100
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,836
The man.

101
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,088
I'm totally into that.

102
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,847
That's nice.

103
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,054
Helping others, I think.

104
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,435
Is that OK? Did I get it right?

105
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,350
The neighborhood.

106
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,389
I like crippled people,

107
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,058
since I was little.

108
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,896
Working to make the handicapped
independent,

109
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,234
on a social level.

110
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,899
Sport too. You need to move.

111
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,697
To fit in with life.

112
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,238
These people can't do a thing.

113
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,033
I had
my first professional experience...

114
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,284
That was Mrs. Dupont-Moretti...

115
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,670
A very old lady...

116
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,748
...really very old...

117
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,386
...whom I cared for until the end.

118
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,423
There were fun times
in the geriatric unit

119
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,057
at Halloween and so on.

120
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,392
I'm also an expert
with bureaucracy.

121
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,352
Housing grants, for instance.

122
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,108
I don't know. Maybe...

123
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,602
...you get one?

124
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,772
Check, Magalie,
but somehow I doubt it.

125
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,749
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

126
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:16,908
Enough.

127
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,661
- I'm Laprade.
- I'm sick of waiting.

128
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,918
[Magalie] Hello.

129
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,424
I need a signature.

130
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,638
Have a seat.

131
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,605
Any references?

132
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,733
- I have plenty.
- All right.

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,567
We're listening.

134
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,525
Kool and the Gang,
Earth, Wind & Fire.

135
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,239
Good references?

136
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,526
I don't know them. Sit down.

137
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,280
You know nothing about music.

138
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,369
I'm no ignoramus
when it comes to music

139
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,580
even if I don't know Cruel...

140
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,744
- Kool and the Gang.
- And you?

141
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,505
Do you know Chopin,
Schubert or Berlioz?

142
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,757
Do I know Berlioz?

143
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,927
I bet you don't!

144
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,216
I'm a specialist.

145
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
Uh yeah?

146
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,800
Who do you know there?

147
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,468
Which building?

148
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,474
What do you mean?

149
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,265
Before becoming a housing project,

150
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,232
Berlioz was a 19th century composer,
writer and critic.

151
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,490
Bullshit. I know who Berlioz is.
Humor's like music for you.

152
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,784
You suck at both.

153
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,623
You need a signature?

154
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,710
Yeah, to say
I applied for the job...

155
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,004
...but that despite
my obvious qualities...

156
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,592
Just put the usual spiel
about not being interested.

157
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,424
I need three refusals
to get the benefit.

158
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,684
I see, your benefit.

159
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,561
- Any other motivations?
- Yes, plenty.

160
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,684
One right here.
Very motivating in fact.

161
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,738
OK, I'm having a blast,
but what do we do?

162
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,989
Sign or not?

163
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,442
I can't sign right now.

164
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,778
- Why not?
- Why not?

165
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,875
That's a bummer.

166
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,882
I'm already late handing it in.

167

00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,239
Will you manage?

335
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,991
Of course he will.

336
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,785
My feet are beautifully coiffed.

337
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,364
Go and have lunch, Marcelle.

338
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,371
Where's the skirt?

339
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,997
They're support stockings.
They help the blood to flow properly

340
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,380
so I don't faint.

341
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,674
I'm not doing that.

342
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,222
There's a problem here.

343
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,721
Seeing as how I won't be doing it,

344
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,262
we need to see if...
Marcelle!

345
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,150
Maybe Marcelle could come back
to put them on you.

346
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,278
She knows how to do it,
being a chick and all that...

347
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,781
I'm just not doing it, OK.

348
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,657
You're better off fainting.

349
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,409
I mean, sometimes...

350
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,404
We just refuse to put them on.
We're men.

351
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,788
No way, Marcelle!

352
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,301
You're good with stockings.

353
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,304
Only natural with that cute earring.

354
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,304
- Can we cut the joking?
- [chuckles]

355
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,310
You're a natural at this.

356
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,722
Haven't you ever considered work...

357
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,641
...as a beautician?

358
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,606
[laughs]

359
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,313
OK, that's done.

360
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,948
What are the gloves for?

361
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,453
Let's wait a while.
You're not quite ready for that yet.

362
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,326
[Marcelle] No, he's not quite ready.

363
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,912
What do you mean,
not ready for what?

364
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,331
- What is this?
- We'll explain.

365
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,419
We need to talk, Marcelle!
This training's not working.

366
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,466
Ready or not,

367
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,469
I'm not emptying the ass
of a guy I don't know.

368
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,089
Or even of a guy I do know.

369
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,054
I don't empty anyone's ass,
on principle.

370
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,516
Can I finish eating first?

371
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,477
No.

372
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,980
Let's just leave it at this.

373
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,615
I don't go for this sick stuff.

374
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,744
The stockings were bad enough.

375
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,779
But I met you part way.

376
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,325
Your turn.
Drop the ass emptying.

377
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,868
- I get the message.
- It's wrong.

378
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,377
Just drop it.

379
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,708
Enjoy your lunch.

Beautiful, huh?

382
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,346
I love it.

383
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,391
[Driss] Don't mind me.

384
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,107
You're not at the movies,
I'm eating here.

385
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,603
Hi. Where can I find a beer?

386
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,488
Maybe in your wig.

387
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,398
[laughs]

388
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,284
- You took both packs?
- No idea. I don't care.

389
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,742
- Take your mop-head for a walk.
- Let's go.

390
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,249
- He's the guy my dad hired.
- Oh, right.

391
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,831
The guy has a name.

392
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,624
[I Donny E. Hathaway: "The Ghetto"]

393

- What?
- Sorry.

- What's going on?
- Nothing.

- You're sure?
- Yeah.

[muttering] Fucking weird.

398

Have you finished playing?

399
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,099
You can't feel a thing?

400
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,810
Have you gone mad?!

401
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,470
He's experimenting.

- You'll burn him!

Lawyer.

406

No. That's personal.
I'll read it later.

407
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,911
[Driss] The "personal" file?

OK.

She's not bad.

It's nearly nine. Philippe's waiting.

That's the punch line, see.

498
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,834
But in your case...

499
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,126
Come on.

500
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,134
- It's wicked.
- It's a good joke.

501
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,008
You got no hands, Philippe.

502
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,020
I'll tell it to Marge Simpson.

503
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,523
[woman] I was wrong about the price.

504
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,777
Ah, voilà.

505
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,859
It's 41,500 euros.

506
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,947
I'll take it.

507
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,741
You will?

508
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,494
[children shouting playfully]

509
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,964
Hi, Philippe.
How are you doing?

510
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,175
You summoned me, so here I am.

511
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,547
I'm listening.

512
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,512
What's so urgent?

513
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,973
I didn't summon you.

514
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,106
You must have some idea
why I'm here.

515
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,067
Who is this fellow?

516
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,354
Everyone's worried.

517
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,857
Yvonne tells me
he's reckless, violent...

518
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,276
He hit a neighbor?

519
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,951
I don't need to tell you
you have to be vigilant.

520
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,957
Don't let just anyone
into your home,

521
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,789
especially not in your state.

522
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:26,004
I'm not really sure
you know whom you're dealing with.

523
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,381
Carry on.

524
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,298
I called Sivot
at the Justice Ministry.

525
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,467
The boy isn't Al Capone,

526
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,762
but young Driss has a record.

527
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,022
He just did six months for robbery.

528
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,980
On top of the rest...

529
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,904
...I'm told he's useless.

530
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,235
Be careful.

531
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,616
These street guys have no pity.

532
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,035
[Philippe] That's it exactly.

533
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,493
That's what I want. No pity.

534
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,827
He often hands me the phone
because he forgets.

535
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,752
True, he isn't compassionate.

536
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,129
But he's strong, with arms and legs.

537
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,170
His brain works, he's healthy.

538
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,931
So, all the rest,
given my state, as you call it,

539
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,764
his background and so on,
I don't give a shit.

540
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,762
As you wish.

541
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,395
Will that be all?

542
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,105
Magalie...

543
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,778
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

544
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,069
I want to show you something.

545
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,945
What is it?

546
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,285
Chill, you can always say no.

547
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,666
[Magalie] One minute then.

548
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,957
$0?

549
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,421
So I have a bathtub.

550
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,627
That's all.

551
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,089
Very interesting.

552
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,723
- And...
- We could take a bath.

553
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,471
There's plenty of room.

554
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,977
I have bath salts and foam.

555
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,063
OK.

556
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,398
Why not?

557
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,230
Yeah. Why not?

558
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,734
Go on then, get undressed.

559
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,120
Look at you!
The saucy kind. I like it.

560
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,577
OK, I'll get undressed.

561
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,077
[chuckles]

562
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,460
What?

563
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,122
Where are you going?

564
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,586
You said yes!

565
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,963
Just a quick rinse!

566
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,298
What's with you?

567
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,435
I'm always tense
when the mail arrives.

568
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,850
As Apollinaire said:

569
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:50,895
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter from you..."

570
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,903
Slower, you're losing me.

571
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,157
I'm at "As Apollinaire said:"

572
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,785
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter..."

573
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,287
[conversation continues
over baby monitor]

574
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,246
You may not realize,
but this is private.

575
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,913
- No, I didn't realize.
- Give me that.

576
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,876
Only if you explain.

577
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,041
There's nothing to explain.

578
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,176
He writes letters.

579
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,924
Letters?

580
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,053
Who to?

581
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,931
Usually to women.

582
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,181
Come on, who?

583
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,766
One in particular. Eléonore.

584
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,227
Who? We've never seen her.

585
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,857
How come?

586
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,734
It's an epistolary relationship.

587
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,652
Meaning they write to each other.
They correspond solely by mail.

588
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,445
No need to spell it out.

589
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,408
The blue envelopes?

590
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,079
He's hot stuff.

591
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,793
He epistles.

592
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,750
How about you?

593
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,628
No lover in sight?

594
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,097
Albert the gardener, say?

595
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,508
Certainly not!

596
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,224
I've seen the longing looks
he gives you.

597
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,764
Am I wrong? Yes or no?

598
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,353
Stop it, it's ridiculous.

599
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,814
Has he slipped it to you?

600
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,729
- What?
- His little cucumber.

601
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,737
What?

602
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,203
- I must be dreaming.
- [high-pitched voice] Albert, Albert.

603
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,497
- He will soon.
- No!

604
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,657
He will soon.

605

- Oh?

- Are you OK?
- [thunder rolling]

It's all right.

616
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,350
Calm down.

[muffled] Philippe. Philippe.

Take it easy.
Try to breathe slowly.

You're with me.

620
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,969
Take it easy.

I need air!

631
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,372
Shit!

632
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,592
[Philippe] It's good to breathe.

633
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,088
What time is it?

634
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,177
[Driss] I don't know. Around 4:00 a.m.

635
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,886
[Philippe] It's ages
since I saw Paris by night.

636
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,764
[Driss] What happened?

637
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,557
[Philippe] The medication
has its limits.

638
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,440
Doctors call them phantom pains.

639
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,780
I feel like a frozen steak
tossed onto a red-hot griddle.

640
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,201
I feel nothing but suffer anyway.

641
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,498
Surely something could help.

642
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,545
That could.

643
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,756
[giggling]

644
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:12,220
We're all sick for that,
me worse than you probably.

645
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,522
I wanted to ask you...
With women...

646
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,727
How do you manage?

647
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,859
You adapt.

648
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,362
So can you do it or not?

649
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,194
You may not realize,

650
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,906
but I feel nothing
from my neck to my toes.

651
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,203
So you can't.

652
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,374
It's not that simple.

653
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,377
I can, but it's not my decision.

654
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,709
And you can find pleasure elsewhere.

655
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,872
Yeah?

656
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,291
You've no idea.

657
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,552
You're right. How, for example?

658
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,796
For example, the ears.

659
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,887
The ears?

660
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,395
The ears are a highly sensitive
erogenous zone.

661
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,522
You get your ears licked?

662
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,602
I'd never have guessed.

00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,957
- Try this. It'll help.
- What is this crap?

666
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,051
It can't hurt you.

667
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,511
Drag on it.

668
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,887
Go on, drag on it.

669
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,138
[coughing]

670
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,346
Take it easy. Share it.

671
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,594
[Philippe] Again.

672
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,395
One more time.

673
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,935
That's enough for now.

674
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,819
Sorry, but you really get off
with your ears?

675
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,952
If your ears are red,
that means you're turned on?

676
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,578
Exactly.

677
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,581
Sometimes they're hard when I wake.

678
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,456
- Both of them?
- Yes!

679
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,252
I met my wife Alice
when we were students.

680
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,383
She was tall, very elegant,

681
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,842
with laughing eyes.

682
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,259
Is she the blond in the photos?

683
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:20,889
She's not bad.

684
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,396
What we had was incredible.

685
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,977
I hope you experience that one day.

686
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,898
Fuck, I loved her so much!
I loved her so much.

687
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,452
Then she got pregnant.

688
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,368
Five successive miscarriages.

689
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,634
Then the verdict came in.
An incurable, terminal illness.

690
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,632
We decided to adopt.

691
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,768
Waiter!

692
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,649
Excuse me!

693
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,777
Excuse me!

694
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,196
Yes?

695
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,367
A tarte tatin, please.

696
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,335
Cooked.
The chocolate cake was raw.

697
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,547
It was all squashy and gooey.
Weird.

698
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,759
That's what molten cake is.

699
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,673
- So that's why.
- Yes.

700
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,763
I'll have a tarte tatin anyway.

701
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,269
I've always loved competition,

702
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,556
extreme sports, speed.

703
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,770
Going faster, higher.

704
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,235
A paraglider gave me that.

705
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,819
I was high in the sky,
looking down at things, breathing.

706
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,825
I was raised to think
we pissed on the world.

707
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,946
Some water. My mouth's dry.

708
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,913
The joint does that.

709
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,213
And what else?

710
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,671
Makes you hungry
and chatty.

711
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,720
But bad weather can be fatal
when paragliding.

712
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,602
And you flew anyway?

713
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,732
Yes, maybe to suffer like Alice.
I knew she'd never recover.

714
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,734
I broke the third and fourth vertebrae.
Now only fly in my mind.

715
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,571
When the pain eases,
I have my thoughts.

716
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,738
My real handicap
isn't being in a chair.

717
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,664
It's living without her.

718
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,041
What do the doctors say?

719
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,802
With the advances in medicine,
they'll keep me going to 70

720
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,634
with massages and pick-me-ups.

721
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,892
It's expensive,
but I'm a rich invalid.

722
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,893
[laughs]

723
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,771
I'd have shot myself.

724
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,683
That's not easy in my condition.

725
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,772
True.

726
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,151
That sucks. [laughs]

727
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,032
What's the date today?

728
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,613
The eighth or the ninth.

729
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,198
It's official then.

730
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,742
What is?

731
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,406
You've won your bet.

732
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,791
Your trial period's over.

733
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,076
I'm hired then?

734
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,041
Yes, you're hired.

735
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,955
Can I count on you now?

736
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,999
- Yes.
- Good.

737
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,793
Start by giving my Fabergé egg back.

738
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,264
Alice gave me one each year.

739
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,222
I have 25, one for each year
we were together.

740
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,311
I cherish it.

741
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,816
I don't know why you...
Wasn't me.

742
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,818
What did you lose again?

743
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,443
[children chattering]

744
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
[Driss] Mina!

745
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,492
Mina!

746
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,839
- What's up?
- Get in.

747
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,921
Buckle up.

748
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,722
How's it going?

749
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,317
How's school?

750
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,530
Why don't you text me back?

751
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,779
I was busy.

752
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,285
Let's hear it.
Who called?

753
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,625
A cop, to talk to Mom.
I put on a deep voice

754
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,334
and said we'd go.

755
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,169
Found my 999?

756
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,424
Have you found it?

757
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,639
Screw your stone egg.
I haven't found it.

758
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,486
What did you say?

759
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,398
What could I say?

760
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,908
I only had 30 grams on me.

761
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,321
For that you get a spell in custody,
then it's bye-bye.

762
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,034
Let's get a kebab.

763
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,621
I'm not getting in that!

764
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,784
Let go of me.

765
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,873
Where are you going?

766
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,538
Who's driving you?

767
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,796
Get lost!

768
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,503
It's not your business.

769
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,130
Piss off!

770
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,893
- [car door shuts, drives off]
- Fuck!

771
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,982
"Her shining eyes
are made of charming minerals

772
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,942
and in this strange,
symbolic world..."

773
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,491
"And in this strange...

774
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,577
...symbolic...

...world..."

776
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,615
Fucking boring!

777
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,749
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

778
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,464
Is that with an or a "y"?

779
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,966
This is killing my mind.

780
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,174
"Sphinx" is with an "I."

781
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,338
Why bother with this crap?

782
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,259
Sphinxes, daisies, angels...

783
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,723
You'd go for this stuff?

784
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,855
True, one could be more direct.

785
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,318
"And ancient sphinx..." Go on.

786
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,149
What's she look like?

787
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,940
I don't know.
That's not what matters.

788
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,453
It's intellectual and emotional,
not physical.

789
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,454
I want a mind-to-mind relationship.

790
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,413
If she's a troll,
it'll be mind-to-troll!

791
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,753
Very subtle. Really.

792
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,539
What can I say?

793
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,254
Bravo.

794
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,339
How long's it been going on?

795
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,262
[sighs]

796
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,926
[Philippe] Please.

797
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:19,683
Six months.

798
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,313
Six months?

799
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,725
And you've never seen her?

800
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,316
Maybe she's fat and ugly.
Or handicapped.

801
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,823
At the end of the poem
put "How's your weight?"

802
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,574
Thank you very much
for your sound advice, Driss.

803
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,447
Let's carry on. Where was I?

804
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,747
A sphinx was eating daisies
with an angel,

805
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,833
then running and doing stuff.

806
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:49,918
Let me see...
"In this strange, symbolic world..."

807
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:54,097
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

808
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,255
Call her!

809
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,890
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

810
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,345
Call her, OK!

811
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,725
I can get more across
with the written word, OK?

812
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,689
He's incredible.

813
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,572
I'm going to find her number.
This is stressing me out.

814
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,987
[Philippe] on!

815
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,697
Dunkirk. That's bad.

816
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,283
Put that down.

817
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,166
No beauty queens there.
Only trolls.

818
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,951
Put that down right now.

819
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,918
Her number's here.
That means she wants you to call!

820
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,957
Put it down, please!

821
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,001
She wrote her number here.

822
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,011
That means:
"Call me, I'll lick your ear."

823
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,840
What's he doing?
Don't call her.

824
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,350
Enough poetry after six months.

825
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,434
He's totally crazy!
I won't speak to her.

826
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,440
I bet she has an accent.
They talk weird up there.

827
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,976
Hang HP!

828
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,238
"I want my Philippe."
She's gonna get him.

829
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,522

- How's this?
- No good. Too traditional.

Traditional or trendy?

1193

Yeah. What's up?

You said a bad thing to Elisa.

If I passed him on the street,

I'd know he was your brother.

...aren't my parents.

1393
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,109
They're my uncle and aunt.

1394
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,575
They fetched me from Senegal
when I was eight.

1395
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:08,166
They couldn't have kids
but a brother had loads.

1396
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,168
They picked the oldest.

1397
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,295
Me.

1398
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,167
My name's Bakary.

1399
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,677
That's my real name.

1400
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,048
But other kids had that name
so they called me Idriss

1401
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,092
and that became Driss.

1402
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,057
And afterwards?

1403
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,474
Out of the blue,
my mother... my aunt

1404
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,063
got pregnant once
and then twice.

1405
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,065
Then my uncle died.

1406

Other men, other kids.

doesn't he need setting straight?

1409

He came to get you, right?

1410

Driss...

1411
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,599
