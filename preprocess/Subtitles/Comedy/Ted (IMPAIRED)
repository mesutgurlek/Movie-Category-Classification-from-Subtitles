Uh-huh. Okay, all right.

to me like that before.

I'm sorry to bother you

626
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:56,499

but admire your teddy bear.

Oh, thank you.

629
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,507
I have to say, I've been following
you ever since I was a young boy

630
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,344
and I remember seeing you
on the Carson show.

631
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,846
You were just wonderful.

632
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,348
Oh, yeah, that was
a weird interview.

633
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,852
Ed thought I was ALF, and he kept
muttering anti-Semitic comments.

634
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,979
He thought ALF was
Jewish for some reason.

635
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,730
Have you ever considered
selling the bear?

636
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,023
What?
Excuse me?

637
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:22,316
I want it.

638
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,652
I'm not an "it," pal.
I'm a "he," all right?

639
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,155
I'm sorry, little guy,
but my bear isn't for sale.

640
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,115
See, I've had him
since I was about your age.

641
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,908
He's very, very
special to me.

642
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,244
Stand up straight when
you're talking to me.

643
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,288
Why the fuck
would he say that?

644
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,374
Sorry, you really shouldn't
swear in front of children.

645

00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,737
Hey.

1213
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:52,071
Hey, Guy.

1214
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,698
What's going on?

1215
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,035
This is Jared. He's the
guy who beat me up.

1216
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:58,953
And we're in love.

1217
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:00,913
Huh?

1218
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:03,833
Turns out I'm gay,
or whatever.

1219
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,668
I had no idea.

1220
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:10,048
Hey, Jared, let's go grab
another one of these.

00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,514
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

1224
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:21,642
Give it a couple of hours.
You'll be golden, Ponyboy.

1225
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:23,436
You want a Xanax?

1226
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,230
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1227
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:27,315

1228
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,151
I got to go.

1229
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:39,243
Lori, I...

1230
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,829
Lori!

1231
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:46,000
Lori, wait, please.

1232
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:48,753
Look, I'm sorry,
I messed up...

1233
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,713
John, I need you out of
the apartment tonight.

1234
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,590
Can I... Just give
me the car keys.

1235
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,550
Can I please just explain? No.

1236
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:55,760
Look, I was...

1237
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,262
I have given up a huge
chunk of my life for you.

1238
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,057
I was going to stop in for like five
minutes and then Flash Gordon...

1239
01:00:01,224 --> 01:00:03,184
Just give me
the car keys.

1240
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:14,821

1241
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,739
Lori, please, I love you.

1242
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:33,256
Johnny, there you are.
I had to get some air.

1243
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,424
That guy from your office
is in there on the couch

1244
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:37,635
making out with that
Van Wilder-looking guy.

1245
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,887
You know what? Fuck you. I don't
even want to talk to you.

1246
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:41,806
What?

1247
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:44,142
Do you know
what just happened?

1248
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,602
Do you have any clue?
My fucking life just ended!

1249
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,813
Come on.
She'll go home,

1250
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,898
she'll watch Bridget
Jones-something-asshole.

1251
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:53,192
She'll have a good cry, she'll be fine.
You'll talk to her tomorrow.

1252
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,027
Come on upstairs. Are you
even listening to me?

1253
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,238
Do you give any
shred of a shit?

1254
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,158
Of course I do, Johnny.

1255
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,118
"Thunder buddies
for life," remember?

1256
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,787
Jesus! Lori was right.

1257
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:07,248
I should have stopped hanging
out with you a long time ago.

1258
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:09,333
I'm never going to have
a life with you around.

1259
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,961
I'm 35 years old
and I'm going nowhere.

1260
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:15,506
All I do is smoke pot and watch
movies with a teddy-fucking-bear.

1261
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,092
Because of that, I just
lost the love of my life.

1262
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,219
Johnny, I'm...

1263
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:21,512
I'm sorry.

1264
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,015
I gotta be on my own, Ted.
I can't see you any more.

1265
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,853
John, wait. Listen.

1267
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,043
So, word through the
grapevine is that you're

1268
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,253
newly solo.

1269
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,380
Rex, I have a lot of
work I need to get to.

1270
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:40,800
I have tickets to Norah Jones
at the Hatch Shell tonight

1271
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,511
and I would love it
if you would go with me.

1272
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:46,806
You're asking me out a week
after I broke up with somebody?

1273
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:49,433
Look, I'm going to
cut the shit, here.

1274
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:50,518
Please.

1275
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,146
This is the first time
that you've been single

1276
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,731
in all the years
you've worked here.

1277
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,985
Just go out with me
one time.

1278
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:00,778
And if you're miserable
and you hate it

1279
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:05,199
then I promise I will never
even hint at the subject again.

1280
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:07,743
Please.

1281
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,453
Rex, I don't think
it's smart.

1282
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,706
I'm an asshole,
I know that.

1283
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:13,124
It worked for me
in high school,

1284
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:14,709
and it's been
a reflex ever since.

1285
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,336
Lori,
the worst that can happen

1286
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:20,172
is that you go on
a fun, casual date

1287
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:22,300
with a guy who
just wants a chance

1288
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:25,886
to prove that he can be
something more than a jerk.

1289
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,306
Plus, you are a huge catch.

1290
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,433
And it's about time someone
treated you that way.

<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> Fuck it. Fine.

Fine. It sure as hell beats crying
myself to sleep every night.

1293
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:39,358
And if that means
getting you off my back,

1294
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:40,776
well, that's just a bonus.

1295
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,320

I saw Lori leaving
the apartment with Rex.

What?

1306
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,147
I'm serious, John.
I went over to talk to her

1307
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,857
and maybe take some
of the heat off you.

1308
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,317
And there he was,
picking her up.

1309
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,735
They were going
to the Hatch Shell.

1310
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:24,820
You're fucking unbelievable,
you know that?

1311
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,489
How stupid
do you think I am?

1312
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:28,074
If you think that by
making shit like that up

1313
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:30,117
you're going to make me choose
some kind of loyalty to you

over her you're out
of your fucking mind.

1315
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,621
Johnny, it's the truth,
I'm telling you.

1316
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,623
You know what?
Get out of here.

1317

Yes, you are.

1320
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,756
So shut your meat hole for
a second and listen to me.

Huh?
Meat hole? What?

Is that what they say?

No, it can't be
that either.

I wanted you to come because
you're supposedly my best friend.

You can't stand there

when you were 10,

with your BB gun?

And then when we saw
it fall from the tree,

1375
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:03,205
we both started crying,
you remember?

1376
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:04,707
And then we ran up to it

1377
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:09,003
and we tried to give it CPR,
and it came back to life.

than life itself.

want to end on good terms.

You know, Ted,
when I was a little boy,

1555
01:19:08,036 --> 01:19:10,247
I saw you on television.

1556
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:11,873
And I thought you were
the most amazing,

1557
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,626
most wonderful thing
I'd ever seen. Ever.

1558
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:20,423
And I asked my dad if I could have
a magical little teddy bear, too.

1559
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:21,925
And he said, "No."

Can you just email me
the rest of this story?

1561
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:26,930
And I was so heartbroken.

1562
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:30,433
And I promised myself that
if I ever had a son,

1563
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,689
I would never,
ever, ever say no to him.

Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every
once in a while wouldn't hurt.

Me and Ted are going
