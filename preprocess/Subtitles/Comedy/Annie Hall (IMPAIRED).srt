1
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:01,435
There's an old joke. Two elderly women
are at a Catskill Mountain resort.

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,022
One of 'em says, "The food
at this place is really terrible."

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,692
The other one says,
"Yeah, I know. And such small portions."

4
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,403
That's essentially
how I feel about life.

5
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,449
Full of loneliness and misery
and suffering and unhappiness.

6
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,785
And it's all over much too quickly.

7
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:23,165
The other important joke for me is one
that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx.

8
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,878
I think it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.

9
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,382
It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing.
I would never wanna belong to any club...

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,219
...that would have
someone like me for a member.

11
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,681
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

12
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,435
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind.

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,106
Cos I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,276
I'm not worried about ageing.
Although I'm balding slightly on top.

15
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,987
That's about the worst
you can say about me.

16
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,406
I think I'm gonna get better
as I get older.

17
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,159
I think I'm gonna be
the balding virile type,...

18
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,122
...as opposed to, say,
the distinguished grey, for instance.

19
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,584
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth,...

20
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,838
...who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag,...

21
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,006
...screaming about socialism.

22
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,969
Annie and I broke up.
And I still can't get my mind around that.

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,181
I keep sifting the pieces of
the relationship through my mind,...

24
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,019
...examining my life, and trying to
figure out - where did the screwup come?

25
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,897
A year ago we were... in love, you know.

26
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,902
And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,779
I... I, uh... You know...

28
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,282
I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.

29
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,577
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War II.

30
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,039
He's been depressed.
All of a sudden he can't do anything.

31
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,418
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?
- Tell Dr Flicker.

32
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,587
It's something he read.

33
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,672
Something he read, uh?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,301
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

35
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:02,181
The universe is everything. If it's
expanding, someday it will break apart...

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,725
..and that will be the end of everything.

37
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,894
What is that your business?

38
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,062
He stopped doing his homework.

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,900
- What's the point?
- What has the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,361
You're here in Brooklyn!
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,073
It won't be expanding
for billions of years yet, Alvy.

42
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,119
And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here, uh?

43
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,371
Uh? Uh? (laughs)

44
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,128
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories.

45
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,048
But I was brought up
under the roller coaster...

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,675
..in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.

47
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,721
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

48
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,098
I have a hyperactive imagination.

49
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,643
My mind tends to jump around a little.

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,063
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,774
My father ran the bumper car concession.

52
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,275
There he is.

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,777
And there I am.

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,989
I used to get my aggression out
through those cars all the time.

55
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,661
I remember the staff at our public school.

56
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,789
We had a saying:
"Those who can't do, teach,...

57
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,500
..and those who can't teach, teach gym."

58
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,421
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,135
I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

60
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,846
Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face.

61
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,475
And Henrietta Farrell.
Just Miss Perfect all the time.

62
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,937
And Ivan Ackerman.
Always the wrong answer. Always.

63
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,189
Seven and three is nine.

64
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,359
Even then, I knew they were just jerks.

65
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,779
In 1942 I had already discovered women.

66
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,616
Ugh! He kissed me!

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,493
He kissed me! Ugh!

68
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,372
That's the second time this month!
Step up here! Step up here!

69
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,375
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

70
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,753
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

71
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,299
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,425
I did.

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,429
For God's sakes, Alvy!
Even Freud speaks of a latency period.

74
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,765
Well, I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

75
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,562
Why couldn't you have been more like
Donald? Now there was a model boy.

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,064
Tell the folks where you are today.

77
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,484
I run a profitable dress company.

78
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,196
Sometimes I wonder
where my classmates are today.

79
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,492
I'm president of
the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

80
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,245
I sell tallises.

81
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,833
I used to be a heroin addict.
Now I'm a methadone addict.

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,837
I'm into leather.

83
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,759
I lost track of most of my schoolmates,
but I wound up a comedian.

84
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,972
They did not take me in the army.
I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P.

85
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,142
In the event of war, I'm a hostage.

86
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,144
(laughter)

87
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,772
You always only saw the worst in people.

88
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,900
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

89
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,611
You were always out of step
with the world.

90
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,323
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

91
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,910
(Alvy) I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

92
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,286
(Rob) You're crazy.

93
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,956
(Alvy) We were walking off
the tennis court. Him and me and his wife.

94
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:19,378
He looked at her and they both looked at
me. And under his breath he said, "Jew."

95
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,546
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

96
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,132
(Alvy) I pick up on those kinda things.

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,720
I was having lunch with some guys from
NBC. So I said, "Did you eat yet or what?"

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,139
And Tom Christie said, "No. D'you?"

99
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,642
Not "Did you". "D'you eat?" "D'you?"

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,229
Not "Did you eat?" but "D'you eat?"
"Jew?" You get it? "Jew eat?"

101
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,356
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

102
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:44,277
Why, Max? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

103
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:49,658
(Alvy) I was in a record store. There's
this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy,...

104
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,663
..looking at me in a funny way and saying,
"We have a sale this week on Wagner."

105
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,479
Wagner, Max. Wagner.
I know what he's really

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,127
trying to tell me,
very significantly.

107
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,170
Right, Max.

108
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,214
California, Max.

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,300
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

110
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,429
We move to sunny LA.
All of show business is there.

111
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,683
No. I don't wanna live in a city
where the only cultural advantage...

112
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,686
...is that you can make
a right turn on a red light.

113
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,605
Forget it.
Aren't you late for meeting Annie?

114
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,942
I'm meeting her at the Beekman.
I have a few minutes.

115
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,919
Are you on television?

116
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,131
No.

117
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,217
Yeah. Once in a while. Occasionally.

118
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,263
- What's your name?
- You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter.

119
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,683
You were on the... uh...
The Johnny Carson, right?

120
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,436
Once in a while, you know.

121
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,605
What's your name?

122
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,024
I'm... I'm Robert Redford.

123
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,193
Come on!

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,863
Alvy Singer. It was nice...
Thanks very much for everything.

125
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,323
Hey!

126
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,991
(man) What?

127
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,076
This is Alvy Singer!

128
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,037
Fellas, you know...

129
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,081
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer? Am I right?

130
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,792
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

131
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,961
I need a large polo mallet.

132
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,131
- Who's on television?
- On The Johnny Carson Show.

133
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,300
Is this a meeting of the Teamsters?

134
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,136
- What programme?
- Can I have your autograph?

135
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,015
- You don't want my autograph.
- No, I do. It's for my girlfriend.

136
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,184
Make it out to Ralph.

137
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,021
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brudder.

138
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,944
- Alvy Singer!
- You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?

139
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,112
Alvy Singer over here!

140
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,281
It's all right, fellas.

141
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,618
Jesus! What did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

142
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,955
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the cast of The Godfather.

143
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,251
- You have to learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with guys named Cheech!

144
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,628
Please. I have a headache, all right?

145
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,756
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

146
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,594
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I'm getting my period!

147
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,889
A little louder. I think
one of them may have missed it.

148
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,101
- Has the picture started?
- It started two minutes ago.

149
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,395
That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.

150
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,898
- Two minutes, Alvy.
- I can't do it. We've blown it already.

151
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,067
I can't go in in the middle.

152
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,861
We'll only miss the titles.
They're in Swedish.

153
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,574
- You wanna get coffee for two hours?
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.

154
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,411
- Go ahead. Goodbye.
- While we're talking, we could be inside.

155
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,707
Can we not stand here and argue
in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.

156
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,875
All right. So what do you wanna do?

157
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,545
I don't know now.
You wanna go to another movie?

158
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,714
Let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

159
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,551
Come on. I'm not in the mood to see
a four-hour documentary on Nazis.

160
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,972
Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture
exactly from the start to the finish.

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,057
Cos... Cos I'm anal.

162
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,602
That's a polite word for what you are.

163
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,733
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

164
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,901
It lacks a cohesive structure.

165
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,740
You get the feeling that he's not
absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.

166
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,702
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

167
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,373
Granted, La Strada was a great film.
Great in its use of negative imagery.

168
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,376
I can't stand this guy.
I'm gonna have a stroke.

169
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,545
Well, stop listening to him.

170
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,048
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

171
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,218
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

172
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,721
I found it incredibly... indulgent.

173
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,475
He really is. He's one of
the most indulgent filmmakers.

174
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,644
The key word here is indulgent.

175
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,604
Without getting...

176
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,858
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

177
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,195
- How can you possibly oversleep?
- The alarm clock.

178
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,198
Do you know
what a hostile gesture that is to me?

179
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,909
I know.
Because of our sexual problem, right?

180
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,704
Everybody at The New Yorker
has to know our rate of intercourse?

181
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,665
It's like Samuel Beckett.

182
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,418
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

183
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,838
- I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
- Stop it, Alvy!

184
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,467
He's spitting on my neck.
He's spitting on my neck when he talks.

185
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,096
You know, you're so egocentric
that if I miss my therapy,...

186
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,432
..you can only think of it
in terms of how it affects you.

187
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,601
Weltanschauung is what it is.

188
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,770
Probably on their first date.

189
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,315
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

190
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,943
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

191
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,154
..who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

192
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,992
Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively
normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

193
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,247
OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem.
OK? My sexual problem. Huh?

194
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,751
I never read that. That was a Henry James
novel? Sequel of The Turn of the Screw?

195
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,087
It's the influence of television.

196
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,383
Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high...

197
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,803
..high intensity.
You understand? A hot medium...

198
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,765
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

199
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,186
What do you do when you get stuck in
a movie line with a guy like this behind?

200
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,356
Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country.

201
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:18,278
Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't
you ashamed to pontificate like that?

202
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,657
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

203
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:27,454
Really? I happen to teach a class
at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture.

204
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,791
So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

205
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,463
Oh, do you? That's funny, because
I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here.

206
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,965
Just let me... Come over here a second.

207
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,134
I heard what you were saying.

208
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,303
You know nothing of my work.

209
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,638
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

210
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,934
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing.

211
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,187
Boy, if life were only like this!

212
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,861
June 14th, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

213
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,657
All over the country, people are desperate
for every available scrap of news.

214
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,244
(Alvy) Those guys in the French
Resistance were really brave.

215
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,456
To have to listen to
Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

216
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,876
Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

217
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,005
The Gestapo would take away
your Bloomingdale's charge card...

218
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,174
..and you'd tell 'em everything.

219
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,343
That movie makes me feel guilty.

220
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,595
Yeah, cos it's supposed to.

221
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,722
Alvy...

222
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,058
What? What... What's the matter?

223
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,227
I don't... I don't know.

224
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:37,690
It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed
together. You know, it's been a long time.

225
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:42,529
Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow
night, so I have to rest my voice.

226
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,907
There's always an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

227
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,035
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

228
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,163
We're probably
in the Guinness Book of World Records.

229
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,792
Alvy, it'll pass.
I'm going through a phase. That's all.

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,003
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

231
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,548
You were very hot for Allison at first.

232
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,758
(audience laughter)

233
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,430
You're on right after Chris Brown,
which looks about 20 minutes.

234
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,599
Excuse me. When do I go on?

235
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,768
Who are you?

236
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,937
Alvy Singer.

237
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm a comedian.

238
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,982
Oh, comedian. Yeah.

239
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,150
Oh. You're on next.

240
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,319
What do you mean, next? I'm...

241
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,488
You're on right after this act.

242
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,991
No, it can't be. Because he's a comic.

243
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,117
Yes.

244
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,328
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

245
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,915
No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on
after another comedian.

246
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,041
It's OK.

247
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,211
No. Because they're laughing.
So I'd... rather not.

248
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,755
Will you relax? They're gonna love you.

249
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,884
I'd prefer not to. Look.
They're laughing at him.

250
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,761
They're gonna laugh at him
then I gotta go out.

251
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,723
I gotta get laughs too.
How much can they laugh?

252
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,601
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

253
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,853
Jesus!

254
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,105
What's your name?

255
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,815
Allison.

256
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,066
Yeah?

257
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,318
Allison what?

258
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,652
Portchnik.

259
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,155
Portchnik?

260
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,324
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

261
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,576
Allison Portchnik! (whistles)

262
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,497
So, what are you telling me? You work
for Stevenson all the time or what?

263
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,417
No, no, no.
I'm in the midst of doing my thesis.

264
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,710
On what?

265
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,005
Political Commitment
in 20th-Century Literature.

266
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,051
You're like... New York, Jewish,
left-wing, liberal, intellectual,...

267
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,055
..Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps?

268
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,225
The father with the Ben Shahn drawings?
The really strike-oriented...

269
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,604
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

270
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:44,150
No. That was wonderful. I love
being reduced to a cultural stereotype.

271
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,362
Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left.

272
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,863
(laughter and applause)

273
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,534
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging. Quickly.

274
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,662
I think you're cute.

275
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,830
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

276
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,083
Go ahead.

277
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,717
(coughs)

278
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,763
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally cos...

279
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,350
..I'm not essentially
a political comedian at all.

280
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:22,063
I interestingly had, um... dated a woman...

281
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,191
..in the Eisenhower administration briefly.

282
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,443
And it was ironic to me cos, um...

283
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,697
Cos I was trying to do to her...

284
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,326
..what Eisenhower has been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

285
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,578
(laughter and applause)

286
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,582
I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.

287
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,919
I can't get it off my mind, Allison.
It's obsessing me.

288
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

289
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,051
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

290
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,847
..and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

291
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,184
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

292
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,520
- It doesn't make sense!
- Alvy...

293
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,691
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

294
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,277
..to hit a moving target at that range.

295
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,237
But...

296
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,656
..if there was a second assassin...

297
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,242
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

298
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,120
They recovered the shells from that rifle.

299
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,289
OK. What are you saying now?

300
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,793
Everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

301
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,253
Well, why not?

302
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,671
Yeah. Earl Warren?

303
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,174
Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren.

304
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,342
Lyndon Johnson?

305
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,847
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!
You know the ethics those guys have.

306
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,892
It's like a notch
underneath child molester.

307
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,561
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

308
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,066
The FBI and the CIA
and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies...

309
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,528
..and the Pentagon and the men's room
attendant at the White House.

310
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,406
I would leave out
the men's room attendant.

311
00:17:55,574 --> 00:18:00,661
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

312
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,497
Oh, my God!

313
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,207
She's right.

314
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,417
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

315
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,046
She was beautiful, she was willing,
she was real intelligent.

316
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,801
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke that
I just don't wanna belong to any club...

317
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,887
..that would have
someone like me for a member?

318
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,056
Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it!

319
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,059
It's a mistake to ever bring
a live thing in the house.

320
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,228
Stop it! Go for that one there.

321
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:29,065
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911 . It's the lobster squad.

322
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,734
They're only baby ones, for God's sakes.

323
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,238
- If they're only babies, you pick 'em up.
- All right! All right!

324
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,865
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me! Don't!

325
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,827
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

326
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,995
It'll turn up in our bed at night.

327
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,124
Will you get out of here
with that thing? Jesus!

328
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,459
Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish.

329
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,254
Hey, look. Put it in the pot.

330
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,216
I can't put it in the pot!
I can't put a live thing in hot water!

331
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,177
You think we're gonna
take him to the movies?

332
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,263
Oh, good, Alvy. Oh, thank you.

333
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,890
OK. It's in. It's definitely in the pot.

334
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,477
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

335
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,855
I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.

336
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:13,234
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here
with a nutcracker, it'll run out.

337
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,403
I'm gonna get my camera.

338
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,655
I think if I could pry the door off...

339
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,159
We should have gotten steaks.
They don't run around.

340
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,162
(Annie screams) Goddamn it! Oh, jeez!

341
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,747
Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.

342
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,916
You're gonna take pictures now?

343
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,502
Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!

344
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,671
Oh, God! That's disgusting!

345
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,590
One more, Alvy. Please!

346
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,383
Oh, good! Good!

347
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,970
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first big romance?

348
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,722
Oh, no. No, no. Uh-uh.

349
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,140
Really? Who was?

350
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,476
There was Dennis
from Chippewa Falls High School.

351
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,606
(Alvy) Dennis? Local kid? Would
meet you in front of the movie house?

352
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,525
(Annie) You should have seen
how I looked then.

353
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,361
(Alvy) Oh, I can imagine.
The wife of an astronaut.

354
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,614
(Annie) Then there was Jerry, the actor.

355
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,782
Look at you. You're such a clown.

356
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,451
I look pretty.

357
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,995
You always look pretty. But that guy...

358
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:10,208
Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
It's very religious.

359
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,003
Like a kind of liberating consciousness.

360
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,255
It's like a visual poem.

361
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,466
Is he kidding with that crap?

362
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,635
Oh, right. (laughs)

363
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,513
I think I know exactly what you mean
when you say "religious".

364
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,640
You do?

365
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,143
- Oh, come on. I was younger.
- Hey, that was last year.

366
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,312
It's like when I think of dying.

367
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,898
- You know how I'd like to die?
- No. How?

368
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,692
I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

369
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,861
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels!

370
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,866
Listen, he was a terrific actor.
He's neat-looking and he was emotional...

371
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,494
I don't think you like emotion too much.

372
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,829
Touch my heart... with your foot.

373
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,499
I may throw up.

374
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,668
(Annie) He was creepy.

375
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,545
(Alvy) I think you're pretty lucky
I came along.

376
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,923
(Annie) Oh, really? Well, la-de-da.

377
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,760
(Alvy) If anyone had ever told me
I would be taking out a girl...

378
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,471
..who used expressions like la-de-da...

379
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,391
(Annie) You really like
those New York girls.

380
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,395
- Well, not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

381
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:16,274
There's Henry Drucker.
He has a chair in history at Princeton.

382
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,653
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.

383
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,155
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

384
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,617
- Why are you so hostile?
- Cos I wanna watch the Knicks on TV.

385
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,786
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

386
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,206
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

387
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,708
Hi, Doug!

388
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,461
Douglas Wyatt. The Foul
Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart.

389
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,049
I'm so tired of making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

390
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,259
Commentary.

391
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:48,097
Really? I heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

392
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,349
No jokes. These are friends, OK?

393
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,227
(TV basketball commentary)

394
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,689
Here you are.

395
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,858
There's people out there.

396
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:04,155
Two minutes ago the Knicks are ahead 14
points, and now they're ahead two points.

397
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,324
Alvy...

398
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,202
What is so fascinating
about a group of pituitary cases...

399
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,830
..trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

400
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,333
What is fascinating is that it's physical.

401
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,586
Intellectuals prove
you can be absolutely brilliant...

402
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,755
..and have no idea what's going on.

403
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,425
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie,...

404
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,594
..as we now know.

405
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,304
Stop acting out.

406
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:33,559
It'll be great. All those PhDs are in there
discussing modes of alienation,...

407
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,228
..and we'll be in here quietly humping.

408
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,441
Alvy, don't.
You're using sex to express hostility.

409
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,196
Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories?

410
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,782
He said, as he removed her brassiere.

411
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,371
Alvy! There are people out there
from The New Yorker magazine!

412
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,831
Oh, my God.

413
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,084
What would they think?

414
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,337
(siren)

415
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,508
Damn siren!

416
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,842
OK. Don't get upset.

417
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,011
Dammit! I was so close!

418
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,557
Last night it was a guy honking
his car horn. The city can't close down.

419
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,644
You wanna have them
shut down the airport too?

420
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,896
No more flights so we can have sex?

421
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,065
I'm too tense. I need a Valium.

422
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,860
My analyst says I should live
in the country and not in New York.

423
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,531
We can't have this discussion.
The country makes me nervous.

424
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,118
You've got crickets.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

425
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,787
The screens
with the dead moths behind 'em.

426
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,582
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Terry.

427
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,421
OK! OK! My analyst just thinks I'm
too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

428
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,756
It's quiet now. We can start again.

429
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,925
I can't. My head is throbbing.

430
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,553
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache.

431
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,679
Bad?

432
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,931
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.
- Jesus!

433
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,517
Where are you going?

434
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,937
I'm going to take another
in a series of cold showers.

435
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,773
Max, my serve will send you
to the showers early.

436
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,236
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

437
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,405
Max, the city is terribly run.

438
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,033
I'm not discussing politics or economics.
This is foreskin.

439
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,413
Every time some group disagrees
with you, it's because of anti-Semitism.

440
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,790
The rest of the country sees New York...

441
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,711
..as left-wing, Communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

442
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,464
I think of us that way sometimes,
and I live here.

443
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:31,051
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

444
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,014
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

445
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,183
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

446
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,642
I know, but I...

447
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,811
Egad. Here he comes.

448
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,062
OK.

449
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,231
Hi!

450
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,567
You know Alvy? This is Janet.

451
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,736
This is Annie Hall.

452
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,279
This is Alvy.

453
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,239
Who's playing with who?

454
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,408
You and me against them?

455
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,078
- I can't play too good, you know?
- I've had four lessons.

456
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,714
(laughter)

457
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,924
Oh! Yeah!

458
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,469
Hi!

459
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,763
Hi. Hi.

460
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,641
Oh, hi. Hi.

461
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,811
Well...

462
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,064
Bye.

463
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,151
You play very well.

464
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,320
Oh, yeah? So do you.

465
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,073
Oh, God. What a dumb thing to say, right?

466
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:39,036
You say, "You play well" and then
right away I have to say, "You play well."

467
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,454
Oh!

468
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,540
God, Annie. Well...

469
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,542
Oh, well.

470
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,710
La-de-da. La-de-da.

471
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,212
La-la. Yeah.

472
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,297
You want a lift?

473
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,675
Oh, why?

474
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,843
You got a car?

475
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,763
Me? No. I was gonna take a cab.

476
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,432
Oh, no. I have a car.

477
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,476
You have a car?

478
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,480
I don't understand.
If you have a car, so then...

479
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,859
..why did you say, "Do you have a car?"
like you wanted a lift?

480
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,028
I don't... I don't...

481
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,281
Jeez, I don't know. I wasn't...

482
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,243
It's... I've got this VW out there.

483
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,536
(laughs)

484
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,705
What a jerk! Yeah.

485
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,957
Would you like a lift?

486
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,418
Sure. Which way are you going?

487
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,587
Me? Downtown.

488
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,755
I'm going uptown.

489
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,258
Well, you know, I'm going uptown too.

490
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,844
You just said you were going downtown.

491
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,137
Sorry.

492
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,432
I can go uptown too.
I live uptown, but what the hell!

493
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,685
It'll be nice having company.
I hate driving alone.

494
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,896
(Alvy) So where do you know Janet from?

495
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,941
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress?

496
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,110
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

497
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,279
(car horn)

498
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,782
- You're not from New York, right?
- Chippewa Falls.

499
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,827
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

500
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,996
You're driving a tad rapidly.

501
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,041
Don't worry.
I'm a very good driver. I'm good.

502
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,835
- You want some gum anyway?
- No. No, thanks.

503
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,547
Hey, don't... No, no.
Would you watch the road? I'll get it!

504
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,424
(tyres screech)

505
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,926
- I'll get you a piece.
- So, you drive?

506
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,055
Do I drive? No.
I've got a problem with driving.

507
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,223
Oh, you do?

508
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,852
I've got a licence,
but I have too much hostility.

509
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,356
Nice car. You keep it nice.

510
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,524
Can I ask you? Is this a sandwich?

511
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,151
Huh? Oh, yeah.

512
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,993
I live over here. Oh, my God! Look!
There's a parking space.

513
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,918
That's OK.
We can walk to the kerb from here.

514
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,089
- You want your tennis stuff?
- Huh? Oh. Yeah.

515
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,424
That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

516
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,677
(both) Well...

517
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,805
Thank you.

518
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,516
You're a wonderful tennis player and...

519
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,936
..you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

520
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,272
Anyplace. Europe.
The United... Anyplace. Asia.

521
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,609
- And I love what you're wearing.
- Oh, you do, yeah?

522
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,446
Oh, well, it's a...
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

523
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,615
Who? Grammy... Grammy Hall?

524
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah, my grammy.

525
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,994
Did you grow up
in a Norman Rockwell painting?

526
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,415
- Your grammy?
- I know. It's pretty silly, isn't it?

527
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:34,169
My grammy never gave gifts. She was
too busy getting raped by Cossacks.

528
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,879
(both) Well...

529
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,048
- Thank you again.
- Oh, yeah.

530
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:42,428
Hey, you wanna come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

531
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,681
I mean, you don't have to.
You're probably late.

532
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,726
No, no. That'd be fine.
I wouldn't mind. Sure.

533
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,938
I've got time. I've got nothing...
till my analyst appointment.

534
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,107
Oh, you see an analyst?

535
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,609
- Yeah. Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?!

536
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,655
I'm gonna give him one more year
and then I'm going to Lourdes.

537
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,657
15... Nah! Come on!

538
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,908
Yeah? Really?

539
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,454
Sylvia Plath? Interesting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

540
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,499
...was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

541
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,625
Oh, sorry.

542
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,628
I don't know.
Some of her poems seem neat.

543
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,131
Neat? I hate to tell you, this is 1975.

544
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,801
"Neat" went out, I would say,
at the turn of the century.

545
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,970
Who are those photos on the wall?

546
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,390
Oh! Well, you see now, uh...
That's my dad.

547
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,351
That's Father.
And that's my brother Duane.

548
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,520
- Duane?
- Yeah, right. Duane.

549
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,648
And over there is Grammy Hall.
And that's Sadie.

550
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,777
- Who's Sadie?
- Oh, well, Sadie... Ha, ha.

551
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,197
Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother George.

552
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,074
George was real sweet.
He had that thing...

553
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:51,205
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence? What is it?

554
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,624
- Narcolepsy.
- Narcolepsy! Right!

555
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,420
So anyway, um... George went to
the union, you see, to get his free turkey.

556
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,633
The union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmas time...

557
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,094
...because he was shell-shocked
in the First World War.

558
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:11,975
Anyway, so George is standing in line -
oh, just a sec - getting his free turkey.

559
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,853
But the thing is,
is that he falls asleep...

560
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,022
...and he never wakes up!

561
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,733
So... so he's dead!

562
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,985
He's dead. Yeah.

563
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,112
Oh, dear.

564
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,784
Well... Terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say?
I mean, that's pretty awful.

565
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,037
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

566
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,707
I think I should get outta here
cos I think I'm imposing.

567
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,668
Really? Well, maybe, um...

568
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,794
You know, I...

569
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:43,090
- You don't have to, you know.
- I'm all perspired and everything.

570
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,425
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

571
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,303
Me? No. Cos I never shower
in a public place.

572
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,721
Why not?

573
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,225
Cos I don't like to get naked
in front of another man.

574
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,686
Oh, I see. I see.

575
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,022
I don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

576
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,608
You never know what's gonna happen.

577
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,570
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah. That's...

578
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,948
God bless.

579
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,787
Well... well...

580
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,500
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew".

581
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,588
Thank you.

582
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,884
Yeah, well, she hates Jews.
She thinks that they just make money.

583
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,178
But she's the one.
Is she ever! I'm tellin' you.

584
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,728
So did you do those photographs
in there or what?

585
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,691
Yeah. I sort of dabble around,
you know. (thinks) I dabble?

586
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,070
They're wonderful, you know.
They have a... a quality.

587
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,283
Well, I would like to take
a serious photography course.

588
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,536
Photography's interesting
cos it's a new art form...

589
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,706
...and a set of aesthetic criteria
have not emerged yet.

590
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,874
Aesthetic criteria?

591
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,585
You mean whether it's
a good photo or not?

592
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,673
The medium enters in as a
condition of the art form itself.

593
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:11,094
Well... to me... I mean,
it's... it's... it's all instinctive.

594
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,597
I just try to feel it.

595
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,683
I try to get a sense of it
and not think about it so much.

596
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,480
Still, you need a set of aesthetic
guidelines to put it in social perspective.

597
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,524
Well, I don't know.

598
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,944
I guess you must be sort of late, huh?

599
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,490
You know, I gotta get there
and begin whining soon. Otherwise I...

600
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,493
- Hey, are you busy Friday night?
- Me?

601
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,037
Oh, uh, no.

602
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,206
Oh, I'm sorry! I have something.

603
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,458
What about Saturday night?

604
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,628
Nothing. No, no.

605
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,880
You're very popular, I can see.

606
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,800
- I know.
- Do you have plague?

607
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,052
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of jerks.

608
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,930
I meet a lot of jerks too.
I think that's a...

609
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,724
But I'm thinking about getting some cats.

610
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,018
Oh, wait a second. Oh, no, no!

611
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,980
Oh, shoot! No. Saturday night I'm gonna...

612
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,774
I'm gonna sing. Yeah.

613
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,652
You're gonna sing?
Do you sing? No kidding?

614
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,406
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where? I'd like to come.

615
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,117
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no!
- I'm interested.

616
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,620
I'm just... I'm auditioning
at this club. I don't...

617
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,749
- It's my first time.
- It's OK. I know exactly what that's like.

618
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,670
You're gonna like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

619
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,839
(piano)

620
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,344
# It had to be you

621
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,596
(microphone feedback)

622
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:44,312
# It had to be you

623
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,689
(glasses smash)

624
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,025
# I wandered around

625
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,485
# And finally found

626
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:55,657
# The somebody who

627
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,076
(arguing)

628
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:03,707
# Could make me be true

629
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:09,171
# Could make me be blue

630
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,964
(talking)

631
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,593
- # And even be glad
- (phone rings)

632
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,928
# Just to be sad

633
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:24,186
- (ringing continues)
- # Thinking of you

634
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,772
I was awful! I'm so ashamed! I can't sing!

635
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,066
So the audience was a tad restless.

636
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,110
What do you mean, a tad restless?
They hated me!

637
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,780
They didn't! You have a wonderful voice!

638
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,366
- I'm gonna quit.
- I won't let you. You have a great voice.

639
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,953
- Really? Do you think so? Really?
- Yeah. It's terrific.

640
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,247
I never even took a lesson, either.

641
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,416
Hey, listen. Give me a kiss.

642
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,753
- Really?
- Because we're just gonna go home later.

643
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:54,841
There's gonna be all that tension and I
won't know when to make the right move.

644
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,512
So we'll kiss now,
we'll get it over with and then go eat.

645
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,014
- We'll digest our food better.
- OK.

646
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,727
OK? So now we can digest our food.

647
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,230
I'm gonna have the corned beef, please.

648
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,274
Oh. I'm gonna have pastrami
on white bread...

649
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,402
..with mayonnaise
and tomatoes and lettuce.

650
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:22,160
So, um... your second wife left you.
And were you depressed about that?

651
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,455
Nothing that a few megavitamins
couldn't cure.

652
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,542
And your first wife? Allison?

653
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:33,255
She was nice, but... That was my fault.
I was just... I was too crazy.

654
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,507
(Annie) Mm... Mm...

655
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,552
That was so nice.

656
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,720
That was nice.

657
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,765
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

658
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,853
- You were great.
- Oh.

659
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,021
Yeah? Yeah?

660
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,274
Yeah. I'm wrecked.

661
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,402
- You're wrecked!
- I mean it.

662
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,737
I will never play the piano again.

663
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,242
It was... I don't know.
You really thought it was good?

664
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,411
Good? Yes.

665
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,914
That was the most fun I've ever had
without laughing.

666
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,083
Here. You want some?

667
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:14,880
No. I... I don't... use
any major hallucinogenics because I...

668
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,300
..took a puff
about five years ago at a party and...

669
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,593
Yeah?

670
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,179
Tried to take my pants off over my head.

671
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,931
- (snorts and giggles)
- Got in one ear.

672
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,143
Well, I don't really...
I don't do it very often.

673
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,395
It just sort of relaxes me.

674
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,151
- You're not gonna believe this, but...
- What? What?

675
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:43,158
I'm gonna buy you these books
because I think you should read them.

676
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,245
- Instead of that cat book.
- That's pretty serious stuff there.

677
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,333
Yeah. Cos I'm obsessed with death,
I think. Big subject with me.

678
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,752
I have a very pessimistic view of life.

679
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,379
You should know this
if we're gonna go out.

680
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,550
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

681
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,222
Those are the two categories.
The horrible would be like terminal cases.

682
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,684
And blind people. And cripples.
I don't know how they get through life.

683
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,020
And the miserable is everyone else.

684
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,232
So you should be thankful
that you're miserable.

685
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,567
You're very lucky to be miserable.

686
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,862
(Alvy) Look at that guy.

687
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,114
In the pink. Mr Miami Beach there.

688
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,701
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

689
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,662
Placed third.

690
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:33,708
Look at these guys. They're back from
Fire Island. They're giving it a chance.

691
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,212
- (Annie) Italian, right?
- Him? Yeah, he's the Mafia.

692
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,091
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting, I think.

693
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,593
"Oh, gee!
Must have my moustache waxed."

694
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,639
There's the winner
of the Truman Capote lookalike contest.

695
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,475
(Alvy) You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy.

696
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,644
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

697
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,314
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

698
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,276
What does that mean?
I don't know what that is.

699
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,862
You're exceptional in bed
because you get pleasure...

700
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,284
..in every part of your body when
I touch you. Like the tip of your nose.

701
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,538
If I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps,
you suddenly get excited.

702
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,707
You know what? I like you.

703
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,875
I really do like you.

704
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,503
Do you love me? That's the key question.

705
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,214
I know you've only known me
a short while.

706
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,676
I think that's sort of...
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,845
Do you love me?

708
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,724
Love is... too weak a word for...
the way I feel.

709
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,393
I lurve you. You know, I loave you.

710
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,521
I luff you. With two Fs.
Yes, I have to invent...

711
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,857
Of course I do. Don't you think I do?

712
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,109
I don't know.

713
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,905
You're not gonna give up
your apartment, are you?

714
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,032
Of course.

715
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,200
- But why?
- I'm moving in with you.

716
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,954
- But you've got a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

717
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,458
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

718
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:01,379
Granted. It has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative thing.

719
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:05,425
You know, bugs are...
Entomology is a rapidly growing field.

720
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,721
- You don't want me to live with you.
- I don't want you to live with me?

721
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,890
- Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

722
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,477
It was yours, actually.
But I approved it immediately.

723
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,688
I guess you think
I talked you into something, huh?

724
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,233
No! We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

725
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,695
Jesus! You don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

726
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,366
- How is it any different?
- Cos you keep your own apartment.

727
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,702
We don't have to go to it.
We don't have to deal with it.

728
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,290
It's like a free-floating life raft.
That we know that we're not married.

729
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,085
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

730
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,712
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

731
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,881
It's got bad plumbing and bugs.

732
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:50,512
Jesus! My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

733
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,974
- You don't think I'm smart enough.
- Hey, don't be ridiculous.

734
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:59,229
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like I was dumb?

735
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,523
Adult education's a wonderful thing.

736
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,943
You meet interesting professors.
It's stimulating.

737
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,749
Does this sound like a good course?

738
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,001
"Modern American Poetry"?

739
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,171
Or let's see now. Maybe I should take...

740
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,924
.."Introduction to the Novel".

741
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,886
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

742
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,596
What?

743
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:38,518
Hey, what do you think? You think we
should go to that party in Southampton?

744
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,729
Don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

745
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:46,484
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the salami or something.

746
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,446
Well, listen,
I'm gonna get a cigarette, OK?

747
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,241
Grass, right?
The illusion that it will make

748
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,868
a white woman more
like Billie Holiday.

749
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,829
- Well, have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

750
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,292
If I have grass or alcohol or anything,
I get unbearably wonderful.

751
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,461
I get too wonderful for words.

752
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,173
I don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

753
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,093
- Well, it relaxes me.
- You have to be artificially relaxed...

754
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,346
- ..before we can go to bed?
- What's the difference?

755
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,017
Take a shot of Sodium Pentothal.
You can sleep through it.

756
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,103
You've been seeing a psychiatrist
for 15 years.

757
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,398
You should smoke this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

758
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,401
- Come on. You don't need that.
- What are you doing?

759
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,738
- No, Alvy. Please.
- You can live without it once.

760
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,867
Wait. I got a great idea.

761
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,996
Hang in there for a second.
I got a little artefact.

762
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,875
A little erotic artefact
that I brought up from the city...

763
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,294
..which I think is gonna be perfect.

764
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,714
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

765
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,342
Now we can go about our business here...

766
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,470
..and even develop photographs
if we want to.

767
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,772
- Hey, is something wrong?
- No. Why?

768
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,525
I don't know. It's like you're removed.

769
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,693
No, I'm fine.

770
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,946
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

771
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,907
I don't know. You seem sorta distant.

772
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,076
Let's just do it, all right?

773
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,621
Is it my imagination or are you just
going through the motions?

774
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,998
Do you remember
where I put my drawing pad?

775
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,502
While you two are doing that,
I think I'm gonna do some drawing.

776
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,755
- That's what I call removed.
- Oh, you have my body.

777
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,383
Yeah, but I want the whole thing.

778
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,760
Well, I need grass.

779
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,388
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass.

780
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,058
I'm a comedian. If I get a laugh
from a person who's high,...

781
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,270
..it doesn't count,
cos they're always laughing.

782
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,606
- Were you always funny?
- What is this? An interview?

783
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,858
We're supposed to be making love.

784
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,237
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

785
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,448
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

786
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,617
Let me explain how I work.

787
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,162
I don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys that come out.

788
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,331
You know you're gonna fall down.

789
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:10,169
But material's gotta be sensational for me.
I work with very... I'm kinda classy.

790
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,673
Let me explain. For instance,
I open with an opening song.

791
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,093
Musical style like -
# Bam da dam da da da - and I walk out...

792
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,262
# Place looks wonderful from here

793
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,639
# And you folks look
wonderful from here

794
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,350
# And seeing you there
with a smile on your face

795
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,686
# Makes me shout
"This must be the place"

796
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,731
Then I open with some jokes.
That's where I need you.

797
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:33,526
"I just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French up there."

798
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:38,197
"The word to remember is Jeanne d'Arc.
It means the light's out in the bathroom."

799
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,366
"I met a big lumberjack..."

800
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,577
Jesus! This guy's pathetic.

801
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,746
Look at him mincing around.

802
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,790
He thinks he's real cute.
You wanna throw up.

803
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,210
If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

804
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,382
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this smile frozen on my face.

805
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,801
I'm in the wrong business. I know it.

806
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,555
(woman with French accent)
"But... um... chri...

807
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,807
..what will I do with this?"

808
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,270
(man with French accent) "Oh, Marie!
Sometime you make me so mad!"

809
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:14,651
They scream at that! Write me something
like that. A French number. Can you do it?

810
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,117
Where am I? I have to reorient myself.

811
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:27,747
This is the University of Wisconsin, right?
Cos I'm always... tense...

812
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:32,210
I have a very bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

813
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,630
And I was thrown out of NYU
in my freshman year...

814
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,341
..for cheating on my metaphysics final.

815
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,844
I looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

816
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,013
(laughter)

817
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,350
My mother,
an emotionally high-strung woman,...

818
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:52,271
..locked herself in the bathroom
and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.

819
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,440
(laughter)

820
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,777
I was depressed at that time.
I was in analysis.

821
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,906
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself.

822
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,784
But I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

823
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,913
If you kill yourself, they make you pay
for the sessions you miss.

824
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,165
(laughter)

825
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,129
Alvy, you were just great.
I'm not kidding. It was...

826
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,799
- You were so funny.
- College audiences are wonderful.

827
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,136
And I'm starting to get
more of the references too.

828
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:27,098
Are you? Well, the 12 o'clock show's
completely different.

829
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,853
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
You'll meet Mother and Father.

830
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,022
- They'll hate me immediately.
- I don't think so.

831
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,713
I don't think they're
gonna hate you at all.

832
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:40,236
It's Easter.
We'll have a nice dinner.

833
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,780
I think they're gonna really like you.

834
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,750
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

835
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,835
Oh, yeah.

836
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,838
Grammy always does such a good job.

837
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,757
A great sauce!

838
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,009
It is. It's dynamite ham.

839
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,933
We went over to the swap meet.

840
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,896
Annie, Gram and I.
We got some nice picture frames.

841
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,648
(Annie) We really had a good time.

842
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:22,862
Ann tells us that you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

843
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,072
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

844
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,577
Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

845
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:35,374
- Duane and I went out to the boat basin.
- We were caulking holes all day.

846
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,628
And Randolph Hunt was drunk. As usual.

847
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,131
That Randolph Hunt.
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

848
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,009
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

849
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,262
I can't believe this family.

850
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,057
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

851
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,268
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

852
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:59,232
And the old lady at the end
of the table is a classic Jew-hater.

853
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:04,445
They really look American. Very healthy.
Like they never get sick or anything.

854
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:08,074
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

855
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,410
Let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

856
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,955
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes?

857
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,666
Is that an excuse? Diabetes?

858
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,962
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

859
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,319
Is that a reason to
steal from his father?

860
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,508
What are you talking about?

861
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,677
Sure! Defend him!

862
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,846
Pass the wurst there.

863
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,598
Mo Moskowitz, he had a coronary.

864
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,809
You don't say!

865
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,062
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs Singer?

866
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,231
- We fast.
- (Mr Hall) Fast?

867
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,150
No food. To atone for our sins.

868
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,319
What sins? I don't understand.

869
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,738
To tell you the truth, neither do we.

870
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,907
(Duane) Alvy.

871
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,076
Hi, Duane. How's it goin'?

872
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,245
This is my room.

873
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,706
Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

874
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,958
Can I confess something?

875
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,301
I tell you this because,
as an artist, I think you'll understand.

876
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,346
Sometimes when I'm driving...

877
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,393
..on the road at night, I see
two headlights coming toward me.

878
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,606
Fast. I have this sudden impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

879
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,941
..head-on into the oncoming car.

880
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,278
I can anticipate the explosion.

881
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,448
The sound of shattering glass. The...

882
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,785
..flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

883
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,458
Right. Well...

884
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,586
I have to go now, Duane, because I...

885
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,380
..I'm due back on the planet Earth.

886
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,926
- Don't let it be so long.
- Look up Uncle Billy.

887
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,094
- He is adorable.
- Do you think so?

888
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,849
- You're taking them to the airport?
- Duane can. I haven't finished my drink.

889
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,894
Yes, Duane is.
Just a second. I have to get...

890
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,748
- You followed me.
- I didn't follow you.

891
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,124
You followed me!

892
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,670
I was walking behind staring at you.
That's not following.

893
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,965
- What is your definition of following?
- I was spying.

894
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:33,302
- Do you realise how paranoid you are?
- You've got your arms around a guy.

895
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,596
That is the worst kind of paranoid.

896
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,517
I didn't start out spying.
I thought I'd pick you up after school.

897
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:43,020
You wanted to keep
the relationship flexible, remember?

898
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,815
You're having an affair
with your professor.

899
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,528
That jerk that teaches that crap course -
Contemporary Crisis in Western Man?

900
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,322
Existential Motifs in Russian Literature!

901
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,491
It's all mental masturbation.

902
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,994
We finally get to a subject
you know about.

903
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,288
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

904
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,626
We're not having an affair. He's married.
He just happens to think I'm neat.

905
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,795
Neat. Are you 12 years old?

906
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,881
- That's a Chippewa Falls expression.
- Who cares?!

907
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,011
Next he'll find you keen and peachy.
Then he's got his hand on your ass.

908
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,680
You've always had hostility
towards David.

909
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,433
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

910
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,145
It's a biblical name, right?
What does he call you? Bathsheba?

911
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:28,274
Alvy. Alvy, you're the one who never
wanted to make a real commitment.

912
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,526
You don't think I'm smart enough.

913
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,572
We had that argument just last month.
Or don't you remember?

914
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,700
- I'm home!
- Oh, yeah? How did it go?

915
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,953
Oh, it was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

916
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,665
I didn't have to lie down on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

917
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,294
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

918
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,838
..and my relationship with my brother.

919
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,966
She mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

920
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,262
I'm one of the few males who suffers
from that. Go on. I'm interested.

921
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:03,017
She said I was very guilty about my
impulses towards marriage and children.

922
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:07,772
Then I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

923
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,024
All this happened the first hour?

924
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,861
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have... nothing like that.

925
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,113
I told her my dream and then I cried.

926
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,658
You cried? I have never once cried.
That's fantastic.

927
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,827
I whine. I sit and I whine.

928
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:27,208
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this
pillow across my face and I can't breathe.

929
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,460
- Sinatra?
- Yeah. Strangling me.

930
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,546
Sure. Because he's a singer
and you're a singer.

931
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,092
It's perfect.
So you're trying to suffocate yourself.

932
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,761
It's a perfect analytic kind of insight.

933
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,597
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

934
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,433
- What do you mean? Me?
- Yeah, you.

935
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,478
Because in the dream
I break Sinatra's glasses.

936
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:52,650
You never said Sinatra had glasses. What
are you saying? That I'm suffocating you?

937
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,861
God, Alvy. I did this
really terrible thing to him.

938
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,990
Because then, when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitched voice.

939
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,159
What did the doctor say?

940
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,745
I should probably come five times a week.

941
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:09,750
I don't think I mind analysis at all. The
only question is, will it change my wife?

942
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,919
- Will it change your wife?
- My life.

943
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,965
- You said, "Will it change my wife?"
- I said, "Will it change my life?"

944
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,134
- You said wife.
- Life! I said life.

945
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:22,138
She said, "Will it change my wife?"
You heard that, so I'm not crazy.

946
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,558
I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously,...

947
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,185
..because you don't think
I'm smart enough.

948
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,354
Why do you always bring that up?

949
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,774
Because I encourage you
to take adult education courses?

950
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,652
You meet wonderful,
interesting professors.

951
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,197
Adult education is such junk.
The professors are so phoney.

952
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,617
I don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

953
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,870
And why are you following me around?

954
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,956
- I was following you and David.
- Let's call it quits.

955
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,376
That's fine. That's great.
I don't know what I did wrong.

956
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,212
She cooled off to me.
Is it something that I did?

957
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,008
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

958
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,844
Love fades? God!
That's a depressing thought.

959
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,347
I have to ask you a question.
With your wife in bed,...

960
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:10,102
..does she need some kind of
artificial stimulation? Like marijuana?

961
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,271
We use a large vibrating egg.

962
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,440
A large vibrating egg?

963
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,319
Well, I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of an answer. Jesus!

964
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,946
Here. You look like a very happy couple.

965
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,199
- Are you?
- Yeah.

966
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,659
So how do you account for it?

967
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,370
Uh... I'm very shallow and empty,...

968
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,833
..and I have no ideas
and nothing interesting to say.

969
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:37,421
- And I'm exactly the same way.
- I see. Well, that's very interesting.

970
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,466
So you've managed
to work out something, huh?

971
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,177
Well, thanks very much for talking to me.

972
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,765
Even as a kid, I always went for the
wrong women. I think that's my problem.

973
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,269
My mother took me to see Snow White.
Everyone fell in love with Snow White.

974
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,897
I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.

975
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,983
- We never have any fun any more.
- How can you say that?

976
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,819
You're always leaning on me
to improve myself.

977
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,280
You must be getting your period.

978
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,950
I don't get a period!
I'm a cartoon character.

979
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,118
Can't I be upset once in a while?

980
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,622
Max, forget about Annie.
I know lots of women you can date.

981
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,124
I don't wanna go out
with any other women.

982
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:18,545
I have got a girl for you. You'll love her.
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

983
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,468
I think there are more people here to see
the Maharishi than there were for Dylan.

984
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,596
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

985
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:32,351
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman."

986
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:37,314
"And she makes love just like a woman.
Yes, she does."

987
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,402
"And she aches just like a woman."

988
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,113
"But she breaks just like a little girl."

989
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,449
After that,
the most charismatic event I covered...

990
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,577
..was Mick's birthday
at Madison Square Garden.

991
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:54,331
- That's great. That's just great.
- Did you catch Dylan?

992
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,835
Me? No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

993
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,795
You have a raccoon?

994
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,505
A few.

995
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,133
The only word for this is transplendid.

996
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,302
It's transplendid.

997
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,470
I can think of another word.

998
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,807
He's God. This man is God.
He's got millions of followers...

999
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,728
..who would crawl across the world
just to touch the hem of his garment.

1000
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,896
Yeah? Must be a tremendous hem.

1001
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,232
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

1002
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,486
I can't get with any religion
that advertises in Popular Mechanics.

1003
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,614
Look. There's God
coming out of the men's room.

1004
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,950
It's unbelievably transplendid!

1005
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:33,329
I was at the Stones concert
when they killed that guy.

1006
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,040
Were you?
I was at an Alice Cooper thing...

1007
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:40,169
..where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

1008
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,714
I hope you don't mind
that I took so long to finish.

1009
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,593
Oh, no. Don't be...
Don't be silly. You know, I...

1010
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,513
I'm starting to get
some feeling back in my jaw now.

1011
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,685
Sex with you
is really a Kafkaesque experience.

1012
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,937
Oh. Thank you.

1013
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,066
I mean that as a compliment.

1014
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:07,071
I think... I think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm.

1015
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,032
You know, to make up for
empty areas in life.

1016
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,203
Who said that?

1017
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,375
I don't know. I think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

1018
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,627
(phone rings)

1019
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,673
Hello.

1020
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,843
Oh, hi!

1021
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,096
Uh... no. What...

1022
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,848
What's the matter?

1023
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,101
You sound terrible.

1024
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,854
No. Sure, I...

1025
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,315
What kind of emergency?

1026
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,194
No. Well, stay there. Stay there.
I'll come over right now.

1027
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,863
Just stay there. I'll come right over.

1028
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,074
(Alvy) It's me. Open up. Are you OK?

1029
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,451
What's the matter? Are you all right?

1030
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,703
There's a spider in the bathroom.

1031
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,955
What?

1032
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,916
There's a big, black spider
in the bathroom.

1033
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:06,588
You got me here at three in the morning
cos there's a spider in the bathroom?

1034
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:11,552
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with a live thing crawling around.

1035
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:15,264
Kill it! What's wrong with you?
Don't you have a can of Raid?

1036
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,932
No.

1037
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,311
I told you a thousand times. You should
always keep a lotta insect spray.

1038
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,689
You never know who's gonna crawl over.

1039
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,525
And a first-aid kit
and a fire-extinguisher...

1040
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,111
Give me a magazine, cos I'm a little tired.

1041
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,281
You make fun of me,
but I'm prepared for anything.

1042
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,242
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

1043
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,413
Hey, what is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

1044
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,747
Yeah.

1045
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,916
Oh, yeah? Really?

1046
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,085
How'd you like it?

1047
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:49,298
Was it... I mean, was it heavy?
Did it achieve total heavy-ocity?

1048
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,467
It was just great.

1049
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,179
Why don't you get the guy
that took you to the rock concert...

1050
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,389
..to come over and kill the spider?

1051
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,184
I called you. You wanna
help me or not, huh?

1052
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,936
Since when do you read
the National Review?

1053
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:07,107
- What are you turning into?
- I like to try to get all points of view.

1054
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,027
Then get William F Buckley
to kill the spider.

1055
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,071
Alvy, you're a little hostile.
You know that?

1056
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,657
Not only that. You look thin and tired.

1057
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,161
It's three o'clock in the morning!
You got me out of bed.

1058
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,540
I ran over here. I couldn't get a taxi cab.
You said it was an emergency.

1059
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,920
I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more
attractive when the evening began.

1060
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,131
Are you going with a right-wing
rock-and-roll star?

1061
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,842
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

1062
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,720
Hey, what am I? Your son?
I came over for...

1063
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,931
I got the good chocolate.

1064
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,808
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

1065
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:46,897
Don't squish it. And after it's dead,
flush it down the toilet a couple of times.

1066
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,567
Darling, I've been killing spiders
since I was 30, OK?

1067
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,783
It's a very big spider.
Lotta trouble. There's two of them.

1068
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,954
I didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider. You got a broom?

1069
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,206
It's at your house.
I think I left it there.

1070
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,291
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

1071
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,920
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

1072
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,172
OK.

1073
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,302
Hey...

1074
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,265
- What is this? You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

1075
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,309
What, are you joining a minstrel show?

1076
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,568
(crashing and banging)

1077
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,820
Don't worry!

1078
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,665
I did it. I killed them both.
What are you sad about?

1079
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,586
What did you want me to do?
Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?

1080
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,880
- Oh, don't go. Please.
- What do you mean, don't...

1081
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,092
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1082
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,428
What's the matter?

1083
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,680
I don't know. I miss you.

1084
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,433
- Oh, Jesus. Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1085
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,685
Oh...

1086
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,151
- Alvy?
- What?

1087
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,197
Was there somebody in your room
when I called you?

1088
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,785
- What do you mean?
- Was there... I thought I heard a voice.

1089
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,748
I had the radio on. I'm sorry -
it was the television set.

1090
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,000
I was watching...

1091
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,173
Alvy, let's never break up again.

1092
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,550
I don't wanna be apart.

1093
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,512
I think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1094
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:46,099
Living together
hasn't been so bad, has it?

1095
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,977
No. For me, it's been terrific. You know?

1096
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,605
Better than either one of my marriages.

1097
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:57,152
There's just something different about you.
I don't know what it is, but it's great.

1098
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,074
You know, I think that if you let me,
maybe I could help you have more fun.

1099
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,326
I mean, I know it's hard. It's...

1100
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,664
Alvy, what about...
what if we go away this weekend?

1101
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,876
Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us
would drive into Brooklyn?

1102
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,880
We could show you the old
neighbourhood. That'd be fun for you.

1103
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,924
Yeah, it would.

1104
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,009
(Annie) Oh, my God! It's a great day!

1105
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,012
(Alvy) Watch the road!
You're gonna total the car!

1106
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,515
(Annie) I've never even been to Brooklyn.

1107
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,727
(Rob) Got to see the old neighbourhood.
We can show her the schoolyard.

1108
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,084
(Alvy) I was a great athlete.
Tell her, Max.

1109
01:01:33,085 --> 01:01:35,273
The best. I was all-schoolyard.

1110
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,694
They threw him a football once
and he tried to dribble it.

1111
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,862
I used to lose my glasses a lot.

1112
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,700
(Alvy) Oh, look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

1113
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:45,909
(Annie) Holy cow!

1114
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:50,038
(Rob) You're lucky. Where I lived
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1115
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,749
(Alvy) I have some
very good memories there.

1116
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,460
Your mother and father
fighting all the time?

1117
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,547
Yeah, and always over
the most ridiculous things.

1118
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,841
- You fired the cleaner?
- She stole!

1119
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,260
She's coloured!
They have enough trouble!

1120
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,763
- She went through my pocketbook!
- They're persecuted enough!

1121
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,975
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it!

1122
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,353
How can we afford it? On your pay?
What if she steals more?

1123
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,523
She's a coloured woman from Harlem!
She has no money!

1124
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,652
She's got a right to steal from us!
Who is she gonna steal from if not us?

1125
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,405
- You're both crazy!
- They can't hear you, Max.

1126
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,533
Leo, I married a fool!

1127
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,410
Hey, Max. What's that?

1128
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:33,081
That's the welcome-home party,
1945, for my cousin Herbie.

1129
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,333
(rumbling)

1130
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:40,046
Look. There. That's Joey Nichols.
He was my father's friend.

1131
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,841
He was always bothering me
when I was a kid.

1132
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,260
Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.

1133
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,429
See? Nickels.

1134
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,099
You see? Nickels.
You can always remember my name.

1135
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,810
Just think of Joey Five Cents. Ha-ha!

1136
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,856
That's me! Joey Five Cents!

1137
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,025
What an asshole.

1138
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,361
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister Tessie.

1139
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,989
I was always the sister
with good common sense.

1140
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,575
Tessie was always
the one with personality.

1141
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,703
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1142
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,249
Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.
She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

1143
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,418
She was once a great beauty.

1144
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,755
Tessie, they say you were
the sister with personality.

1145
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,924
I was a great beauty.

1146
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:27,886
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

1147
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,806
There were many men interested in you?

1148
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,600
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

1149
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,686
That's very hard to believe.

1150
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:41,525
Well, I had a really good day. It was just
a real fine way to spend my birthday.

1151
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:45,278
- Your birthday's not till tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1152
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,739
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

1153
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,242
I wonder what this is.

1154
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,578
- Happy birthday.
- What is this?

1155
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,997
Is this a present? Are you kidding?

1156
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,209
- Yeah. Why don't you try it on?
- Yeah? I don't...

1157
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:03,964
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1158
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,925
- Yeah. Forget it.
- Here's a real present.

1159
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,094
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?

1160
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,346
- Check it out.
- Let me see.

1161
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,431
OK. Let's see.

1162
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,225
Oh, God!

1163
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:19,104
You knew I wanted this.
God! It's terrific. God!

1164
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,233
Just put on the watch and the...
and that thing and everything.

1165
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,235
Oh, God. Oh.

1166
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:37,622
# Seems like

1167
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:42,961
# Old times

1168
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,756
# Having you

1169
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,801
# To walk with

1170
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,555
# Seems like

1171
01:04:56,517 --> 01:05:01,521
# Old times

1172
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:07,277
# Having you to walk with

1173
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:13,700
# And it's still a thrill

1174
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:21,833
# Just to have my arms around you

1175
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,798
# Still the thrill

1176
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:36,681
# That it was the day I found you

1177
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:41,353
# Seems like

1178
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:49,778
# Old times

1179
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:55,951
# Dinner dates and flowers

1180
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:04,459
# Old times

1181
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:09,839
# Staying up all hours

1182
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:16,262
# Making dreams come true

1183
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:24,437
# Doing things we used to do

1184
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:36,282
# Seems like old times

1185
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:44,749
# Here with

1186
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:54,259
# You

1187
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:58,138
- (applause)
- Thank you.

1188
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:04,060
You were sensational. I told you
if you stuck to it you would be great.

1189
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,522
And... and you know...
you were sensational.

1190
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,734
Well, Alvy, they were
just a terrific audience.

1191
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:13,945
It makes it really easy for me
because I can be...

1192
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,488
Excuse me.

1193
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:17,032
Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1194
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,244
We just wanted to stop by and say
that we really enjoyed your set.

1195
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,413
Oh, yeah, really?

1196
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,416
I thought it was very musical
and I liked it a lot.

1197
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,585
That's really nice. Thanks a lot.

1198
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:32,088
Are you recording? Do you...
Are you with any label now?

1199
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,757
Me? No. (giggles)

1200
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,383
No. Not at all.

1201
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,846
Well, I'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1202
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:43,475
- Possibly working together.
- Well, that's nice.

1203
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,937
Oh, listen. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1204
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,982
No, but I know your work.
I'm a big fan of yours.

1205
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,151
Thank you very much.

1206
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,196
This is Shaun and Bob and...
Bob and Petronia.

1207
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,364
Hi.

1208
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,868
We're going back to the Pierre.
We're staying at the Pierre.

1209
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,288
We're gonna meet Jack
and Anjelica and have a drink.

1210
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,166
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1211
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,585
We can just sit and talk. Nothing...

1212
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,798
Not a big deal. It's just relaxed.
It would just be very mellow.

1213
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,509
Remember we have that thing.

1214
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,260
What thing?

1215
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,766
Don't you remember we discussed
that thing that we were... We had a...

1216
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,935
Oh, the thing!

1217
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,104
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1218
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,230
Yeah...

1219
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:34,901
Oh, well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine too. We'll do it another time.

1220
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,905
Maybe if you're on the coast,
we'll get together and meet there.

1221
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,574
It was a wonderful set.
I really enjoyed it.

1222
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,743
Nice to have met you. Good night.

1223
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,995
Bye.

1224
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,503
What's the matter?
You wanted to go to that party?

1225
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,131
I don't know.
I thought it might be kinda fun.

1226
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,591
It would be nice
to meet some new people.

1227
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:04,389
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1228
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,518
I have a tendency to...
If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot.

1229
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,687
It's not good for my...

1230
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,566
So you don't wanna go to the party.
So what do you wanna do?

1231
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,618
That was the last day
I remember really having a good time.

1232
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:29,747
- We never have any laughs any more.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1233
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:33,042
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1234
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:37,797
- Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
- Constantly. I'd say three times a week.

1235
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,843
- The other night Alvy wanted to have sex.
- She would not sleep with me.

1236
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:46,598
Then... I don't know... Six months ago
I would have done it just to please him.

1237
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:51,102
I tried everything, you know.
I put on soft music and my red light bulb.

1238
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,272
But the thing is,
since our discussions here,...

1239
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,900
..I feel I have a right to my own feelings.

1240
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,695
I think you would have been happy
because I asserted myself.

1241
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:05,700
I'm paying for her analysis. And she's
making progress and I'm getting screwed.

1242
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,745
I feel so guilty because
Alvy is paying for it.

1243
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,789
So I do feel guilty
if I don't go to bed with him.

1244
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:15,752
If I do go to bed with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

1245
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,881
She's making progress and I'm not.
Her progress is killing my progress.

1246
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,218
Sometimes I think
I should just live with a woman.

1247
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:27,430
I don't believe it! You mean to tell me
you guys have never snorted coke?

1248
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:31,100
Well, I always wanted to try.
But Alvy, he's very down on it.

1249
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:35,104
Don't put it on me. I don't wanna put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1250
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:37,273
There's the nasal membrane.

1251
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:41,069
- You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
- How can you say that?

1252
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,615
I said that you, I and that girl from your
acting class should have a threesome.

1253
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,576
- Well, that's sick!
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

1254
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,745
You didn't say it couldn't be sick.

1255
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,871
Come on, Alvy.

1256
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,040
Do your body a favour. Try it.

1257
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,085
I'm sure it's a lot of fun,
cos the Incas did it.

1258
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,254
And they were a million laughs.

1259
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,465
Come on. For your own experience.
You wanna write.

1260
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:06,594
It's great stuff. A friend of mine
just brought it in from California.

1261
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,639
Oh, you know, we're going
to California next week.

1262
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,392
It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know.

1263
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,396
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

1264
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:20,275
No. That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on television.

1265
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,027
You act like
you're violating a moral issue.

1266
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,823
We have to leave New York
during Christmas week, which kills me.

1267
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:32,245
Listen, while you're in California, could
you possibly score some coke for me?

1268
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:37,333
Oh, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll just put it
in a hollow heel that I have on my boot.

1269
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,919
How much is this stuff, incidentally?

1270
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,088
It's about $2,000 an ounce.

1271
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:45,383
Really? And what is the kick of it?
Cos I never...

1272
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:54,726
# We wish you a merry Christmas,
we wish you a merry Christmas...

1273
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:58,730
(Rob) I've never been so relaxed
as I have been since I moved here, Max.

1274
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:03,151
I want you to see my house. I live next to
Hugh Hefner. He lets me use the Jacuzzi.

1275
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,279
And the women are like
the women in Playboy magazine,...

1276
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,573
..only they can move their arms and legs.

1277
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,743
(Annie) I can't get over it -
this is really Beverly Hills.

1278
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,203
(Alvy) The architecture's so consistent.

1279
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,540
French next to Spanish
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1280
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,709
(Annie) God! It's so clean out here.

1281
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:23,504
(Alvy) They don't throw their garbage out.
They make it into TV shows.

1282
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,965
(Rob) Give us a break, Max.
It's Christmas.

1283
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,134
(Alvy) Can you believe this is Christmas?

1284
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,888
(Annie) It was snowing and
really grey in New York, naturally.

1285
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,265
(Alvy) Santa Claus'll have sunstroke.

1286
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,143
Max, there's no crime.
There's no mugging.

1287
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,312
(Alvy) There's no economic crime.

1288
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,692
But there's ritual religious-cult murders.
There's wheat-germ killers out here.

1289
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,154
While you're out here,
I want you to see some of my TV show.

1290
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,865
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1291
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:55,912
# Remember Christ our Saviour
was born on Christmas Day

1292
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,959
# To save us all from Satan's power
when we were gone astray...

1293
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:05,129
All right now, Charlie,
give me a good laugh here.

1294
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,257
- ..limousine to the track break down?
- (laughter)

1295
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,426
A little bigger.

1296
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,137
Max, you realise how immoral this all is?

1297
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:17,350
- Max, I got a hit series.
- I know. But you're adding fake laughs.

1298
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,102
..home so early.

1299
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,604
Give me a tremendous laugh here,
Charlie.

1300
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,232
We do this show live
in front of an audience.

1301
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,068
And nobody laughs,
cos the jokes aren't funny.

1302
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,362
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1303
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,074
Honey, you'd better lie down.
You've been in the sun too long.

1304
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,785
Now give me
a medium-sized chuckle here.

1305
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,954
And then a big hand.

1306
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,747
(applause)

1307
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,916
Is there booing on that?

1308
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,876
Oh, Max.

1309
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,711
I don't feel well.

1310
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:49,257
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I just got... very dizzy.

1311
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,676
- I feel dizzy, Max.
- Well, sit down.

1312
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,428
(coughs) Oh, Jesus!

1313
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,680
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

1314
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,725
- You wanna lie down?
- No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.

1315
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:02,854
- How about a ginger ale?
- Oh... Max, no.

1316
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,022
Maybe I'd better lie down.

1317
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:09,610
Why don't you try to get a little
of this down? It's just plain chicken.

1318
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,779
Oh, no. I can't eat this.

1319
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,948
I'm nauseous.

1320
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:18,911
If you can just give me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1321
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,748
I have to go out to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1322
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:26,335
There's nothing wrong with you, actually,
so far as I can tell.

1323
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,297
You have no fever.
No symptoms of anything serious.

1324
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:33,301
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor.

1325
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,387
Alvy, that was the show.
They said everything is fine.

1326
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,932
They found a replacement
so they're going to tape without you.

1327
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,143
Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show?

1328
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,938
- I know. Listen, doctor.
- I was just saying, I can't find anything.

1329
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,774
- Nothing at all?
- No. I could get a lab man up here.

1330
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,943
Can I have the salt, please?

1331
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:55,198
Perhaps it would be even better if we
took him to hospital for a day or two.

1332
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,366
- Hospital?
- Or there's no real way...

1333
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:00,411
- ..to tell what's going on.
- This is not bad, actually.

1334
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,461
(Alvy) Don't tell me we have to walk
from the car to the house.

1335
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:12,006
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

1336
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,468
I'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1337
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:18,804
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1338
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,973
All the good meetings are taken.

1339
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:24,101
Right now it's only a notion.
But I think I can get money...

1340
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,188
..to make it into a concept,
and then turn it into an idea.

1341
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,148
- Like this house, Max?
- Mm-hm.

1342
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,651
I even brought a map
to get us to the bathroom.

1343
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,362
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1344
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,531
What difference does that make?

1345
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,992
- I think he has a thing for Annie.
- No. Unfortunately, Max,...

1346
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,537
- ..he goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1347
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,705
The one with the VPL.

1348
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,874
- VPL?
- Visible Panty Line.

1349
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,585
- Max, she is gorgeous.
- Yeah, she's a ten, Max.

1350
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:53,172
- Great for you, cos you're used to twos.
- There are no twos, Max.

1351
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,927
The kind with shopping bags in Central
Park with surgical masks on, muttering.

1352
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:02,056
How do you like this couple? They just
came back from Masters and Johnson.

1353
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,183
Yeah. Intensive care ward.

1354
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,936
My God. Hey, Max,
I think she's giving me the eye.

1355
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,147
(Rob) If she comes over,
my brain'll turn into guacamole.

1356
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,441
- Hi.
- Hi. You're Alvy Singer, right?

1357
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:15,528
- Didn't we meet at EST?
- EST? No, I was never to EST.

1358
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:19,156
- Then how can you criticise it?
- Oh, he didn't say anything.

1359
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:23,160
I came out to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1360
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,330
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How you doing?

1361
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:29,709
- You taste to see if the food's poisoned?
- Yeah. He's great.

1362
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:33,879
You guys are wearing white. It must be
in the stars. Uri Geller must be here.

1363
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:36,048
We're gonna operate together.

1364
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:40,386
We just need about six weeks. In six
weeks we could cut the whole album.

1365
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,638
I don't know. This is strange to me.

1366
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:46,350
You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing you can have.

1367
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:49,353
- Yeah? Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1368
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,355
I don't know. I don't know.

1369
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:55,026
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good meeting.

1370
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:59,322
This is a great house. Really.
Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1371
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:03,618
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.

1372
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,329
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1373
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:09,999
Charlie Chaplin.
Right before his un-American thing.

1374
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,834
That's great.

1375
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:15,713
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

1376
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,718
I used to live there. I used to live there
for years, but... It's so dirty now.

1377
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,887
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.

1378
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,681
This is a really nice
screening room, Tony.

1379
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:28,184
There's another thing about New York.

1380
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:32,688
If you wanna see a movie, you have to
stand in line. It could be freezing.

1381
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,274
We saw Grand Illusion here last night.

1382
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,902
Hey, that's a great film if you're high.

1383
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,238
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing.

1384
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:43,407
No, thanks, man. I'm cool.

1385
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,619
It's wonderful. They just eat
and watch movies all day.

1386
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,788
And gradually you get old and die.

1387
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:51,457
It's important to make an effort
once in a while.

1388
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,126
Do you think his girlfriend's beautiful?

1389
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,837
A tad on the androgynous side,
but dynamite.

1390
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,340
Yeah. I forgot my mantra.

1391
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,592
(# swinging music)

1392
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,985
(Annie) That was fun.

1393
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:23,114
I don't think California's bad at all.

1394
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,491
It's a drag coming home.

1395
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,660
(Alvy) A lot of beautiful women.

1396
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,870
It was fun to flirt.

1397
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,039
(Annie) I have to face facts.

1398
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:36,335
I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work any more.

1399
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:40,339
(Alvy) I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1400
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,508
Why do I need this?

1401
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,928
(Annie) If only I had
the nerve to break up.

1402
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,179
But it would really hurt him.

1403
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:51,142
(Alvy) If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1404
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,520
It'd probably wreck her.
But I should be honest.

1405
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,857
Alvy, let's face it. You know...

1406
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,943
I don't think our relationship is working.

1407
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,155
I know. A relationship,
I think, is like a shark.

1408
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:07,616
It has to constantly move forward,
or it dies.

1409
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,162
And I think what we got on our hands
is a dead shark.

1410
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,081
Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?

1411
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,042
If it has my name on it,
then I guess it's mine.

1412
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,379
It sure has... You wrote
your name in all my books...

1413
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,840
..cos you knew this day was gonna come.

1414
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,385
Alvy, you wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

1415
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:30,973
No question. I think we're doing
the mature thing, without any doubt.

1416
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:36,270
All the books on death and dying are
yours, and all the poetry books are mine.

1417
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:41,025
Denial of Death. This is the first book
that I got you. Remember that day?

1418
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:44,695
Jeez, I feel like
there's a great weight off my back. Hm.

1419
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,864
Oh. Thanks, Annie.

1420
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,493
Oh, no, no, no. I mean,
I think it's really important for us...

1421
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,621
..to explore new relationships
and stuff like that.

1422
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,958
There's no question about that. Cos
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1423
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,669
My analyst thinks this move is key for me.

1424
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,632
And, you know, I trust her.
Because my analyst recommended her.

1425
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,427
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1426
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:10,721
And you know what the beauty part is?

1427
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,016
- We can always get back together again.
- Exactly.

1428
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:18,896
I don't think many couples could handle
this. Just break up and remain friends.

1429
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,900
Hey, this one's mine, this button.
I guess these are all yours.

1430
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,402
Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon.

1431
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,739
Impeach Lyndon Johnson.
Impeach Ronald Reagan.

1432
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,953
I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.

1433
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,664
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1434
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,918
Then the hell with her. If she likes
that lifestyle, let her live there.

1435
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,963
- He's a jerk, for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1436
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,843
He may have... Listen, Harvard makes
mistakes too. Kissinger taught there.

1437
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,011
Don't tell me you're jealous.

1438
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,722
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.

1439
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,954
Can I show you something, lady?
I have here...

1440
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:58,018
I found this in the apartment.

1441
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,814
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1442
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,983
Don't ask me why.

1443
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,485
Why don't you go out with other women?

1444
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:10,197
Well, I tried. But it's... you know,
it's very depressing.

1445
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,325
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1446
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:18,038
What are you making such a big deal
about? They're only lobsters.

1447
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,166
You're a grown man.
You know how to pick up a lobster.

1448
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:24,670
- I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
- When did you quit?

1449
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:25,921
16 years ago.

1450
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,506
What do you mean?

1451
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:28,966
Mean?

1452
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:33,345
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
Is that what you said?

1453
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,932
I don't understand.

1454
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,184
Are you joking or what?

1455
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,032
Central Park's turning green.

1456
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,076
Yeah. I saw that lunatic
that we used to see...

1457
01:21:56,244 --> 01:22:00,414
..with the pinwheel hat,
you know, and the roller skates.

1458
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,208
Listen, I... I want you to come back here.

1459
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,880
Well... Then I'm gonna
come out there and get you.

1460
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:14,553
What do you mean, where am I?
Where do you think I am?

1461
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,473
I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in.

1462
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,059
I... Well, I flew in to see you.

1463
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:24,396
Hey, listen. Can we not
debate this on the telephone?

1464
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:27,024
Because I feel that I got a temperature.

1465
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:32,029
And I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles
nausea already. I don't feel so good.

1466
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:36,742
Wherever you wanna meet. I don't care.
I'll drive in. I rented a car.

1467
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,578
(Alvy) I'm driving. What do you...

1468
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,831
What, is that such a miracle?
I'm driving myself.

1469
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,810
I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and...

1470
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,062
..a plate of mashed yeast.

1471
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,491
Hi.

1472
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,834
You look very pretty.

1473
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:30,671
Oh, no. I just lost
a little weight, that's all.

1474
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,845
Well... you look nice.

1475
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,724
I've been thinking about it,
and I think that we should get married.

1476
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,350
Oh, Alvy. Come on.

1477
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:47,271
Why? You wanna live out here?

1478
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,690
It's like living in Munchkin Land.

1479
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,152
What do you mean?
It's perfectly fine out here.

1480
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,320
I mean, Tony's very nice.

1481
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:59,700
And... well, I meet people
and I go to parties and we play tennis.

1482
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,953
I mean, that's a very big step for me,
you know.

1483
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,539
I mean, I'm able to enjoy people more.

1484
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,251
So... you're not gonna
come back to New York?

1485
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:13,255
What's so great about New York? It's
a dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1486
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:16,300
You didn't read Death in Venice
till I bought it for you.

1487
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:20,095
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1488
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:22,514
Cos it's an important issue.

1489
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:25,017
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life.

1490
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:28,103
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1491
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,773
You're like this island unto yourself.

1492
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,692
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1493
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:38,489
If one guy is starving someplace,
that's... it puts a crimp in my evening.

1494
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,785
So you wanna get married or what?

1495
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,081
No. We're friends.

1496
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,333
I wanna remain friends.

1497
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,461
OK.

1498
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,296
Check, please!

1499
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,632
You're mad, aren't you?

1500
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,302
Yes, of course I'm mad.
Because you love me. I know that.

1501
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:05,140
Alvy, I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life. I really can't.

1502
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,309
You know how wonderful you are.

1503
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:12,022
You know you're the reason that I got out
of my room and that I was able to sing...

1504
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,442
..and get more in touch
with my feelings and all that crap.

1505
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:19,655
Anyway, look, I don't wanna...
Listen, listen, listen, um...

1506
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,616
So what are you up to anyway, huh?

1507
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:28,789
The usual, you know. I'm trying to write.
I'm working on a play.

1508
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,377
(sighs) So what are you saying? You're
not coming back to New York with me?

1509
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,380
No. Look...

1510
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,341
I gotta go.

1511
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:42,052
- I flew 3,000 miles to see you.
- I'm late.

1512
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,180
Air miles. You know what
that does to my stomach?

1513
01:25:45,348 --> 01:25:48,433
It's a hectic time for Tony.
The Grammies are tonight.

1514
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,478
- The what?
- He's got a lot of records up for awards.

1515
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,731
They give awards for that music?
I thought just earplugs.

1516
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:57,734
Just forget it!
Let's just forget the conversation.

1517
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:01,363
Awards! They do nothing
but give out awards! I can't believe it.

1518
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:04,324
Greatest fascist dictator - Adolf Hitler.

1519
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,708
(engine wheezes)

1520
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,682
(police siren)

1521
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:39,067
I know what you're gonna say. I'm not a
great driver. I have some problems with...

1522
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:41,236
Can I see your licence, please?

1523
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:44,031
Just don't get angry or anything, cos I...

1524
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,200
I have my licence here.

1525
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,368
It's a rented car and I... I...

1526
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:49,494
Here.

1527
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,580
Don't give me your life...

1528
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,706
..story.

1529
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,875
Just pick up the licence.

1530
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:59,421
You have to ask nicely cos I've had
an extremely rough day. My girlfriend...

1531
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,757
Just give me the licence, please.

1532
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:06,345
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1533
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:09,139
I have a terrific problem with authority.

1534
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:12,184
It's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1535
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,194
So long, fellas. Keep in touch.

1536
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:35,791
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call, Max.

1537
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:39,211
Yeah. I had the feeling
that I got you at a bad moment.

1538
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,588
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1539
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,757
Twins, Max.

1540
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,176
16-year-olds.

1541
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,973
Can you imagine
the mathematical possibilities of that?

1542
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:55,143
You're an actor, Max. You should be
doing Shakespeare in the Park.

1543
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,188
I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.
I got mugged.

1544
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:03,068
I was playing Richard II, and two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1545
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:10,075
Max, are we driving through plutonium?

1546
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,869
It keeps out the alpha rays, Max.

1547
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,122
You don't get old.

1548
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:20,127
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1549
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,005
What is so incredibly great
about New York?

1550
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:26,133
It's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

1551
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,593
You didn't read it till I gave it to you.

1552
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:31,013
You only give me books
with "death" in the title.

1553
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,078
It's an important issue.

1554
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:34,975
You are totally incapable
of enjoying life.

1555
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,602
You're like New York. You're an island.

1556
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,481
OK. If that's all that we've been
through together means to you,...

1557
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:45,152
..I guess it's better if we just
say goodbye, once and for all.

1558
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,656
You know, it's funny, after all the serious
talks and passionate moments,...

1559
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:53,744
..that it ends here, in a health-food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1560
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:56,079
Goodbye, Sunny.

1561
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,748
Wait.

1562
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm gonna go with you.

1563
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:03,086
I love you.

1564
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,508
What do you want? It was my first play.

1565
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:12,929
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1566
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,432
..because it's real difficult in life.

1567
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,686
Interestingly, however,
I did run into Annie again.

1568
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,481
It was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1569
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:26,026
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in SoHo with some guy.

1570
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:30,030
And when I met her, she was dragging
him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity,...

1571
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,116
..which I counted as a personal triumph.

1572
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:36,286
Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that and...

1573
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,872
..just kicked around old times.

1574
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:45,837
(Annie) # Just to have my arms

1575
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:50,967
# Around you

1576
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:57,349
# Still the thrill that it was

1577
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:01,812
# The day I found you

1578
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:07,150
# Seems like

1579
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:14,491
# Old times

1580
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:22,791
# Dinner dates and flowers

1581
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:26,962
# Old times

1582
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,382
(Alvy) After that,
it got pretty late and we both had to go.

1583
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,781
But it was great
seeing Annie again.

1584
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:35,011
I realised what a terrific
person she was...

1585
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,806
..and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

1586
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,684
And I thought of that old joke, you know.

1587
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,979
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says,...

1588
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:47,941
.."Doc, my brother's crazy.
He thinks he's a chicken."

1589
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,528
And the doctor says,
"Well, why don't you turn him in?"

1590
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,739
And the guy says,
"I would, but I need the eggs."

1591
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:59,327
Well, I guess that's pretty much now
how I feel about relationships.

1592
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:04,458
You know, they're totally irrational
and crazy and absurd and...

1593
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:11,006
But I guess we keep going through it
because most of us need the eggs.

1594
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:19,848
(Annie) # You
