1
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:21,561
Clear the way, people.
Superstar comin' through.

2
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,722
Superstar comin' through.

3
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:28,034
And her jet_set friend,
Miss Lola Lafonda.

4
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:30,070
Lola Lafonda?

5
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:34,039
lf people figure out l'm Lilly,
it's only a short jump to Miley.

6
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:37,839
Oh, very smart, Miss Lola.

7
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:40,940
Thank you, everybody.
l love you all. Thank you.

8
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:43,711
This is totally insane.
Back off, people. Back off.

9
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:47,049
Don't make me release Thor.

10
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:52,485
Yeah, you go get 'em, Thor. Two pounds
of pure piddle just looking for a target.

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,529
_ Actually, l think he just...
_ Oh, man!

12
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,791
Hannah! Wait!

13
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:01,232
Oh, no. lt's Oliver again.

14
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:06,569
He snuck into my dressing room last week,
nearly jumped on stage the week before

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,475
and just when you think he can't get any
more obsessed... he kicked it up a notch.

16
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,036
Look at those bony little elbows go.

17
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:16,742
That boy cuts through the crowd
like a Weedwacker.

18
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,342
Let me through!

19
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,914
Hannah, please. Kiss my hand
and l'll never wash it again.

20
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,459
Looks like he never
washes it now.

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,158
Come on, Thor,
make yourself useful.

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,429
Baby. You're an animal.

23
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:37,636
l like 'em feisty.

24
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:42,267
_ Let's rock_'n'_roll, driver.
_ He's never gonna give up.

25
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:45,437
Better hope he does,
because if he finds out your secret,

26
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:49,312
he's not only gonna be in love with
Hannah Montana, he'll be in love with you.

27
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:51,442
What? That's crazy.

28
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:55,545
The only thing that's the same
about Hannah Montana and me is...

29
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,488
me.

30
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:00,527
And me doesn't feel that way
about him.

31
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:03,753
Don't worry.
l know guys, and sooner or later,

32
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,790
he's gonna get tired of chasing after
somebody that's not chasing him back.

33
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:19,170
Do a dude a favor
and don't get on the freeway.

34
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,339
For you, my love.

35
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:27,847
Why did you have to be
such a good kisser?

36
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:29,644
lt's all true.
Hannah actually kissed this hand.

37
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:33,551
_ You gotta be kidding me.
_ A big, slobbery wet one.

38
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,111
Look. lt's still shiny.

39
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:41,485
Yeah, there's nothing like
the romantic glow of dog drool.

40
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,359
Chad, dude.
Close up shop when you chew.

41
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:51,336
You're getting spit
on the Hannah hand.

42
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:57,842
Miley, let's go.
You're cutting into my tan time.

43
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,141
Look at him.
He's never gonna quit.

44
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:04,207
What happens if he does find out?
l really do care about Oliver.

45
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,549
And l just don't wanna weird out
our friendship.

46
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:14,083
Unless, deep down, maybe,
just maybe, you feel the same way.

47
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:20,958
Yes, and maybe,
just maybe, that's insane.

48
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,265
And now that she's
left her mark on me,

49
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,275
it's time to take our relationship
to the next step.

50
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:33,143
Tonight at her CD signing,
l'm gonna stare into her eyes and say:

51
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:39,015
''You are my love, my life.
Someday you'll be my...''

52
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,053
Note to self:
''Think of words that rhyme with 'life.'''

53
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,753
Dude, isn't that the Hannah hand?

54
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:56,259
The CD signing. lf he stares into my eyes,
he might recognize me.

55
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:59,134
_ That's never gonna happen.
_ But what if it does?

56
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:02,141
You could learn to love him,
like with my brother's hamster.

57
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,406
And here's the beauty part.
lf Oliver dies,

58
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,539
you won't have to bury him
in the backyard.

59
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:13,985
When you talk, do you hear it,
or is it like a big roaring in your ears?

60
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,284
Step off, Chad.

61
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,521
Fine. But you're gonna
throw this away for me.

62
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,100
Take it off, dude! Take it off!

63
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:30,728
Dude. What's with you
and the gum_chewing?

64
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,539
Little Baby Ollie.
Aunt Harriet just wants to eat you up.

65
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:41,877
'Cause you're yummy,
yummy, yummy.

66
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,318
Let me kiss that off you.

67
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,959
l hate that woman.

68
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:04,602
Been sittin' here all morning,
l'm trying to write a song.

69
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:09,770
Can't remember
when it ever took me this dang long.

70
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:14,746
Maybe l should just up and fly the coop
'Cause everything l've written sounds like...

71
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,079
l got it, Dad, l got it.

72
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,311
Prepare to be blown away.

73
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:22,412
This better be good, son.
l was in the middle of a masterpiece.

74
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:27,517
Jackson Stewart, come on down.
You are the proud owner of a brand_new...

75
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,289
used car.

76
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,456
Yes, over the last 1 5 years,

77
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:35,161
this preowned beauty's been driven
by heavy smokers and sloppy eaters

78
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:40,434
and one Wilma McDermott, whose cat
popped out six kittens on the front seat.

79
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:44,068
Yes, some stains
just don't come out.

80
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,671
_ And you're happy about that.
_ Yes, l am.

81
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:50,342
Dad, it's mine.
lt's not perfect,

82
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,284
but it's my own car,
and l bought it with my own money.

83
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,845
l'm proud of you. Especially
the bought_it_with_your_own_money part.

84
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,154
_ Let's take a look at this puppy.
_ Puppies.

85
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:03,322
_ That reminds me. And in the back seat...
_ l don't wanna know.

86
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
Yep, there she is.

87
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,208
Clean, no dents and...

88
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,838
there's that stain.

89
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:24,042
_ Where is it?
_ lt's right here.

90
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,980
This?

91
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,852
l know.
l can't believe it's mine, either.

92
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:33,290
And l can't believe
you just bought a girl car.

93
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,418
What?

94
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:36,655
Jackson, only girls drive this thing.

95
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,928
lt's a chick mobile,
a babe bucket, a skirt scooter.

96
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,629
You might as well have bought
a bra with tires, man.

97
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:47,970
You are so wrong.
This is totally a guy's car.

98
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,475
When l was driving home,
there was guys honking

99
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:53,980
and waving and...
giving me kissy faces.

100
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:57,881
Oh, no, Dad.
Tell me l didn't just buy a chick car.

101
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,646
You didn't buy a chick car.

102
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,985
Now say it like you mean it.

103
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:09,118
l'd like to, son, but you know
how ladies like to have the final word.

104
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,805
Thank you so much.
l love you all. Thank you.

105
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,067
Thank you.

106
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,609
Let's boogie, driver.

107
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:29,048
That was great. Oliver stared
right into my eyes and never had a clue.

108
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:33,610
Kinda like the look
he has in Spanish.

109
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:37,214
l don't know what
l was so worried about anyways.

110
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,886
Better pull over, driver.

111
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,760
Don't be scared.
lt's me _ Oliver Oken.

112
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,201
Wow. You're even more beautiful
upside down.

113
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:54,170
Thank you. You're so sweet.

114
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:56,539
He was talking to me.

115
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,274
Look, you are very sweet,
but l have a boyfriend.

116
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:06,376
A boyfriend? Wait, l don't understand.
Then why did you kiss me?

117
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,819
l didn't. The dog did.

118
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:14,421
Ah, man!

119
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:18,828
Those are the lips l've been thinking about
for the past 24 hours?

120
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,596
l'm sorry.
l was trying not to hurt your feelings.

121
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:27,163
lt's just that...
l'm just not interested. OK?

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,333
OK. l get it.

123
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,742
Now get down off the roof, son,
before you dent it. This is a rental.

124
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:35,805
Fine. l won't bother you anymore.

125
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:39,943
lf it helps,
the dog hasn't stopped talking about you.

126
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,951
_ You must think l'm pathetic.
_ No. l think you're sweet.

127
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,995
_ And maybe if l didn't have a boyfriend...
_ l'd have a chance?

128
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,053
_ l never said that.
_ But you implied it.

129
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:54,692
And that's good enough.
l'll wait for you forever.

130
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,862
_ l never said that.
_ Forever. Do you hear me, Hannah?

131
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:59,735
Forever.

132
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:02,206
That was close.
He almost got you tonight.

133
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,573
Ya think?

134
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,545
You know what that boy needs?
A real girlfriend.

135
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:12,074
Dad, that is...
the smartest thing you've ever said.

136
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:18,153
You know what they say _ every now and
then, even a blind pig snorts up a truffle.

137
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:20,557
And that is the weirdest.

138
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,326
That's right _ it's me.

139
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,801
_ Yo, locker man.
_ l'm up.

140
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,339
_ l owe you.
_ l'll be back to collect.

141
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,376
Locker man.

142
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,005
You're amazing, Oliver.

143
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,346
l've been told that.

144
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,648
_ Having trouble with your locker, Chad?
_ Yeah. Could you?

145
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:50,849
Well, locker man is on the job, but...

146
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:53,552
not for you, sucker.

147
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,228
Oliver.
See that girl Pamela over there?

148
00:11:57,297 --> 00:12:00,528
_ She thinks you're cute.
_ Can't say that l disagree.

149
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Too bad l'm cruising
down the Hannah Highway.

150
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:07,167
What about Kyla Goodwin?

151
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:11,938
She is so desperate
she'll go out with anybody.

152
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:15,743
My type of woman.
Too bad l'm taken.

153
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:20,448
What about Lilly?
You guys would be perfect together.

154
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,317
_ Excuse me?
_ You're both stubborn.

155
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,755
_ l am not.
_ See? You always agree.

156
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,784
_ No, we don't.
_ l am definitely seeing a couple here.

157
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:31,194
You're not... because l'm not...

158
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:37,798
That's smart, because what if one friend
loved another but didn't get loved back?

159
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:41,363
Then things would get weird,
and they couldn't be friends anymore.

160
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,239
And there is nothing more important
than our friendship.

161
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,836
Oh, man, you love me.

162
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:47,902
No.

163
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,882
l mean, l do love you.
But like a brother or a pet fish.

164
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,785
l'd cry if l had to flush you down the toilet,
but l don't wanna kiss you.

165
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,688
That's a relief,
because you're my buddy.

166
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:00,521
l think Hannah and you
could wind up being close friends.

167
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,290
_ Closer than you think.
_ Great.

168
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:07,094
Once Hannah and l are together,
we'll have you over for some sushi.

169
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,759
Yeah.

170
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,610
Soon, my love, we'll be together.

171
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,284
You enjoy that.

172
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,256
This isn't over, pal.

173
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,658
Goodbye.

174
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,963
Hello again.

175
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:47,632
l know that look. Either you have
a great idea or you really gotta go.

176
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:51,609
Oliver is about to totally get turned off
to Hannah Montana.

177
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,839
And l really gotta go.

178
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,360
l can't believe
he wouldn't take the car back.

179
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,026
l thought l made
a very convincing argument.

180
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:18,559
Well, technically, son,
getting on your hands and knees

181
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:22,870
and begging for a do_over
is not really an argument.

182
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:27,141
_ Hey there, neighbor.
_ Oh, man, it's Mr. Dontzig.

183
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,147
And he's wearing his robe again.

184
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:33,151
Yeah, well, count your blessings.
At least this time it's the long one.

185
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,347
So... Stewart family.

186
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:42,254
What would another leaf from your tree
be doing in my hot tub?

187
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,594
l don't know.
Maybe it wanted to party.

188
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:51,602
_ Come on. Just trying to be neighborly.
_ That's nice.

189
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,232
But l hate neighbors.
That's why l got the big hedge.

190
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:59,505
So, something needs to be done
about this.

191
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,810
Yeah. And l think something needs
to be done about this.

192
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:08,047
l would recommend possibly some sit_ups
or maybe a bigger robe.

193
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,589
Very neighborly.

194
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,488
Got a new car.

195
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,392
You know, my wife,
she had a car just like this.

196
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,954
Traded it in.
She thought it was too girly.

197
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,829
Get your leaves out of my hot tub!

198
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:27,907
l'll have you know that we Stewart men
don't define ourselves

199
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,408
by the types of cars we drive.

200
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:33,969
That's it. This dolly wagon's
going back where it came from.

201
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:38,484
_ But the salesperson already said no.
_ To you, not to me.

202
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,884
Face it, son _ l'm a bit more intimidating.

203
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,253
Lord, take me now.

204
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,664
_ l came as fast as l could. ls she still here?
_ There.

205
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:59,364
l can't believe you saw Hannah
break up with her boyfriend on our beach

206
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,930
the moment l was getting home
from the orthodontist.

207
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,637
_ l know. Knock, knock. Who's there? Fate.
_ Fate who?

208
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,577
Just go.

209
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:11,884
_ This is it.
_ Good luck, Oliver. But remember:

210
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:15,011
lf things don't work out,
you're still Smokin' Oken.

211
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:18,489
_ Thanks, but it's gonna work out.
_ Absolutely.

212
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:21,721
But if it doesn't, Smokin' Oken.

213
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,722
'Nuff said.

214
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:32,099
lt's me. Oliver. l heard about your breakup,
and l'm here for you.

215
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:34,834
lf you need a hug, my arms are open.

216
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:40,574
_ Get away from me.
_ l can do that.

217
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,423
Hannah?

218
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,257
Hi. The kid from the moonroof.
Look at you, all upside right.

219
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:07,839
Where are my manners?
Sit down, sweetie. Join the party.

220
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:10,375
Here. You want some gum?
Load yourself up.

221
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,468
l didn't know you liked gum.

222
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:17,539
l've surfed all your websites, and none
of them mentioned you're a chewer.

223
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:20,552
l'm a chewer, all right.
l love to chew.

224
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,781
l chew all the time, like a train.

225
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:29,222
l chew in the morning,
the afternoon, the evening.

226
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:34,255
_ lf it can be chewed, it's in my mouth.
_ Good to know.

227
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,768
You should think about
updating your websites.

228
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,670
Why? Does it bother you?
lt really turns off some people.

229
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,143
They can't even be around me.
They love me, but l disgust them.

230
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,475
Well, l'm not like that.

231
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:49,915
You're not?

232
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:52,713
_ Because it's OK if you are.
_ No.

233
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:57,313
Relationships are about sacrifice,
and l accept you just the way you are.

234
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,187
Good to know.

235
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:05,897
Move over, boys.
New chew comin' through.

236
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:17,170
Your mouth... lt's...

237
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,143
Turning black?

238
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,113
lt's licorice. l love licorice.

239
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:25,049
Don't make me laugh _
it comes out my nose.

240
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:27,814
_ You wanna see?
_ No.

241
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,856
Too late. She's about to blow.

242
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:35,258
Am l grossing you out?
Because l totally understand

243
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:38,058
if you want to transfer
your obsession to Mandy Moore.

244
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,998
_ You know, she's blond again.
_ No, no, no.

245
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:45,561
My love is bigger than my disgust
and your black drippage.

246
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,607
Black drippage. Watch this.

247
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,769
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.

248
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,277
How do you like me now?

249
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,253
l...

250
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:10,619
_ ...still love you
_ What does it take with you?

251
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:12,756
What more do l have to do?

252
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:16,563
You and Hannah Montana
are never gonna be together.

253
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:17,933
Why not?

254
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,129
Because...

255
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:25,806
l'm Hannah Montana. Me. Miley.

256
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,350
OK, that went well.

257
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,256
_ You were Hannah in the limo?
_ Yeah.

258
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:41,054
_ Backstage when l hung out the window?
_ Yep.

259
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,096
And when l hid in your bass drum
and rode on your tour bus to Phoenix?

260
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,792
_ You did what?
_ Nothing.

261
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,335
_ How come you didn't tell me?
_ l'm sorry.

262
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:53,497
lt's just that l knew
that you were so in love with Hannah

263
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,406
that l was afraid that
maybe you might...

264
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,535
Be in love with you?

265
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,613
Do you think l am?

266
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:08,211
You tell me. l mean, have you ever pictured
yourself with Miley, your friend the dork?

267
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,586
_ You're not a dork.
_ Oh, come on.

268
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:15,560
What about the time l tripped in the biology
lab and spilled frog juice all over you?

269
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:20,156
Right. Mom made me take off my pants
in the school parking lot.

270
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,999
Or when we were at Andrew's birthday
party and you accidentally knocked me

271
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,664
into the pool
in your one_man stampede for the cake?

272
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:27,933
That's not fair.

273
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:32,774
lt was an ice_cream log cake,
and you know l have to get an end cut.

274
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,313
Come on, Oliver.

275
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:40,876
Let's face it. The girl you thought you loved
is standing right here, and the truth is...

276
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,285
you don't love her.

277
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:46,348
Wow. l think you're right.

278
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,458
That's two years of my life
l'll never get back.

279
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,626
Sorry about that. So, what do you think?
Are we gonna be OK?

280
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,559
Yeah, we're OK.

281
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,239
_ Anything?
_ No.

282
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:04,071
ln fact, it's a little awkward.

283
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,036
Let's go grab a hot dog.

284
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:12,578
So... Mandy Moore. You don't happen to
have her number, do you?

285
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,033
Boy, you bounce back fast.

286
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:23,200
Where's my dad? lt's been hours.

287
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:26,610
He couldn't sell it _ that's what it is.
And now he can't face me.

288
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,876
Maybe something good happened.

289
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,851
Maybe he parked it
and a bunch of cheerleaders stole it.

290
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,853
You think so?

291
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,649
Here he comes.

292
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:41,252
Still driving it.

293
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:46,892
l knew it. Failure.
You're a failure as a father.

294
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:51,462
Get a grip. They wouldn't take the car back,
but l did do something to beef it up a little.

295
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:57,277
Dad, changing the horn
is not gonna make it a guy car.

296
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,745
l know. But this might.

297
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:05,711
Dang. This is tight.

298
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:11,082
_ Son, l primped your ride.
_ Oh, yes, he did.

299
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,828
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

300
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:19,366
thank you, thank you, thank you.

301
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:21,561
OK, son, you can let go now.

302
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:25,663
lt was cute when you were five.
Now it just throws my back out.
