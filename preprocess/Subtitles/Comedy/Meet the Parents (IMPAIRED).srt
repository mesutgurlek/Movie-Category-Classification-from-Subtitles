(Choir) # Show me a man

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,978
# Who's gentle and kind

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,612
# And I'll show you

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,656
# A loser

5
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,749
# Now show me a man

6
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,320
# Who takes what he wants

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,993
# 0h, how exciting

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,739
# 0h, how exciting

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,207
# So the poets sing

10
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,443
# When you're a fool in love

11
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,376
# And nothing goes the way you plan

12
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,016
# And no one cares

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,149
# And no one understands

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,159
# That you're a fool

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,751
# And you're in love

16
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,023
# Never another spring for you

17
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,635
# Never a robin to sing for you

18
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,038
# You're out there on your own

19
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,671
# When you're a fool in love

20
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,343
# When you're a fool in love

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,620
# Seems like the skies

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,281
# Are always gray

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,489
# You turn around,
there's someone in your way

24
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,723
# And it's you

25
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,128
# And you're in love

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,399
# Sometimes you think
that your luck has changed

27
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,567
# And a rainbow explodes
'cross the sky

28
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,539
# But when you're a fool in love

29
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:03,286
# You'll be a fool
till the day you die #

30
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,035
(Man) I know we haven't been
together that long,

31
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,480
but these last 10 months have been
the happiest of my life.

32
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,848
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend...

33
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,785
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

34
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,383
Will you marry me?

35
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,693
Yes.

36
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,288
Seriously, do you think
that sounds good?

37
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,529
- No!
- Really? Cos I think that...

38
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,194
No!

39
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,865
0h! 0h! Sorry. Sorry.

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,273
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

41
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,470
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

42
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,107
You got a real gentle touch
there, Doctor.

43
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,579
She won't be able to say no.

44
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,885
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

45
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,519
- Good luck, Greg.
- Thanks, Cameron.

46
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,902
0K, it's time for
our problem of the week.

47
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,606
I want you to pick out
your problem,

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,337
a problem that's been
bothering you all week.

49
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,279
With your eyes still closed...

50
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,246
I want you to picture
that problem in your mind.

51
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,981
Pretend it's right there
in front of you.

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,647
..not only my best friend,

53
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,351
but you're also
the person that I...

54
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,621
want to spend the rest
of my life with.

55
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,631
I love you. Will you...marry me?

56
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,032
Now I want you to scare
your problems away.

57
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,663
- I want you to say "boo"!
- Boo!

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,503
- B00!
- B00!

59
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,308
All right, you guys are great.
Very good.

60
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,405
I will see you guys after lunch.

61
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,177
Pam, isn't that your special friend?

62
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,312
Yeah, I think so.

63
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,183
- Why don't you talk to him?
- You think I should?

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,658
(Kids) Yeah!

65
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,556
Come here!

66
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,366
(Giggling)

67
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,426
- Hi, sweetie.
- How're you doing?

68
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,668
I was in the area, got off early,
thought you'd want to go eat.

69
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,540
That's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

70
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,910
0h, shoot!
I forgot to change my shoes.

71
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,883
That's 0K. You know I can't resist
a man in nurse's shoes.

72
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,388
I got my sneakers here.
Let me change. It'll take a second.

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,979
Huh! 0K.

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,656
- Honey?
- Hmm?

75
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,489
- Pam.
- Yeah?

76
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,223
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

77
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,698
Come on, sweetie. I got a half-hour
before I have to be back.

78
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,566
So you wanna go have lunch?

79
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,901
(Chuckling) What are you doing?

80
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,875
Um, nothing. I just love you so much.

81
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,936
These last 10 months...have been
the happiest of my life.

82
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,677
Yeah, they've been amazing, but...
What's going on?

83
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,710
Nothing. I just...I just feel like,
you know, we're so close.

84
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,556
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and...

85
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,095
You 0K, sweetie? You're acting weird.

86
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,892
I just got a crick in my neck.

87
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,899
I did CPR
on a 300-pound crack head today.

88
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,299
- Want me to massage your neck?
- No, no.

89
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,703
Honey, your kids are
trying to tell you something!

90
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,832
- (Phone)
- 0h, hold on.

91
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,069
0h, it's my sister. Hello. Hi.

92
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,749
You're engaged? Congratulations!

93
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:55,311
You're getting married in two weeks?
That's...a little soon.

94
00:05:55,388 --> 00:06:00,291
Mom and Dad...really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was 0K with this?

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
Wow. That was very thoughtful of him.

96
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,624
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

97
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,961
Yeah.

98
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,164
I'm just here with Greg.
He's taking me to lunch. He's 0K.

99
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,402
I know you've got to go.
All right. I love you. Bye.

100
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,037
So, what's going on?
Debbie's marrying that guy?

101
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,603
Yeah. In two weeks.

102
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,013
Dr. Bob of Denver. Isn't that great?

103
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,951
Yeah, that's... Didn't they
just meet a few months ago?

104
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,682
Yeah, but he asked her
and she said yes.

105
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,588
Well, he asked my dad first.

106
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah, I overheard that.
So he had to ask his permission?

107
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,392
No, he didn't have to.

108
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,025
Bob just understood
that Dad appreciates that.

109
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,195
- Mm-hm.
- Deb said that Dad loves him.

110
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,967
Bob bought him the perfect gift
that just won him over.

111
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,805
Really. Huh, a gift.

112
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,440
(Pam) Is it 0K to X-ray this?
(Greg) Yeah. It won't mutate.

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,812
- Sir, that's not gonna fit.
- Wait a second.

114
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,287
It's too big. You got to check it.

115
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,292
(Beep)

116
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,160
Raise your arms, sir.

117
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,166
Look, I got an engagement ring
in the bag,

118
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,499
so I can't open it here,
can't I just carry it on?

119
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,201
If it don't fit through the frame,
you ain't carrying it on the plane.

120
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,767
531, New York, La Guardia. Check it.

121
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,710
Wait, wait, excuse me...

122
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,011
Don't worry,
it'll be waiting for you there.

123
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:40,550
(PA) 'Welcome to La Guardia Airport.
Please follow the signs...'

124
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:52,661
Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag
and there's a diamond ring inside it.

125
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,933
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

126
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,738
Put your address here
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

127
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,073
And if it doesn't?

128
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,706
Am I supposed to go the whole weekend
with just these clothes?

129
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,085
(Pam) It's great. I just thought
you were getting champagne.

130
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,954
Trust me,
your dad's gonna love this gift.

131
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,255
Well, don't forget he's retired.

132
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,957
He was in the rare flower business,
he'll be interested.

133
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,463
Sounds like they're hard to please.

134
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,993
No, not at all.
He's the sweetest man in the world.

135
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:30,031
- He's gonna love you. I promise.
- As much as he loves Dr. Bob?

136
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,909
(Pam) Easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is wasted on my parents.

137
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,005
(Greg) What, are they Amish?

138
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,111
(Greg) 0K, no jokes.

139
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,589
- What are you doing?
- What?

140
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,594
My dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

141
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,462
- 0K, I'll leave them in the car.
- No! He'll check there.

142
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,500
- 0h, gosh...
- What...?!

143
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,468
Yeah, the roof
is probably a better idea.

144
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,838
0h, and...

145
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,605
we're not living together.

146
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,511
- I thought you said you told them.
- Well...

147
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,314
Hi, Daddy! Hi!

148
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,719
- 0h, I missed you so much, Pamcake.
- I missed you too, Popjack.

149
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,586
(Kissing)

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,823
0h, boy! 0h, boy! 0h, boy!
0h, boy! 0h, boy! 0h, boy!

151
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,956
(Both) Shortstack, shortstack,
coming up!

152
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,125
Pop-pop, pop-pop, pop-pop-pop!

153
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,499
Where's my widdle girl?

154
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,937
Mommy! My mom!

155
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,837
0h, you look so beautiful!

156
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,433
(Pam) So do you! Look at you!

157
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,775
0h, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

158
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,646
- Hi, I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.
- It's great to meet you.

159
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,584
- I'm Dina. Welcome to 0yster Bay.
- Thanks.

160
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,388
What you driving, a Ford?

161
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,189
Uh, yeah. It's a Taurus.

162
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,163
We were gonna get a mid-size,

163
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,200
but I figure, hey,
pulling down decent bucks,

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,066
might as well go all out
and pop for the full-size.

165
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,004
True. Interesting color.
You pick it?

166
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,872
0h, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

167
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,343
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

168
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,377
- But you didn't pick it.
- (Dina) Jack!

169
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,941
(Sniffing)

170
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,420
0h, yucky!
What smells of old sour milk?

171
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,719
0h, poor Greg got spit up on
by a baby.

172
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,156
He didn't!

173
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,024
He did, Ma, at Lost Luggage.
The airline lost his bag.

174
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,723
0h! They didn't!

175
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,321
Yeah, they did.

176
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,333
- What about you, honey?
- No, I carried on.

177
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,632
That's my girl!

178
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,331
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

179
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,070
And Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask, huh?

180
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,374
That's right. Mi casa es su casa.

181
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,778
0h, thanks, Jack. You, too.

182
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,441
Yeah, ha ha!

183
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,115
Hey, Momma, looks great!

184
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,712
Really?
We spruced up for the wedding.

185
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,450
This is so nice!

186
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,958
(Jack) We like it.

187
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,961
(Greg) Beautiful.

188
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,465
0h, now, Greg,
you have a very unique last name.

189
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,626
And we were curious, er,

190
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,227
how do you pronounce it?

191
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,000
0h. Just like it's spelled.

192
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,474
F-0-C-K-E-R.

193
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,672
Focker.

194
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,441
Hmm... Focker.

195
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,839
Mm-hm.

196
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,247
- I'll get it, honey.
- 0h, thanks, Mom.

197
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,218
0h, there he is!

198
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,724
(Pam) Jinxy!

199
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,387
Come here, baby!
Come to Daddy, Jinxy!

200
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,724
Come on, Jinxy!

201
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,027
Come here. Come to Daddy.

202
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,966
Come on. 0h!
Taught him that in one week.

203
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,027
(Jack) This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.

204
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,903
- Say hello. Wave to Greg.
- Hello, Jinx.

205
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,068
Attaboy!
That took me another week.

206
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,977
- My gosh!
- I didn't know you had a cat.

207
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,515
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

208
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,414
Your daddy's best friend!

209
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,353
You won't believe it,
he even taught him to use the potty.

210
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,083
Dad, that's kinda weird.

211
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,183
Why? Now we don't have
to smell kitty litter.

212
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,488
That's right.

213
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,793
How did you teach
the cat to use the toilet?

214
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,130
Easy. I designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet.

215
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,636
0nce he got used to it,
I took it away.

216
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,865
0h! That's... Yeah, makes sense.

217
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,809
But he doesn't like it. Every chance
he gets he tries to squat and bury.

218
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,176
I had to move all my plants.

219
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,774
Plus you got another guy
in the house to leave the seat up.

220
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:39,015
He can't lift the seat. He lacks
the strength and opposable thumbs.

221
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,391
Ah, right. 0pposable...
Didn't think about that.

222
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,398
Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out.
He lacks survival skills.

223
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,559
It's just one of those things.

224
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,628
I don't think Greg will
be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats.

225
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,107
Pam, I don't hate cats.

226
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,543
I don't... I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.

227
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,672
Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,512
Well, it's 0K if you hate cats, Greg.

229
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,052
I don't. I don't hate cats...at all.

230
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,318
That's 0K. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

231
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,258
I'm being honest, really. Like what?

232
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,697
Why don't we let the kids freshen up?

233
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:24,395
Greg, we'll get you something
to wear from Jack's closet.

234
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,165
0K.

235
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,001
- 0h, honey.
- Yeah?

236
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,507
I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

237
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,575
Me, too, Daddy.

238
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,279
Hey, listen, be nice to this one, 0K?

239
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,215
I kinda like him.

240
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,083
0K, I'll try.

241
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,315
Thank you.

242
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,460
Shirt fit 0K, Greg?

243
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,362
Fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

244
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,367
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

245
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,926
I wish you hadn't said
that I hate cats.

246
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,369
You do hate cats.

247
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,135
But you didn't have to say
right when we met.

248
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

249
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,402
Get your red hot pu-pus!

250
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,310
My goodness! What is that?

251
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,782
0h, that's just...
a little something from me.

252
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,717
Go ahead, open it up.

253
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,120
0h, look, honey.
Greg brought us a present!

254
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,090
0h, isn't that nice?

255
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,161
Look at this. It's a flower pot...
with the dirt in it.

256
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,328
Mm.

257
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,464
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,101
The bulb of a Jerusalem Tulip.

259
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,312
Which, I was told,

260
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,340
is one of the rarest and most
beautiful flowers in existence.

261
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,854
0h, right, right.
Uh, the Jerusalem.

262
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:54,392
From the Jerusalis tulipizius genus,
yes, yes.

263
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,126
Anyway, the guy said
with regular watering

264
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,257
it should bloom in six months.

265
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,995
Well, we'll look forward to that.

266
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,976
(Pam clears throat)

267
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,479
So, uh, Greg, how's your job?

268
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,415
Um, good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

269
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,114
I recently got transferred to triage.

270
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,122
Is that better than a nurse?

271
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,150
No, Mom, triage is a unit of the ER.
That's where all the top nurses work.

272
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,130
- Well...
- No. They do.

273
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,368
Not many men in your profession.

274
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,430
No, Jack. Not traditionally.

275
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,666
Mm-hm.

276
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:47,339
Pam, did you know that your father
started his own business?

277
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,347
Really? Dad, that's great!

278
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,905
0h, wow!

279
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:55,317
Yes, I thought with my experience,
why let retirement stop me?

280
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,378
I really admire that.

281
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,755
So what is it? What's...?
What's the new venture?

282
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,386
0h, let me ask you a question, Greg.

283
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,796
Let's say you have kids and you wanna
get out of the house, you know?

284
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,996
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

285
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,904
References, experience -
all check out fine.

286
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,135
But, how do you know for certain

287
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,577
that your loved ones
are safe with this stranger?

288
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,845
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?

289
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,885
Sure. I think so.

290
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,355
No. The answer is you cannot.

291
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,760
Let me show you something.

292
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,525
Take a look at this, Greg.

293
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,064
What's this look like to you?

294
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,901
It looks like a teddy bear.

295
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,473
Smile. You're on nanny camera!

296
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,804
0h! 0h!

297
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,072
I've seen these advertised on TV.

298
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,842
Not like this you haven't.
Take a look.

299
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,845
- 0h, my gosh.
- 0h.

300
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,250
Hi. Where's the other camera?

301
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,586
Right here
in this decorative artifact.

302
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,285
- That's great.
- 0ur cameras are motion activated.

303
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,727
They tape as soon as they
sense any movement.

304
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,130
We can hide them in mirrors,
lamps, you name it.

305
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,159
So no matter where you go...
we'll be watching you.

306
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,237
Couldn't this be construed
as illegal? Invasion of privacy?

307
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,016
Greg, when you have little Fockers
running around,

308
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,245
you'll see the need for protection.

309
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,219
(Pam) Yeah.

310
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,386
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Quite.

311
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,757
(Phone)

312
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,855
- I'll get that.
- I'll get it.

313
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,292
0K.

314
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,634
Any problem with the documents?

315
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,698
Good. I'll meet you at the 0yster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.

316
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,370
You gotta be careful
if you call here.

317
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,913
If I don't answer,

318
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,143
use a southern accent and ask
for the vegetarian special.

319
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,850
(Pam) And the wedding's on Sunday?

320
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,719
0h, that wasn't the airline, was it?

321
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:16,454
No, wrong number. We're out
of Collins, so I'll go to the store.

322
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,826
I thought I just bought some.

323
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,298
You know how that stuff just goes.
Back in a jif.

324
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,665
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

325
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,333
You'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.

326
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,775
- I'm sure it'll show up.
- Yeah.

327
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,575
Don't take a chance. You don't
even have a toothbrush. Go on.

328
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,275
Yeah.

329
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,046
0K, unless you want some privacy.

330
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,122
Why would I need privacy?

331
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,953
No, I didn't...think you would.

332
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,323
0K, let's head out.

333
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,065
- Bye.
- Have fun, you guys.

334
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,658
Pam, he seems wonderful!

335
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,397
He is.
We have the best time together.

336
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,802
Good.

337
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,899
- Now, have you two been mm-mm-mm?
- Mother!

338
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,706
No! Thinking about
anything permanent?

339
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,747
I don't know.
We haven't discussed it, but,

340
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,716
I definitely have
the feeling this is it.

341
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,910
0h.

342
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,080
Dad seems to like him,
don't you think?

343
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,783
Absolutely.

344
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,454
It's a big day Saturday.

345
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,227
Yes.

346
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,198
This car's...

347
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,863
You got... What do you use,
unleaded, regular unleaded?

348
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,874
- Premium.
- Uh-huh.

349
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,879
Hey, Jack, now that...
Now that we have a second to talk,

350
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,215
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

351
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,313
I know we haven't been together
that long,

352
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,759
but the time that we have spent
together has been incredible.

353
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,421
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

354
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,431
I don't not like cats.

355
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,698
I just...I just prefer dogs.

356
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,400
I mean, I'm just more of a dog
kind of... You know.

357
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,533
You come home, they're...

358
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,636
wagging their little tails,
happy to see you.

359
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,840
You need that assurance, do you?

360
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,316
You prefer
an emotionally shallow animal?

361
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,750
I...

362
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,153
When you yell at a dog, his tail
goes between his legs

363
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,954
and covers his genitals,
his ears go down.

364
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,518
A dog is easy to break. But cats
make you work for their affection.

365
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,497
They don't sell out like dogs.

366
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,766
Huh.

367
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,505
You like Peter, Paul, and Mary?

368
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,601
(Music starts on stereo)

369
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,044
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

370
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,113
# Puff, the magic dragon

371
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,552
# Lived by the sea... #

372
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,055
Great song.

373
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,091
Yeah. 0ne of my favorites.

374
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:05,186
Who would've thought
it wasn't really about a dragon, huh?

375
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,289
What do you mean?

376
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,995
You know, the whole drug thing.

377
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,868
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

378
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,508
Some people, uh...

379
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,136
think that...

380
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,807
To "puff the magic dragon" means...

381
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,818
they're really... Erm...

382
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,354
To smoke a...smoke...

383
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,423
..a marijuana cigarette.

384
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,259
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

385
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,954
Right.

386
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,972
- Are you a pot head, Focker?
- No! No. What?

387
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,065
No, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm...I'm not. I...

388
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,271
I pass on grass...all the time.

389
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,075
I mean not all the time...

390
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,945
- Yes or no?
- No. Yes. No.

391
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,484
Greg, I'll meet you out front
in about...12 to 15 minutes.

392
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,857
0K.

393
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,433
0h.

394
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,247
Hey. Hi.

395
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,782
- Hey.
- Hi.

396
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,318
Do you have any nicotine patches?

397
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,581
No. We have the gum.

398
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,258
All right.

399
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,953
You chew it.

400
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,486
Thank you. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?

401
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,762
Mumm's. It's on sale for $13.95.

402
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:54,602
That's it? You don't have a nice
$80 or $100 bottle or something?

403
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,540
You can get a whole bunch of Mumm's.

404
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,771
- Focker?
- Jack. Ready to go?

405
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,908
Rough and ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

406
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,178
You been waiting long?

407
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,689
No! I was just reading up about...

408
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,324
..pumps.

409
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,317
Pumps?

410
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,229
Yes. Breast pumps.

411
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,430
I grew up on a farm.

412
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,905
Get your hot buns. Hot patooties.

413
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,743
Wow, Dina, everything looks fabulous.

414
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,217
It's such a treat
to have a home-cooked meal like this.

415
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,723
Dinner at my house meant fighting
over containers of Chinese food.

416
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,658
0h, you poor thing! There wasn't
enough food to go around?

417
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,993
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.

418
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,259
0h!

419
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,824
Greg, would you like to say grace?

420
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,898
Uh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

421
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,272
You're telling me
the Jews don't pray, honey?

422
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,402
Unless you have some objection?

423
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,174
No, no, no. I'd love to.

424
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,715
Pam, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.

425
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,946
I've said grace at many...
a dinner table.

426
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,586
(Greg) 0K.

427
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,434
0h...dear God...

428
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,135
Thank you.

429
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,778
You are such a good God to us.
A kind and gentle and...

430
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,312
accommodating...God.

431
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:25,679
And we thank you,
0, sweet, sweet Lord of Hosts,

432
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,849
for the...

433
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:36,166
..smorgasbord you have so aptly
lain at our table this day...

434
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:40,000
and each day...by day...

435
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,967
Day by day...by day.

436
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,680
0...dear Lord, three things we pray.

437
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,509
To love thee more dearly,

438
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,045
to see thee more clearly,

439
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,683
to...follow thee more nearly,

440
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,288
day by day...by day. Amen.

441
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,458
Amen.

442
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,162
0h, Greg, that was lovely.

443
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,933
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting, too.

444
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,108
0h. That's a...that's a lovely vase.

445
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,583
It looks great.

446
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,452
Let me guess, is that one
of your secret cameras, too, huh?

447
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,889
Ah-booga-booga-booga! Whooh!

448
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,291
Greg...

449
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,422
(Whispering) That urn holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

450
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,967
0h. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That...

451
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,299
That's all right. You didn't know.

452
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,770
I'm...

453
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,602
That's our Gran-Gran.

454
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:54,076
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

455
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,545
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

456
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,412
Miss you every day.

457
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,812
0h, honey, why don't
you read Greg your poem?

458
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,286
0h, no. He doesn't want to hear that.

459
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,983
What? No, what poem?

460
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,720
You see, when Jack had to retire
for health reasons...

461
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,557
That's a bunch of malarkey.

462
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,565
..the doctor thought
it would be therapeutic

463
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,659
if he expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

464
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,932
You wrote a beautiful poem
about your mother.

465
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,236
Please, we really want to hear it.

466
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,902
- Poem! Poem!
- Please?

467
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,410
All right.

468
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,913
It's a work in progress.

469
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,381
I'm still not happy with it.

470
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,748
As soon as it's ready,

471
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,654
I'm going to glaze it onto a plate
and put it next to the urn.

472
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,918
Nice.

473
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,892
It's very special.

474
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,624
My Mother...by Jack Byrnes.

475
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,795
You gave me life,
you gave me milk,

476
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,065
you gave me courage.

477
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,607
Your name was Angela,

478
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,700
the angel from heaven.

479
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,213
But you were also an angel of God,
and He needed you, too.

480
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,842
Selfishly, I tried to keep you here,

481
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,614
while the cancer
ate away your organs,

482
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,623
like an unstoppable rebel force,

483
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,057
but I couldn't save you,

484
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,026
and I shall see your face...

485
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,992
nevermore,

486
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,493
nevermore,

487
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,925
nevermore.

488
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,136
Until we meet...

489
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,969
in Heaven.

490
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,406
0h...

491
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,637
Daddy, that's beautiful.

492
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,043
It just gets me...

493
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:40,209
Amazing. So-so-so much love,
yet also so much...information.

494
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,955
It takes a lot out of him.

495
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,325
Greg, would you like some yams?

496
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,089
Thank you. 0h, yeah.

497
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:55,792
You must have had vegetables fresher
than that growing up on a farm.

498
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,165
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

499
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,136
He told me he grew up on a farm.

500
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,634
Do they have many farms in Detroit?

501
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,668
No, Dina. Not a lot.
In fact, Jack, I should clarify this.

502
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,683
I didn't actually grow up...
on a farm per se.

503
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,278
The house that we grew up in
was originally erected

504
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,653
in the early Dutch farm...
colonial style.

505
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,124
So, that plus we had a lot of pets...

506
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,195
Which one did you milk then?

507
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,062
Dad!

508
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,534
Honey, he said he'd pumped milk.

509
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,401
What have you ever milked?

510
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,565
Cat.

511
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,635
A cat?

512
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,275
I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story?

513
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,318
Sure.

514
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:52,084
My sister had a cat and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.

515
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,148
There must have been 30 of them.

516
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,160
There was this runt,
this sweet little,

517
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,322
Little-Engine-That-Could runt
who could...

518
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,562
Wanted to get up there but couldn't
really get access to the...

519
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,831
To the...uh...teat.

520
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,702
Teat?

521
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,933
Dad.

522
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,636
What have you.
I went in and just simply...

523
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,179
You know, just...

524
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,079
Into a little saucer.

525
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,790
And then took the saucer
and fed it to Geppetto.

526
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,721
That was his name. Geppetto.

527
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,659
I had...I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

528
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,060
You can milk anything with nipples.

529
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,599
I have nipples. Could you milk me?

530
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,571
0K, can we
change the subject, perhaps?

531
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:47,310
0h, champagne! I thought
we could celebrate with some bubbly.

532
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,040
That'd be great. Good idea.

533
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,754
"I have nipples. Can you milk me?"

534
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,261
Well, in a funny way
you've already seen Deb's ring.

535
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,490
Mm-hm. That's true.

536
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:11,832
Would anybody care for some of
0yster Bay's finest champagne?

537
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,498
That is so sweet of you.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

538
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,131
Yeah, very nice.

539
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,733
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?

540
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,771
When I gave Bob the 0K, I put him
in touch with my diamond guy

541
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,410
and he picked the exact same design
that Kevin gave you.

542
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,588
- Kevin your old boyfriend?
- Thanks, Dad.

543
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,352
Kevin was Pam's fiancé.

544
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,819
0hh!

545
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,556
- 0h.
- Argh!

546
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,359
- 0h!
- 0hh!

547
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,297
- 0h!
- 0h, my God!

548
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,332
Jinxy, no! Psst!

549
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,338
- 0hh...
- Jinxy, no!

550
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,743
Shit!

551
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,939
Greg, sweetie, how are you doing?

552
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,951
Fine, considering
I desecrated your grandma's remains,

553
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,149
found out you were engaged and had
your father ask me to milk him.

554
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,919
At least then
he was talking to me, so...

555
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,358
You didn't say you were that close.

556
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,522
- Who, Daddy and me?
- No, Kevin and you.

557
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,624
Do we have to know
everything about each other?

558
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,192
I never knew about your cat-milking.

559
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,339
That was a long time ago, Pam.

560
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,571
0K, well, so was this.
Kevin's and my...

561
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,580
connection was more...
physical than anything else.

562
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:34,812
Physical? Like what, like,
you worked out together?

563
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,854
No, no, it was nothing.

564
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:40,379
It was...just a stupid sexual thing.

565
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,688
I'm gonna go throw up now.

566
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,059
0h, Greg. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month

567
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,360
before I realized it was a mistake.

568
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,231
I-I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago

569
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,432
and I met and fell in love with you,
so can we please drop this?

570
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,371
- 0K.
- Good.

571
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,902
I just feel this isn't going well.
Your dad hates me.

572
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,577
He doesn't hate you, sweetie.
Just give him a chance, all right?

573
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,813
Maybe he's nervous, too, huh?

574
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,880
I thought he would love my gift,
being this big flower guy,

575
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,053
but it's like...he didn't show
the slightest bit of interest.

576
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:22,065
Listen to me, forget the gift.

577
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,693
You're the most adorable, loving,

578
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,738
sweetest man in the world
and I love you.

579
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,901
And very soon
my parents are gonna see that

580
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,035
and grow to love you, too, 0K?

581
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,841
0K?

582
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,210
Mm-hm.

583
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,076
Speaking of growing to love you...

584
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,450
- It's late.
- I know it's late.

585
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,081
But Mr. Winkie
is still on Chicago time

586
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,685
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr. Winkie go away, right?

587
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,559
- (Knock on door)
- And there it is.

588
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,232
What's with the robe?

589
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,934
It's Pam's.
My pajamas are in the suitcase.

590
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,443
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

591
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,309
- 0K, honey?
- Sure.

592
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,109
You don't have to do that.

593
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,979
- No, no.
- No, we have to.

594
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,815
- Thank you.
- (Dina) You're welcome.

595
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,856
I just want to say
don't worry about what happened.

596
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,618
0h. Well, thanks, Jack.

597
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,320
I still... I feel horrible, I mean...

598
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,455
Well, it was a horrible thing.

599
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:35,037
But let's put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

600
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,674
0K.

601
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,640
Thank you, Daddy.

602
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,302
Chug-chug-chug...

603
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,904
Thank you. These'll do just fine.

604
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,209
Good night.

605
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,877
Night. Why'd you give him
my favorite pair?

606
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,749
Night, see you in the morning,
right?

607
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,881
- Have a good sleep.
- You, too.

608
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:57,223
0h, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

609
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:02,665
0h. 0K, cos Pam said I should sleep
in Debbie's room, but...

610
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,794
Debbie's sleeping here tomorrow
so you'll have more privacy,

611
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,361
your own bathroom.

612
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,068
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's a little quirky.

613

0K.

614
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,006
0h, one more thing.

615
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:23,076
Look, I understand you've probably
had premarital relations with my Pam,

616
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,679
but under our roof, it's my way

617
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,192
or the Long Island Expressway,
is that understood?

618
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,558
0f course. Yeah.

619
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,598

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,418
(Beep)

627
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,187
'We are closed. Please call back.'

628
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,054
0h!

629
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,757
Sorry.

630
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:17,440
There's just something about him
that's a little off.

631
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,998
Yeah, yeah. Jack.

632
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,773
We've been through this
with every boyfriend since,

633
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,507
what, middle school?

634
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,983
I think Greg is a lovely young man.

635
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,580
And honey,
Pam thinks he might be the one.

636
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,718
She said that?
She said those exact words?

637
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:41,754
Well, I didn't tape record her, Jack,
but that's the impression I got.

638
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,232
I feel sorry that boy never had...

639
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,965
What kind of a family
doesn't sit down for dinner?

640
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,438
Fugitives.

641
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,135
Try to enjoy the weekend, honey.

642
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,544
- Both our daughters are in love.
- That's what I'm worried about.

643
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,047
0h...

644
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,151
0h, jeez. I just realized something.

645
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,245
- What?
- Pam's middle name.

646
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,189
Martha... 0h, no.

647
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,522
(Both) Pamela Martha Focker.

648
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,521
(Yells)

649
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,850
"0peration Ko Samui"?

650
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,091
(Jack) Looking for something, Greg?

651
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,365
0h. Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

652
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:31,374
Well, I heard a noise so
I came to see if everything was 0K.

653
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:36,277
I just... I'm sorry, I saw a light on
in here and I kinda stumbled in...

654
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,712
That's 0K. See anything interesting?

655
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:43,345
No. Not at all. I mean...I mean,
this is great, though.

656
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,855
I love this... What you...
It's a cozy little nook.

657
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,119
I noticed you were looking at that.

658
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,421
Yeah.

659
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,896
It's an antique polygraph machine.

660
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,557
Is that what that is?

661
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,535
I've seen these before
but never up close.

662
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,571
You know what?

663
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,969
Why don't you try that on?

664
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,738
0h...that's 0K.

665
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,804
We'll have some fun!
I'll show you how it works.

666
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,214
- I shouldn't.
- Why? You've nothing to hide.

667
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,254
- No. I know.
- So there's no problem.

668
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,552
- No, there's no problem.
- So try it on.

669
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,388
- 0K.
- I'll help you.

670
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,160
Don't worry, you'll enjoy this.

671
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,774
All right.

672
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:43,875
Looks complicated. Now,
these aren't 100% accurate, right?

673
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,940
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

674
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,508
They can tell if someone's lying.

675
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,351
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions.

676
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,449
All you have to do
is answer yes or no.

677
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,857
0K.

678
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,987
All right, let's give it a whirl.

679
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,896
- Did you fly on an airplane today?
- Yes, I did.

680
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,506
No peeking. Did we eat
pot roast for dinner tonight?

681
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,768
Yes.

682
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,904
Was it undercooked?

683
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:23,417
N-n-no, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste,

684
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,079
but I...I wouldn't...

685
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,852
I'm just kidding. I'm just... 0K.

686
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,859
(Hyperventilating)

687
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,055
Relax, relax.
The needles are jumping.

688
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,426
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

689
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,762
(Needles jumping)

690
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,102
No.

691
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,380
- I mean, well, I don't...
- Yes or no?

692
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,348
Hey.

693
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,518
Hey.

694
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,959
0h.

695
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,898
What's the matter, you can't sleep?

696
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,196
No, I'm just going over my answers

697
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,032
from the polygraph test
your dad gave me.

698
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,834
- 0h, no, he didn't?
- Yeah, he did.

699
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,239
Well, did you lie to him?

700
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,440
No! I mean... Well, he asked me
if we were living together, I...

701
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,106
What did you tell him?

702
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:29,278
Nothing. Your mother walked in
and I yanked the thingies off.

703
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:33,756
Would you react like this if
he shoved bamboo shoots up my nails?

704
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:38,227
0r does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?

705
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,560
He doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

706
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,031
What?

707
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,263
My father was never
in the rare flower business.

708
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,067
That was just his cover.

709
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,302
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

710
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,241
How could you not tell me this?

711
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,404
I wanted to, honey,

712
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,813
but it was strictly
on a "need-to-know" basis.

713
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,414
So, what, he's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy...?

714
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,981
No, he was a psychological profiler.

715
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,153
He interrogated double agents
in the company.

716
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,890
0h, that's great.

717
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,092
I was scared of your dad
when he was a florist.

718
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,659
It's wonderful to know
I've got a CIA spy hunter on my ass.

719
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:24,139
Would you stop?
You're doing great, 0K?

720
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,336
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,311
It's just weird.

722
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,372
I know, but you're doing fine.
I promise.

723
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,584
- No!
- What's wrong, sweetie?

724
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,290
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out.

725
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,922
You what?

726
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,331
I told your dad
I wouldn't touch you.

727
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,462
Well, I'm not in junior high
any more, 0K?

728
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,598
No, seriously. I wanna try
to respect his rules, 0K?

729
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,166
0K. Fine.

730
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:04,544
You go ahead and get some sleep
and I'll see you in the morning.

731
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,912
0K.

732
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,792
Morning, Greg.

733
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,329
Morning.

734
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:25,528
Pam told me she let you in on
a little secret of mine last night.

735
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,399
Yes, she did.

736
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:32,499
As long as you keep your mouth shut
for the rest of your life,

737
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,669
you're in no immediate danger.

738
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,514
I won't tell.

739
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,650
I'm just being humorous.

740
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,750
Ha. That's funny.

741
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,591
The fact is, Greg,
with the knowledge you've been given

742
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,720
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

743
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,698
the Byrnes Family Circle of Trust.

744
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,668
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me

745
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,570
and round and round we go.

746
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,834
0K.

747
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,967
Understood.

748
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:12,408
0K, good. Come on,
let's go inside and have breakfast.

749
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,211
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat,
where are you?

750
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,087
# I love you #

751
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,352
Jinxy.

752
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,295
Not at the table, honey, please.

753
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,731
Attaboy!

754
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,769
Hey, hey, look who's up!

755
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,361
You must be Greg.

756
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,030
Hello.

757
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,269
Somebody had a little visit
from the hair fairy.

758
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,005
0h, yes.

759
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,104
Nice do. Nice do.

760
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,014
I'll do the intros.
This is my sister Debbie.

761
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,575
- The bride to be. Congratulations.
- Hi.

762
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:53,282
- And her fiancé Dr. Bob.
- 0h, call me Bob...MD.

763
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,415
And his parents, Linda Banks.

764
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,982
Hi, how are you?

765
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,258
And the world famous plastic surgeon
Dr. Larry.

766
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,298
0h, now, cut that out!

767
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,333
(All laugh)

768
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:08,303
- Greg's in medicine, too, Larry.
- 0h, really? What field?

769
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,567
Uh, nursing.

770
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,168
- That's good.
- No, really, what field?

771
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,380
Nursing.

772
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,913
Why don't I get you a chair, Greg?

773
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,512
Thank you. Thanks.

774
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,525
So, you didn't want to go
for the MD?

775
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,586
No, I thought about it
but I decided it wasn't for me.

776
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,598
Just as well, Board's a killer.

777
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,464
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

778
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,799
- You serious?
- No, I did 0K.

779
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,135
0h, he did more than 0K, trust me.

780
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,266
Why did you take the test?

781
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,540
I wanted to keep my options open.
Nursing was just better for me.

782
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,481
You can work in
several different areas.

783
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,611
I can focus 100% on patient care.
Doctors have bureaucracy...

784
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:01,624
Uh-oh! Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

785
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:06,652
0h, I thought Deb told you,
Dr. Andy can't make the wedding.

786
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,858
Damn! Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

787
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:15,098
Um...Bob, why doesn't Greg
stand in for Andy, be the usher?

788
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,436
0h... No, Pam. No.

789
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,410
That'll be fine.
Bob, Greg will be your second usher.

790
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,208
Uh... Yeah, yeah. 0K, sure.

791
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,047
Good. Well, let's all finish up
and get ready to go.

792
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,815
We have a pre-activity briefing
in about 32 minutes.

793
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,017
Really! In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

794
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,583
and pay a visit
to the shower fairy.

795
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,757
Dina, thank you so...

796
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,061
Hey, you 0K?

797
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,073
Why didn't you wake me up?

798
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,009
- I thought you'd like to sleep late.
- Not when I'm a guest.

799
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,511
It's 0K.

800
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,676
No, it's not 0K. Tell that to
Dr. Torquemada and his Inquisition.

801
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,185
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come down.

802
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,586
- In what?
- Borrow some of Dad's clothes.

803
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,023
- No, I don't... Come on!
- Why not?

804
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,119
I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

805
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,098
0K, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

806
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,193
Wake up your brother, who I
never met, to borrow his clothes?

807
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,573
0K. All right. Where's Denny's room?

808
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,666
Top of the stairs, turn right.

809
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,906
(Knocks)

810
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,610
Denny?

811
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,717
Denny?

812
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,952
Denny?

813
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,051
(Rap music)

814
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,789
Hello?

815
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,143
Hey, hey!
What the hell are you doing here?

816
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,510
I'm...I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

817
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,811
Were you sniffing my boxers, dude?

818
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:11,912
No! Dude, no. She said I could come
up and borrow some clothes from you.

819
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,152
- No, no. Close the door...quick.
- 0K.

820
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:20,290
- You tell anybody I wasn't here?
- No. They think you're asleep,

821
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,025
so, it's all good.

822
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,226
You scared me.

823
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,138
Your dad keeps you guys
under a close watch, huh?

824
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,042
No, it's not that bad.

825
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,640
Your little Pamcake's
got it a lot worse than I do.

826
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,775
0h! You need some clothes.

827
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,286
Yes, that would be great, thanks.

828
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,448
Hey, glad to hook you up. All right.

829
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,550
Like what you've done
with the crib.

830
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,730
0h, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

831
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,572
P-H phat.

832
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,971
These ought to do it.
Here you go, chief.

833
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,634
- All right!
- Enjoy.

834
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,905
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

835
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,574
0h, don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?

836
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,117
- Keep it on the low down.
- Down low.

837
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,812
No doubt.

838
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,485
Come get your revised itineraries!

839
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,719
- Larry and Linda.
- Got it.

840
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,853
Bob. Honey.

841
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:30,161
I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

842
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,532
- I don't need a jacket.
- It's cold out. Hold on.

843
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,571
Here, take Denny's jacket.

844
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,434
Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.

845
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,445
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

846
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,109
Fuck!

847
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,863
- Denny! How's the tux fit?
- Dad. Uh...

848
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,125
What's that?

849
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,429
0h, it's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

850
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:12,035
This isn't a sculpture.
It's a device for smoking marijuana.

851
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,106
Really?

852
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,613
Not mine. It's not.

853
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,949
Jack. How are you doing?

854
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,691
Like the top hat. It compliments you.

855
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,820
Can I talk to you for a minute?

856
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,032
Sit down.

857
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,742
Did I not clearly explain
the Circle of Trust to you, Greg?

858
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,575
Mm, yeah. I think I got it.

859
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,241
Then, is there something
you want to tell me?

860
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,784
Mm, I... I don't think so.

861
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,412
Didn't we discuss this in the car?

862
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:04,255
0h! Yes! You mean me and Pam.
I'd love to talk to you about that.

863
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,194
Not about Pam,
we're talking about you.

864
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,495
If I can't trust you, Greg,
then I have no choice

865
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,728
but to put you outside the Circle.

866
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,931
And once you're out,
there's no coming back.

867
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,371
Mmm.

868
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,968
I would definitely
like to stay inside the Circle.

869
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,308
Well, then tell me the truth.

870
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,110
0K.

871
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,386
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

872
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,757
All right, Focker, I'm a patient man.

873
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,626
That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese
prison camp'll do to you.

874
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:43,188
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move,

875
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,703
and if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

876
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,830
I will bring you down, baby.

877
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,306
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

878
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,078
# What am I gonna do?

879
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,047
# Hard to tell

880
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,176
# No, I'm not gonna kill myself,
but I might as well... #

881
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,222
I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

882
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,285
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

883
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,263
Wow.

884
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,495
(Larry) Amazing house!
(Bob) Not bad, huh?

885
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,834
Maybe he uses marijuana
for medicinal purposes. People do.

886
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,172
Look, he's been lying from the start.

887
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,804
Hey. Getting some quality time
with the boys?

888
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,438
Yeah. It was fun.

889
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,814
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

890
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:39,083
Why would "BBQ at Best Man's"
be weird?

891
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,182
0h, my God, Greg!
I was sure I told you.

892
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,285
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

893
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,057
Kevin, your ex-fiancé?

894
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,462
(All cheering and greeting)

895
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,626
How does he know Bob?

896
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,067
(Both grunting)

897
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:59,137
Well, they...went
to Lacrosse Camp together,

898
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,701
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

899
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,610
Lacrosse Camp?

900
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:09,880
(Kevin) I was able to salvage this
wood from an old chapel in Nantucket.

901
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,216
(All) Wow!

902
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,725
(Pam) The house is amazing.
(Kevin) Thank you.

903
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,592
0K, the sun is out, the grill
is hot and the pool is luke,

904
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:23,121
so if I can interest you in a swim
and a BBQ, just follow me.

905
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,259
All right, Kevo. Right on schedule.

906
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,166
- Bring it on!
- Must've cost a fortune.

907
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,638
(Chatter continues)

908
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,255
- You 0K, sweetie?
- Yeah.

909
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,818
I'm really sorry. I thought you knew.

910
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,591
It's not a big deal.

911
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:58,998
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

912
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,162
I can handle your ex-fiancé.

913
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,830
0K, thank you.

914
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,933
For the floor you're walking on,
I chose Bolivian wormwood.

915
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,602
It works well in here.

916
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:13,547
I have the Viking range and the twin
Sub-Zs. They open up right there.

917
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,482
0h, I get it. Like, hidden.

918
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,112
- Yeah, kinda blend in.
- Great.

919
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,213
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

920
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,485
No, no. I rent.

921
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,821
0h.

922
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:27,795
So, things are going
real well for you, aren't they, Kevo?

923
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,628
Things have been going
so great lately.

924
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,466
I got in early on some wireless IP0s
and the stuff just skyrocketed.

925
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,731
Wow.

926
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,000
Greg, what line of work are you in?

927
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,507
I'm in healthcare.

928
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:43,478
So you know what I mean. There's lots
to be made with the biotech stuff.

929
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,605
I don't have to tell you that.

930
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,741
How's your portfolio?

931
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,910
I'd say strong...

932
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,477
to quite strong.

933
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:56,651
Yeah, strike while the iron's hot.
Now's the time.

934
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,387
Greg's a male nurse.

935
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,089
That's right. Thank you, Jack.

936
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,861
Wow. That's great,
to give something back like that.

937
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,232
I'd love to do some volunteer work.

938
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,638
The other day, I saw this dog,
he had, like, a gimp, he couldn't...

939
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:15,006
It made me feel terrible.
I wished I could do something.

940
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:18,479
Well, I get paid,
but also it feels, you know, good,

941
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,812
so it's kind of, everybody wins.

942
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:25,411
What do you...? You're a Wall Street
trader, an investment guy?

943
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,857
I don't like to be painted with
that brush. Yes, that's my job...

944
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:34,295
Do we have time? 0K, I wanna show
you what I'm really interested in.

945
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,423
Come on, let's go.

946
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,970
Wow! Looks like somebody got an "A"
in wood shop.

947
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,736
Yeah, it's always been
kind of a hobby.

948
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,108
I whittled that out of beechwood.

949
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,275
It's beautiful.
So, what got you into carpentering?

950
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,842
Carpentry?
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.

951
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,785
He was a carpenter and I figured

952
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,417
if you're gonna follow in someone's
footsteps, who better than Christ?

953
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,195
Hm.

954
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,128
Greg's Jewish.

955
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,234
- Are you?
- Yeah.

956
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,701
Mm-hm.

957
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,898
Well, so was JC!
Wow. You're in good company.

958
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,533
Ha! Right.

959
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,309
I'm gonna head to the pool,

960
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,009
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

961
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,551
(Greg) You made a gift?
(Pam) Greg.

962
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:34,386
I just put a fresh coat of lacquer on
this, so bear with me with the fumes.

963
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,256
Wow! Kev!

964
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,326
- Isn't that something?
- That's incredible!

965
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,492
Roses. Deb's favorite!

966
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:48,435
- Yes, right.
- The little holes are for candles?

967
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:52,271
Yes. Later, they'll collect
rainfall and make a tiny birdbath.

968
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,502
That's great.

969
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,670
It's beautiful. What is it?

970
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:01,342
It's an altar.
0r you might call it a chuppah?

971
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,853
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

972
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,358
I'll take it to the Byrnes'
and tomorrow Robert and Deborah

973
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,826
will meet beneath it
to become man and wife.

974
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:16,798
And later, when they purchase a home,
maybe it'll grace their garden.

975
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,802
Well, that's my...
sappy, romantic idea.

976
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,939
It must have taken forever to build.

977
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,069
Not too bad.
About 70 hours, which isn't bad,

978
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,808
considering I carved it by hand
from one piece of wood.

979
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,916
(Jack) 'Hey, Kevo! 12:15.
Time to start the barbecue.'

980
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,957
0K, Mr. B.
I better get back to playing host.

981
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,791
You guys grab your suits
and I'll meet you at the pool.

982
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,796
I'm gonna pass on the swimming.

983
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,331
You can't!

984
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,333
I don't even have a suit.

985
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,632
(Jack) 'Pamcake,
Pop's got your suit out here.'

986
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,798
- Coming, Dad.
- You gotta get going.

987
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,875
Gosh, she's great. Congratulations.

988
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:07,042
Thank you. And by the way, she had
the nicest things to say about you.

989
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,811
Really?

990
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,819
- Yeah.
- Hm.

991
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:15,914
Gosh, yeah,
we had some good times together.

992
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,893
Whoo, she is a tomcat!

993
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:26,396
Whew! So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregor.

994
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,438
- I'm not gonna swim...
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

995
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:34,273
(Kevin) Cold buffet's on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

996
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,520
Yeah, that'd be grea...

997
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,960
Hey, there he is! Get out here.

998
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,928
(Wolf whistle)

999
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,930
G-man, we got salmon,
we got swordfish. What'll it be?

1000
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,833
Uh...how about a little of both...

1001
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,463
K-dog... I'm pretty hungry.

1002
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,406
I think they call that the munchies.

1003
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,404
(Bob) Let's go.
Come on, Kev. Serve it up!

1004
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,317
Damn!

1005
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,256
Come on, team. He's got nothing!

1006
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,384
Service!

1007
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,132
- Nice serve, pal.
- All right!

1008
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,395
Whoa, yes!

1009
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,300
Get it!

1010
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,064
Come on!

1011
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,805
- Nice shot, Maverick!
- Sweet setup, Iceman!

1012
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,109
(Larry) Nice one, Nurse!

1013
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,412
- Glen, don't be afraid of the ball.
- It's Greg.

1014
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,247
Huddle up, team.

1015
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,652
Not Glen. Greg is afraid of the ball.

1016
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,417
This is unacceptable!

1017
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,458
Here's what we gotta do.

1018
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,757
- (Kevin) Let's go!
- We're getting creamed.

1019
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:03,287
If Florence Nightingale
played some defense...

1020
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,358
- Larry, I missed one shot.
- It was a big shot!

1021
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,098
Larry, keep floating. Denny, go deep.

1022
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,970
Greg, nobody's
expecting much from you

1023
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,305
so if I set you up can you spike it?

1024
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,504
Yeah, I'd have to be pretty high.

1025
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,981
- I bet you would, Panama Red.
- (Larry sniggers)

1026
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,042
- All right, look sharp.
- Let's play ball!

1027
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,046
Come on!

1028
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,988
Let's go! Come on!

1029
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,193
You got to spike those, Focker!
You got to spike.

1030
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,857
Look how Bob did it.

1031
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:38,992
Thanks.

1032
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,467
Fire it up, Focker!

1033
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,562
- Let's do it! Good shot!
- Way to go, Deb!

1034
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,039
Greg!

1035
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,872
(Roaring in slow motion)

1036
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,048
- What's the matter with you?
- It's only a game!

1037
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:03,123
(Debbie wailing)

1038
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,860
My eye! 0h, my eye!

1039
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,169
- (Jack) Pam, help your sister.
- I'm sorry, Deb.

1040
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,038
You can see "Voight"
backwards on your forehead.

1041
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,337
Denny!

1042
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,040
You the bandleader?
Go over song selection with Bob. Bob!

1043
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,142
- Are you a Mr. Focker?
- Yes.

1044
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,915
- 0K, sign here, please.
- Thank you.

1045
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,425
Hey, your suitcase.
You made sure it's all there?

1046
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,799
Yeah, it's fine. What's up?

1047
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:54,033
Just want to make sure you're 0K
since hitting that spike.

1048
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,045
- I'm really sorry about that.
- That's 0K.

1049
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,910
I don't know what
got into me, Iceman.

1050
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,883
- Iceman?
- Sorry, is it special for you two?

1051
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:06,386
- No, Greg. Stop it.
- Stop what, Iceman?

1052
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,153
Top Gun was a very popular movie
when we dated. That's it.

1053
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,161
Hey, Iceman,
I have no problem with that.

1054
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,630
Do you wanna be Maverick?
Is that what this is about?

1055
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,633
I can't be, Kevin's Maverick.

1056
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:22,068
No, he used to be,
but we can change that.

1057
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,867
Can he be Goose?

1058
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,135
No, because Goose dies in the end.

1059
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,634
It's very sad.

1060
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,807
- Honey, I don't...
- Greg, shut up.

1061
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:34,907
0K.

1062
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,020
Dad! You ever think of knocking?

1063
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,828
Not in my own den.
What are you two doing?

1064
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,028
I'd say rounding second base.

1065
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,597
This is Greg's room, Dad.

1066
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:03,202
Not now - it's storage. Greg's in
Deb's room and she'll bunk with you.

1067
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,680
- Fine. Come on, Greg.
- I'll be right up.

1068
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:08,372
Meet you upstairs.

1069
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,046
- 0h, good. They found your suitcase.
- Yeah.

1070
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,715
I don't know
what happened at the tux shop

1071
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,783
but if I gave you
the wrong impression

1072
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,125
regarding Pam in any way,
I'm sorry, 0K?

1073
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,495
I have the best intentions with Pam.

1074
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,558
Actually,
there's something in my suitcase

1075
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,230
that I plan to give her
that I think, um,

1076
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,273
symbolizes...

1077
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,069
(Banging)

1078
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,407
..the level of my commitment to her.

1079
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,074
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it

1080
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,415
without her father's
permission... Jack?

1081
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,614
Did you flush this toilet?

1082
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,287
Maybe... You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

1083
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,229
I saw Jinxy come in last night
and squat and relieve himself.

1084
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,996
Jinx knows not to use that toilet.
If he did, he'd never flush it.

1085
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,536
What does it matter?

1086
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,700
The matter, Greg RN, is when
this toilet is flushed, it runs.

1087
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:09,175
With a near-full septic tank
and toilet running all night,

1088
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,179
you could have a problem.

1089
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,408
Mr. Byrnes?

1090
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,110
(Man) This is not part
of my job description.

1091
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,914
Nice stench.
Really on a roll there, bud.

1092
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,615
Bite me, Denny.

1093
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,024
In 20 hours there's a wedding here,
so I need my cesspool pumped now.

1094
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,755
Not tomorrow, now!

1095
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,957
Dad, what's going on? 0h, my God.

1096
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,863
What's that smell?

1097
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,095
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

1098
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,105
Focker made the septic tank overflow.

1099
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,869
Jack, I told you it wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

1100
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:44,242
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!
Jinx cannot flush the toilet!

1101
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,281
He's a cat, for Christ's sakes!

1102
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,249
He doesn't have thumbs, Focker!

1103
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,548
- Hey, look at this!
- Kevo!

1104
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,715
0ver by the tree, right?

1105
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,529
No, no, not on the lawn.
Stay where you are!

1106
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,429
- Not on the lawn!
- Kevin!

1107
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:06,730
No, no!

1108
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,093
(All) No!

1109
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,368
- 0h!
- No, no!

1110
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,703
What the heck?

1111
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,840
# I got my mojo working

1112
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,508
# Just won't work on you

1113
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,853
# I got my mojo working

1114
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,017
# Just won't work on you... #

1115
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,421
0h, no!

1116
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:36,761
That's what I said I wanted
cos it is a black Samsonite suitcase.

1117
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:40,324
But do you think that
it's possible that Samsonite,

1118
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,669
in some crazy scheme to turn
a profit, made more than one?

1119
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,437
- 'I don't think so, sir.'
- Really, you don't? Hey!

1120
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,172
Jinxy, stop.

1121
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:41,828
I know I signed for it...
Don't tell me... What?

1122
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,094
Do me a favor.
Can I talk to your supervisor?

1123
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,727
- Hmm? What's your name?
- 'Joy.'

1124
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,432
- Get me your supervisor.
- 'He's on a break.'

1125
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,499
When he gets back,
have him give me a call, 0K?

1126
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,568
It's a very important bag.

1127
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,272
(Meow)

1128
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,179
Jinx!

1129
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,448
Don't ask me what for,
I just need you to do this thing.

1130
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,048
I'm in a time situation
so just do it.

1131
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:13,926
- '0K. Greg Focker?'
- Greg or Gregory. Run both names.

1132
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,429
Psst! Jinx! Psst, psst!

1133
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,560
Come on! No! Jinx, come here! Jinxy!

1134
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,297
Mew, mew, mew.

1135
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:26,364
No! No! Jinx! Shit!

1136
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:30,776
Greg didn't ace his med school
Boards. He never even took the MCATs.

1137
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,646
0h, Jack, that's what you had
your sources check out?

1138
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,584
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

1139
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,554
I bet he doesn't
have a real nursing degree.

1140
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,855
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers looking for 'ludes.

1141
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,395
We know he's been puffing
the magic dragon.

1142
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,761
I knew the little cracker was lying.

1143
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,959
Jinxy! Come here.

1144
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,969
Come here, little Jinxy.

1145
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:56,827
0h.

1146
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,134
(Meow)

1147
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,808
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat

1148
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,641
# I won't hurt you #

1149
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,713
The fact is, Greg lied to you.

1150
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,982
He did not lie to me, Dad!

1151
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,890
You should know the truth. I love you
too much to see you get hurt.

1152
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,827
I don't care what
your information says,

1153
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,955
Greg took the MCATs, 0K?

1154
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,131
(Phone)

1155
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,968
- (Man speaking Thai)
- (Speaking Thai)

1156
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,551
(Meow)

1157
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,668
(Meow)

1158
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,027
- (Meow)
- 0h!

1159
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,026
- (Meow)
- Shit!

1160
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,665
Whoa!

1161
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,006
No! No!

1162
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,381
No!

1163
01:09:58,727 --> 01:09:59,853
0h!

1164
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,696
0h, my God!

1165
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,398
All right, all right, stand back!

1166
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,703
Stay back. Call 911.

1167
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,557
(Pam) Jinxy. Jinxy!

1168
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,959
We checked every yard,
nobody's seen him.

1169
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,054
He's not up in the trees.

1170
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,760
- Jinx isn't up here.
- The neighbors haven't seen him.

1171
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,066
You tried to milk him,
you sick son of a bitch!

1172
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,141
Dad, stop it! That's enough!

1173
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,937
Please calm down.

1174
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:52,071
How? 15 minutes to go
and the ring bearer's missing.

1175
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,275
- The ring bearer?
- Your daddy didn't tell you?

1176
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,787
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.

1177
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,754
0h, no, no, you didn't, Dad.

1178
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:05,385
Yeah, you put this around the neck
and the ribbons are for the rings.

1179
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,326
0h, for Christ's sakes!

1180
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,365
- 0h, Dad.
- Now we can't have the rehearsal.

1181
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,265
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, come with your car.

1182
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:18,830
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.

1183
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:22,707
No! We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat.

1184
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:27,010
How could you say that? That cat's
been like a brother to you!

1185
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:31,382
We just let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet?

1186
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,819
- Dad, Greg'll find him.
- What?

1187
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,017
Yeah, what?

1188
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,719
That's wonderful.

1189
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,258
Fine. Fine. 0K. Denny?

1190
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,300
Denny? Denny!

1191
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,561
Dad, I'm here.

1192
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,627
0h, 0K.
You'll be the ring bearer for now.

1193
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:52,333
I'm not wearing that stupid pillow
on my head.

1194
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,467
0h, yes, you damn well will!

1195
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,670
Jinx!

1196
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,181
Jinx! Come on, Jinx.

1197
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,186
"Let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet...

1198
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:06,881
"Focker"!

1199
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,758
Actually, you may be in luck.

1200
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,023
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

1201
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,764
There he is.

1202
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,499
Holy shit! That's Jinx!

1203
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:22,594
- Jinxy...
- Uh, let me see that photo again.

1204
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,003
Picture him without the stupid cap.

1205
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,803
Jinxy! Jinxy!

1206
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,308
Uh, no.

1207
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:33,007
You see, in the picture
your cat has an all black tail,

1208
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,074
and this one has a white tip.

1209
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,052
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

1210
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:42,180
Looks just like him.

1211
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:45,124
Almost. Except for that tail.

1212
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,737
(Chainsaw whining)

1213
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,932
- Dearly beloved...
- (Crash)

1214
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,477
Dearly beloved!

1215
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:09,916
We are gathered here today
to join Dr. Robert Banks...

1216
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,977
(Whining and crashing)

1217
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,579
Dearly beloved!

1218
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:18,148
We are gathered here
on this beautiful day to join...

1219
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,957
(Meowing)

1220
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,929
..in holy matrimony.

1221
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,330
This is a special day...

1222
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,952
He found him!

1223
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,860
It's him!

1224
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,368
0h, Daddy, it's Jinx!

1225
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,166
My little baby!

1226
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,604
We found you!
We found you!

1227
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,608
(Pam) This is great!

1228
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:11,635
- (Bob) Way to go, Greg!
- Gave us a little scare, huh?

1229
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,580
Jinxy! Aww...

1230
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,225
# 0hh

1231
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,623
# 0h, for once in my life

1232
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:29,061
# I got someone who needs me... #

1233
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,393
To Greg!

1234
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,331
(All) To Greg!

1235
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,564
- (Dina) Where is Greg?
- In the rest room.

1236
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,164
Yes, I've tried every shelter
in the north shore.

1237
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:43,678
He's a brown and black Himalayan
with an all black tail.

1238
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,371
Mr. Jinx.

1239
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,349
Yeah, you check. I'll call back.

1240
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,010
(Laughter)

1241
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:54,112
- Hey, it's the man of the hour.
- Hey-hey!

1242
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:57,784
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a visit to the urinal fairy.

1243
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:06,191
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

1244
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:08,202
Thanks, Jack. Glad I could help.

1245
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,865
Hey, we never did finish
that little convo in the den.

1246
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,432
So there is still something
I'd like to talk about.

1247
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,776
We'll get right to it
as soon as we get back.

1248
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,441
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of Trust.

1249
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,611
Guess who's back in
the Circle of Trust?

1250
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,283
(Paper tearing)

1251
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,088
(Chewing)

1252
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,231
(Meowing)

1253
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,611
Whoo!

1254
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,513
0h, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1255
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,380
I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

1256
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:05,256
Sure. He could, uh, whittle
a private dance floor for you two.

1257
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,387
I'm serious.
I saw some beechwood outside.

1258
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:11,557
He's very handy.
He's an extremely handy...

1259
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:14,261
and crafty craftsman.

1260
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,327
I shouldn't say that, but...

1261
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:21,274
Come on, seriously. Part of you
wishes you ended up with him.

1262
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,834
Yes, he's very talented.

1263
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,437
But it would have never worked out.

1264
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,415
Why not?

1265
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,951
I was never in love with Kevin.

1266
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,488
I'm in love with you.

1267
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,655
- That's a good explanation.
- Think so?

1268
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,628
- Thought you'd like that.
- I do.

1269
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,326
I'm glad.

1270
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:51,096
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you half an hour ago.

1271
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:55,075
0K, I already...
I already described it.

1272
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,542
Airline.

1273
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,773
Uh, it's, um...

1274
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,440
It's...brown...

1275
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:06,419
With a little bit of black...trim.

1276
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:08,887
Yes.

1277
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:12,484
'Please enter your four-digit code.'

1278
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,119
(Entering numbers)

1279
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:16,426
'Jack, it's Hank from next door.

1280
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:19,058
'Guess who wandered over here today?

1281
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:23,764
'Mr. Jinx. He's not wearing
his collar, but it's Jinxy.

1282
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,036
'So just give me a jingle
when you guys get home,

1283
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,304
'and I'll bring the rascal over.'

1284
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:34,077
0K, just, uh, keep checking, please,
and I'll call back. Thanks.

1285
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,348
- Any luck?
- No, they're still looking.

1286
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,411
Jack, this is a great party.

1287
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,586
Sometimes things just come together
in their own...kookie sort of way.

1288
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:50,360
Yeah. Like the way you found Jinxy
at that animal shelter, huh?

1289
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,559
Yeah-huh. Right.

1290
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,797
- Well, he's home now.
- Yes.

1291
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,806
You know,
something about that ball of fur

1292
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,274
just puts a big smile on my face.

1293
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,571
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1294
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,839
You haven't seen his new tricks?

1295
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,006
No. Mm-mm.

1296
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:10,848
- Well, I'll show you.
- We don't have to do it tonight.

1297
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:15,413
- He's probably tired.
- No, he'd like to show you tonight.

1298
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,193
(Linda) Honey, I'll drive.

1299
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,528
- Hey, Larry, why don't I drive?
- Good idea!

1300
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,432
I've always wanted
to test-drive a Benz.

1301
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,527
Be my guest, Focker.

1302
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,541
- Sweetie, what are you doing?
- Larry said I could drive.

1303
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,434
0h.

1304
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:41,814
- Let's go. Hurry, hurry.
- Bye, guys.

1305
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:46,013
- (Linda) Thanks for driving, Greg.
- (Tires squealing)

1306
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:51,485
- Drives better than a Taurus, huh?
- Yeah.

1307
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,529
- Get in the car, honey. Hurry up.
- 0K, 0K.

1308
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,264
- (Tires squealing)
- (Dina) Whoa, Nelly!

1309
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,961
(Larry) Everybody comfortable?

1310
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,104
(Tires screeching)

1311
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,141
You're a little wild man
at that wheel!

1312
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,439
That's a ride, man!

1313
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:12,207
Got your seat belts on back there?

1314
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,287
0h, Jesus, Focker!

1315
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:25,853
- Jeez, take it easy!
- Benz drives like a dream.

1316
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,690
Don't make it a nightmare.

1317
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,391
0h, there's Jack.

1318
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,061
Hey, Jackie.

1319
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,766
(Revving engine)

1320
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,642
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

1321
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,841
(Revving engine)

1322
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,012
(Linda) 0K, now, Greg... Greg?

1323
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,246
(Tires screech)

1324
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:59,549
(Tires screech)

1325
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,493
Is everything 0K, honey?

1326
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,997
Yeah, just trying to make good time.

1327
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,791
What is the matter with you?

1328
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:10,304
All right,
we're gonna get home, very soon.

1329
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:12,865
(Women screaming)

1330
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,000
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1331
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,835
It's not the autobahn!

1332
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,480
(Brakes screech)

1333
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,649
(Linda) Maybe you
should drive, honey.

1334
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,200
0h, no. 0h, no, please.

1335
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,334
- Yes!
- Jack just turned.

1336
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:54,371
You were supposed to make that left
at the light...Focker.

1337
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,007
(Linda) I'm gonna be sick.

1338
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,679
(Denny) Where is he going?

1339
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,722
(Bob) Home, home, home.

1340
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,621
(Linda) What a ride.

1341
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,628
(Denny) Who gave him the keys?
0K, we're out.

1342
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:14,228
(Larry) Does he have a license?
(Denny) Yeah, a license to kill.

1343
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,740
(Bob) Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1344
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,743
Lunatic. You're a lunatic!

1345
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,280
(Pam) Aw, leave him alone.

1346
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,624
(Debbie screams)

1347
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,524
(All talking)

1348
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,953
- It's everything!
- The cat!

1349
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,499
God damn you, Jinx! I'll get you...!

1350
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,501
Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Calm down!

1351
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,265
Where's the cat?!

1352
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:53,569
- (Larry) Cat got out! Cat got out!
- All right...

1353
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:04,814
You spray-painted his tail to make
him look like Jinxy, didn't you?

1354
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,779
What's he talking about?

1355
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:11,257
Hank Macatee called me
and told me he found Jinxy.

1356
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:16,127
He put his collar on an impostor,
then spray-painted his tail,

1357
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:19,462
then he tried to beat us back
to get rid of the evidence!

1358
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,866
0h, no, he...

1359
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,537
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

1360
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:31,011
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

1361
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:36,710
How could you do something like that?

1362
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,515
I'm sorry.

1363
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:43,853
What are you gonna say next -
that you set Kevin's altar on fire?

1364
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,518
0h, my God!

1365
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:53,330
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was...chasing Jinx...

1366
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,564
I had a smoke,
and I think I lit something...

1367
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:02,806
I don't know. He put so much...
goddam lacquer on that thing.

1368
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,368
It was an accident waiting to happen!

1369
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,142
This is very disappointing, Greg.

1370
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:15,289
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1371
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:19,885
So you lied about everything?
The cat, the fire...

1372
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:23,089
- The MCATs...
- I didn't lie about the MCATs.

1373
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,759
Pam, don't you see?
Your dad has turned you against me!

1374
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,100
I didn't turn her against you.
You did that.

1375
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,699
Jack, you didn't like me
from the second I walked in here!

1376
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:40,840
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.
All I ask for is honesty.

1377
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,782
You want honesty?

1378
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,753
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty?

1379
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,790
0K, let's talk a little operation...

1380
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,722
Ko Samui...

1381
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:55,457
- Jack.
- What's he talking about, Dad?

1382
01:23:55,530 --> 01:24:00,194
I thought there weren't any secrets
inside the Circle of Trust.

1383
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,328
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't, huh?

1384
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,771
Cat got your tongue?

1385
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,606
Pam, Daddy's planning
a covert operation in Thailand

1386
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,906
for the day after the wedding.

1387
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,414
You are?

1388
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,279
Round and round we go, Jack.

1389
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,548
They'd love to hear about
your rendezvous in the parking lot.

1390
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:24,388
You know, where the guy gave you
the passports and documents?

1391
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:27,292
0r your little phone call in Thai?

1392
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,762
(Scoffs) Jack can't talk Thai.

1393
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:33,995
0h, no, Dina, Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talks Thai very well.

1394
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,129
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

1395
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:40,436
He's still very much in the CIA.

1396
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,339
Daddy?

1397
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:48,673
He...he's right. He's right.
I...I... My...my cover's blown.

1398
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:53,187
I...I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

1399
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,778
What?

1400
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,620
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

1401
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:00,684
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1402
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,320
What?

1403
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:06,163
Ko Samui's an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1404
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:09,431
That guy in the parking lot
is my travel agent!

1405
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,869
He was giving me their visas!

1406
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:17,102
Wow, Thailand.
Thanks a lot, JB. That's some...

1407
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,339
Don't mention it. I just...

1408
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:25,444
You know, if nursing doesn't work
out, you have a career in espionage.

1409
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,953
(Sniggers)

1410
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,750
Thanks, Greg.

1411
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,192
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

1412
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,865
I guess you're gonna stay here?

1413
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:19,533
Pam, I...

1414
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,382
It's 0K. It's 0K.

1415
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,702
Gaylord M. Focker?

1416
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,765
"Gaylord"?

1417
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:56,776
Yeah, that's me.

1418
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:00,370
- I thought your name was Greg.
- It is.

1419
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,474
- That's not on the form.
- No one's called me by it

1420
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,576
since I was in third grade.

1421
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,381
(Sniggering)

1422
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,650
(Courier) Whatever.

1423
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,762
Wait, wait, wait.
Your name's Gay Focker?

1424
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,626
(Laughter)

1425
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:22,365
- Denny.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1426
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:25,304
It's not a normal name, you know?

1427
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,538
You're in luck. There is room...

1428
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,742
(Typing)

1429
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:17,657
And without a Saturday stay-over
that fare difference will be

1430
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:20,387
$1,137 and 11 cents.

1431
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:27,398
- Did you want me to book this seat?
- 0K. All right.

1432
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,631
- (Typing)
- Did you want to check any bags?

1433
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,710
We should be all right
with only one usher.

1434
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:19,150
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1435
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:27,425
Thought you might like to see this.

1436
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:39,304
- How did you get this?
- I have my sources, too.

1437
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:47,847
I called Gaylord -
AKA Greg's parents in Detroit.

1438
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,282
They saved his SAT scores, too,
in case you're interested.

1439
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:55,288
0h, honey, it doesn't matter
if he did well in some test.

1440
01:29:55,356 --> 01:30:00,316
Look at this! He almost destroyed
the wedding because he lied!

1441
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,660
I love you, Daddy...

1442
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,200
but you can be a real jerk sometimes.

1443
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:14,838
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

1444
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,706
Who is, Jack?

1445
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:20,646
Nobody has ever been good enough
for your Pam.

1446
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,849
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin

1447
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,914
until she broke up with him?

1448
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:34,519
Maybe it's time you think
about what Pam wants.

1449
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,142
Greg, it's me.

1450
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,407
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

1451
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:57,781
so, um, I guess you'll get this
when you get home.

1452
01:30:57,885 --> 01:30:59,284
Um...

1453
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:02,252
Listen, I am so sorry.

1454
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,919
I acted like
a complete idiot, and...

1455
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:08,359
And I hope that you can forgive me.

1456
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:11,489
I mean, I...I don't care about...

1457
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:15,093
the fire or the cat or...

1458
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:19,606
I mean, I can't believe you
actually...spray-painted a cat...

1459
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,971
It's actually really gross.

1460
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:24,307
But the point is that...

1461
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:28,344
that I understand
why you did it, and...

1462
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,680
and I love you.

1463
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:35,654
I want you to know that I really,
I really, really love you and...

1464
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,485
So when you get this,
will you please call me?

1465
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:43,962
0K, bye.

1466
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:54,504
I need a commercial flight ID scan.
New York, La Guardia to Chicago.

1467
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,440
Four-hour sweeps,

1468
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,447
last name Foxtrot-0scar-
Charlie-Kilo-Echo-Romeo,

1469
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,109
first name Golf-Alpha-Yankee...

1470
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:07,553
'Gaylord Focker, Atlantic American
flight 27. Departs 2:35.'

1471
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:09,451
- 2:35?
- 'Affirmative.'

1472
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:11,582
23 minutes. Thanks.

1473
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,559
(Clerk) Enjoy your flight.

1474
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:16,055
Hello.

1475
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:22,366
Sorry, we're only boarding rows
nine and above. You'll have to wait.

1476
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:25,362
I'm in row eight.

1477
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,532
Please step aside, sir.

1478
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,701
It's one row. Is it 0K if I...?

1479
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:32,405
We'll call your row momentarily.

1480
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,807
Step aside, sir.

1481
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:57,828
Hm.

1482
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,875
(Through PA) Thank you for waiting.

1483
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:06,573
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.

1484
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,754
0h. Hello.

1485
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,416
Mm-hm. Enjoy your flight.

1486
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:33,669
(Horns honking)

1487
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,604
Excuse me.

1488
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,882
0K, where's the fire, huh?

1489
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:52,253
- Sir, you'll have to check that.
- I got it.

1490
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:56,023
- No, sorry, that bag won't fit.
- I'm not checking my bag.

1491
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:57,860
Don't raise your voice, sir.

1492
01:33:57,932 --> 01:34:01,060
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be raising my voice!

1493
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't wanna check my bag.

1494
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:06,164
And your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

1495
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,677
I did that once and you lost it,
and everything screwed up for me.

1496
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:14,806
I assure you your bag will be placed
safely below with the other luggage.

1497
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:18,079
0h, yeah? How do you know
my bag is safe below?

1498
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,416
Are you gonna take my bag
and put it there?

1499
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:23,946
Are you gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it there?

1500
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:27,153
- No.
- 0K, then shut your pie hole

1501
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:29,025
and listen to me when I say

1502
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:33,760
that I am finished with the
checking-of-the-bags conversation!

1503
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,029
Sir, if a bag is this large...

1504
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:40,335
0K, you know what? Get your
grubby little paws off of my bag!

1505
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:43,673
It's not like I have a bomb
to blow up the plane.

1506
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:47,043
I just want to stow my bag
according to regulations!

1507
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:48,103
Sir! Sir!

1508
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:52,414
If you would take the sticks
out of your head you would see

1509
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:55,649
that all I have to do
is do what I wanna do,

1510
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:59,682
and all I wanna do is hold on
to my bag and not listen to you.

1511
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,990
The only way I would let go

1512
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:05,931
would be if you tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers, 0K?

1513
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,369
If you can get it from my
kung-fu grip, then you can have it.

1514
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,599
0therwise, step off, bitch!

1515
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:14,106
(Gasps)

1516
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:16,872
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1517
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:20,037
Keep your... Agh!

1518
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:29,352
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended!

1519
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,015
So tow it.

1520
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:33,560
You threatened that stewardess.

1521
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:37,461
I was just trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing!

1522
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:41,433
- You threatened her with a bomb!
- I said I didn't have a bomb!

1523
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:43,834
- You said bomb.
- I said I didn't have a bomb.

1524
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:47,066
- You said bomb on an airplane
- What's wrong with that?

1525
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:48,768
You can't say "bomb" on airplanes.

1526
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,367
Bomb, bomb, bomb.
Bomb, bomb, bomb-bomb.

1527
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:52,173
Bomb bo-bo-bomb
bo-bom-bom-bo-bomb!!

1528
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,577
- Arrest me!
- Assaulting an...

1529
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:55,979
What if I was a bombardier?

1530
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:00,744
Norm.

1531
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:03,983
Take five. We got a specialist.

1532
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,251
Bye, Norm.

1533
01:36:11,065 --> 01:36:14,159
0h, shit. How'd you get here?

1534
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:16,260
I'm everywhere, Focker.

1535
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:19,465
- I didn't do anything, Jack.
- Yeah, I know.

1536
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:22,703
Then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1537
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,770
I'm not telling anyone anything
until you answer some questions.

1538
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:30,874
Unless you wanna go to prison,
you better tell me the truth.

1539
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,784
No more lies, understand?
No more lies.

1540
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:36,550
- Did you do this?
- Answer the question.

1541
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:41,061
- Did you get me taken off the plane?
- Put your hands over there.

1542
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,028
You're sick, you know that?

1543
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:49,202
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no.

1544
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,669
Yes.

1545
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:53,571
- Are you a male nurse?
- Yes.

1546
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,541
- Are you a pot head?
- No.

1547
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:57,941
- Have you ever smoked pot?
- Yes.

1548
01:36:58,012 --> 01:37:02,415
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr. Jinx?

1549
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,212
Yes.

1550
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:06,378
Because you were seeking my approval?

1551
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:07,613
Yes.

1552
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,418
- Because you love Pam?
- Yes.

1553
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:12,253
Do you want to marry her?

1554
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:16,191
Do you want to marry her?

1555
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,262
I did.

1556
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,393
Till I met you.

1557
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,664
What does that mean?

1558
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:28,401
I love your daughter.
I love her more than anything.

1559
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:32,844
But frankly, sir, I'm terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1560
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:38,510
This weekend has made me doubt that
I could even survive in your family.

1561
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:44,920
I think you've got
some serious issues.

1562
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:50,223
If I lighten up, would you
consider marrying my daughter?

1563
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,265
Would you lighten up a lot?

1564
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:55,735
- Y...
- Yes or no?

1565
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:59,739
- Yes.
- Would you let us live our lives?

1566
01:37:59,807 --> 01:38:02,742
I promise not
to interfere in your lives.

1567
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:05,209
Stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1568
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,942
Could you at least try
to consider another profession?

1569
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:10,813
- Jack, yes or no?
- Ever?

1570
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,479
- No.
- 0K, yes.

1571
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:17,854
- Let me and Pam sleep together?
- Don't push it, Focker.

1572
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:20,621
You're in a real mess.

1573
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:26,260
Would you support my daughter
the way she deserves to be?

1574
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,800
Yes.

1575
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:30,166
Would you be honest and faithful?

1576
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:32,034
Yes.

1577
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:36,576
Will you devote yourself entirely
to her for the rest of your life?

1578
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:38,737
0f course.

1579
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:41,274
Gaylord Focker...

1580
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:45,776
Will you be my son-in-law?

1581
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:53,857
(Door creaks)

1582
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:11,605
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.

1583
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,772
We had a little plane trouble.

1584
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:17,146
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

1585
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:20,380
Don't...don't worry, it's 0K.

1586
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,217
We worked out a lot of our issues.

1587
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:25,452
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

1588
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:29,360
He gave me his human lie detector
thing, but I passed.

1589
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:33,366
- Good.
- Yeah.

1590
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,402
And...

1591
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:37,437
then he proposed.

1592
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:43,065
Are you feeling all right?

1593
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:47,747
Listen...
This weekend was a nightmare.

1594
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:48,975
0h.

1595
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:51,984
I had this elaborate plan,
but somewhere...

1596
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:55,749
between giving your sister
a black eye and...

1597
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:59,452
setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

1598
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,228
I just... I love you.

1599
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:04,093
I love you so much.

1600
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:07,260
I don't know, it makes no sense...

1601
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:09,492
I think he's about to do it.

1602
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:12,835
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

1603
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:14,601
Shh-shh!

1604
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:19,476
And if we can get through...what we
got through in the last 48 hours,

1605
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:21,514
we could get through anything.

1606
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:24,276
I think so, too.

1607
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:27,286
- And I don't...
- Wait, hang on a sec.

1608
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:29,015
(Whispers) Mr. Jinx.

1609
01:40:29,089 --> 01:40:31,182
Mew mew mew mew. Mew mew mew mew.

1610
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:36,622
Hi, Jinx...

1611
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,126
It's a ring.

1612
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:45,429
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

1613
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:48,575
Pam...

1614
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:51,774
Will you marry me?

1615
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:53,210
Yes!

1616
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:55,446
Yes!

1617
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,108
Yes!

1618
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,315
Yes!

1619
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:04,347
Attaboy, Greg.

1620
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:08,593
That "circle of trust" thing,
that's mine.

1621
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:15,068
Well, looks like we've got
another wedding to plan.

1622
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:17,433
Yup. Just got to do one more thing.

1623
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:19,472
- What's that?
- Meet his parents.

1624
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:22,932
- Jack...
- Honey, relax.

1625
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:26,036
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

1626
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:27,740
Good night, Jack.

1627
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:41,323
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker?

1628
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:42,623
(Pam sighs)

1629
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:46,996
Do you, Deborah Byrnes, take Robert
Banks to be your wedded husband?

1630
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,694
Yes! I mean, I do!

1631
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,397
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1632
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,752
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

1633
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:38,974
I knew it.

1634
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:41,020
(Greg) '0h! Shit!'

1635
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:44,016
I knew it.

1636
01:42:44,091 --> 01:42:45,683
'Damn!'

1637
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:56,093
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

1638
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:58,334
'Hello, Jack.

1639
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:01,374
'Aw, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.

1640
01:43:01,441 --> 01:43:03,705
'What's that, Jack? What?

1641
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:05,768
'You're a big, fat, CIA man, huh?

1642
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,373
'Did they teach you THAT...?
They teach you THAT?

1643
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:11,576
'0h, yeah, what's that, Jack?

1644
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:16,589
'You thought "Puff" was just the
name of the boy's magic dragon?

1645
01:43:16,657 --> 01:43:18,750
'Not too quick on the uptake, huh?

1646
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:22,522
'Why don't you ask Denny?
Not onto that one, huh?

1647
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:25,588
'Surprising for a big
CIA pulse detector.

1648
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:29,033
'0oh, hey, check my pulse
on this question.

1649
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:31,195
'Do I think you're a psycho? Yes.

1650
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:35,071
'What? 0h, you like
my little...gift?

1651
01:43:35,142 --> 01:43:37,838
'What? The Jerusalem what?

1652
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:40,903
'I can't hear you.
Jerusalem tulipoosy-posly-lit...?

1653
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:45,884
'What? 0h, you don't know shit
about flowers. You want me to what?

1654
01:43:45,953 --> 01:43:47,750
'A question? Sure...

1655
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:49,550
'Can you deal with THAT?!'
