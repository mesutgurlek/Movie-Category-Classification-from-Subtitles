What?

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,222
No, I don't work today.

you're gonna come in, 12:00?

00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,058
Be there by 12:00? Where?

13
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,509
Swear you'll be there by 12:00

in and smoke that way.

- This is where you're heading.

- Do you want that?
- If it's already too late, I guess...

No, it's never too late. Put the cigarettes
back, and try some gum instead.

- Here. Chewlies gum. Try this.
- It's not the same.

and it certainly beats this.

- Fifty five.

the customers.

- This?

dollars a week on your cigarettes?

102
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:03,378
- Forty.
- Fifty three.

103
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:06,420
Fifty three dollars a week
on cigarettes! Come on!

104
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:08,980
Would you give somebody
that much each week to kill you?

105

That's what you're doing now by paying
for this so called privilege to smoke!

We're gonna croak sometime.

It's that mentality that allows
the cancer producing industry to thrive.

108
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,480
Of course we're all gonna die someday!
Do we have to pay for it?

- They were called Nazis!

- Friggin' Nazi.

117

They practically wiped
an entire nation off the Earth,

- You want me to leave. Why?

'Cause somebody's telling it like it is,
giving these fine people a wake up call?

121
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,277
No, you're loitering
and causing a disturbance.

122
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,928
I'm a disturbance?
You're the disturbance, pal.

Here, now I am a customer.
I'm gonna buy some Chewlies gum.

I'm a customer engaged in a discussion
with the other customers.

You are the source in this area,
and we're gonna shut you down for good!

Let's see some credentials.
Slowly!

135
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:57,195
- You're a Chewlies gum representative?
- [Man] Chewlies?

136
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:01,673
You're stirring up anti-smoking
sentiment to, what, sell more gum?

137
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,917
Get out of here!

138
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:08,562
And you people, don't you have jobs
to go to? Get out of here. Go commute.

139
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:12,402
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of easily led automatons.

140
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:16,396
Try thinking for yourselves before you
pelt an innocent man with cigarettes!

141
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:21,041
[Coughing, clears throat]

142
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,597
Uh, pack of cigarettes?

143
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:34,128
Don't you think you're taking
this too hard?

144
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:38,966
I have enough indignities in my life and
people start throwing cigarettes at me.

145
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,847
- At least they weren't lit.
- I hate this fucking place.

146
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,247
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.

147
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:46,485
Veronica, the last thing I need is a lecture.

148
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,368
All I'm saying is, if you're
that unhappy, you should leave.

149
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,249
- I'm not even supposed to be here today!
- I know.

00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:55,282
I stopped by your house.
Your mom told me you left, at 6:00.

151
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,006
The guy got sick.
He couldn't come in.

152
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,726
- Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?
- Yes.

153
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,927
I'm gonna play like shit because
I didn't have a good night's sleep.

154
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,485
- Why'd you agree to come in?
- I'm only here until 12:00.

155
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:08,662
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

156
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,509
- Why don't you open the shutters?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

157
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:15,444
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

158
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,023
- Thanks.
- How much did you leave up there?

159
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:26,966
Three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

160
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,791
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

161
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,345
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that?

162
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:36,248
How do you know they're taking the right
change or paying for what they take?

163
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,908
Theoretically, people see money,
no one around,

164
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,834
they think they're being watched.

165
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,907
Honesty through paranoia.

166
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,987
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

167
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,394
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

168
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,428
- Smell won't come off.
- [Door opens]

169
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,803
You think anybody
can see us down here?

170
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,757
Why, you wanna have sex or something?

171
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,829
- Can we?
- Really?

172
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:59,870
- I was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

173
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:03,172
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure?

174
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:06,371
Show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

175
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,611
- What about what we do for you?
- Women?

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,747
Women as lovers are basically the same.
They just have to be there.

177
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,817
Be there?

178
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,491
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

179
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:19,337
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

180
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:21,257
How flattering.

181
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:24,138
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

182
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,697
You think so?

183
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:28,706
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

184
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,235
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

185
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,894
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?

186
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:38,221
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

187
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:40,936
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

188
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:42,315
I've touched a nerve.

189
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:45,230
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

190
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,816
It wasn't directed at you.
It's a broad generalization.

191
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:50,222
You're making a generalization
about broads.

192
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:52,263
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

193
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,540
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

194
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,616
- How many?
- How many what?

195
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,275
How many different girls
have you slept with?

196
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,996
- Didn't we have this discussion before?
- We might have.

197
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:05,034
- I don't remember. How many?
- Including you?

198
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,594
It better be up to and including me.

199
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,016
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls?

200
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,979
Including you? Yes.

201
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,051
- Ow! What'd you do that for?
- You're a pig!

202
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,124
Why'd you hit me?

203
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,003
Do you know how many men
I've had sex with?

204
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,458
- Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.

205
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,737
- Three?
- Three, including you.

206
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,398
You only slept with three people?

207
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,325
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who?

208
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,140
- You!
- No, who are the three, besides me.

209
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,241
- John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
- Wow.

210
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,061
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

211
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:38,673
- You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

212
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,239
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

213
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,484
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

214
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,041
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

215
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,488
Name it.

216
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:48,409
I want you to come with me on Monday.

217
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,816
- Where?
- To school.

218
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:52,981
There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program

219
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,906
after a lapse in enrollment.

220
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,827
Can't we have a discussion
without that?

221
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,419
It's important to me, Dante.

222
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:01,013
You have so much potential
going to waste in this pit.

223
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:04,663
- I wish you'd go back to school.
- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

224
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,581
- Shit! Why're you getting up?
- I have class in 45 minutes.

225
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,549
Willam?

226
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,981
Hey, Ronni.
How you been, man?

227
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,795
What, do you work here now?

228
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:20,060
No, I was visiting my man.

229
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:23,576
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

230
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:27,904
- How you doing? Just the soda?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

231
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:31,898
So where you been, man?
Still going to Seton Hall?

232
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,095
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

233
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:39,294
That's beautiful, man.

234
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,502
So, you still talk to Silvan?

235
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,572
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

236
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,499
Oh, that's great.

237
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:50,210
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

238
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:53,147
Bye. Take it easy.

239
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:56,735
- [Ronni] That was Snowball.
- [Dante] Why do you call him that?

240
00:14:56,806 --> 00:15:00,385
Silvan made it up.
It's a blow job thing.

241
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,310
What do you mean?

242
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,791
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

243
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,719
It's called snowballing.

244
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,436
- He requests this?
- He gets off on it.

245
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:13,637
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that?

246
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,040
Like you said, she snowballed him.

247
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:20,035
- Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

248
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,114
I'm serious.

249
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,635
- You sucked that guy's dick?
- Yeah. How do you think I knew...

250
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,320
You said you had sex with three guys.
You never mentioned him.

251
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,039
- Because I never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick!

252
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:34,924
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.

253
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,957
Oh, my God. Why did you tell me
you only had sex with three guys?

254
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,364
Because I did only have sex
with three guys.

255
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,726
- Doesn't mean I didn't go with people.
- I feel so nauseous.

256
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,646
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

257
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,173
I did understand!

258
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,063
That you had sex with three guys
and that's all you said!

259
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:51,983
- Please calm down.
- How many?

260
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,220
- How many dicks have you sucked?
- Let it go!

261
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,751
Shut up and I'll tell you. Jesus!

262
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,476
I didn't freak out when you told me
how many girls you fucked!

263
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,328
This is different. This is important.
How many?

264
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,747
Well?

265
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:19,660
- Something like 36.
- What? Something like 36?

266
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,384
- Lower your voice.
- What is that? "Something like 36"?

267
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,309
Does that include me?

268
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,982
- Uh... 37.
- I'm 37?

269
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,187
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

270
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:35,282
- 37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks!
- In a row?

271
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,549
- Where you going?
- Listen, jerk. Until today, you never knew

272
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:41,268
how many guys I slept with
because you never bothered to ask.

273
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:44,950
You act all nonchalant about fucking
12 girls. I never had sex with 12 guys!

274
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,407
- You sucked enough dick!
- I went down on a few guys.

275
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:50,330
- A few?
- One was you. The last one, I might add.

276
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:54,323
Which, if you're too stupid to comprehend,
means I've been faithful since we met.

277
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:58,008
All the others I went with before I met you.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.

278
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:01,372
Don't look at me like the town whore,
you were plenty busy before you met me.

279
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,049
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any other decent person?

280
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,972
Because going down isn't a big deal.

281
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,853
I liked a guy, we'd make out,
and I'd go down on him.

282
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:12,569
- But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
- I feel sick.

283
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,362
I love you!
Don't feel sick.

284
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,799
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

285
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,548
I'm going to school.
Maybe later you'll be more rational.

286
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:22,202
- I'm 37! I just can't...
- Goodbye, Dante!

287
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,417
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on the way through the parking lot!

288
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,904
Hey! Hey, you!
Get back here.

289
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:40,415
I thought that place was supposed
to be open at 11:00. It's 11:20.

290
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,713
I've already called his house twice.
He'll be here soon.

291
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,229
Hey, it's not like
it's a demanding job over there.

292
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,789
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

293
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,677
I walked in the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

294
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:55,394
- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?

295
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:59,173
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No! He was probably resting his eyes.

296
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,476
What the hell is that,
"resting his eyes"?

297
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:05,254
- Like he's some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that's his night job.

298
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,616
Wise ass too, huh?
Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.

299
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,878
That's why you jockey a register
in some fuckin' convenience store

300
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:14,117
instead of working at a steady job.

301
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:17,798
I've got no time to bullshit around,
waiting for that son of a bitch.

302
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,809
Make sure he gets that.

303
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:24,227
The number's 812. My name's Wynarski.
I wanted a movie tonight.

304
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,755
If you tell me the movie title,
he'll hold it for you.

305
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:30,603
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

306
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:35,557
[Door opens, closes]

307
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,150
You forgot your keys.

308
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:52,140
- Guy ain't here yet.
- You're kidding! It's almost 11:30.

309
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:56,944
- I've been here since 11:00.
- I hate it when I can't rent videos!

310
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,141
I would've went to Big Choice,
but the tape I want is on that wall.

311
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,153
- Really? Which one?
- Dental School.

312
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,616
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

313
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:06,546
- I have first dibs.
- Says who?

314
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,743
Says me. I've been here half an hour.
I'd call that first dibs.

315
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:13,261
- Ain't gonna happen. I'm getting it.
- Like hell you are.

316
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,821
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

317
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,748
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.

318
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:21,130
All right, asshole. You're on.

319
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,383
You're late.

320
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:41,622
- What are you doing here?
- The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

321
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,538
- Why are the shutters closed?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

322
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:47,024
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- That's what I said.

323
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,165
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

324
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,050
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Go open the store.

325
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,949
- Hey, you see a set of keys around here?
- No time for love, Dr. Jones.

326
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,795
Fucking kids.

327
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,932
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

328
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:31,515
Said the store was closed for two hours
yesterday. I tore up his membership.

329
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:32,961
Shocking abuse of authority.

330
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:35,810
I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class,

331
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,152
especially since I rule.

332
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:40,894
- [Randal] Want something to drink?
- [Dante] No, thanks.

333
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:43,136
Who was on your phone
this morning, like, 2:30?

334
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:45,278
- I was trying to call for half an hour.
- Why?

335
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:48,765
I wanted to use your car.
Snack cake.

336
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:50,862
You don't wanna know.

337
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,742
- You call Caitlin again?
- She called me.

338
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,939
- You tell Veronica?
- One fight a day is all I can stomach.

339
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,757
- What do you fight about?
- We don't fight about anything.

340
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,824
She wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction.

341
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,352
I bet the most frequent
topic of argument is Caitlin.

342
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,629
- You win.
- I'm going to offer you some advice.

343
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:10,342
Let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin.
You been with Veronica how long?

344
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,581
- Seven months.
- Chick's nuts about you.

345
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,592
- How long you date Caitlin?
- Five years.

346
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,056
Chick made you nuts.
She cheated on you how many times?

347
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:18,986
- Eight and a half.
- Eight and a half?

348
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:22,248
Party at John Kay's, senior year.
I pass out in his bedroom.

349
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,902
- Caitlin jumps all over me.
- So that's cheating?

350
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:28,268
- In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad?

351
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,017
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

352
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:34,020
- One time, I called this girl "mom".
- I hit the light, she freaks.

353
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:36,429
- She thought I was Brad Michaelson.
- What?

354
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,561
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a dark room. Picked the wrong one.

355
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,638
- She didn't know I was at the party.
- God.

356
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,046
- Great story, huh?
- That girl was vile to you.

357
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:47,243
Interesting postscript.
Know who wound up in there with Brad?

358
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,774
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.

359
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,145
- Chess team Alan Harris?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

360
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,209
They raise sheep.

361
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,722
- Frightening.
- Different strokes to move the world.

362
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:59,340
I don't see how you could romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

363
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:02,062
She broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

364
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:04,019
- There was a lot of good.
- Oh, yeah?

365
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,287
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

366
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,804
That's what high school was about.
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

367
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:12,365
- Think things will be different this time?
- They are.

368
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:15,569
When she calls me now, she's different.
Frightened, vulnerable.

369
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:18,987
She's finishing college
and about to enter the real world.

370
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:21,550
- Shit, I gotta place an order.
- Talkin' to myself.

371
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:25,169
- I'm listening. She's leaving college...?
- And she's looking for support.

372
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,444
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

373
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,527
What about Veronica?

374
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,415
The arguments Veronica and I have
are a manifestation

375
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,488
of a subconscious desire
to break up,

376
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,895
to pursue a meaningful relationship
with Caitlin.

377
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,547
- Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
- It's safe to say yes.

378
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:41,585
- I think all four of you better talk it over.
- All four?

379
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:45,750
You, Veronica, Caitlin
and Caitlin's fiancé.

380
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,233
- Do you sell video tapes?
- Yeah. What are you looking for?

381
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,269
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
- Uh, one second.

382
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:04,637
I'm on with the distribution house.
Let me make sure they got it.

383
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:07,321
- What's it called again?
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.

384
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,300
- [Child] Happy Scrappy...
- She loves it.

385
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,455
Obviously.

386
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,353
This is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

387
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:17,595
I'd like to place an order.

388
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,836
I need one each of the following tapes:

389
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,913
Whispers In The Wind,
To Each His Own,

390
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:25,052
Put It Where It Doesn't Belong,
My Pipes Need Cleaning,

391
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:28,254
All Tit Fucking Volume Eight,
I Need Your Cock,

392
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:31,618
Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers,
My Cunt And Eight Shafts,

393
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:35,808
Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts,
Cum Buns III,

394
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:38,593
Cumming In Socks,
Cum On Ilene,

395
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:40,701
Huge Black Cocks
with Pearly White Cum,

396
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:43,457
Girls Who Crave Cock,
Girls Who Crave Cunt,

397
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:47,071
Men Alone Il: The KY Connection,
Pink Pussy Lips,

398
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:50,110
oh, yeah, and
All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.

399
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:54,045
Yup. Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

400
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,581
# I'm a needle, you know

401
00:23:55,655 --> 00:24:00,031
# Never want to be a haystack

402
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:03,236
# Don't ever want to break
Your heart in two

403
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:06,753
# Know the crowd
Is gonna sell their soul

404
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:09,793
# Take it anywhere I know
Well, I promise you

405
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,906
# It's making me sick #

406
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,618
Yes, I'd like to check on
a misprint in today's edition.

407
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:18,756
Today's edition.

408
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:22,440
It says,
"Bree to wed Asian design major".

409
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,363
No, everything's spelled fine.

410
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:27,495
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

411
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,151
I don't know,
a typographical error or something.

412
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:34,794
Maybe it should say, "Caitlin Bray"
or "Caitlin Bre" with one "e".

413
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:39,501
I'm a curious party.
A curious party.

414
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,290
I'm an ex- boyfriend, and...

415
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,622
I talk to her all the time and
she never mentioned this engagement.

416
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:47,591
That's why I'm thinking
maybe it's a misprint.

417
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:53,927
Are you sure? Maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

418
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,897
Meaning like, someone who asked her out
once and got shot down,

419
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,314
and this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper.

420
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:04,722
Hello. Hello?

421
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,395
- [Sniffing]
- [Cat meows]

422
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:17,107
I don't care if she's my cousin, I'm
gonna knock those boots again tonight.

423
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:20,557
- Look. The fuckin' human vacuum.
- Scumbag, what are you doing?

424
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:23,501
- Hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin.
- He's your cousin?

425
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,583
- He's from Russia too.
- No way.

426
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:29,365
- What part of Russia?
- Do I look like his fuckin' biographer?

427
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:33,524
- Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
- Moscow.

428
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:37,368
- He only speaks Russian?
- He speaks some English, but not good.

429
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:40,401
- Is he staying here?
- He's moving to the big city this week.

430
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,646
- He wants to be a metal singer.
- [Girl] No way.

431
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:45,203
I swear. Olaf, metal.

432
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:48,887
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

433
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:51,509
- [Speaks Russian]
- That's fucked up, man.

434
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,809
- What did he say?
- I don't know, but this guy's a character.

435
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:57,844
- He really wants to play metal?
- He's got his own band in Moscow.

436
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:01,366
- Called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans".
- That doesn't sound metal.

437
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:04,569
You gotta hear him sing.
Olaf, "Berserker".

438
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:08,251
- Come on, man, "Berserker"!
- Does he sing in English or Russian?

439
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,254
In English. Come on, "Berserker".
Girls think sexy.

440
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,154
- Aah. Aah.
- Watch, he's gonna sing it. It's too funny.

441
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:20,633
# My love for you

# Would you like
Some making fuck, berserker #

443
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:27,836
- That's fuckin' funny, man.
- Did he say, "making fuck"?

That's beautiful, man.

450
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:05,960
Hold on to the counter
and I'll pull.

451
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,993
Usually I just turn the can upside down.

452
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:11,401
Maybe we oughta soap your hand up.

453
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:14,599
They ought to put a warning on these,
like with cigarettes.

454
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,423
I think it's coming!

455
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:22,603
Thanks. I thought I was going
to have to go to the hospital.

456
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,255
I'll throw this out
as a precautionary measure.

Stings a little.

458

A word of advice. Sometimes you
got to let those hard-to-reach chips go.

- [Door opens]
- Thanks.

460
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:38,215
That article's accurate.
Caitlin really is getting married.

461
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,419
- Know what I just watched?
- Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?

462
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:42,798
Return Of The Jedi.

463
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:45,996
Didn't you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.

464
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,677
What did you like better?
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?

465
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:51,688
- Empire.
- Blasphemy.

466
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,546
Empire had the better ending.

467
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,906
Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

468
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:01,266
Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett.
It ends on such a down note.

469
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:04,627
I mean, that's what life is
a series of down endings.

470
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,994
All Jedi had was a bunch of muppets.

471
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:10,378
There was something else going on
in Jedi. I never noticed it 'til today.

472
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,363
They build another Death Star, right?

473
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:15,667
The first one was fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

474
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,742
Luke blew it up. Give credit.

475
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:20,052
The second one was being built
when they blew it up.

476
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,679
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

477
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,240
Something never sat right with me
that second time.

478
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,963
I couldn't put my finger on it.
Something wasn't right.

479
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:28,177
And you figured it out.

480
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,736
The first Death Star
was manned by the Imperial Army.

481
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,225
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, Imperialists.

482
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,298
Basically.

483
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:37,940
So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

484
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,524
- And the second time around?
- It wasn't even done being built yet.

485
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,766
- It was still under construction.
- So?

486
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,105
A job of that magnitude would require

487
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:49,075
a lot more manpower
than the Imperial Army had to offer.

488
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:51,767
I'll bet they brought
independent contractors in.

489
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:54,487
- Plumbers, roofers...
- Not just Imperialists.

490
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:57,493
- Is that what you're getting at?
- To get it built quickly,

491
00:28:57,565 --> 00:28:59,508
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

492
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:02,233
Think the average Storm Trooper
can install a toilet main?

493
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:06,645
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in independent contractors.

494
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:11,455
- Why are you so upset.
- All those contractors brought in are killed.

495
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,171
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

496
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,267
Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

497
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:21,055
You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

498
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:24,090
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

499
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:28,189
Along come these militants who blast
everything within a three-mile radius.

500
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:30,681
You didn't ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

501
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:33,690
- You're trying to scrape out a living.
- I don't mean to interrupt,

502
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:36,580
- what are you talking about?
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.

503
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:37,922
He's trying to convince me

504
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:41,153
that any independent contractors
working on the Death Star

505
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:43,709
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed.

506
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,336
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

507
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:48,262
"Done And Ready Home Improvements".

508
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:51,459
Speaking as a roofer, I can tell you
a roofer's personal politics

509
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:54,495
- comes into play when choosing jobs.
- Like when?

510
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,864
Three weeks ago, I was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

511
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,744
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

512
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:04,258
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

513
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,948
- Then I realized whose house it was.
- [Dante] Whose was it?

514
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,816
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Babyface Bambino? The gangster?

515
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:14,666
The same! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

516
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:18,594
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

517
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:21,156
- Based on personal politics.
- Right!

518
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:25,321
The next week, the Foresci family
put a hit on Babyface's house.

519
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,619
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

520
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:29,799
No way.

521
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,733
[Man] I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

522
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,662
My friend wasn't so lucky.

523
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:39,623
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

524
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:42,184
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

525
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:45,159
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

526
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:59,086
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

527
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:05,168
Are either one of these any good?

528
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:07,092
- Sir?
- What?

529
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,770
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don't watch movies.

530
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:14,067
[Sighs] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

531
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:17,266
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

532
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:21,110
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

533
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,030
Nope.

534
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:24,951
[Sighs]

535
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,230
- Well, what about these two?
- They suck.

536
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:33,593
[Sighs]
These are the same two movies.

537
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:36,974
- You weren't paying any attention.
- No, I wasn't.

538
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,222
I don't think your manager
would appreciate...

539
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:42,390
- I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon?

540
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:45,907
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

541
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,072
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention.

542
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,996
And I hope it feels good.

543
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:55,160
- You hope what feels good?
- I hope it feels so good to be right.

544
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,466
Nothing's more exhilarating
than pointing out

545
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:59,357
the shortcomings of others, is there?

546
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:02,555
[Heavy sigh] Well, this is
the last time I rent here!

547
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:05,755
- You will be missed.
- Screw you!

548
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,096
- You're not allowed to rent here anymore!
- [Jay] Yeah!

549
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,015
Screw me?

550
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,924
You'll never believe what this
unruly customer said.

551
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:30,425
- Wait.
- She in here?

552
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,508
This guy's going through all the eggs.

553
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,784
This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

554
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,635
- What's he looking for?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

555
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,419
- Perfect dozen?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

556
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,657
- The quest isn't going well?
- Obviously not.

557
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,956
- Look at the cartons that didn't make it.
- Why doesn't he mix and match?

558
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:48,412
- I told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say?

559
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:51,619
He said it's important to have standards.
No one has pride anymore.

560
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:53,826
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

561
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:56,744
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

562
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,679
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

563
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,825
Two packs of cigarettes.

564
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,833
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

565
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:11,559
- You know him?
- No, but I know the behavior.

566
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,668
He's looking for the perfect
carton of eggs?

567
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,918
[Randal] How'd you know?

568
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:18,600
- I'll bet you he's a guidance counselor.
- [Dante] Why do you say that?

569
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:22,531
I saw it happen in Food City, last year.
Different guy, though.

570
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:25,322
Stock boy said he looked through
cartons for half an hour,

571
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,397
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

572
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,667
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

573
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:32,558
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

574
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:34,762
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.

575
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:38,094
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

576
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,779
They used to make a big deal of it.
They just let it go now.

577
00:33:40,848 --> 00:33:43,882
They always pay for whatever they break.
They never bother anybody.

578
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:45,448
Why guidance counselors?

579
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:48,686
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

580
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:52,104
- My guidance counselor was worthless.
- See?

581
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,513
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference.

582
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:59,566
That's why I manually masturbate caged
animals for artificial insemination.

583
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:04,851
# Go your own way

584
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:09,904
# You can call it
Another lonely day #

585
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:36,310
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in "9"?

586
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:38,234
Damn, that's eerie.

587
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,983
Know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour?

588
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,066
What's a jiz-mopper?

589
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,272
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

590
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,347
- "Nudie booth"?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

591
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,909
- You ever been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.

592
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,126
Oh, man, it's great.

593
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:54,231
You go into a booth, and there's
glass between you and these chicks.

594
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:57,434
- They put on a show for you for ten bucks.
- What kind of a show?

595
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:00,470
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

596
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:04,089
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

597
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,494
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now?

598
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,527
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

599
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,575
Everybody does it right on the window.

600
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:14,748
I don't know if you know this,
cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it.

601
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:17,720
- I will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me?

602
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:21,504
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

603
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,953
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

604
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:27,930
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

605
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:30,688
You've highly offended me.

606
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:33,692
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

607
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,554
Oh!
[Screaming]

608
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:38,240
- You can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that?

609
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,060
- You know he's going tell the boss.
- Who cares?

610
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:43,941
He's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in is way too uptight.

611
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:46,822
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

612
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:50,019
- I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up?

613
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,056
You'd feel better if you'd
rip into the occasional customer.

614
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:55,944
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

615
00:35:56,009 --> 00:36:00,516
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that
annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.

616
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,074
- There aren't!
- How can you lie like that?

617
00:36:03,146 --> 00:36:08,515
Why don't you vent? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off?

618
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:11,883
Well, I guess it isn't
customers in particular.

619
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:14,599
Maybe just a group of customers.

620
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:18,793
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

621
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,716
The Milk Maids?

622
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:24,524
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

623
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,557
as if somewhere beyond all the
gallons is a container of milk...

624
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,216
that won't go bad for like a decade.

625
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:34,282
You know who I can do without?
The people in the video store.

626
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:36,392
- Which ones?
- All of 'em.

627
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:40,010
What would you get for a six-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

628
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,765
So, do you have any new movies in?

629
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:47,307
Do you have that one with that guy who
was in that movie that was out last year?

630
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:49,233
They never rent quality flicks.

631
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:52,365
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

632
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:54,857
Oooh! Navy SEALS!

633
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:58,281
In order to join they have to have an I.Q.
Less than their shoe size.

634
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:02,219
You think you get stupid questions?
You should hear the barrage that I get.

635
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:04,660
There's no ice?
I've got to drink this coffee hot?

636
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,987
So, how much is this thing anyway?

637
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:12,720
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

638
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,646
Ooh! Mini-Trucker magazine.

639
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:17,581
- See? You vented. Don't you feel better?
- No.

640
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:20,623
- Why not?
- My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

641
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,958
You got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

642
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,880
Veronica!

643
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:30,869
- What happened to home by 12:00?
- Boss hasn't shown up yet.

644
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:33,272
- How come you're not in class?
- Got canceled.

645
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,634
- So I brought you some lunch.
- What is it?

646
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,666
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts
cut off. What do you think?

647
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:42,391
- It's lasagna.
- Really?

648
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,794
Oh, you're the queen.

649
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:47,676
I'm glad you calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

650
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:50,556
- Thirty-seven?
- Shut up!

651
00:37:50,622 --> 00:37:53,917
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

652
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,673
[Sucking sound]

653
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:58,012
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

654
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,688
- You had to tell him?
- I had to. He put it into perspective.

655
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,575
- What did he say?
- He said at least he wasn't 36.

656
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,495
And that made you feel better?

657
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:13,857
And he said most of them were college
guys I never even seen or met before.

658
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,890
- The ostrich syndrome: If you don't see it...
- It isn't there. Yes.

659
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:20,094
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagna.

660
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,951
- Couldn't get the shutters open?
- No.

661
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:25,217
I called the locksmith. The earliest
he can be here is tomorrow morning.

662
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:27,772
Bummer. Well, I gotta
head back for the 1:30 class.

663
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:31,707
- What time you get finished?
- 8:00. I have a sorority meeting 'til 9:00.

664
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,334
I'll see you when you close.
Can we go out for coffee?

665
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:36,261
- Sure.
- Good.

666
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,498
See you when you close.
Enjoy the lasagna.

667
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,862
[Door opens, closes]

668
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:49,248
[Sucking sound]

669
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,968
Vermont?

670
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,068
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

671
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,724
He left at what time?

672
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:06,887
He really went to Vermont? When
the hell was someone going to tell me?

673
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:09,606
He promised me he'd be here by noon!

674
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:13,768
Jesus, when does he get back? Tuesday?
You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

675
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:16,171
I've got a game at 2:00,
the shutters are jammed.

676
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:19,850
And he's in Vermont?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!

677
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:22,252
[Sighing]

678
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,547
So I'm stuck here until closing?

679
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:29,445
Oh, this is just great.
I can't fucking believe this.

680
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,796
No. No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

681
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:38,127
Yeah, I know.

682
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:41,642
No, I'll be all right.

683
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:44,365
Well, that's all I can do, right?
Yeah.

684
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:47,249
- All right, thanks. Bye.
- Vermont?

685
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:50,217
- Can you fucking believe this?
- He didn't mention that to you?

686
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,942
Not a word!
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

687
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,184
- So, what? You're stuck here all day?
- Fuck!

688
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,107
- Why'd you apologize?
- What?

689
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,824
I heard you. Why?
You had every reason to be mad.

690
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,861
- I know!
- That seems to be the leitmotif in your life.

691
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,941
- Ever backing down.
- I don't back down!

692
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:07,502
You always back down.
You assume blame that's not yours.

693
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,225
You come in on your day off.
You buckle like a belt.

694
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:13,111
- Know what pisses me off?
- That I'm right about your buckling?

695
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:15,664
- I'm going to miss the game!
- Because you buckled.

696
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:18,868
- Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping!
- Don't yell at me, pal.

697
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:21,109
- I'm sorry.
- See? There you go again.

698
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:24,887
- I can't believe I'm going to miss the game.
- At least we're stuck here together.

699
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:27,191
You got a customer.

700
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,746
What?
What do you want?

701
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:36,467
I can't fucking believe this.

702
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,507
Yeah, hello, Sanford.
Dante.

703
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,356
I can't play today.
I'm stuck at work.

704
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,196
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled today...
Forget it.

705
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:51,769
Point is, I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

706
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,764
Wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

707
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,450
Hold on.
You feeling limber?

708
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:12,257
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
- I've got to tell you,

709
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:14,657
this is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

710
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,538
I never thought you capable of such
a disregard of store policy.

711
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:20,419
- I told him I had a game. It's his own fault.
- No arguments here.

712
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:23,452
- Insubordination rules.
- I just want to play hockey.

713
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,834
I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

714
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,810
If you grab one,
then everybody will.

715
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:29,057
- So?
- Who's gonna pay for these Gatorades?

716
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,941
- What do you care, motherfucker?
- I have a responsibility.

717
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:34,821
- Everybody can't grab free drinks.
- What responsibility?

718
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,702
- You're closing the store to play hockey.
- He's got a point.

719
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,255
Will you let me maintain
some semblance of control?

720
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:42,662
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
go the full nine,

721
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:44,583
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit.

722
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:46,624
As if we're going to have a run
on Gatorade.

723
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:49,152
- Fuckin' A.
- All right! Jesus, you fuckers are pushy!

724
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:51,298
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

725
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,280
- Design major.
- Can we not talk about this?

726
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:57,315
Fine, but you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

727
00:41:57,386 --> 00:42:00,037
- You gonna lock the store?
- You gonna lock the video store?

728
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:02,923
Look who you're asking here.
How're we gonna block the street?

729
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,567
- We're not playing in the street.
- Then where are we gonna play?

730
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,566
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

731
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,807
[Yelling]

732
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,960
I got it! I got it!
It's mine, it's mine!

733
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,627
Yeah!

734
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,019
[Yelling continues]

735
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:02,709
Hit 'em!

736
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:06,768
All right, here we go.
I got it.

737
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:08,944
- When is this period over?
- Eight minutes.

738
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:11,666
What, are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

739
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:15,031
- Just wait a few minutes.
- I'm gonna break my neck on this ladder.

740
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:18,163
Lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store!

741
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:19,608
- Where are you?
- He's busy!

742
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:20,663
- In a second!

743
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:24,310
Fuck "in a second"!
Oh, look at you. You can't even pass.

744
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:27,346
- [Dante] I can pass!
- How about covering the point? You suck!

745
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:30,715
- Who are you to make assessments?
- I'll assess all I want, pal!

746
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:34,391
- Dante, you in or out?
- Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

747
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,948
- You're any better?
- I can whip your ass any day.

748
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,836
- Easy to say over there.
- Give me a stick, pretty boy!

749
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,935
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass!

750
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:44,761
- You open?
- Yeah, you open?

751
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,994
- No!
- No!

752
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:50,583
There's a stick.
You're shooting up against this goal.

753
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,892
Hey, Redding! Come on.
Get this fucker!

754
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:06,553
Oh, man! Hey!

755
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:09,496
Come on. Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on. Get him!

756
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,480
Come on. Get him, get him!

757
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:27,776
- Give me another ball.
- There are no more.

758
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:30,333
What are you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

759
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:33,854
I brought the orange one
and... the orange one.

760
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,197
Hey, any balls down there?

761
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:40,039
[Jay] About the biggest pair
you ever seen, dingleberry.

762
00:44:40,104 --> 00:44:43,171
- You only brought one?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.

763
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:45,958
- [Redding] Dante had the balls.
- Nobody has another ball?

764
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:47,431
Shit!

765
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:52,037
We got what, 12 minutes of a game
and it's over? Fuck!

766
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,718
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

767
00:44:57,546 --> 00:45:00,296
I still get free Gatorade, right?

768
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:13,637
- Be careful.
- I'm trying.

769
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,486
You know, the insides of those has
got stuff that can give you cancer.

770
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,886
- So I'm told.
- Yeah.

771
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:23,563
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living. In the circus.

772
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:26,927
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?

773
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:30,605
- Got hit by a bus.
- Oh. Can I help you?

774
00:45:32,593 --> 00:45:37,101
Well, uh, that depends.
You got maybe a toilet in here?

775
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,137
- Yeah, but it's for employees only.
- I understand.

776
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,506
But I, uh, thought maybe
you'd let me use it anyway.

777
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:47,663
I'm not so young anymore and I'm,
how do you say, a little incontinent.

778
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:51,660
- Sure. In the back, through the cooler.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

779
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:05,044
Say, uh, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

780
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:08,144
- The white kind.
- I didn't ask about the color.

781
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,664
I mean, is it rough
or is it cottony?

782
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,453
- Actually, it's kinda rough.
- Oh, boy!

783
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,750
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my hemorrhoids.

784
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,949
I thought maybe you could
let me have a roll of the soft stuff.

785
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:23,506
I see you sell
the soft stuff back there.

786
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:26,230
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, boitshik! What's the difference?

787
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:29,496
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

788
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:32,150
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

789
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,075
You're a lifesaver.

790
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:44,886
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

791
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:48,407
but, uh, maybe I could have something
in the back there to read?

792
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,334
A paper or something?

793
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,570
Sometimes it takes me a while,

794
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,323
and I like to have something
to read while it's going on.

795
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,247
[Dante] Yeah, sure, go ahead.

796
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:00,411
[Man] One of the magazines you got
in the back behind the counter.

797
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,613
- The porno mags?
- Yeah!

798
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:06,016
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

799
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:09,378
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

800
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:12,257
Not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

801
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:14,657
- They got bigger titties in there.
- Here.

802
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:17,375
- Now leave me alone.
- Oh, thank you, sonny boy.

803
00:47:17,444 --> 00:47:19,299
I appreciate it.

804
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:24,283
Hell of a game.

805
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:28,252
One ball? I close the store, they come
all the way here, for one ball?

806
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:30,432
Hockey is hockey.
At least we got to play.

807
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:33,318
Twelve minutes is not a game.
It's hardly even a warmup.

808
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:37,792
- Bitch, bitch. Want something to drink?
- Yeah, a Gatorade.

809
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:42,621
- Hey, what happened to all the Gatorade?
- Exactly. They drank it all.

810
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:46,210
- [Randal] Know what Sanford told me?
- [Dante] I can't believe she's marrying.

811
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,775
- Julie Dwyer died.
- Yeah, right.

812
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:49,857
- No, I'm serious.
- Oh, my God!

813
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,897
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

814
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,305
- How? When?
- Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

815
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:58,186
She was swimming in the pool
in the YMCA when it happened.

816
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:01,929
- She died mid-backstroke.
- I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

817
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:04,997
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she
one of the illustrious 12?

818
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:08,582
- Yeah, number six.
- You've had sex with a dead person.

819
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:11,207
- I'm gonna go to her wake.
- No, you're not. It's today.

820
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:14,212
- [Dante] What?
- [Randal] The next show's at 4:00.

821
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:17,450
- [Dante] What about tomorrow?
- [Randal] She's buried in the morning.

822
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:19,853
- You gotta watch the store. I gotta go.
- Wait.

823
00:48:19,919 --> 00:48:22,058
Has it occurred to you
I might be bereaved?

824
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:23,208
You hardly knew her.

825
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,582
True. Do you know how many people
will be there?

826
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:28,496
- All her old classmates.
- This is beneath even you.

827
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:31,529
I'm not gonna miss what's probably
the social event of the season.

828
00:48:31,602 --> 00:48:34,733
- You hate people!
- But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?

829
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:37,453
Stop being an asshole.
Someone's gotta watch the store.

830
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:39,530
- If you go, I go.
- She meant nothing to you!

831
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:42,091
She meant nothing to you neither
'til I told you she died.

832
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:44,019
- I'm not taking you.
- I'm going with you.

833
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:47,532
- I can't close the store.
- You just closed the store to play hockey.

834
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:51,402
Which means I can't close it for another
hour just so we can both go to a wake.

835
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:53,331
You were saying?

836
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:57,140
Thanks for putting me in
such a tough spot. You're a good friend.

837
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:01,938
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Twenty- two. Just like us.

838
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:05,619
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.

839
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:07,977
That's nothing compared to
how my cousin Walter died.

840
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:09,151
How did he die?

841
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:12,176
- He broke his neck.
- That's embarrassing?

842
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:14,900
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

843
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,977
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.

844
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:18,904
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.

845
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:23,061
- Oh, my God!
- Haven't you ever tried to suck your dick?

846
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:25,881
- No.
- Yeah, right. You're so repressed.

847
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:29,395
- Because I never tried to suck my dick?
- No, because you won't admit to it.

848
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:32,600
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
'cause he tries to go down on himself.

849
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:35,319
You're as curious as the rest
of us, pal. You've tried it.

850
00:49:35,388 --> 00:49:38,204
- Who found him?
- My cousin? Mom found him.

851
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:41,881
It was a mess. He was on his bed,
his legs doubled over himself.

852
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,805
Mom freaked out.

853
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:46,359
# You know that you are
A shooting star #

854
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:49,879
- Made it, huh? Dick in his mouth?
- Yeah.

855
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:52,602
Balls resting on his lips.

856
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:56,120
- Wow. He really made it.
- Yeah, but at what a price.

857
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:01,408
- I can never reach.
- Reach what?

858
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,808
- You know.
- What, your dick?

859
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:07,803
Yeah. Like you said, I guess everybody
gets curious and tries it sometime.

860
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,730
I never tried it.

861
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,730
Fucking pervert.

862
00:50:15,684 --> 00:50:19,962
# Suddenly everyone loved
To hear him play his songs

863
00:50:20,037 --> 00:50:25,024
# Watch the world go by
Surprising it goes so fast

864
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:29,829
# Johnny looked around him and said
Hey, I've made the big time at last #

865
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:35,111
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Listen to you.

866
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:38,951
I can't help it. At least on the roof,
I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

867
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,023
Nobody's there.
It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

868
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:43,780
How many people ever come to the store
at 4:00 on a Saturday?

869
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:47,369
Let me in!

870
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,923
[Crashing sound, woman screaming]

871
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:15,525
# Do you know your place

872
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,474
# In the big charade

873
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,854
# Are you more than dead

874
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:26,637
# Leaders and followers
Leaders and followers #

875
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:28,975
- [door closes]
- I can't fucking believe you.

876
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:30,896
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

877
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:34,540
- You knocked the casket over!
- I was leanin' on it. It was an accident.

878
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,814
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose!

879
00:51:36,882 --> 00:51:40,014
- So the casket fell over. Big deal.
- Her fucking body fell out!

880
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,215
I put her back in it. It's not like
it matters if she breaks something.

881
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:46,580
- Just go open the video store.
- [Jay] Open the video store!

882
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,979
Shut the fuck up, junkie.

883
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:54,642
- Would you just go open the video store?
- Yeah, you cock-smokin' clerk.

884
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,558
How many times have I told you
not to deal in front of the store?

885
00:51:57,622 --> 00:51:59,379
I'm not.
What're you talking about?

886
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:01,651
- Have you got anything, man?
- What you want?

887
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:07,063
- Let me borrow your car.
- I don't want to talk to you.

888
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:10,424
- Fine. Just let me borrow your car.
- Why should I loan you my car?

889
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:12,660
- I want to rent a movie.
- You want to rent a movie.

890
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,777
I want to rent a movie.

891
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:15,224
- [Sighs]
- What's that for?

892
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:18,770
- You work in a video store!
- I work in a shitty video store.

893
00:52:18,842 --> 00:52:22,902
I want to go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

894
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:26,034
And a pack of cigarettes.

895
00:52:26,107 --> 00:52:28,977
- Cute cat. What's its name?
- Annoying customer.

896
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:30,907
Fucking dickhead.

897
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,124
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers?

898
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,524
- Let me borrow your car.
- May I be blunt with you?

899
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,589
If you must.

900
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,324
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST Video, respectively.

901
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,620
We have obligations that, although
they may seem cruel and unusual,

902
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:49,405
- mean manning the store until closing.
- I see.

903
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:52,920
So playing hockey and attending wakes
are standard operating procedures?

904
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:57,248
Those are obligations that couldn't
have been met at any other date.

905
00:52:57,313 --> 00:53:01,886
Renting videos, that's gratuitous, and
illogical, since you work at a video store.

906
00:53:01,954 --> 00:53:03,809
- Are you open?
- Yes.

907
00:53:03,874 --> 00:53:05,500
I don't care for your rationale.

908
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,288
It's gonna have to do,
being it's my car up for request.

909
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,526
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.

910
00:53:10,596 --> 00:53:14,044
- What's your point?
- You're a clerk, paid to do a job.

911
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:17,499
You can't just do anything
you want while you're working.

912
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:21,436
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time-Warner.

913
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:24,412
Report stock increase".

914
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:27,105
They print any kind of shit
in this paper.

915
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,030
They certainly do.
Three dollars.

916
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:31,484
- Your argument is title dictates behavior.
- What?

917
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:34,789
You won't let me use your car
because I have a title and job description.

918
00:53:34,856 --> 00:53:37,028
- I'm supposed to follow it, right?
- Exactly.

919
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:40,326
I saw one one time that said,

920
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:42,946
"The next week,
the world is ending".

921
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:45,352
In the next week's paper, they said,

922
00:53:45,418 --> 00:53:48,069
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

923
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:51,434
by a koala-fish mutant bird".

924
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:52,612
[Laughing]
Crazy shit.

925
00:53:52,683 --> 00:53:57,256
I'm no more responsible for my decisions
here than a death squad soldier in Bosnia?

926
00:53:57,324 --> 00:54:00,226
You're not being asked to slay children
or anything.

927
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,788
- Yeah, not yet.
- And I remember one time...

928
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:07,596
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk!

929
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:10,150
- I'm sorry. He meant to hit me.
- Well, he missed.

930
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:13,037
Here, let me refund your money
and we'll call it even.

931
00:54:13,103 --> 00:54:15,045
I'll never come in here again.

932
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,008
And if I see you again,
I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

933
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,812
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Two reasons.

934
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:28,591
One, I hate it when people can't shut up
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

935
00:54:28,657 --> 00:54:32,007
And two, to prove a point.
Title does not dictate behavior.

936
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:35,378
- What?
- If title dictated my behavior as a clerk

937
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:38,258
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but I did.

938
00:54:38,323 --> 00:54:40,812
My point is that people
dictate their own behavior.

939
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:44,179
Even though I work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

940
00:54:44,245 --> 00:54:45,455
Agreed?

941
00:54:45,524 --> 00:54:47,434
You are a danger
to the dead and the living.

942
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:49,843
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

943
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,812
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

944
00:54:58,327 --> 00:55:00,596
Sounds like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

945
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:01,663
Excuse me?

946
00:55:01,688 --> 00:55:03,630
You strained
when you picked up that milk.

947
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:06,574
- It only weighs seven pounds.
- I didn't strain. I sighed.

948
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:08,852
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

949
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,270
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

950
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:16,340
I'm a trainer. I know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

951
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,509
- What? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat!

952
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:21,881
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

953
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,890
- You open?
- Yes.

954
00:55:23,964 --> 00:55:26,550
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

955
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,133
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape?

956
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:32,059
Can't really tell from here.

957
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,842
- He is.
- I am not!

958
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:36,764
How much can you bench?

959
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,677
- I don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

960
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:41,598
I know I can bench more than that.

961
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:44,314
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way!

962
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,239
Feel that.

963
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:49,054
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

964
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,225
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

965
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:53,718
- Oh, for God's sakes!
- See, you're ashamed.

966
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:55,135
You know you're out of shape.

967
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:57,176
Here.
Take my card.

968
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:59,551
I can get you on an aerobics,
free weights program.

969
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:02,466
- Are you open?
- [Dante] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

970
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:04,386
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day?

971
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:07,452
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

972
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:09,379
I don't have love handles!

973
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:11,549
- Were you working here about 4:00?
- Yes.

974
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,468
- It's from being around this food every day.
- Oh, I know.

975
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:17,948
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

976
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:20,640
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can I have your name, please?

977
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,979
Dante Hicks. Why?
What's this all about?

978
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,008
You're Dante Hicks? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

979
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,468
- Because he's out of shape!
- Do I know you?

980
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:31,999
Do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out...

981
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:33,795
- With Caitlin Bree!
- I'm her sister.

982
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,720
You're Alyssa's sister Heather?

983
00:56:35,785 --> 00:56:37,825
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree?

984
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,872
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl?

985
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:42,367
A little taller than her?
Gorgeous body?

986
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,351
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

987
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:46,369
You went to the same school,
played hockey.

988
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:48,996
- How did you know that?
- You still goin' out with her?

989
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,140
- No, she's getting married.
- To you?

990
00:56:51,211 --> 00:56:53,099
No. To an Asian design major.

991
00:56:53,164 --> 00:56:55,019
Aw, shit!

992
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:58,249
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, I used to fuck her.

993
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,684
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

994
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:03,433
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

995
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:05,444
- You're Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

996
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:07,373
- You know him?
- Yeah.

997
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:09,860
- Caitlin talked about him all the time.
- Really?

998
00:57:09,935 --> 00:57:13,864
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

999
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:16,587
Don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

1000
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:18,860
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it.

1001
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,449
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

1002
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,409
Jesus Christ! What next?

1003
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,328
- Here you go.
- What's this?

1004
00:57:25,393 --> 00:57:27,084
- A fine for $500.
- What?

1005
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:29,041
Five hundred bucks?
For what?

1006
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:33,514
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170l51.

1007
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:36,075
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

1008
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:39,563
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

1009
00:57:39,636 --> 00:57:40,880
is regarded as disorderly.

1010
00:57:40,948 --> 00:57:45,105
- What are you talkin' about?
- An angry mother called the state

1011
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:47,061
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

1012
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:50,093
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes today.

1013
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,916
The Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health

1014
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,837
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1015
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:58,286
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

1016
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,749
The fine is doubled
due to the young age of the child.

1017
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:02,864
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids!

1018
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:05,806
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old?
What a scumbag!

1019
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:07,888
That's sick, Dante.

1020
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:10,100
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I swear!

1021
00:58:10,169 --> 00:58:11,697
The due date is on the bottom.

1022
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:14,803
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

1023
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:18,552
Failure to remit will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

1024
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,692
and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

1025
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,105
Have a nice day.

1026
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:26,427
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids.
Hey, wait a minute!

1027
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:30,868
Forget it. I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

1028
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,145
Can I, uh, give you
a lift somewhere?

00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:35,996
Sure. How 'bout the beach?

I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you in so long.

Dante, you have a customer.

I just saw Alyssa's
little sister outside.

1038
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:26,855
- She was with Rick Derris.
- Let's not talk about her.

1039
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:29,341
- How'd you get home?
- Train. It took eight hours.

1040

- I can't believe you're here.
- Excuse me. Do you...

Back behind the oil.
How long you staying?

1042
00:59:34,057 --> 00:59:36,926
Until Monday.
Then I have to take the train back.

Congratulations.

I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:42,791
She's marrying
an Asian design major.

the store?

01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,160
I wanna talk to you,
and I don't wanna be disturbed.

1050
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:19,175
Something I read in the tabloids.

- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, I thought.

- It's not what you think.
- Oh, it's not.

What? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child?

- What's goin' on here?
- I am not pregnant.

Were you gonna tell me,
or send me an invitation?

1056

I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well.

1057

You could've broken it gently.

You could've told me you had a boyfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.

I'm sorry, but when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

1060
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,915
- And then he proposed last month.
- You said yes.

Well, kind of. Sort of.

"Kind of," "sort of"?

- I know you.

You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

- So you're really getting married?
- No.

The story goes like this: He proposed,
I told him I had to think about it,

1070
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:10,576
and he insisted
that I wear the ring.

1071
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,018
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

1072
01:01:13,082 --> 01:01:15,417
- I don't like her.
- Then my mother called

1073
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:17,850
to let me know the announcement
was in the paper.

1074
01:01:17,915 --> 01:01:20,916
I hopped a train to come here,
because I knew you'd be a wreck.

1075
01:01:20,988 --> 01:01:23,509
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?

1076
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,436
"Wreck" is a harsh term.

1077
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:27,770
"Disturbed" is more like it.
"Mildly disturbed".

1078

I love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

- What smells like shoe polish?
- So you came here to comfort me?

1080
01:01:34,782 --> 01:01:37,849
The last thing I needed was
for you to think I was hiding something.

1081
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,024
- But you were!
- No, I wasn't! Not really.

1082
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:41,884
I told you
I'd been seeing other people.

1083

But not seriously.
You're ready to walk down the aisle.

1084
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,968
That constitutes something
more than seeing somebody.

I'm on the verge of graduation.

1088
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:58,646
I want to go to grad school after this,
and then I want to start a career.

1089

I don't want to be a wife

1090

and then worry about
when I'm gonna fit in the other stuff.

1091
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:04,830
I have come way too far
and studied too damn hard

1092
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,315
to let my education
go to waste as a housewife.

1093
01:02:08,388 --> 01:02:10,243
And I know
that's what I'd become.

1094

Sang's just signed with a major firm,
and he's gonna pull in a huge salary,

1095
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:16,001
which would give me
no reason to work.

- Stop it. He's a nice guy.

why aren't you marrying him?

behind your refusal to wed.

having sex with an Asian design major?

Oh, Jesus. You're so caustic.

1107

I had to knock you down
from that cloud you were on.

I mean that.

Not for years.

We can introduce them.
They may hit it off.

You're serious?
You wanna date again?

I wanna be your boyfriend, yes.

1117

It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years.

wanna go out with me again

- The key word here is "talk".

1124

I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating,

1125
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:33,201
is a lot more idyllic than
what actually happens when we date.

1126

What are we supposed to do?
Pretend over the phone we're dating?

Maybe we should just see what happens.

Yeah, a real date.
Dinner and a movie.

Naked Somewhere" kind of private date?

- Jerk!

succumbing to your wily charms,

1136

- He's your fiancé.

for this bold and momentous decision

from both school and home.

- You are such an asshole.

- Where is he, anyway?

He isn't back yet.

You should see the box.
Beautiful chicks with dicks.

1171
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:56,037
- And you rented this?
- I like to expand my horizons.

1172
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:58,827
- I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
- No way.

1173
01:05:58,894 --> 01:06:00,902
- Five hundred dollars.
- Bullshit.

No, I'm not.

1175
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,118
Holy shit! I didn't think they enforced this.

1176
01:06:07,183 --> 01:06:09,551
- Living proof.
- You never sold cigarettes to kids.

1177
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:11,689
- I didn't. You did.
- Really?

1178
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,800
Yep. A little girl,
maybe four years old.

1179
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:16,840
- Holy shit! That girl?
- As opposed to hundreds of other children

1180
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:18,888
you've sold cigarettes
while working here.

1181
01:06:18,962 --> 01:06:20,937
- How come you got the fine?
- 'Cause I'm here.

- You're lyin'.
- No, I'm not.

1183
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:25,199
- Why aren't you screaming at me?
- I'm happy.

1184
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:27,176
- I'm happy.
- You're happy to get a fine?

1185
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:30,154
- No, Caitlin came to see me.
- Now I know you're lyin'.

1186
01:06:30,228 --> 01:06:32,268
- I'm not. She just left.
- What'd she say?

1187
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,544
She's not marrying that guy.
She telling her mom.

1188
01:06:34,612 --> 01:06:36,467
- You're kiddin'.
- I'm not.

1189
01:06:36,533 --> 01:06:38,704
Well, you've had quite an evening.

1190
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:41,108
She went home, getting ready
and we're going out.

1191
01:06:41,173 --> 01:06:43,443
Is there anything I can do for you?

1192
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:46,772
- Watch the store.
- What about "Title dictates behavior"?

1193
01:06:46,838 --> 01:06:49,773
This is my way
of spitting water at life.

1194
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:52,214
You want me to bring
the VCR over so we can watch this?

1195
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:54,581
No, I might be leaving early
to go out with Caitlin.

1196
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:56,622
You're gonna lock up

it awful? My mother sent that in.

1205
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,277

- You'd think she's marrying him.

- What are you watching?
- Children's programming.

1207
01:07:48,225 --> 01:07:50,592
What'd your mom say
when you told her?

1208
01:07:50,658 --> 01:07:53,276
She said not to come home
until after graduation.

1209
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:55,354
Wow. You got thrown out for Dante?

1210
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:57,915
What can I say?
He does weird things to me.

1211
01:07:57,987 --> 01:07:59,842
- Can I watch?
- You can hold me down.

1212

- Can I join in?
- You might be let down.

1213

- I'm not a hermaphrodite.
- Hey, few are.

1214

What makes you think you can maintain
a relationship with him this time?

1215

A woman's intuition.

1216
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:13,698
Something inside of me says
it's time to give him a serious try.

1217
01:08:13,766 --> 01:08:16,931
Wow. Hey, you know, you and I
have something in common.

1218
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:19,333
- We both eat Chinese.
- Dick.

- Exactly.
- So where is he?

1220
01:08:21,671 --> 01:08:23,581
He went home to change
for the big date.

- No. This is great.

Oh, lord.
Can I use your bathroom?

- There's no lights.
- Why aren't there any?

1224

There are, but for some reason
they stop working at 5:14.

- You're kidding.
- Nobody can figure it out.

1226
01:08:37,258 --> 01:08:39,430
The boss doesn't want
to pay the electrician

1227
01:08:39,499 --> 01:08:41,572
because he owes money
to the video store.

1228
01:08:41,643 --> 01:08:44,709

- And I'm caught in the middle,

and my desire to piss with lights on.

Oh, hey, Caitlin? Break his heart
again this time, and I'll kill you.

Nothing personal.

You always have been.

but my guess is he was masturbating,

- What responsibility?
- If you hate this job and the people...

1345
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:30,663
and the fact that you have to
come in on your day off, why not quit?

1346
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:33,218
- Like it's that easy.
- It is. You just up and quit.

1347

There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

- You're comfortable?

This is a life of convenience
and any attempt to change it

1351

would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

- Same with Veronica.
- Leave her out.

1356
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:01,416
You date Veronica because it's
convenient and she's low maintenance.

1357
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,276
But all you do is talk about Caitlin.

1358
01:15:03,344 --> 01:15:05,766
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

1359
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,045
High school, for God's sakes.
You're 22.

1360
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:11,496
- Leave me alone.
- If you want Caitlin, be with Caitlin.

It must be great to have
this ability to simplify things.

1366

"Yes, some things you say are true"?

1373

Things are not going to change.

1374
01:15:46,647 --> 01:15:49,069
- Make 'em change.
- I can't, all right?

1375
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,705
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

1376
01:15:50,777 --> 01:15:53,712
I can't make changes in my life
like that. If I could, I would.

1377
01:15:53,785 --> 01:15:56,687
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

1378
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,517
on the big money and fabulous prizes.

1379
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:01,935
- Who are you kidding? You can so.
- Jesus H. Christ! I can't.

1380
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:06,615
So you're gonna be miserable 'cause
you don't have the guts to face change?

that when I was three years old,

1382
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:11,642
my potty lid was closed,

1383
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,610
and instead of me lifting it,
I shit my pants.

1384
01:16:14,684 --> 01:16:16,375
Lovely story.

1385
01:16:16,445 --> 01:16:18,649

I'm not the type of person

01:16:18,718 --> 01:16:22,035

just so I can shit comfortably.

- What happened with that old guy?

- He died in the bathroom.
- I heard he was jerkin' off.

01:17:16,743 --> 01:17:18,784
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

1402
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:22,173
He saw that Caitlin chick. I know
I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.

- Knock it off.

- That used to be my girlfriend.
- Oh, you used to go out with her?

1406
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,461
I thought we might
be starting again.

1407
01:17:31,531 --> 01:17:34,946

- [Dante] Yeah, Veronica.

Didn't I see her change your tire once?

1413
01:17:47,437 --> 01:17:51,147
I jacked up the car. All she did was
unloosen the nuts and put the tire on.

- All I know is she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

they wanted from me was weed and shit.

No, wait. I fucked up.

with nothing on it?"

1419
01:18:06,193 --> 01:18:09,008
- Meaning?
- I don't know. She was senile.

I love her.

1429
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:42,545
That's it. He doesn't love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.

1430
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:44,623
And he told you all of this?

1431
01:18:44,695 --> 01:18:48,820
Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part. That's my theory.

1432
01:18:48,888 --> 01:18:51,158
I don't know what to say.

1433
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:54,935
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

1434
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:57,904
It's not your fault.
It's Dante.

1435
01:18:58,522 --> 01:19:00,824
Look. I don't know thing one
about chicks.

1436
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:03,739
So if you gotta cry or something,
I can get out of here.

1437
01:19:03,803 --> 01:19:06,105
- I'm not sad.
- You're not?

1438
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:07,797
What did you do that for?

1439
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,901
If you didn't wanna go out with me,
why didn't you say so?

1440
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:13,340
Instead you pussyfoot around
and see that slut!

1441
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:15,576
- What?
- You've been talking to her for weeks!

1442
01:19:15,645 --> 01:19:16,726
Only a few times.

1443
01:19:16,797 --> 01:19:19,734
Then you freak out because
I've gone down on a couple of guys.

1444
01:19:19,834 --> 01:19:20,883
Oh, a couple?

1445
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:25,115
I'm not trying to patch up with my ex,
sneaking around behind your back!

1446
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,071
If you think 37 dicks are a lot,
just wait.

1447
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:30,397
I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame!

1448
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,154
- Will you let me explain?
- What?

1449
01:19:32,224 --> 01:19:36,086
How you've been waiting until the time
was right to dump me for her?

1450
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:38,169
- It isn't like that!
- Damn right!

1451
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:41,470
I won't let it be like that.
You want your slut? Fine.

1452
01:19:41,538 --> 01:19:43,960
- I don't want Caitlin.
- You don't know what you want!

1453
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:47,166
But I'm not going to hold your hand
anymore until you figure it out!

1454
01:19:47,234 --> 01:19:48,729
I've tried with you, Dante.

1455
01:19:48,803 --> 01:19:52,251
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

1456
01:19:52,324 --> 01:19:54,113
to take charge and find direction.

1457
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,563
I transferred so maybe you'd be more
inclined to go back if I was with you.

1458
01:19:57,637 --> 01:20:00,954
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

1459
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,363
and wanted to see you
pull yourself out of this funk

1460
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,464
that you've been in since that whore
dumped you so many years ago.

1461
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,869
You wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over more!

1462
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:11,074
- I don't wanna go back...
- Of course. Not now.

1463
01:20:11,143 --> 01:20:13,991
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out.

1464
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:18,180
I want you to follow through so you
can find out what an idiot you are.

1465
01:20:18,249 --> 01:20:20,900
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you, she will,

1466
01:20:20,969 --> 01:20:23,555
when she dumps you again
I want to laugh in your face

1467
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,625
so you realize what you gave up
our relationship for.

1468
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:29,416
I'm glad Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't.

1469
01:20:29,482 --> 01:20:32,831
Having him tell me was
the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

1470
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:36,006
- Veronica, I love you.
- Fuck you!

1471
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,618

1472

# Our problems seem a world away

# You'll all be replaced #

1482
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,264
How's your eye?

1483
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:28,431
The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. Stings.

1484
01:21:29,845 --> 01:21:33,359
- How's your neck?
- It's kind of hard to swallow.

1485
01:21:34,358 --> 01:21:36,246
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

1486
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:39,540
Why did you tell Veronica I was
gonna dump her to go with Caitlin?

1487
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,455
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

1488
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:44,975
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change.

1489
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:48,496
- I thought I'd give you a hand.
- Thanks.

1490
01:21:48,568 --> 01:21:50,423
You still didn't have to choke me.

1491
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:53,304
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

1492
01:21:53,369 --> 01:21:55,158
- Why do you say that?
- Why do I say that?

1493
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:56,917
Forget it.

1494
01:21:56,986 --> 01:21:58,961
No, really.
What did I do that was so wrong?

1495
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:00,376
What don't you do?

1496
01:22:00,443 --> 01:22:03,510
Sometimes I think you come to work
to make my life miserable.

1497
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:05,848
- How do you figure?
- What time did you get to work?

1498
01:22:05,915 --> 01:22:08,218
Like 10:00, or ten after.

1499
01:22:08,284 --> 01:22:11,219
You were half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

1500
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,938
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store is closed.

1501
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:18,551
- It's not like I'm miles away.
- Unless you're out renting videos.

1502
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:21,372
Hermaphrodites. I rented it
so we could watch it together.

1503
01:22:21,438 --> 01:22:22,846
You get me slapped with a fine.

1504
01:22:22,911 --> 01:22:25,846
You argue with the customers,
and I have to patch everything up.

1505
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:28,603
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

1506
01:22:28,672 --> 01:22:31,869
To top it off, you ruin my relationship.
What's your encore?

1507
01:22:31,936 --> 01:22:35,482
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

1508
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:41,054
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is?

1509
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,163
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

1510
01:22:43,235 --> 01:22:46,497
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, pal!

1511
01:22:46,563 --> 01:22:48,603
Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

1512
01:22:48,675 --> 01:22:50,530
I'm the source of all your misery.

1513
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:54,077
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

1514
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:56,418
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend

1515
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:59,355
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

1516
01:22:59,429 --> 01:23:01,502
You wanna blame somebody?
Blame yourself.

1517
01:23:01,574 --> 01:23:03,549
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today".

1518
01:23:03,622 --> 01:23:05,313
You sound like an asshole!

1519
01:23:05,382 --> 01:23:07,324
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

1520
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,374
You're here of your own volition.

1521
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:12,262
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

1522
01:23:12,328 --> 01:23:14,597
like this would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1523
01:23:14,664 --> 01:23:18,210
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1524
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,722
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

1525
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:25,925
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

1526
01:23:25,994 --> 01:23:28,297
so much more important
than it really is.

1527
01:23:28,363 --> 01:23:32,771
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, I might add.

1528
01:23:32,843 --> 01:23:35,975
I work in a shitty video store,
badly as well.

1529
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,820
That guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

1530
01:23:39,885 --> 01:23:42,569
We like to make ourselves
seem more important

1531
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:45,605
than the people that come in
to buy a paper or cigarettes.

1532
01:23:45,677 --> 01:23:48,133
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

1533
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:51,851
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,
what are we doin' workin' here?

1534
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:12,967
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

1535
01:24:13,043 --> 01:24:16,339
- Need a ride home?
- No, I got one. Just pulled up.

1536
01:24:16,915 --> 01:24:20,178
- You workin' tomorrow?
- Same time. What about you?

1537
01:24:20,244 --> 01:24:23,540
I'm callin' out.
Goin' to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

1538
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:25,940
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

1539
01:24:26,005 --> 01:24:29,999
You wanna grab a bite to eat when you're
done with that and I get off work?

1540
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,885
- I'll give you a call, let you know.
- All right.

1541
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,838
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

1542
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:36,943
I can talk to her,
try to straighten...

1543
01:24:37,015 --> 01:24:39,568
No, thanks.
I think I can handle it.

1544
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,258
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

1545
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:45,198
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.

1546
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:48,088
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

1547
01:24:48,153 --> 01:24:49,714
Why don't you wrangle for me?

1548
01:24:49,786 --> 01:24:52,339
- [Scoffs] No.
- Come on. Just wrangle out the door.

1549
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:54,996
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on.
