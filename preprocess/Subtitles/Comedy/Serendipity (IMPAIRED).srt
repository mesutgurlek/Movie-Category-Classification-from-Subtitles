- Wooh! Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

31
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,197
- [ Chuckles ]
- Do you want these?

32
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:51,709
- No. Please.
- You go ahead. It's the last one.

33
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:54,303
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,178
- Whatever's out is what we have.
- You don't have a stockroom?

35
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,846
- No. No. We don't have
an attic either.
- Or a basement?

36
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,082
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.

37
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:07,490
- No, no, no.
You saw them first. I--
- Please. I insist.

38
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,663
- Take them. Wait a minute.
- Oh! Oh!

39
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,790
- Excuse me, sir. These are ours.
- Yeah?

40
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:17,165
Oh. Your gloves? How come?
They're just sort of hanging there,

41
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,500
sleeping with their
little price tag on.

42
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:23,030
- We were just discussing
them, all right?
- Well, I have news for you.

43
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:26,237
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.

44
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,678
- Calm down, all right?
- Calm down? It's five days
before Christmas.

45
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:31,273
I'm in the middle
of a New York department store.
He's asking me to calm down.

46
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:34,514
Well, these were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.

47
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:38,114
- Yeah, we put quite a lot
of thought into those.
- Isn't that right?

48
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:40,352
- Well, who were they for?
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.

49
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,792
- Her boyfriend.
- His girlfriend.

50
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:45,387
One pair of gloves
for two people?

51
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,433
- This is hard to explain.
- Try.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,968
All right.
Go ahead.

53
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:55,872
Oh. Uh, well, he is
at the present time my boyfriend.

But in 18 months--

55
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,577
After the operation--

56
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,983
- He will be--
- She will be--

57
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,485
My girlfriend.
Do you understand?

58
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,487
That didn't
really work out.

59
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:13,491
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.

60
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:17,051
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.

61
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,293
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.

62
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,766
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well--

63
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,735
Ah, well.

64
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:27,773
# Have a yule that's cool ##

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,001
They're ready for you guys.

66
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:32,010
Thank you.

67
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:34,012
I don't know what you said
to that guy makes any sense.

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,345
- But I think we scared
the be jesus out of him.
- You were pretty fierce.

69
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,749
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.

70
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,617
But I'm serious about the check.
It's the least I can do.

71
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:45,589
Well, thank you, but, see,

72
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,593
now I have to go find
something else for my girlfriend.

73
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:51,095
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.

74
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,132
- Oh, I can't accept them then.
- Well, you have to.

75
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,690
Otherwise you
won't treat. Really.

76
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,259
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blend to drink.

77
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:01,306
- Where did you find this place?
- I first came in
because of the name.

78
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:03,706
- Hmm.
- Serendipity. It's one
of my favorite words.

79
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,710
- It is? Why?
- Uh-huh.

80
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:09,373
'Cause it's such a nice sound for
what it means: a fortunate accident.

81
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,440
- Mm.
- Except I don't really
believe in accidents.

82
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:14,145
- I think fate's behind everything.
- Oh, you do?

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,313
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?

84
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,380
- I think so.
- Everything's predestined?

85
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,450
- We don't have any choice at all?
- I thinkwe make our own decisions.

86
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,791
I just think that fate
sends us little signs,

87
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:26,798
and it's how we read the signs
that determines whether
we're happy or not.

88
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,130
- Little signals. Yeah.
- Yeah.

89
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:32,968
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.
Columbus in America.

90
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,907
- Yeah, or Fleming
discovering penicillin.
- Penicillin.

91
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:38,910
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.

92
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,242
Or "Jonathan
and the Gloves."

93
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:43,908
- I don't know that one.
- You don't know that story?

94
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,917
It's an old
folk tale classic.

95
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:48,180
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.

96
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:52,691
And in a perfect act
of "serendipiocity"
or "serendipaciousness,"

97
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:57,354
he runs into a beautiful, attractive
English girl with a boyfriend.

98
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,364
You have a boyfriend, right?

99
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,696
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.

100
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,895
- And you have the glove lady.
- Yes, I do.

101
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:10,236
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.

102
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:16,010
- Well, I hope you enjoy the
gloves you bought yourself.
- Oh, I'm sure I will.

103
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:20,382
I usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness.
What do you want for Christmas?

104
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,387
- Golfclubs.
- Oh.

105
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:24,616
So you're gonna meet
your boyfriend now or what?

106
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,523
No, I think he's probably
out doing what you're doing.

107
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:30,187
Getting a crush on
someone else's girlfriend?

108
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:33,198
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
I had a really great time.

109
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:36,201
You know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,
you know, just in case.

110
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,397
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.

111
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:42,305
I just had a great time, and I'd
never be able to find you again.

112
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,811
Well, if we're meant to meet again,
then we'll meet again.

113
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:47,869
It's just not
the right time now.

114
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:51,280
Maybe we were supposed
to meet on British time
and we're five hours too early.

115
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,081
Come on.
I don't even know your name.
My name is Jonathan.

116
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,783
- Does that make you
wanna tell me something?
- Yeah, it does.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,326
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.

118
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:13,333
That's it?

119
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:15,840
# I can feel my heart #

120
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:18,934
- Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry about that.
- # And it's about to burst #

121
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,446
# I try to clean it up #

122
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:28,019
# But I just get worse #

123
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:30,578
# Wish I could fall #

124
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:34,123
# On a night like this #

125
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,595
- # Into your loving arms #
- I think I left a scarf.

126
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,632
No. Nothing down here.
Why don't you go upstairs?

127
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,668
- Maybe it's still there.
- Thank you.

128
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:45,795
# I thought I saw your face #

129
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,841
# In the evening sky #

130
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,937
# On a lonesome cloud #

131
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:58,609
# That was drifting by #

132
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:02,814
# I wish I could fall #

00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:05,322

# Into your loving arms ##

135
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,259
Hey.

136
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,696
Hey.

137
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,800
Let's go do something.

138
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:24,638
All right.
What you wanna do?

139
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,473
I don't care.

140
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:30,140
All right. Come on.

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,493
Now, promise me you're not
just visiting here for a week...

142
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:46,190
or marrying somebody
to get a green card or on parole.

143
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:50,531
None of the above. You?

144
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,730
No, no, no. Proud U.S. citizen.
No criminal record.

145
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,705
So you won't tell me
your name.

146
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:57,538
Well, tell me, uh, what do you
miss most about Mother England?

147
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,840
I miss my mom terribly.

148
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:02,278
If I were her,
I'd miss you too.

149
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,418
Okay. Favorite movie.

150
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,223
- The correct answer
is Cool Hand Luke.
- I've never seen it.

151
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,457
Oh, come on. You've never seen
Cool Hand Luke?

152
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:23,696
Paul Newman?
Oh, my God. Come on!

153
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,500
"Failure to communicate."
Sadistic cop in sunglasses
with no name.

154
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,973
Reminds me of you
in that way.

155
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,942
Um, favorite
New York moment.

156
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,111
This one's
climbing the charts.

157
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:40,118
I'm flattered.

158
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,221
Is there anything else
you need to know about me?

159
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,224
Huh.

160
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,827
Favorite sexual position?

161
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,057
Oh!

162
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:57,262
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah, yeah. That's my favorite too.

163
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,304
- You all right?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,271
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No. Yes.

165
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,900
- You did?
Let's take a look at that.
- Ouch.

166
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:08,072
- Oh, Jesus.
That's a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.

167
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:11,844
What? We'll
fix that right up.

168
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,845
There you go.

169
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,418
What? Oh, you're
looking at my freckles.

170
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:25,521
It's the curse
of the English, I'm afraid.
Fair skin and bad teeth.

171
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:27,691
No, you have great teeth.

172
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,894
Those aren't just freckles.

173
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:32,904
If you look closely,
you can see Cassiopeia.

174
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:36,430
- What?
- Right there.

175
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,444
Hold on a minute.

176
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:44,211
Okay. All right,
here's the story.

177
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:46,376
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

178
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:49,478
there was this queen
named Cassiopeia...

179
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:53,457
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,

180
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,824
and there wasn't anybody in
the kingdom who wasn't offended...

181
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,363
by this woman's
relentless vanity.

182
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,126
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.

183
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,225
I don't remember what she did and
I don't remember who she offended.

184
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:05,361
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.

185
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:09,771
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god,
punished Cassiopeia...

186
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:13,005
by placing her in the heavens
upside down on her throne,

187
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:15,444
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders...

188
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,846
and all the blood
rushing to her head.

189
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,353
And now she's just
a constellation in the sky,

190
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,753
a bunch of English freckles
in the shape of a throne.

191
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,691
So she made
one tragic mistake.

192
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,826
And paid for eternity.

193
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,832
Correct.

194
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,183
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.

195
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,519
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Now, please, please.

196
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,525
Let fate take
its proper course.

197
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,860
Oh!

198
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:15,973
- That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.
- I can't.

199
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,906
That was a sign.

200
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,968
Fate's telling us
to back off.

201
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:23,412
If fate didn't want
us to be together, then why
did we meet tonight, huh?

202
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,507
- Gotcha.
- Well, I don't know.

203
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:27,984
- But it's not an exact science.
It's a feeling.
- Well, what if you're wrong?

204
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,214
Huh? What if it's all
in our hands and we just walk away?

205
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,122
No names, no phone numbers, nothing.
What do you think's gonna happen?

206
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,319
Do you think good old fate is
just gonna deliver my information...

207
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:38,386
- right to your doorstep?
- Do you know that's the best
idea you're had all night?

208
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:42,628
- What's the best--
- Here you go. Write
your name and number down.

209
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,295
- On a $5.00 bill?
- Mm. Just do it.

210
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,734
You are a strange
and interesting woman.

211
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:55,279
Now what?

212
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:58,009
Wait there.

213
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,990
Hey!

00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,856
What the hell was that?

215
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:18,802
When that $5.00 bill
makes it back into my hands,
I'll be able to call you.

216
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:21,066
And when you hear
my voice on the other end,

217
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,608
then you'll believe
in fate, won't you?

218

219
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:28,647
- Hey, what about me?
- What do you mean?

220
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:31,205
Well, we have to send
something out in the universe
with your name on it, don't we?

221
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,081
- Come on. Isn't that
the only fair thing?
- That is the only fair thing.

222
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,951
What have I got, even?
Ooh. No. I have a really good idea.

223
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,889
- What?
- Okay.

224
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,826
- That's a lot of tuba.
- Okay, see this book?

225
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,453
Yeah.

226
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,498
Okay, so when
I get home tonight,

227
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:48,499
I'm gonna write my name
and number inside this book.

228
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,967
And then first thing
tomorrow morning, I'll sell it
to a used book store.

229
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,901
Which one?

230
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,133
You're not gonna tell me.
You're not gonna tell me. Why not?

231
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,141
Well, now, every time
you go past an old book store,

232
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,303
you're gonna have to go inside
to see if it's there.

233
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,314
This is just wrong.
You don't just have the most
incredible night of your life...

234
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:06,647
with a perfect stranger and then
leave it all to chance, do ya?

235
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:10,485
- Do ya?
- Come with me a second.

236
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,786
What, we're gonna get a room?

237
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,326
I'm kidding.
But I wanna know you more.

238
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,158
- Come on. Where are we going?
- Okay.

239
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,596
- Now, you stay here.
- Okay.

240
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:25,160
- No, stay here. Stay there.
Don't make me come over there.
- Okay.

241
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:28,832
All right, if we both
randomly pick the same floor,
we're meant to be together now.

242
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,670
You're insane.

243
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:34,270
Come on.
Okay, get in.

244
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:37,338
Take a breath, and then
when the door closes, hit a button.

245
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,045
- I don't understand this.
- You don't have to understand.
You just have to have faith.

246
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Faith in what?

247
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,524
Destiny.

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,004
- Uh--
- Let's go, buddy.

253
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:36,132
- We're going up here.
- Oh, that's okay.

I'm sorry.

[Man] I usually have to
beg to be a part of weddings.

272
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:34,805
And if I do get into the wedding,
of course they postponed it,

273
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,273
and it's overseas somewhere,
and they've canceled my passport,

274
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:40,277
and I can't be a part of it,
and it's ridiculous
and awkward and horrible.

00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,711
So thank you.
I take this very seriously.

276

It's a gift
to be the best man.

They say that once in your lifetime,
someone comes along...

278
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,635
whom you're absolutely
meant to be with.

are in balance.

Formy friend
Jonathan Trager,

282
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:01,717
that person was me.

283
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:05,649
But as you know,
Jonny and I were simpatico.

284
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:07,657
We were brothers
from another mother.

285
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,750
We were friends
since freshman year.

286
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:14,093
I watched him go out
with woman after woman,
and he'd always come crawling--

287
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,133
he would come crawling
back to me.

288
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,761
- It was embarrassing.
- You loved it.

289
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,237
But then one night he came home
and things were different.

290
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:25,400
His adole scent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker
was a thing of the past.

291
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,172
- Thank God.
- He hardly even responded...

292
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:31,272
to my playful yet tormented
flicks of my finger...

293
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:35,581
against the soft part of his skull
as he studied for finals.

294
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:38,349
And that is because
he had found her.

295
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,858
The woman he was meant to be with.
And if anyone is qualified...

296
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:46,158
to know when he met his soul mate,
it would be me, his first wife.

297
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,429
She's smart, she's funny,
she's beautiful.

298
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:55,301
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.

299
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:58,934
And I think we all have.
So it is with sadness...

300
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,877
and fond, fond memories...

301
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,709
that I raise my glass...

302
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,715
to the new
Mrs. Jonathan Trager.

303
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,717
I'll tell you what.

304
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:11,118
I'll tell you something. My friends,
if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

305
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:15,386
I can't imagine
a more perfect woman than Halley.

306
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,292
Cheers to both of you.

307
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:26,963
- How drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten?
- Twelve.

308
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,972
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?

309
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,975
- I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.
- Me neither.

310
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,341
Must be a bitch
on their sex life.

311
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:38,712
We have a pomegranate souffle
which is amazing, which is
different than the sorbet.

312
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,151
Listen, we'd love
to join you guys,

313
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:45,620
but Courtney has to wake up,
so I got to be good.

314
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,022
Halley, listen to me.
It's not too late to back out.

315
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:50,322
- Good night, Dean.
- And I'm at 166th and--

316
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,362
Good night, Courtney.

317
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,196
Mama, you don't want to see this.
I need-- I need to snuggle.

318
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:59,168
- I'm gonna go sleep it off.
Listen, you're wonderful.
- Good night.

319
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:01,602
- You know what? You need me.
- Take care. Come on, hon.

320
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:05,665
You guys, listen, I hate to
tell you, but I gotta go home too.

321
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,712
I have to. I gotta get up
at 8:00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.

322
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,213
- Come in for one drink.
- He doesn't want to come.
He doesn't have to come.

323
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,512
- I'll see you in about 20 hours.
- Bye-bye, dear.

324
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,518
- I love you, son.
- Night-night.

325
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,645
- George.
- Take care.

326
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:20,555
You okay?

327
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,116
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?

328
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:26,061
- Because I'm gonna come home
and get undressed...
- Uh-huh?

329
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,189
- and climb into bed,
- Uh-huh?

330
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:31,428
act like we just got
over a terrible fight.

331
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,042
See you later now.

332
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:00,062
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.

333
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,235
Reading?

334
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,016
- Hold on, hold on. Listen, listen.
- I read it a long time ago.

335
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:24,816
- I'll throw in the screenplay to
The Bridges of Madison County.
- I saw the movie. It was great.

336
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,096
Okay, and--

337
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,766
And nothing. I mean--
I mean, I did nothing.

338
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:47,641
I-- I just let her
walk out of the party
and I didn't say anything to her.

339
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:50,306
And now she's gone forever.

340
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:54,147
I mean,
she was my soul mate.

341
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:59,121
Kenny, I honestly
think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."

342
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,284
It implies there's
some magical element
that we have no control over,

343
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,793
like fate or destiny.

344
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:08,298
I think holding on to beliefs like
that stops us doing the real work.

345
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:11,163
And the fact is,
if your therapy stays on track,

346
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:14,796
I think you'll find there
are many, many people out there
you could easily be happy with.

347
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:17,204
You truly believe
all that, Sara?

348
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,866
Yeah. I really do.

349
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,549
- There you go.
- Thanks.

350
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:40,323
# From the very first time
I rest my eyes on you, boy #

351
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:44,527
# My heart said
follow through #

352
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:51,865
# But I know now that
I'm way down on your line #

353
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:56,012
# But the waiting
feeling's fine #

354
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,014
# You see #

355
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:03,850
# I don't wanna wait
in vain for your love #

356
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:10,019
# I don't wanna wait
in vain for your love #

357
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:15,828
# I don't wanna wait
in vain for your love #

358
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,734
# 'Cause summer is here #

359
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:22,637
- # And I'm still waiting there #
- # Summer is here #

360
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:25,539
- # Winter is here #
- # Winter is here #

361
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:32,071
# I'm still waiting there #

362
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,719
# Like I said #

363
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:46,388
# It's been three years since
I'm knocking on your door #

364
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:50,263
# And I still can knock
some more #

365
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:55,071
# Ooh, boy Ooh, boy #

366
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:59,041
# Is it crazy
Look, I wanna know now #

367
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:04,411
# For I to knock
some more, you see #

368
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,745
# In life I know ##

369
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:09,012
[Man]
You got to say yes, first.

370
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,624
Yes.

371
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:41,015
- Wait a second.
- Ow!

372
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,110
- Let me-- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- I got it. I got it.

373
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,121
- Ow, ow. Ow!
- I got it.

374
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:48,991
Okay, you're not gonna
read into this, right, Sara?

375
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:51,721
- I mean, it's just
an accident, nothing more.
- No.

376
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:53,990
God. We'll
get it refitted.

377
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:56,692
It's beautiful.
I love it.

378
00:25:56,767 --> 00:26:00,100
You-You get changed.
I'm gonna call Ryan,
tell him you said yes.

379
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,970
- Why? Was he worried?
- Not about you. About the tour.

380
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,475
He's hoping to fit the honeymoon
into the schedule.

381
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,445
How does Bora Bora sound?

382
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:13,677
Very... sexy-sexy?

383
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:22,092
# I don't wanna wait
in vain for your love #

384
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,563
# I don't wanna wait
in vain for your love ##

385
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:32,834
[Man] Now, if you're a golfer
on a one-hour lunch break,

386
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,930
you'd use that time up
just getting to the nearest
course out of Manhattan.

387
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,305
All this was
a long overdue solution.

388
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:43,005
Formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago,

389
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,344
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle...

390
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:48,908
the chance to keep
their drives straight,
their short games accurate...

391
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:52,046
and most of all, brings the joys
and frustrations of golf...

392
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:54,056
back to city folk.

393
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:57,924
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

394
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:00,395
Superb, Nick.
We got it. Thank you.

395
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:03,024
- Artie, I gotta run, okay?
- What about the B-roll shot?

396
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,069
Paging Sara Lawson.
Paging Sara Lawson.

397
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,036
- Please come to the frontdesk.
- Could you come back and get
the B-roll on Friday?

398
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,039
- Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you, sir.

399
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,905
- I'm Sara Lawson. Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
- How are you?

400
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:15,445
You're down
at position number two.

401
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:17,412
[Sara] Oh, right. Bad golfers
all the way down there, right?

402
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:19,642
Dude, take off.
We got it.

403
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,218
Well, hello,
Mr. Marrying Man.

404
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,388
- Hi. Uh, where's Lauren?
- Oh, Lauren took the day off.

405
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:37,161
My name is Sara
and I'm gonna cut your hair today.

406
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:39,225
You know what?

407
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,999
I'm not thrilled with having
that "just cut hair" look
for my own wedding, so--

408
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:44,165
- I'll just take a little bit off.
- I gotta live with these pictures
the rest of my life.

409
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:45,469
- Just a little bit.
- Please, you know, uh--

410
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,169
# It's you #

411
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:51,840
# And me forever #

412
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:57,683
# Sara, smile #
Whoo!

413
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,747
# Won't you smile
a while for me #

414
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:04,225
Forget Charles Street.
Take me to the New York Times
building on 42nd, please.

415
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:05,921
- Mm-hmm.
- # Sara ##

416
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:09,124
- [ Horns Honking ]
- Whoo!

417
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,133
[Jonathan] I'm telling you,
I keep running into her.

418
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,897
I keep finding it.
It keeps happening.
She was at the golfrange.

419
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:16,030
She's a big girl now with big hips.
All right?

420
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:19,269
Then I gotta leave
'cause Sara's gonna cut my hair,

421
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,470
And the guy in the taxi,
he's serenading me, "Sara."

422
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:24,241
I'm telling you, the universe
keeps revealing her to me,

423
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,976
- screwing with my head.
- You're getting married
in three days.

424
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:29,611
- That's my point.
- It's entirely duplicitous.

425
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:32,951
Think about it. Why would you risk
your relationship with Halley...

426
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:37,221
- just to search
for some pipe dream?
- Just hear me out, man.

427
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:39,421
I'm sure that
I love Halley, all right?

428
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,430
And maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody,

429
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:43,432
it's a completely
different experience.

430
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,936
So it's a mistake to compare them.
I get it, but--

431
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:48,995
All right.

432
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:52,509
It's like Halley is
The Godfather, Partll.

433
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,669
She's what?

434
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:57,339
Godfather, Partll.
That was an incredible movie.

435
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,348
Might be better than the original.
All right?

436
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,350
But no matter how much you love
The Godfather, Partll,

437
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,352
you still have
to see the original...

438
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,514
to understand and appreciate
the sequel, don'tya?

439
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,854
Come on. Is it too much to ask from
my oldest friend to help me out?

440
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:12,020
- You've already got
the fairy-tale marriage.
- I'm the best man.

441
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:14,030
You work in the biggest
newspaper in the world.
Help me find her.

442
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:16,328
Let me tell you something.
Contrary to popular New York myth,

443
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,334
the Times
is not omniscient.

444
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:20,336
I need a last name.
I need a social security number.

445
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:23,168
- If we find the book--
- It-It-It's a dead end.
You know that.

446
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,333
- Unless we search every
book store in New York.
- You did that.

447
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:28,003
- Years ago. Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.

448
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:30,171
- Maybe somebody bought it
and sold it back.
- You know what?

449
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:34,445
I don't want any part of this.
All right?

450
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:51,260
[Jonathan]
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.

451
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:54,202
I'm telling you right now,
British women do not age well.

452
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:57,365
You know, I mean, years ago,
yes, she was a luscious treat.

453
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,739
You know, she probably looked like,
you know, Baby Spice.

454
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,745
But now
she could look like--

455
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:05,873
Old Spice.

456
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:22,425
- It's a great haircut.
- Oh. Thanks.

457
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:25,593
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

458
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:29,400
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?

459
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:32,271
I don't know. Like...

460
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:36,108
how I'm the only girl in the
entire universe meant for you.

461
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:40,248
[Beeping]

462
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:43,286
Oh, my God, the dinner!

463
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:47,551
By the way, I emptied your closet.
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.

464
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:49,683
-[Beeping Continues]
- God, I hate this building.

465
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,092
Shut up!

466
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,187
Don't hit it with the thing.

467
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:56,926
- [Beeping Continues]
- Jon!
- What?

468
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,127
I'm gonna go yell
at the super.

469
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:57,320
[Halley] I don't understand
why this is going off.

470
00:31:57,394 --> 00:32:00,761
- You said last week
it would be fine.
- Hey, Jon.

471
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,322
This place looks like
a disaster area.

472
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,028
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it's in here.

473
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:08,537
I gotta get going.
Coming!

474
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:01,318
Come on! I wanna see!
I wanna see!

475
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:04,224
I thought you wanted
a round-cut diamond.

476
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:07,024
- Why? When did I say that?
- I'm not exactly sure.

477
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:09,725
- But when we were younger, I think.
- Oh, God.

478
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,166
When I was younger, I was gonna
marry Boris Becker, wasn't I?

479
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,999
- Hey, guys. What did you think?
- Hey!

480
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:18,599
Well, I mean, was that last song
really inspired by my sister?

481
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,609
Every artist
needs his muse.

482
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:23,373
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.

483
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,415
No. You pay me
to keep away the bad news.

484
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:30,078
- Bring it on.
- Lars' dates in Stockholm
sold out in eight hours.

485
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:32,280
Wow!

486
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:35,086
That means we're gonna
have to add some more shows.
So we'll bump Paris--

487
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:38,093
Sorry. I don't wanna
spoil anyone's party,

488
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:40,254
but Lars and I have
already set the dates
for our honeymoon and our wedding,

489
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,924
and I've told my patients
when I'm going.

490
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:45,968
Well, baby, your patients can do
without you for a couple weeks.

491
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:49,767
He's right, Sara.
I mean, a couple of extra weeks
in Europe aren't gonna kill you.

492
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,865
Caroline's just pushing you
to stay longer...

493
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,433
'cause she wants us
to house-sit for you guys.

494
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:57,605
Yeah, thank you.
I was going to ask her
when she was drunk.

495
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:01,412
- Actually, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?
- Yes!

496
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:05,114
Come on, Kip.
Let's get out of here
before Sara changes Lars' mind.

497
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:09,155
- I said something wrong?
- No, it's--

498
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,217
I've just got
a very detailed schedule...

499
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:13,285
and my patients
are important too.

500
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:16,992
- I don't like changing
the dates at the last minute.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

501
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,831
But I really need you to approve
these T-shirt designs forAustralia.

502
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:21,837
- Oh, no problem.
- You don't mind, do you?

503
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:23,839
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.

504
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:25,875
She don't mind.

505
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:13,689
That's chamomile
for you ladies.

506
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,691
- Nice and hot. Very good.
- Thanks.

507
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,057
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It's no big deal.

508
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,062
It's peculiar though, right?
Don't you think?

509
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,462
Look, I thought you were through
with all this New Age bullshit...

510
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:25,501
like horoscopes and feng shui
and all the crap.

511
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,869
Eve, for someone
who owns a New Age store,
you are alarmingly earthbound.

512
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,034
Oh, yeah? And for
a shrink-in-training,
you are a little bit crazy.

513
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,202
- I'll tell you that much.
-[Woman] Excuse me.

514
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:38,736
- Do you carry the Casanova candle?
- As a matter of fact, we do.

515
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:42,911
Check on the shelf across
from the Caligula incense.

516
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:45,580
And they're on sale,
so today's your lucky day.

517
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:48,818
Great. You see,
that is what happens...

518
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,826
when people get hooked
on the New Age life.

519
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,158
They end up sitting at home
burning candles for Mr. Right...

520
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,223
when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now
is waiting at the corner bar.

521
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,896
- [ Giggling ]
- Hi. Oh, yeah.
She's a pain in the ass.

522
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:09,077
- And I gotta find her.
- I've been here three years,
so this is--

523
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:12,603
Yeah, I understand.
But your computer system
has been here for a long time.

524
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:15,116
- I think-- I think you're
just wasting my time, sir.
- No, no.

525
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:17,119
- Here's the thing.
- There's nothing I can do.

526
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,121
- It's very crucial.
- You cannot be over here.
You cannot come over...

527
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:21,123
- to this side of the counter.
- All right.

528
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:24,592
- Please don't cross this line.
Thank you.
- All I really need...

529
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:27,596
is if you can enter this
account number in the computer...

530
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:29,598
- and just tell me her name.
- Oh, I see.

531
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,657
When you put it
that way, no.

532
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,265
- Would 20 bucks help?
- It might if I was
a health inspector.

533
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,604
- Listen, this is really important.
- Oh, boy, did it again.

534
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:43,112
Crossed the line. You have to remain
on the other side of the register.

535
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:46,376
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.

536
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:50,180
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?
I have to have the name.

537
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:55,287
Well, I was a little short
on myweekly sales draw.

538
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:57,292
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.

539
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:03,060
Okay. Um, I'm going
to, uh-- [ Muttering ]

540
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,465
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are.

541
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:07,025
Allright?

542
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,634
- Lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.

543
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,147
Account number
was 029351--

544
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:21,650
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.

545
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:24,846
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.

546
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:27,253
- $700? That's extortion.
- 700.

547
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:29,986
That's good
salesmanship, sir.

548
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,994
What do I need?

549
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:34,087
Ring it up.

550
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:37,691
- Well, we have a purple tie.
What would go with a purple tie?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,962
I look like a magician.

552
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:42,436
All right,
you horrible little man.

553
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:45,133
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?

554
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,609
- Now, look her up.
- I already did.

555
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:51,704
It was a dead account.
There's no information
in our computers.

556
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,715
- You give me that?
- Hey, chase me.

557
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:55,717
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!

558
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:59,221
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that
or I will cut you!

559
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,348
Now, you better find a way
to help me right now!

560
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:03,824
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.

561
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:05,827
When our customers
apply for a credit card,

562
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,489
the hard copies go to our
storage facility in Queens.

563
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:12,023
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,

564
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,036
and you can find
her application.

565
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,402
However, you need
an employee to get you in.

566
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:19,408
You need an employee...

567
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:21,444
to get you in.

568
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:28,250
Crocodile.

569
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,500
Hal.

570
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,796
Halley.

571
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:39,321
A natural.

572
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:41,687
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.

573
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:50,393
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?

574
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:54,631
The problem is you can't fend
off an army of blood thirsty
Vikings with a shehnai.

575
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:57,002
- It's illogical.
- No, see-- No, no.

576
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:59,940
You're lulling them
into submission with the music.

577
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,501
That's the whole point
of the song, really.
"Mystic Surrender."

578
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:07,979
You don't think he looks
like he hates the music?

579
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:11,350
No. Hey.

580
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:16,425
Hey, baby.

581
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:19,360
- Now, this guy, he's-he's like
Alec Guinness. So good.
- Yeah.

582
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:22,227
Star Wars.
Obi-Wan.

583
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,531
All right, right here,
what are they doing?
What's their attitude?

584
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:30,095
- Whatare they thinking?
Whoare thesepeople?
- They're in awe and speechless.

585
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:34,667
And they're just grateful.
Underfed. Underpaid.

586
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:37,804
Why don't they ask me to stay
in the village and have a feast?

587
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:40,782
Yeah. Sara, hey.

588
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,784
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.

589
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,786
Okay, yeah, I'm going
to split, guys.

590
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:47,516
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director...

591
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,354
and I'm gonna have him
tweak that whole section.

592
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:53,623
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.

593
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:59,326
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.

594
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:02,894
- Oh, that's a drag.
- And I've just
found them in the freezer.

595
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,304
I don't get it.
Is that a joke?

596
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,309
No, Lars,
it's not a joke.

597
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:09,311
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

598
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:13,338
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.

599
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,384
It's just a bit
too much to deal with.

600
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:19,547
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning,

601
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:22,352
- so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know.

602
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,552
And that's why I think
I need a little break.

603
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:27,061
What do you mean,
a little break?

604
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,064
No, not that kind
of little break.

605
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:33,000
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries
and clear my head.

606
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:36,232
Hey, this has nothing
to do with the other night.

607
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:39,901
I just need this.
I need it for me.

608
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:42,274
But I won't go
unless you say it's okay.

609
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,742
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

610
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:50,650
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?

611
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:55,287
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.

612
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,364
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.

613
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:08,028
Are you serious?
Get out of town.

614
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,038
Yeah, that's the idea.

615
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:12,267
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.

616
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:15,140
This is unbelievable.

617
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:17,702
Sara, really, this is
way too generous of you.

618
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,307
Oh, come on.
Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?

619
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,318
There's no ulterior motives?

620
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:26,617
Well, yeah.

621
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,147
I'm getting married in a week
and I'd just like to have
one last fling...

622
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:32,160
with my best friend
before I walk down the aisle.

623
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:35,994
- It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.
- Oh, thanks.

624
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:39,193
- We're going to New York?
- Yeah. Yea!

625
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,177
# I want you
to get together #

626
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:57,550
# I want you
to get together #

627
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:04,894
#I want you
to get together#

628
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,502
# Put your hands together
one time #

629
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,538
# I want you
to get together #

630
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:20,576
# I want you
to get together ##

631
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:25,347
Hey! Excuse me.

632
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:27,781
- Why so tense?
- Because you're
freaking me out, all right?

633
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,944
- Is there another space
you can be in?
- Oh. Excusez-moi.

634
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,352
- Uh-huh.
- And what is it you do?

635
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:36,517
Why, my sales clerk friend,
I happen to write for
a little publication.

636
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:39,390
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called the New York Times.

637
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:42,898
- Oh.
- Yeah.
-[Phone Ringing]

638
00:43:47,437 --> 00:43:49,371
[Ringing]

639
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:52,533
Hello. Who?

640
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:56,510
Dean? And who may
I say is calling?

641
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,844
Huh? Hang on.
Your editor.

642
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,009
Hi. No.

643
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:06,522
Didn't get a chance
to write that one. Uh--

644
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:08,523
Didn't write
that one either.

645
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:12,891
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
they'll all still be dead tomorrow.

646
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:17,831
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.

647
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,767
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

648
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:23,328
- You must be very proud.
- Uh-huh. I'm the one
with the last word.

649
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:25,772
- Not tonight. I don't think so.
- Yes, I am. Absolutely.

650
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:28,333
- Fat chance. Last line.
- Still talking. Yeah, right here.

651
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,778
[Yelling]

652
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:34,180
I don't know. I don't know.
My eyes are killing me.

653
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,184
- Tell me these numbers match.
- I'll tell you.

654
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,186
- Let me see.
- Don't do that.

655
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:40,222
- Ah-ah!
- Is it 0293?

656
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,224
0293.
Congratulations.

657
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,226
- You got it?
- I think you found her.

658
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:47,694
Too bad the last name's
completely smudged out, though.

659
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:52,126
Well, it's his fault.
It was his thumb.

660
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:55,466
When he grabbed it, his thumb
went right across the name.

661
00:44:55,538 --> 00:44:57,733
Completely. I'm kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.

662
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:00,207
- Would you stop it?
- It's just a little joke.
That's carbon paper for you.

663
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:02,767
I guess that's why
America rejected it.

664
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:06,281
- What's that address?
Is that her address?
- That's seven years ago, man.

665
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:08,408
So go to the building
leasing office...

666
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:10,418
and you'll find out
who lived there seven years ago.

667
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,920
It ain't rocket science.

668
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,889
Thank you.

669
00:45:25,535 --> 00:45:27,594
- Hi.
- Hey.

670
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,604
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?

671
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:34,837
- Uh, okay, take us...
anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?

672
00:45:34,911 --> 00:45:36,845
Anywhere. Wherever
you feel like going.

673
00:45:36,913 --> 00:45:39,575
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?

674
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:43,176
- Um, okay, Eve, please
don't get mad at me.
- What?

675
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:45,812
Oh, no.
I cannot believe this.

676
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:47,321
I need
a borough here, ladies.

677
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,517
I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.

678
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:51,992
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

679
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,325
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait!

680
00:45:54,397 --> 00:45:56,365
Wait!

681
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:01,000
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.

682
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,800
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.
I needed my best friend with me.

683
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:06,501
What are you doing, Sara?

684
00:46:06,576 --> 00:46:09,545
Honestly, Sara, I don't
understand you anymore, okay?

685
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:12,206
Please, tell me something.

686
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:15,250
Tell me anything that makes
just a little bit of sense.

687
00:46:16,752 --> 00:46:19,687
I've just spent
the entire flight...

688
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:22,952
staring into the sky,
thinking.

689
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:26,722
Not about my fiance,
but about this mystery guy...

690
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:29,731
I met a million
and a half hours ago.

691
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:33,235
A guy I don't even remember,
except for this...

692
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:36,829
vague picture I have
inside my head.

693
00:46:36,906 --> 00:46:40,467
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.

694
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:43,137
And it was like...

695
00:46:43,212 --> 00:46:45,544
in that moment,

696
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:49,073
the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.

697
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:52,387
That's why I'm here.

698
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:56,721
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.

699
00:46:56,792 --> 00:47:01,320
Because when all this is over,
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.

700
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:04,866
Let's just pray
he's a bald fascist...

701
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:08,233
who picks his nose
and wipes it under the car seat.

702
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:16,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

703
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:18,012
Could you hold on?

704
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,856
Where are you going?

705
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:37,923
You better be buying me one
frigging big birthday cake,
that's all I gotta say.

706
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,934
Could I get your
destination, please?

707
00:47:40,002 --> 00:47:43,836
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.

708
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,538
Okay, we are going...
that way.

709
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:51,876
And I'm gonna follow.

710
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:54,883
You can do it yourself. Just open up
the computer and look into it.

711
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:58,387
- I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.
- If you can't, why can't you?

712
00:47:58,454 --> 00:48:00,945
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.

713
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,457
Couple of months out of college,
you're acting like you're
part of the establishment.

714
00:48:03,526 --> 00:48:07,292
No, no, no, no, no--
What about privacy law, huh?

715
00:48:07,363 --> 00:48:09,797
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?

716
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:12,493
- No.
- They protect millionaires.
Do you know who those are?

717
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:14,502
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.

718
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,663
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.

719
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:20,231
Pimple-faced college dropouts who
have made unhealthy sums of money...

720
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:23,176
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,

721
00:48:23,246 --> 00:48:26,147
provide no viable services and still
manage to generate profits...

722
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:28,809
for all of its lazy, day-trading,
son-of-a-bitch shareholders.

723
00:48:28,884 --> 00:48:32,251
Meanwhile, as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat,

724
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:35,813
you find some altruistic need
to protect these digital
plantation owners?

725
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:38,223
Wow. Come on.

726
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:45,198
Come on.

727
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:49,068
- You guys want the tenant
on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.

728
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,341
- There's your tenant.
- Sebastian Mig-non?

729
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,278
No. Mignon.
It's French.

730
00:48:59,348 --> 00:49:03,512
No, we're looking
for someone named Sara.
You got the right one?

731
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:07,283
- Maybe he was her boyfriend.
- Thanks.

732
00:49:07,356 --> 00:49:11,224
- You did the right thing.
Really, you did.
- Goodwork, pal.

733
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:13,228
You got it.
M-I-G-N-O-N.

734
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,355
You got it?
There you go.

735
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,867
- Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.
- Where is he?

736
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,698
- Brooklyn.
- Okay, let's, uh--
let's grab a subway.

737
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:23,705
Wait a minute. Wait. Aren't you
forgetting about something?

738
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:25,707
- What?
- Wedding rehearsal.
Bachelor party.

739
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:27,709
- Plenty of time.
Plenty of time. Come on.
- You sure?

740
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:30,075
- Yes. Gotta go to Brooklyn.
Come on.
- [ Barks ]

741
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:35,712
[ Gasps ]
Prada!

742
00:49:35,785 --> 00:49:37,719
Oh, my God!

743
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:41,052
Ooh! Prada!

744
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:45,056
Ooh, I love this stuff.

745
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:47,061
- That's $20.
- Twenty bucks?

746
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:49,563
Eve, that's
a horrific knockoff.

747
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:52,760
At least my fake says "Prada."
Yours says "Prado."

748
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:55,395
Yeah? Well,
I say for a dollar,

749
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:57,405
I can buy a little
Magic Marker and fix that.

750
00:49:57,473 --> 00:49:59,498
I'll take it.
Twenty bucks?

751
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:01,770
Right back here.
Here you go.

752
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:05,177
Two buckets of balls for the price
of one at the Chelsea Piers today.

753
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:07,181
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.

754
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:09,217
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like I feel something.

755
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:12,914
- Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.
Hey! Who are you?

756
00:50:12,988 --> 00:50:18,620
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of-- Whoa!

757
00:50:18,694 --> 00:50:21,925
- Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.
- Oh, my God.

758
00:50:21,997 --> 00:50:24,465
- Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?

759
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:29,027
- Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?
- Oh, my. Goodness gracious.

760
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:32,438
- I'm all right.
Can you get the flyers?
- Here you go.

761
00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:39,111
- Taxi!
- Sara!

762
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:42,014
They should
make pills for this.

763
00:50:52,561 --> 00:50:55,792
He's gotta be here.

764
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,834
He's got to be here.
I can feel it.

765
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:20,153
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yeah?

766
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:23,885
- You're blocking my shot.
- Oh.

767
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:28,056
Oh. Sorry.

768
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:37,498
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

769
00:51:37,573 --> 00:51:41,202
- Oh!
-[Eve] Do you know
who plays golf?.

770
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:44,678
Guys who are too fat
to play tennis.

771
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:46,681
Like that guy.

772
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,683
[Man #1]
Well, this is a special occasion.

773
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:51,481
After all, how many times in your
life is your son gonna get married?

774
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:53,488
[Man #2]
Well said.

775
00:51:53,556 --> 00:51:56,116
- You wanna know
why I love this game?
- No. Why?

776
00:51:56,192 --> 00:51:58,126
I'll tell ya.

777
00:51:58,194 --> 00:52:01,721
You can take years off from playing
and still come back strong.

778
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:04,732
Well, me, I haven't played
in over five years.

779
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,267
You're kidding.

780
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:10,964
- Ow!
- Ooh!

781
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,133
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
- Sorry up there.

782
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:15,143
- Eve, look out!
- Go.

783
00:52:15,211 --> 00:52:19,978
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm, so sorr-- Are you okay?

784
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,142
[ Sara ] Please say something.
Say something.

785
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:24,379
[ Eve ]
I think I swallowed a filling.

786
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:26,921
Thank you for letting us in.
Now, Mr. Mignon,

787
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:29,924
we have an odd and some what
personal question to ask you.

788
00:52:29,992 --> 00:52:32,483
Mignon.

789
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:34,722
Mr. Mignon.

790
00:52:34,797 --> 00:52:37,561
Mignon. Like the meat.

791
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:41,831
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl,
first name Sara?

792
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:45,067
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,
you know, really amazing...

793
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,075
- girl.
- Oui.

794
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:51,579
- Do you know where we can
locate this individual?
- No, I do not.

795
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:54,343
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.

796
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,350
Oh, come on. You don't
even remember the last name
of your ex-girlfriend?

797
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:59,410
- I find that hard to believe.
- You don't understand anything.

798
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:02,855
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.

799
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:04,916
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.

800
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:07,861
- She was placed with me by--
- A roommate finder's service?

801
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,627
Oui. She stayed with me with
her boyfriend for a few months--

802
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,863
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out
very quickly.

803
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:18,429
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too.

804
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,441
Yeah, but did she
leave anything behind,

805
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:23,205
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?

806
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:25,406
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.

807
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:27,472
Anything would help,
really. Anything.

808
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:30,842
I remember she sat on me.

809
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:35,613
She-- She sat on you?

810
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:39,627
Yes. She sat on me
for a while.

811
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:42,459
I found her...

812
00:53:42,531 --> 00:53:45,091
inspiring.

813
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:49,297
I guess that is why I started
painting her in the first place.

814
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:51,305
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.

815
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:54,069
That is what I said.

816
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:56,634
- That's what he said.
- That's what I said.

817
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:58,703
Clearly.

818
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:04,318
Do you happen
to have the painting?

819
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:13,657
Hey, now you're gonna see
what it's all about.
You know, you see her face.

820
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:16,220
Okay. Yeah.

821
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,900
This is her, yes?

822
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:25,537
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.

823
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:30,102
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing, you know,
with the crown and the scepter.

824
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:33,444
- Do you have a name for
the roommate finder's service?
- They would have the information.

825
00:54:33,515 --> 00:54:36,109
No, I do not.

826
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:40,849
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.

827
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:42,857
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?

828
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,395
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

829
00:54:47,463 --> 00:54:49,454
On 60thStreet.

830
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:53,865
- East side or west side?
- It was just next to that--

831
00:54:53,936 --> 00:54:58,396
on the left of that
splendid little patisserie,

832
00:54:58,474 --> 00:54:59,907
Serendipity.

833
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:03,977
That'sit.

834
00:55:08,717 --> 00:55:11,277
Get-- Get ready.

835
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:15,647
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.

836
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:17,658
Thank you.

837
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,626
Thanks.

838
00:55:21,296 --> 00:55:23,230
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

839
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:26,131
- No, you will be if you sing.
- [ Laughs ]

840
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,903
Eve, thanks so much
for coming with me.

841
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,907
You're welcome.

842
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:36,672
Sara, you know,
it's a wonderful thought.

843
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:40,943
The idea that all of life,
that every single event
is part of some master plan...

844
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:44,008
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate.

845
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:48,045
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?

846
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:52,025
Or making decisions?
Hell, why should we even
get out of bed in the morning?

847
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:53,925
For the cake?

848
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:56,863
No. Not for cake.

849
00:55:56,932 --> 00:55:59,594
So that you make mistakes.

850
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:02,102
Mistakes like this trip.

851
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:05,197
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.

852
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:07,538
You figure it out.
You-You think.

853
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:12,205
You realize that life
isn't some elaborate stage play
with directions for the actors.

854
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:14,215
Life's a mess, Sara.

855
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:17,343
It's-It's
chaos personified.

856
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:22,619
I have to give it
all up now, don't I?

857
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:24,625
Sara, you have a fiance who,

858
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:28,629
despite his weird
Eastern music,

859
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:32,758
which we hope is
just a phase, let's hope,

860
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:34,769
loves you
very, very, very much.

861
00:56:34,837 --> 00:56:37,032
It's not giving up.
It's growing up.

862
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:41,042
[ Sighs ]

863
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,709
Let's get out of here.

864
00:56:46,749 --> 00:56:48,717
Yeah.

865
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,358
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.

866
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:19,176
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.

867
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:22,581
- Wait right here.
I'll be right back. Stay here.
- Why?

868
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:28,823
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.

869
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:30,791
Right. Right.

870
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:43,234
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.

871
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:45,239
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.

872
00:57:45,307 --> 00:57:47,241
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.

873
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,709
What?

874
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:52,372
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

875
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:54,745
- What?
- It can't get
any more clearer than this.

876
00:57:54,817 --> 00:57:57,251
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.

877
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:00,755
Hey, it's another
one of your clues, man.
Let's talk about it in the cab...

878
00:58:00,823 --> 00:58:04,350
- on the way over.
- It's not a clue. It's a sign.

879
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:08,590
- What's the difference?
- A clue is what a detective
uses to find a suspect.

880
00:58:08,664 --> 00:58:12,065
The receipt, the warehouse,
that French guy-- those
are clues. This is a sign.

881
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:14,068
Me never finding the book,
that's a sign.

882
00:58:14,136 --> 00:58:16,366
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.

883
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:18,998
How could something
not happening be a sign?

884
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:22,066
Maybe the absence
of signs is a sign.

885
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:23,577
Isn't it?

886
00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:25,738
That's lucid.

887
00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:28,078
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.

888
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,416
And if there is,
it's not working for me.

889
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:35,422
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.

890
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,254
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?

891
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:41,091
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.
My wedding rehearsal...

892
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:43,097
starts in less
than an hour.

893
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:45,258
- My bride is waiting for me.
- Let me ask you something here.

894
00:58:45,334 --> 00:58:49,270
If Sara were here right now,
poof, came down, what would
she tell you to do?

895
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:51,602
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf...

896
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:53,937
because all the signs
point to me getting married.

897
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:55,943
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.

898
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:58,536
- I hate to state the obvious--
- State it.

899
00:58:58,614 --> 00:59:02,311
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.

900
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:06,115
Maybe I was never
supposed to.

901
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:08,122
Maybe all this
is just a maze...

902
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:11,990
designed to lead me directly
back to where I started.

903
00:59:14,696 --> 00:59:16,823
Which is getting married.

904
00:59:21,236 --> 00:59:23,727
They should make pills
for this.

905
00:59:27,342 --> 00:59:30,607
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!

906
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,115
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?

907
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:37,208
- Good.
- Oh, my God.
Sara, can you believe...

908
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:40,380
that I was Halley's R.A.
in college?

909
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,424
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.

910
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,619
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

911
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:48,629
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years?

912
00:59:48,697 --> 00:59:50,665
Eve was, uh--
I went to B.U. with Eve.

913
00:59:50,732 --> 00:59:52,825
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?

914
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:55,028
So what are you doing here?

915
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:59,369
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are? Congratulations.

916
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:00,999
- Congratulations.
- Wow!

917
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:04,170
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?

918
01:00:04,246 --> 01:00:07,579
Yeah, at noon.
We're going to rehearsal.
Why don't you come watch?

919
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:11,210
- Why don't you go?
- Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.

920
01:00:11,286 --> 01:00:15,916
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.

921
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:19,085
- Oh!
- Oh! No, no.

922
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:23,063
I have to go upstairs
and call my fiance-- who's a man.

923
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:26,123
Oh! You must be
very proud.

924
01:00:26,201 --> 01:00:30,137
- Okay, so have a good one.
I'll see you later.
- Okay, good.

925
01:00:30,205 --> 01:00:34,198
Good-bye,
my sweet lesbian lady lover.

926
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:37,211
I'm just kidding.
It's just a joke between us.

927
01:00:49,124 --> 01:00:52,218
Lars?

928
01:00:52,294 --> 01:00:54,592
What are you doing?

929
01:00:54,663 --> 01:00:58,429
- How did you know where I was?
- Intuition.

930
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,229
Really?

931
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:04,068
No. I went through
the New York Hotel Guide.

932
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:07,506
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."

933
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:10,010
Sara, I missed you so much.

934
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,947
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.

935
01:01:15,017 --> 01:01:20,182
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.

936
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,460
l, Jonathan, take you, Halley,
to be my wife,

937
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:27,461
and I promise to love
and sustain you...

938
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:30,498
in the bond of marriage
from this day forward.

939
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:32,726
[Dialogue Fades Out]

940
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,281
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.

941
01:01:53,355 --> 01:01:57,291
- [Laughter]
- And that's when the actual
ceremony will conclude.

942
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,827
- Excuse me. I need
some help over here.
- What?

943
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:01,988
And then--
then you're married.

944
01:02:02,064 --> 01:02:05,033
Hal, who's that girl
over there?

945
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,467
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.

946
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:10,505
[Woman]
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.

947
01:02:10,572 --> 01:02:15,134
And now make sure to
be here tomorrow morning
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

948
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,145
I hate to break up a good thing,
but we have some strippers
waiting for us. We're late.

949
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:20,579
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I mean "strippers."

950
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,981
- The women who take off everything.
- I'll see you men at 9:00.

951
01:02:23,051 --> 01:02:26,020
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.

952
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:28,215
Fantastic. It gives you
an hour to get crazy.

953
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,520
Let's get into it.

954
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:35,029
Before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,
I need to talk to him.

955
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:39,056
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.

956
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:42,103
- Hi.
- I want you to meet Jon.

957
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:45,662
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- I would love
for you to come tomorrow.

958
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,335
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?

959
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:52,039
- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.
It's tomorrow at noon?

960
01:02:52,114 --> 01:02:54,105
Yeah, and you can bring
your friend if you want.

961
01:02:54,182 --> 01:02:58,016
- Okay. I'll be there.
- Be there.

962
01:02:58,086 --> 01:03:00,020
Thank you.
That's so nice.

963
01:03:00,088 --> 01:03:03,489
- See you tomorrow.
- Nice to meet you. Bye. See you.

964
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:09,859
- Halley, what is it?
What's wrong?
- It's you.

965
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:12,525
- What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?
- Nothing, exactly.

966
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:15,764
It's just this feeling
I have, like--

967
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:17,805
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.

968
01:03:17,873 --> 01:03:21,104
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

969
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:27,237
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and-and...

970
01:03:27,315 --> 01:03:29,875
I've imagined the dress
and the flowers...

971
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:32,818
and even the music
the band was gonna play.

972
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:37,382
And everything is exactly the way
I want it, except for my fiance,

973
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:39,757
who's just decided to float off
to Never-Never Land.

974
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:41,921
Look, maybe I've been a little bit
out of it the past week,

975
01:03:41,997 --> 01:03:44,261
but it's just normal,
you know, guy stuff.

976
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:46,630
- It's a little cold feet.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.
- Well, call me crazy,

977
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:48,760
but I'd like
my fiance's feet to be warm,

978
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:52,329
especially when we're hours
from going down the aisle.

979
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:57,744
I'm sorry, Hal.
Really, I am.

980
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:01,179
Whatever it is that
you're holding on to,

981
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:05,242
please just let it go.

982
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,584
Please.

983
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:10,648
I think it already
let go of me, okay?

984
01:04:14,663 --> 01:04:16,654
Wait.

985
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:21,268
- What's this?
- What do you think?

986
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:24,203
It's the traditional
groom's gift.

987
01:04:24,272 --> 01:04:28,504
- I got yours,
and I forgot to bring it.
- I know. It's okay.

988
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,909
Open it.

989
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:40,150
It's a first edition.

990
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:43,953
It's just that every time
we go into a bookstore,
you're always flipping through it.

991
01:04:44,025 --> 01:04:46,892
And I checked this week.
You don't even have a copy.

992
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:03,209
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

993
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:08,478
It's perfect.

994
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,711
It's an excellent choice.

995
01:05:18,093 --> 01:05:21,256
# When you know #

996
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:24,162
# That you know #

997
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,166
# Who you love #

998
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:29,067
# You can't deny it #

999
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:31,503
What's going on?
Are you all right?

1000
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:33,939
Her name's Sara Thomas.

1001
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:37,001
What?

1002
01:05:37,078 --> 01:05:39,012
How did--

1003
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,181
Halley gave it to me
as a wedding gift.

1004
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:49,917
# Never let him go #

1005
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:52,425
# 'Cause you know #

1006
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:55,861
# And you know
that you know #

1007
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,569
Sally?

1008
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:04,196
It's Dean from obits.
Hey.

1009
01:06:04,272 --> 01:06:08,436
I need an address for a Sara Thomas.
S-A-R-A T-H-O-M-A-S.

1010
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,035
Uh, I got
an old phone number.

1011
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:16,208
Yeah, we'll hold.

1012
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:19,879
[Lars] Hang on.
Sir, can you pull this thing over?

1013
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:22,548
I can't hear a thing.

1014
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,388
Honey, just one second.
Okay, go. What?

1015
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,725
What?

1016
01:06:28,797 --> 01:06:33,234
We have to cancel
Dusseldorf. Why?

1017
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:36,532
We have to cancel Stockholm?

1018
01:06:42,143 --> 01:06:46,944
# You can feel
love's around you #

1019
01:06:47,015 --> 01:06:52,282
# Like the sky
round the moon #

1020
01:06:52,354 --> 01:06:57,485
# This is how
love has found you #

1021
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:02,826
# Now you know
what to do #

1022
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:05,161
# When you know ##

1023
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:12,204
Oh. Look at those stars.

1024
01:07:12,273 --> 01:07:16,676
They all have names,
you know.

1025
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:19,077
I don't know
what that is.

1026
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:36,026
It's Cassiopeia.

1027
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:43,033
The... stars in the sky.

1028
01:07:44,706 --> 01:07:47,470
It's Cassiopeia.

1029
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:59,987
You realize with the time delay,
if our return flight takes off
more than ten minutes late,

1030
01:08:00,054 --> 01:08:01,988
I miss my own wedding, okay?

1031
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:05,856
- Does that bother you
in the slightest?
- You are a jackass.

1032
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:10,159
- Well, thank you.
- You are. You--

1033
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:13,223
Y-Y-You're my hero,
you know?

1034
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:15,997
You're like my oracle
and shit, you know?

1035
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,267
You're out there, man,
and you're making it happen.

1036
01:08:20,742 --> 01:08:22,676
Courtney moved out.

1037
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:31,713
- What?
- Yeah. It's-- Look, man.

1038
01:08:31,786 --> 01:08:35,950
We'd been fighting
for a really long time.

1039
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,958
Why didn't you tell me?

1040
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:39,960
We didn't want to ruin
your wedding, man.

1041
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:43,395
- Didn't want to rain
on your parade, man.
- What the hell happened?

1042
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,399
We just--

1043
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:47,435
We let it slip away,
you know?

1044
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:51,802
That's the point. It--
You know, it died.

1045
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:54,740
- We died.
- What was the cause of death?

1046
01:08:54,809 --> 01:09:00,406
Not enough of all of this,
of this, of this.

1047
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:04,248
And not enough,
you know? Do you--

1048
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,049
Do you remember
the philosopher Epictetus?
You remember what he said?

1049
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:11,888
He said, "If you want to
improve, be content to be
thought foolish and stupid."

1050
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,155
That's what you've done.

1051
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:18,994
- I work hard at it.
- Now I want to be a jackass.

1052
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:23,197
You know?
You're the shit!

1053
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:26,770
That would be me, the shit.

1054
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:28,638
[Dean]
Yeah. He's the shit. Okay.

1055
01:09:49,531 --> 01:09:53,092
## [Soft Rock]

1056
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:15,120
You know what, old buddy?
On second thought,
maybe you should call first.

1057
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:17,123
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring.
It's more polite that way.

1058
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:19,125
Calling her gives her
a chance to clean up.

1059
01:10:19,193 --> 01:10:21,127
I don't care how clean
her house is!

1060
01:10:21,195 --> 01:10:23,129
- She might.
- What are you talking about?

1061
01:10:23,197 --> 01:10:26,064
- You told me to go!
You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.

1062
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:29,126
- You can't look!
- Why are you hanging on?

1063
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:33,196
- I don't want you to get hurt.
Don't get hurt!
- You're hurting me!

1064
01:11:11,746 --> 01:11:15,182
I think that went very well.

1065
01:11:15,249 --> 01:11:18,548
Didn't-- Didn't she say that
everything happens for a reason?

1066
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,783
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we're
laying here because--

1067
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:24,552
Because why?

1068
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:27,356
Because you don't want to
be standing somewhere else.

1069
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:43,136
I see. Yeah.
We're crawling. We're crawling.

1070
01:11:43,444 --> 01:11:45,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

1071
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,248
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna
be on the ground a little longer...

1072
01:11:48,316 --> 01:11:50,284
due to some bad weather
heading this way.

1073
01:11:50,351 --> 01:11:52,319
The air traffic controller
has put us on hold,

1074
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:56,949
so in the mean time,
I've asked the cabin attendants
to start the movie.

1075
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:59,823
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.

1076
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:02,556
You know me.
I love a good wedding.

1077
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:05,292
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.

1078
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:08,267
We spoke this morning
before he left.

1079
01:12:08,336 --> 01:12:11,499
I think he's gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.

1080
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:15,565
Of course he's gonna be okay,
and you're gonna be okay too.

1081
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,077
Yeah?

1082
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:21,081
Oh, you know what?
There's a lady glaring at me.

1083
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:24,585
I don't think I'm supposed
to be on the phone.
Can I call you when I get home?

1084
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:26,586
Have a safe flight, okay?

1085
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:29,748
- Lots of love. Bye.
- Headsets?

1086
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:32,725
- Yes, I will.
- $3.00, please.

1087
01:12:34,162 --> 01:12:36,096
What the hell is this?

1088
01:12:36,164 --> 01:12:37,859
Something the matter?

1089
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:41,629
Yes. I think I've mixed up
my wallet with my friend's.

1090
01:12:41,703 --> 01:12:43,637
Yes, I have.
See? Prado.

1091
01:12:43,705 --> 01:12:47,197
Oh. Well, is there
any money in it?

1092
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:50,972
I'll have a look.

1093
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:53,946
Yes, there is.
Thank you.

1094
01:13:11,232 --> 01:13:15,794
Two ones... and a five.

1095
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:17,804
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

1096
01:13:17,872 --> 01:13:21,638
- Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
- That's this gentleman's change.

1097
01:13:21,709 --> 01:13:25,167
- Jonathan. Jonathan.
- Excuse me. I just--

1098
01:13:25,246 --> 01:13:27,646
Sorry. You know what?
I'm going to--

1099
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:32,049
Thank you. Excuse me.
Sorry. Whoo! I'm sorry!

1100
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:35,683
Hi. Yeah.
It's in New York City.

1101
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:39,193
I need the address
of a Jonathan Trager.

1102
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,320
Yeah. T-R-A-G-E-R.

1103
01:13:44,565 --> 01:13:47,159
34 Charles Street?
Thank you.

1104
01:13:47,235 --> 01:13:49,169
34 Charles Street.

1105
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:02,544
Hi. I'm looking
for a Jonathan Trager.
Is this his building?

1106
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:05,177
- You must be late.
- Late for what?

1107
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:07,414
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.

1108
01:14:10,758 --> 01:14:13,420
- He's getting married?
- Might be already.

1109
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:20,697
- Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!
Excuse me!
- [ Tires Screech ]

1110
01:14:20,768 --> 01:14:24,465
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria
as fast as you can go, please?

1111
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:31,168
Can you see what it is?

1112
01:14:48,196 --> 01:14:50,187
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!

1113
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,303
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.

1114
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:06,076
- Stop!
- Stop?

1115
01:15:06,147 --> 01:15:08,081
Is it over?

1116
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:09,912
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

1117
01:15:09,984 --> 01:15:12,851
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.

1118
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:23,763
Butdon't worry.

1119
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:27,426
You'll get
your present back.

1120
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:31,198
- Excuse me?
- They always return thepresents.

1121
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,509
You asked
if it was over.

1122
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:38,101
The truth is,
it never even began.

1123
01:15:38,179 --> 01:15:43,014
- What?
- Yeah. He called the whole
thing off this morning.

1124
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:48,381
He called it off?

1125
01:15:57,064 --> 01:16:00,227
That's terrible.

1126
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:03,395
Were you a friend
of the bride?

1127
01:16:04,805 --> 01:16:07,239
Or the groom?

1128
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:10,572
[Bell Tolling]

1129
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:18,085
- What's up with this weather?
- What happened to spring?

1130
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:22,748
- So, what kind of
pep talk do you want?
- What do you got?

1131
01:16:22,823 --> 01:16:26,657
Well, I've got the inspirational
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."

1132
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:28,752
It's very popular,
but not appropriate for this.

1133
01:16:28,829 --> 01:16:32,492
Of course, there's the "Don't worry,
there's more fish in the sea" pap.

1134
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:35,865
- No.
- Uh, we can always
fall back on the classic...

1135
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:41,341
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."

1136
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:43,570
How about telling me
I did the right thing?

1137
01:16:43,644 --> 01:16:46,909
I don't have to tell you.

1138
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:49,006
I wrote it.

1139
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:51,108
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.

1140
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:54,052
- Nice.
- Turns out I had writer's block...

1141
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:56,954
penning your best man speech,
and that's what ended up coming out.

1142
01:16:57,024 --> 01:16:59,788
Blame it on the day job.

1143
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:03,422
- Twenty, right?
- Thanks.

1144
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:11,031
- You going to see Courtney?
- Absolutely.

1145
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:13,096
I needed this.

1146
01:17:16,677 --> 01:17:19,703
You know, the Greeks
didn't write obituaries.

1147
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:24,114
They only asked one question
after a man died:

1148
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:26,380
"Did he have passion?"

1149
01:17:30,124 --> 01:17:32,024
How do I look?

1150
01:17:36,697 --> 01:17:38,631
Like a jackass.

1151
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:42,502
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

1152
01:17:55,883 --> 01:17:57,908
[Dean]
Jonathan Trager,

1153
01:17:57,985 --> 01:18:00,681
prominent televisionproducer
for ESPN,

1154
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:05,988
died last night from
complications of losing
his soulmate and his fiance.

1155
01:18:07,561 --> 01:18:12,430
He was 35 years old
and soft-spoken and obsessive.

1156
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,594
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.

1157
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:18,934
But in the final days
of his life,

1158
01:18:19,006 --> 01:18:21,873
he revealed
an unknown side of his psyche.

1159
01:18:21,942 --> 01:18:25,173
This hidden
quasi-Jungian persona...

1160
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:30,479
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit
for his long-reputed soulmate,

1161
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:34,453
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.

1162
01:18:34,522 --> 01:18:38,686
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night...

1163
01:18:38,759 --> 01:18:42,661
in complete and utter failure.

1164
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,994
Yet even in certain defeat,

1165
01:18:45,066 --> 01:18:47,557
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief...

1166
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:51,469
that life is not merely
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.

1167
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:55,236
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events...

1168
01:18:55,309 --> 01:19:00,042
that culminate in
an exquisite, sublime plan.

1169
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:03,515
Asked about the loss
of his dear friend, Dean Kansky,

1170
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:07,145
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author and executive editor
of the New York Times,

1171
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:11,487
described Jonathan as a changed man
in the last days of his life.

1172
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:14,653
"Things were clearer for him, "
Kansky noted.

1173
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:19,324
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if weare to live life
in harmony with the universe,

1174
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,894
we must all possess a powerful
faith in what the ancients
used to call "fatum,"

1175
01:19:23,971 --> 01:19:28,806
- what we currently
refer to as destiny.
- Destiny.

1176
01:19:41,255 --> 01:19:43,223
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1177
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,349
I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.

1178
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:47,621
I don't think you should do that.
I really don't.

1179
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:49,959
- Well, what do you think
I should do?
- Just be here.

1180
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:53,796
- I feel it.
I feel it in the air.
- Eve, what's happened to you?

1181
01:19:53,868 --> 01:19:56,268
You've become your own
worst nightmare right there.

01:19:59,273 --> 01:20:02,106
Bye.

1183
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:07,843

It's freezing out here.

I think it's good luck we return

No beverages on the premises!

- Hey, how you doing?

1206
01:24:57,404 --> 01:24:59,099

This is the girl.
- Yes, I do.
