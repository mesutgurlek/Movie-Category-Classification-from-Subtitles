You know why.
We've been through it.

I think I see a cab.
If we run quickly,

159
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,247
we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

160
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,956
I'm back.

161
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,705
- Where were you?
- Oh.

162
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,539
You know, just out and around.

163
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,879
You probably took your niece
to the movies again.

164
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,835
Oh, I'm crazy about that kid.

You gonna make another scene?

170
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,014
- Hey, I didn't make a scene last time.
- Yes, you certainly did.

171
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,190
You were not nice
and your resentment showed.

172

I don't resent him.
I've told you that.

173
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,561
You know, I happen to think he's
a pompous ass. You don't see it

174
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,567
- 'cause you're in love with him.
- What are you muttering?

175
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
- I'm not muttering anything.
- You certainly are.

Hey, I like your brother Ben.

178
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,912
Sure. Ben is a saint.
You're not jealous of Ben.

179
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,409
You think I'm jealous of Lester

180
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,889
because he's a television producer?

181
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,121
No. I think you're jealous
because he's a much-honored,

182
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,920
highly-respected man and he's
a millionaire 10 times over,

183
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,542
and he's doing what
you'd like to be doing.

184
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,920
Hey, listen,
I can't watch his stuff, ok.

185
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,171
It's submental.

186
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I think he wants to talk
to you about a job.

187
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,679
I don't need a job.

188

And didn't I get honorable mention
at that festival in, in, in...

In Cincinnati? The Cincinnati
Documentary Film Festival?

190

This is what you're clinging to?

191

Everybody got honorable

- Hi.

- My brother-in-law Clifford.
- Hi.

This is Lisa Crosley.
Lisa's gonna star in my new series.

Yeah, well,

Oh, hi. Hello, darling.

204
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,862
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.

00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,281
I see it.

308
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,703
(JUDAH SIGHING)

309
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,076
JUDAH: Oh, God.

310
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,290
What?

311
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,539
I need to take a minute.

312
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,585
What's wrong, Judah?

313
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,009
I'm in such trouble, Ben.

314
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,837
What is it?

315
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,722
I need to talk to someone.

316
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,925
Sure.

317
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,478
We've known each other many years.
You're a religious man.

318
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,226
I'm... Okay, I'm not.

319
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,815
We've differed on many points,

320
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,608
but you're somebody I do respect.

321
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,319
May I confide in you?

322
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,738
Of course.

323
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,866
Go ahead.
Everything's confidential.

324
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,535
I've done a foolish thing.

325
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,708
Senseless, vain, dumb.

326
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,415
Another woman.

327
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,680
Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.

328
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,684
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone, I don't know.

329
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,182
But now my life's about
to go up in smoke.

330
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,265
BEN: Can't you break it off?

331
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,895
The woman won't allow it.

332
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,944
She's young.
She's very unstable.

333
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,862
She's an hysteric.

334
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,191
And vindictive.

335
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,155
And it's my fault.

336
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,615
I instigated it.
I prolonged it.

337
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,411
Many times I tried to back off,
but I was too weak.

338
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,785
But I promised her nothing.

339
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,962
But did I?
See, I don't even know anymore.

340
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,549
In the heat of passion,
you say things.

341
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,927
All I know is, after two years
of shameful deceit,

342
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,219
where I led this double life,

343
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,888
I awakened as if from a dream

344
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,849
and realized what I'd be losing.

345
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,642
It's called wisdom.

346
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,720
It comes to some suddenly.

347
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,600
We realize the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

348
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,316
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

349
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,155
You know,
I kidded myself about loving her,

350
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,066
but deep down I knew,

351
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,947
knowing I behaved selfishly.

352
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,741
For pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

353
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,990
Sometimes when there's
real love and

354
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,493
true acknowledgment of a mistake,

355
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,795
there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.

356
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,540
I know Miriam.

357
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,375
Her values, her feelings,

358
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,511
her place among
our friends and colleagues...

359
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,670
But what choice do you have

360
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,631
if the woman is going to tell her?
You...

361
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,342
You have to confess the wrong

362
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,927
and hope for understanding and

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,763
maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too,

364
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,771
and you have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

365
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,437
And maybe you and Miriam
can never go back to the old life,

366
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,865
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding.

367
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,362
Maybe I...

368
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,114
Maybe even a richer one.

369
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,655
You know what's funny?

370
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,541
Our entire adult lives,

371
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,498
you and I have been having

372
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,750
this same conversation
in one form or another.

373
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes, I know.

374
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,882
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

375
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,963
You see it as harsh
and empty of values and pitiless,

376
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,221
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

377
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,643
a moral structure with real meaning

378
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,811
and forgiveness.

379
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,973
And some kind of higher power.

380
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,479
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.

381
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,020
And I know you well enough to know

382
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,856
that a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.

383
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,117
Now, you're talking to me
like your congregation.

384
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,906
(BOTH LAUGHING)

385
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,246
It's true.
We went from a small infidelity

386
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,994
to the meaning of existence.

387
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,620
Miriam won't think two years
of scheming and dishonesty is a...

388
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,830
ls a small infidelity.

Oh, how can you do it?

392
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,356
I give up.

393
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,808
God, you're in such
wonderful shape.

394

- For any age.

(BOTH PANTING)

396
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,940
I was actually quite athletic
when I was a young student.

397
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,898
You still make love
like a young student.

398
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,424
Yeah?

399
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,785
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

400
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,285
You know,

401
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,804
I don't think we
should do this here.

402
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,024
Well, why not?
We're all alone.

403
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,247
I don't know.

404
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,874
I feel a little self-conscious.

405
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,126
Let's go back to the
cottage and light a fire.

406
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,798
And you can play me the Schumann.

407
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,171
Schubert.

408
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,502
- Schumann is flowery.
- Oh.

409
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,970
Schubert is...

410
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,423
Well, reminds me of you.

411
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,597
The sad one.

Schubert.

413
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,139
God, you have to teach me all that.

414
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,312
I'm so ignorant in classical music.

415
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,639

Why did you call the house last
night and hang up, huh, Del?

422
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,436
I'm not playing games, Judah.

423

Just because you've decided
I'm through in your life

00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,397
doesn't mean I'm gonna
roll over and die.

What the hell happened to us?
I mean...

426
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,693
We had a wonderful few years.

427
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,524
We both knew it
couldn't go on forever.

428
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,110
I gave up things for you.

Oh, come on.
That's poppycock.

430

Don't give me that, will you?

431
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,788
For God's sakes.

432
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,035
There were no business opportunities.
It's all in your head.

No lovers begging for your hand.

Can we not argue?

436
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,752
I just wanted to talk.

437
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,087
I'm just so rattled.

438
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,634
I have an idea.

439
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,267
I thought if we could get away.
Just...

440
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,515
Just for a little while
on one of our trips.

441
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,057
Our trips are the warmest
memories I have,

442
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,642
not just in our relationship,

443
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,148
but some of the loveliest
times I've ever had.

444
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,196
And you're always so much
more relaxed away from home.

get away to Boston or Washington,

preconceived notions...

- I can't, Del.

- Why not?
- I can't.

- Of course, I won't.

Look.

460
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,816
I've been...

461
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,902
I've been thinking, too,

462
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,657
and it...

463
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,868
it occurs to me, I mean, if I...

464
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,992
If I have caused you
to miss out on any opportunities

465
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,793
that might have been
lucrative for you,

466
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,963
I'm... I'm perfectly prepared
to, to reimburse you.

467
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,006
I mean, I certainly don't
want to feel I've cost you...

468
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,254
I'm not after your goddamn money!

00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,381
I want to speak to Miriam.

470
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,008
- It's her problem, too.
- Now keep her out of it.

471
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,091
- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it, all right?

472
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,147
I think she should know her husband
is a liar and an embezzler.

473
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,104
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

474
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm not blind.

475
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,911
I know what went on between those
philanthropies and your stocks.

476
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,408
I took nothing, not a nickel, ever.

477
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,286
My conscience is completely clear.

478
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,083
You needed money
to cover your losses.

479
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,160
- I was around when it was happening.
- Okay, okay.

480
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,588
JUDAH: I needed some temporary help.
I mean,

481
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,965
for Christ's sake.
I mean, after a lifetime of hard work,

482
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,589
a man doesn't sit still and watch
himself go down the toilet.

483
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,968
I mean, does he?

484
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,013
And moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

485
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,164
- Without asking or telling anyone?
- Look, listen to me.

486
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,223
Every cent was accounted
for with interest.

487
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,352
I don't think they
would see it that way.

488
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,604
So this is it, right?
This is what you plan on doing.

489
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686
You're gonna hold on
to me with threats, right?

490
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,363
Stupid threats and slander.

491
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,759
This is your idea of love, right?

492
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,617
I will not be tossed out!
I want to speak to Miriam!

493
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,403
Think, for Christ's sake!

494
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,784
Well, think... Think what the hell
you're doing to me, will you?

495
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,164
Please.

496
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,162
I can't figure it out.

497
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,035
I need you.

498
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,130
(SIGHING) Del.

499
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,759
LESTER: I love New York. I was
born in that building right there.

500
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,930
Behind the... The guy, uh, the statue
there, the guy on the pedestal.

501
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,677
I love New York. It's like, uh,

502
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,633
it's like thousands of,
uh, straight lines

503
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,685
just looking for a punch line,
you know?

504
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,139
And what makes New York
such a funny place, is that

505
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,977
there's so much tension and pain
and misery and craziness here.

506
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,939
And they got...
That's the first part of comedy.

507
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,567
But see, you got to get
some distance from it.

508
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,738
You know what I mean?

509
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,691
That the main...
The thing to remember about comedy is,

510
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,527
if it's... If it bends, it's funny.

511
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,454
If it breaks, it's not funny.

512
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,657
So you gotta get back from the pain.
You see what I mean?

513
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,912
But the... The, uh...

514
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,540
Like they said, they asked
me up in, uh, at Harvard,

515
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,713
a bunch of kids asked me,
"Why... What's comedy?"

516
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,879
So, I said...
And then this is...

517
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,299
This is part of what I'm trying
to say about getting back from it.

518
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,423
I, I said,
"comedy is tragedy plus time."

519
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,797
Tragedy plus time.

520
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,757
See, when...
The night Lincoln was shot,

521
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,093
you couldn't joke about it.
You couldn't make a joke about that.

522
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,473
You just couldn't do it.

523
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,852
Now time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

524
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,771
See what I mean?
It's tragedy plus time.

525
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,352
CLIFF: Okay. We're out.

526
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,687
That's it? So fast?

527
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,818
I shot up 10 rolls on
your first question.

528
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,946
All right, I gotta...
I gotta get to CBS Anyway.

529
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,226
Remember where we were.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

530
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
Just... Just remember
what I was saying.

531
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,288
- What do you think? All right?
- Excellent.

532
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,866
- Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

533
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,041
I'm gonna do it more...

534
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,618
I'm gonna be more relaxed
tomorrow, you know?

535
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,328
I'm gonna do that tragedy stuff.
I got good stuff on that.

536
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,084
Yeah, this is Halley Reed
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.

537
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,756
Listen, would you...
Would you excuse me one second?

538
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,750
Listen, I know I told
you this before,

539
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,927
but if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

540
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,563
Wouldn't you rather
leave it to science?

541
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,089
- That's okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
- Will you listen?

542
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,052
Will you listen? I'm offering you my heart.
You're squashing it. Come on.

543
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,852
When are you gonna quit
this organization, come work for me?

544
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,431
Oh, you'd fire me.
I'm much too opinionated.

545
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,857
No, no, no.

546
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,525
- That's okay. I'll wait.
- Listen, I like...

547
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,318
I like mental stimulation.

548
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,987
You tried shock therapy?

549
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,782
That's good, that's funny.
That's very good.

550
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,357
Listen, Lester.
I'm sorry, but we've got...

551
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,987
OK, I'll be...
I'll be right with you.

552
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,535
Wait in the car for me.
Wait in the car.

553
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,827
Arthur, wait in the car.

554
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,246
- Would you please come?
- Yes.

555
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,073
- You promise?
- Wait in the car. Wait in the car.

556
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,373
Yes. I... I was holding

557
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,998
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.
It's Halley Reed.

558
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:54,852
What do you think?

559
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,288
Why don't you come with me
down to Barbados?

560
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,499
We'll swim, you know,
we'll get some sun...

561
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,254
Sorry. I freckle.

562
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,882
That's my best shot.
I can't do any better than that.

563
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,178
(STAMMERING)
That's okay. I'll wait.

564
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,346
Okay. Look, think about it, okay?

565
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,595
Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

566
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,684
Oh.

567
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,227
Yeah. It's Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

568
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,691
Excuse...

569
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,771
Okay.

570
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,357
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met.

571
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,612
Hi. I'm Halley Reed.

572
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,284
I'm one of the associate producers.

573
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,656
I'm Clifford Stern.

574
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,205
Can I ask you the same
question that I asked the producer?

575
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,032
What do you bother
with this guy for?

576
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,368
I mean, he's, you know,
he's such a pompous bore,

577
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,704
- and your show does such great profiles.
- Well, listen,

578
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,163
I'll tell you just
between you and me.

579
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,214
I wanted to do
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

580
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,382
That's perfect.

581
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,552
They like to mix it up.
They like a little variety.

582
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503
After all, he is an
American phenomenon.

583
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,180
Yeah, but so is acid rain.

584
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,223
Boy, you really don't
like him, do you?

585
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,926
I love him like a brother.

586
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,352
David Greenglass.

587
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,896
So, why... Why are
you doing this show?

588
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,895
It's very unusual for them to bring
in an outside person like this.

589
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,648
Well, yes, I know. I'm... I'm
doing it strictly for the money.

590
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,247
I wanna, you know... I'm trying to
make my own documentary on...

591
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm doing a profile on a guy

592
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,158
who would be absolutely
perfect for your show.

593
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,951
- He would be worthy.
- Yeah, who's that?

594
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,655
His name is Louis Levy.
Do, do, do you have

595
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,073
a little time?

596
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,251
<i>Now, the unique thing that happened</i>

597
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,913
<i>to the early Israelites was</i>

598
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,499
<i>that they conceive a god that,
that cares.</i>

599
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,302
<i>He cares, but at the same time,</i>

600
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,138
<i>he also demands</i>

601
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,887
<i>that you behave morally.</i>

602
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,476
<i>But here comes the paradox.</i>

603
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,771
<i>What's one of the first things
that, that God asks?</i>

604
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,733
<i>That God asks Abraham</i>

605
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:44,028
<i>to sacrifice his only son,</i>

606
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,109
<i>his beloved son to him.</i>

607
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,737
<i>In other words, in spite
of millennia of efforts,</i>

608
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,070
<i>we have not succeeded to create</i>

609
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,702
<i>a really and entirely</i>

610
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,579
<i>loving image of God.</i>

611
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,829
<i>This was beyond our
capacity to imagine.</i>

612
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,628
Boy, he's really interesting.

613
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,424
I know.
This is a fascinating guy.

614
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,797
He could be wonderful
for the series.

615
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,470
Well, that would be great.
You want to dump Lester and do him?

616
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,594
'Cause I would love to...
You know, we could scrap Lester...

617
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,970
We can't do...
We can't dump Lester,

618
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,802
but I could talk them into
a little financing for you.

619
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,308
And if this, you know,
if all this comes together right,

620
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,435

For me to get something on your series

answer that satisfactorily?

turn to but a brother?

she won't listen to reason.

764
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,162
I even toyed with the idea of
telling everything to Miriam,

765
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,740
but she'd never be
able to live with it.

766
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,835
Add to that, her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

767
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,037
Not that I stole, but I...

768
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,588
I was indiscreet and

769
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,716
if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

770

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,103
I don't know.
Jack, I don't know.

779
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,530
Well...

780
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,033
Christ, Jack,
what are you suggesting?

781
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,490
What did you call me for?

782
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,198
I don't know. I... I hoped

783
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,749
you'd have more experience
with something like this.

784
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,711
You called me because you
needed some dirty work done.

785
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,334
That's all you ever call for.

786
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,751
Look how bitter you are.

787
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,592
You've staked me plenty of times.

788
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,891
I don't forget my obligations.

789
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,430
Threatening her would
only make it worse, Jack.

790
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,975
Okay. Forget about it.

791
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,351
What do you want me to say?

792
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,524
How the hell can I forget about it?

793
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,067
I'm fighting for my life.

794
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,979
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

795
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,026
That's what I'm saying, Judah.

796
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,574
If the woman won't
listen to reason,

797
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,322
then you go on to the next step.

798
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,612
What, threats? Violence?

799
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,117
What are we talking about here?

800
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,573
She can be gotten rid of.

801
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,124
I mean, I know a lot of people.

802
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,701
Money will buy whatever's necessary.

803
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,144
I'm not even going to comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

804
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,464
Well, what did you want me
to do when you called me?

805
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,004
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

806
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,304
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam, now. She's...

807
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,804
She's talking financial doings.

808
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,970
I'm out of ideas.

809
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,687
I don't know what I expected from you,
Jack, but maybe some help.

810
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,358
You know, you're not aware

811
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,981
of what goes on in this world.

812
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,653
I mean, you sit up here
with your four acres

813
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,402
- don't give me any of that stuff.
- ...and your country club

814
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,733
- I don't want to hear about my success.
- ...and your rich friends and

815
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,783
out there in the real world,

816
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,953
- it's a whole different story.
- Come on.

817
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,826
I've met a lot of characters
from when I had the restaurant...

818
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,824
I know you have.
I've heard these stories before.

819
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,959
From 7th Avenue,
from Atlantic City,

820
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,129
and I'm not so high-class that I can
avoid looking at realities.

821
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,922
I can't afford to be aloof.

822
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,634
And you come to me
with a hell of a problem,

823
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,552
and, uh, then you
get high-handed on me.

824
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,969
Jack, I don't mean
to be high-handed.

825
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,088
I haven't been sleeping nights.
I'm irritable, okay?

826
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,889
- Okay. Okay. Forget I said anything.
- Okay.

827
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,146
Now let me just get
something straight here.

828
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,188
Am I understanding you right?
I mean...

829
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,900
Are you suggesting
getting rid of her?

830
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,078
You won't be involved.

831
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,989
But I'll need some cash.

832
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,499
What will they do?

833
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,214
What'll they do?
They'll handle it.

834
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,007
I can't believe I'm talking
about a human being.

835
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,215
Jack, she's not an...
An insect.

836
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,844
You don't just step on her.

837
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,681
I know.

838
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,808
Playing hardball was
never your game.

839
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,352
You never liked to get
your hands dirty.

840
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,059
But apparently this
woman is for real,

841
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
and this thing isn't
just gonna go away.

842
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,649
I can't do it.

843
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,198
I can't think that way.

844
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,405
No.

845
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,282
Mmm-mmm.

anything about it.</i>

to her ankles with soft catgut.</i>

851

That's a horrible word.</i>

852

<i>Look, get the angle on this.</i>

853
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,229
<i>She disappears,
two weeks, maybe three,</i>

854
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,556
<i>then up she pops,</i>

855

<i>none of this stuff on her anymore.</i>

856

<i>No marks. A suicide.</i>

857
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,403
<i>Now, isn't that beautiful?</i>

858
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,901
<i>It's loathsome.
Now be sure no one sees you.</i>

859
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,233

Oh, listen, we should get back.

862
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,281
Lester's going to be
leaving the hotel soon.

863
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,741
It's okay. We'll make it.

864
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,077
We've been shooting Lester all week.
I'm tired of it, you know.

865
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,753
We... We'll catch him in time.

866
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,830
I never should have
told you my weakness

867
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,836
is going to the movies
in the daytime.

Yeah, that's what you said yesterday.
We were late then, too.

871
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,176
We weren't late.
We didn't miss anything. Here.

872
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,556

I brought you a present.

few remaining teeth.

You said you were bored
with the bicycle.

I'm afraid you're gonna find
this just as boring, though.

00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,426
Well, I think you're in
great shape already.

889

Yeah, for a man my age.

- Thank you.

Oh, it's great to see you enjoy yourself.
You've been so depressed lately.

I just... I just wanted, you know...

1403

Tonight was a lot of fun.

1404
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,914
Wasn't Lester so silly?

1405
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,879
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

1406

if you can handle it.

(STUTTERING) Okay. Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1415
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,220

to make his move. I can see it.

1416
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,094
And he, he wants it just
for conquest. I can tell.

1417
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,642
You know, it's so shallow
and I'm crazy about her.

1418
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,186
You know, and how can I compete
with the guy because he's rich

1419
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,222
- and he's famous, he's successful.
- Oh, come on,

1420
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,107
he's no competition for you.

1421

Oh, God bless you for saying
that, sweetheart, really.

You know, but you'll find
as you go through life

He's a wonderful guy.

1427
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,956
The poor guy called me last night.
He's going blind.

1428
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,749
He's got a terrible eye disease

1429
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,042
and he's losing his sight.

1430
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,758
He's gonna be blind in
another few months.

1431
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,547
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

1432

JUDAH: All right. Look left.

1433
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,383
Now, straight ahead, Ben.

that I should go to the doctor.

- Yeah.

Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

1442
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, I believe they're windows,

1443
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,169
but I'm not sure it's
the soul they see.

1444
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,588
My mother taught me I have a soul.

1445

And it will live on after
me when I'm gone.

And if you look deeply
enough in my eyes,

you can see it.

01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,958
You're saying you challenge the whole
moral structure of everything?

1540
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,338
What moral structure?

1541
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,258
Is that the kind of nonsense
you use on your pupils?

1542
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,807
Do you not find human impulse
is basically decent?

1543
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,509
It's basically nothing.

1544
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,720
Such a cynic,
my sister, a nihilist.

1545
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,895
Go back to Russia.

1546
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,270
Well, listen.
I happen to agree with May

1547
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,484
when it comes to all
that mumbo-jumbo.

1548
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,651
SOL: How can you say that?

1549
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,571
You come to every seder,
you pray in Hebrew.

1550
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,859
Yes, I'm going through the
motions, just like any ritual.

1551
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,943
It's a habit.

1552
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,747
What are you saying, May? There's no
morality anywhere in the whole world?

1553
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,374
Listen, for those
who want morality, there's morality.

1554
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,706
Nothing's handed down in stones.

1555
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,038
Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

1556
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,044
It's like an, an ear for music
or the talent to draw.

1557
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,672
He believes, and you can
use logic on him all day long,

1558
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,843
and he still believes.

1559
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,466
Must everything be logical?

1560
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,005
If a man

1561
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,349
commits a crime, if he...

1562
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,268
If he kills.

1563
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,101
Then one way or another,
he will be punished.

1564
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,773
If he's caught, Sol.

1565
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,773
If he's not caught, that which
originates from a black deed

1566
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,274
will blossom in a foul manner.

1567
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,440
Eh, you're relying a little too
heavily on the Bible, Sol.

1568
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,197
No, no, no, no. Whether it's the, uh,
the Old Testament or Shakespeare,

1569
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,619
murder will out.

1570
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,158
Who said anything about murder?

1571
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,739
You did.

1572
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,618
Did I?

1573
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,749
And I say, if he can do
it and get away with it,

1574
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,338
and he chooses not to be
bothered by the ethics,

1575
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:01,669
then he's home free.

1576
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,843
Remember, history is
written by the winners.

1577
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,761
And if the Nazis had won,

1578
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,388
future generations would understand

1579
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,061
the story of World War
ll quite differently.

1580
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
SOL: Your aunt is a
brilliant woman, Judah,

1581
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,974
but she's had a very unhappy life.

1582
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,232
- And if all your faith is wrong, Sol.
- Yeah...

1583
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,939
I mean, just what if, huh?
If, hmm?

1584
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,117
Then I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

1585
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,488
Wait a minute?

1586
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,242
Are you telling me that you
prefer God to the truth?

1587
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,575
If necessary, I will always
choose God over truth.

1588
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,749
I agree with him.

1589
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,247
(ALL CHATTERING)

1590
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,830
I say, what goes around,
comes around.

1591
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,795
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yes.

1592
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,846
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

1593
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,924
- Mrs. Ames is waiting.
- Yeah.

1594
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,684
- Any messages?
- Yeah, you got an odd one.

1595
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:54,143
A Detective O'Donnell called and said he
wanted to talk to you about something.

1596
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,894
Well, I tried to get
him to tell me what,

1597
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,146
but he said he only
wants to talk with you.

1598
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,114
<i>He says, murder, he says</i>

1599
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,739
<i>Every time we kiss,
he says, murder, he says</i>

1600
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,570
<i>Keep it up like this
and that murder he says</i>

1601
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,032
<i>In that impossible tone</i>

1602
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:17,003
<i>Will bring on nobody's
murder but his own</i>

1603
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,298
That was not such a great
movie, but, but, you know, it's fun.

1604
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,375
Yeah, I liked it.

1605
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,964
I think maybe when I'm older
I wanna be an actress.

1606
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,405
I don't want you to be an actress.

1607
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,388
I want you to be on the Supreme Court

1608
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,716
or a doctor or something.

1609
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,427
You know, show business
is, is dog eat dog.

1610
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
It's worse than dog eat dog.

1611
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,309
It's, it's dog doesn't return
other dog's phone calls.

1612
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,606
You know, which is terrible.

1613
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,730
Which reminds me,
I should really check my service.

1614
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,688
Although I don't know why. I haven't had
a message in seven years, you know?

1615
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,023
I call up and I hear the girls
on the other end giggling.

1616
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,325
- Oh, how's Halley?
- She's great.

1617
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,572
I'm going to make my move there,

1618
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:49,732
- I think, you know?
- Yeah.

1619
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,487
But I have this ethical dilemma
'cause I'm married.

1620
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,074
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't know about that.

1621
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,375
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

1622
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,537
Yeah, my, my heart says one thing,
my head says something else, you know?

1623
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,043
Very, very hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

1624
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,670
Let me teach you that, you know.

1625
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,501
In my case,
they're not even friendly.

1626
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,711
Yes?

1627
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,049
Really?

1628
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,098
No.

1629
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,151
Okay, thank you.

1630
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,065
What's wrong?

1631
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,623
Professor Levy committed suicide.

1632
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,496
<i>But we must always remember that we,</i>

1633
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,714
<i>when we are born,</i>

1634
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,633
<i>we need a great deal of love</i>

1635
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,259
<i>in order to persuade
us to stay in life.</i>

1636
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,640
<i>Once we get that love...</i>

1637
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,399
- (PHONE RINGS)
<i>- ...it usually lasts us.</i>

1638
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:57,095
<i>But the universe is a
pretty cold place.</i>

1639
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:00,603
<i>It's we who invest it
with our feelings.</i>

1640
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,484
<i>And under certain conditions,</i>

1641
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,148
<i>we feel</i>

1642
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,488
<i>that the thing isn't
worth it anymore.</i>

1643
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,740
HALLEY: I came as soon as I heard.

1644
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,738
I... I thought
you might not want to be alone.

1645
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,785
Oh, God.
It's been terrible, you know.

1646
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,115
(STAMMERING) I called...
The guy was not sick at all.

1647
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,292
And he left a note, he left a
simple, little note that said,

1648
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,743
"I've gone out the window."

1649
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,750
I mean, this is a major intellectual,
and, and this is his note.

1650
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,910
"I've gone out the window."

1651
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,172
I mean, what the hell
does that mean, you know?

1652
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,768
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

1653
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,633
What... Did he...
Did he have family or anything?

1654
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,840
No. You know, they were
all killed in the war.

1655
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,140
That's what's so
strange about this.

1656
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,685
He... He's seen the worst
side of life his whole life.

1657
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,309
He always was affirmative,
always said yes to life. Yes, yes.

1658
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,604
Now, today he said, "no."

1659
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,273
Boy, can you imagine his students?

1660
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,272
Imagine how shattered
they're gonna be?

1661
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,773
Listen, I don't know
from suicide, you know.

1662
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,776
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

1663
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,357
You know, everyone was too unhappy.

1664
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,863
Boy, you know,
this will put a damper on the show.

1665
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,696
Well, I got 600,000
feet of film on this guy,

1666
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,781
and he's telling how great
life is and everything.

1667
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,036
And now, you know.

1668
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,495
You know, what am I gonna do?
I'll...

1669
01:17:01,521 --> 01:17:03,190
I'll cut it up and make
it into guitar picks.

1670
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:06,373
HALLEY: I'm just thinking, I mean,
no matter how elaborate

1671
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,503
a philosophical
system you work out,

1672
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,084
in the end

1673
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,549
it's, it's gotta be incomplete.

1674
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,130
I've been so...

1675
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,307
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1676
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,350
- Oh, God. I understand.
- It's really, really... It's gonna be...

1677
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,472
It's gonna be such a blow.

1678
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,395
I just thought you might
want some company.

1679
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:25,941
No, don't do that.

1680
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,146
It's something that I wanted
to do now for, for weeks.

1681
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,149
- I just want you to know that.
- You're married.

1682
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:36,528
Yes, I'm married, but, you know,
that's not going to last.

1683
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,078
I mean, you know...

1684
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,782
Well, you know,
I'm... I'm not ready.

1685
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,620
Is there something you're
not telling me? I mean...

1686
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,000
No.

1687
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,372
Is there anybody else?

1688
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,708
I mean, I just don't

unsettled about my career.

1707

Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

1710
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,162
The record shows that
she phoned you here

1711
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,664
- and at your home a number of times.
- Mmm-hmm.

1712
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,704
She was worried about her eyes.

1713
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,039
What was she suffering from?

1714
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,295
Nothing serious, I mean, she, um,

1715
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,427
she had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

1716
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,631
And I could never find anything
very wrong with her, but, uh...

1717
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,967
And I told her that, you know, it was
just a common occurrence.

1718
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,597
She was a hypochondriac?

1719
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,147
No, no. I wouldn't say that,
but she was concerned.

1720
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,892
And there's nothing she ever said

1721
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,735
that you think might be
relevant to the case?

1722
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,858
Uh, personal life, friends?

1723
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,818
No, not really.

1724
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,483
How did she come to you?

1725
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,446
You know, I honestly can't remember.

1726
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,409
Possibly another patient.

1727

she phoned me a lot.

and now I'm gonna pay.

make a clean breast of it to the police.

1743
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,496
I want this off my mind.

1744
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,833
Listen to me, Judah,
I'm in this with you.

1745
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,213
I helped you out
and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

ideas about confessing

and you may not care
whether you drag me down with you.

1748
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,758
But I'm telling you right now,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1749
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,601
What the hell is that,
Jack, a threat?

1750
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,929
Just pull yourself together and
be a man. You're in the clear.

1751

What, are you gonna have me
rubbed out, too?

you meant by that remark,

1754
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,313
"You won't let it happen."
What did you mean by that?

1755
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,861
You're my brother. You've helped me
out in the past, financially.

Fine. I did you a favor
when you needed it, all right?

Now all of a sudden
you get this urge to confess?

1758
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,910
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress.

1759
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,363
Not about this. This is murder.

1760

You paid for it, I engineered it,

1761
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:11,375
and it's over, all right?
So forget about it!

Judah, will you shut up already?

1766
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,757
Or what? You'll have your
friends shut me up?

he, he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

Little sparks of his
religious background,

2061
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,404
which he'd rejected

2062
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,243
are suddenly stirred up.

2063
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,377
He hears his father's voice.

2064

He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

2065
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,884
Suddenly, it's not an
empty universe at all,

2066
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,337
but a just and moral one,

2067
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,264
and he's violated it.

2068
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:46,509
Now, he's panic-stricken.

2069
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,474
He's on the verge of
a mental collapse,

2070
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,934
an inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

2071
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,146
And then one morning,

2072
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,232
he awakens

2073
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,406
and the sun is shining
and his family is around him.

2074
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:08,991
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

2075
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,036
He takes his family on
a vacation to Europe,

2076
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,840
and as the months pass
he finds he's not punished.

2077
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,417
In fact, he prospers.

2078
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,841
The killing gets attributed
to another person,

2079
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,014
a drifter who has a number of
other murders to his credit.

2080
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:28,218
So, I mean, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

2081
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,179
Now he's soot-free.

2082
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,979
His life is completely
back to normal.

2083
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:40,276
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

2084
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,987
Uh, yes, but can he
ever really go back?

2085
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,539
Well, people carry sins
around with them.

2086
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:53,164
I mean, oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment,

2087
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,915
but it passes.

2088
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,547
And with time, it all fades.

2089
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,501
Yeah. But, but, so then, you know,

2090
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:05,259
then, then his worst...
His worst beliefs are realized.

2091
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,966
Well, I said it was a
chilling story, didn't I?

2092
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:11,223
I don't know.

2093
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,976
It... It'd be... I think it'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

2094
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,729
You know, it's... Very few
guys could actually live,

2095
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:19,186
you know, to live with something
like that on their conscience.

2096
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,396
What do you mean? People carry
awful deeds around with them.

2097
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,153
What do you expect him
to do, turn himself in?

2098
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,822
I mean, this is reality.

2099
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,195
In reality, we, we rationalize.

2100
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:32,452
We deny or we,
we couldn't go on living.

2101
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:39,414
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

2102
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,422
'Cause then you see, then your
story assumes tragic proportions.

2103
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,924
Because in the absence
of a God or something,

2104
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,098
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.
