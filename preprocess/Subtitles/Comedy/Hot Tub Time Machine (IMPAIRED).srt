00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:01,635
- I haven't.
- Maybe not her,

627
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:04,205
but I know that you were here.

628
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:06,831
You know what's going on here,
don't you, old man?

629
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,136
Yes, I do.

630
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:11,042
Your tub is on the fritz.
It'd behoove you to fix it.

631
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:12,136
(HOT TUB STARTING UP)

632
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:13,442
What?

633
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:15,106
NICK: It's working.

634
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,417
- Damn. I think it's still broke.
- ADAM: Shit.

635
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,214
JACOB: Where'd he go?

636
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:26,123
That motherfucker's in on it, man.

637
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:29,095
What was all that cryptic shit he was
saying about not changing one little thing?

638
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:31,098
I know exactly what he meant.
He was talking about the butterfly effect.

639
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,258
That was a great fucking movie.

640
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,989
One little change has a ripple effect
and it affects everything else.

641
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:38,989
Like, a butterfly floats its wings

642
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,652
and Tokyo explodes,
or there's a tsunami in, like, somewhere.

643
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:46,788
Dude, yes, exactly. Or you step on a bug
and the fucking Internet's never invented.

644
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:49,367
Then you have to talk to girls
with your mouth.

645
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:53,165
Yeah. I was more concerned about bigger
consequences, like me not being born.

646
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:54,705
Oh, yeah. No, I don't care about that.

647
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:57,173
The point is, what did we do 20 years ago?

648
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:01,406
Let's figure it out right now.
We gotta do the exact same thing.

649
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,174
- I had that gig.
- That's right.

650
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:06,445
You got up on stage
and you were wildly mediocre.

651
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:07,883
And that led to nothing of a career.

652
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:10,477
Okay, first of all, fuck you, motherfucker!

653
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:11,681
I could have had a career,

654
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,690
but I got married
and I went a different way.

655
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,190
Which way is that? The way that sucked?

656
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:16,659
Didn't you also bang that groupie?

657
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:18,423
- What was her name?
- Tara.

658
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,226
You banged her.
You got to go do that again.

659
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,632
I did do that. But, fuck, no, I'm married!

660
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,494
I can't go around banging girls in hot tubs.

661
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,972
Nick, it's 1986. You can't cheat
on someone you don't know yet.

662
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:32,305
You haven't even met Courtney.

663
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,572
Lucifer, itinerary please.

664
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,647
Uh... Nothing really happened.

665
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:37,510
I actually fucked a chick, too.
So I'll just do that.

666
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,811
I seem to remember
you getting your ass whooped.

667
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:40,942
(LAUGHING)

668
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:42,577
ADAM: Oh, yeah.
NICK: That's right.

669
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,486
That ski patrol dude
pummeled you like it was his job.

670
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,786
- Yeah, no. I don't remember it that way.
- I do.

671
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,361
Yeah. He fucked you up.
You cried and peed.

672
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:53,431
Fuck this, man! This is fucking bullshit!

673
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,500
Would you just think of somebody
other than yourself, man?

674
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:58,626
- There's four of us.
- It's the fucking '80s, guys!

675
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,433
Let's do what we wanna do. Free love!

676
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,167
JACOB: That's the '60s, dipshit.

677
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:07,177
No, we had, like, Reagan and AIDS.
Let's get the fuck out of here, okay?

678
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,610
Do the right thing, Violator.

679
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:11,512
God damn it! This is fucking bullshit!

680
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,608
Tonight's the night
you broke up with Jenny Stedmeyer.

681
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,879
- Shit.
- LOU: Yeah, you got stabbed

682
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:16,921
in the fucking eyeball tonight!

683
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,683
Hey, man, do you want backup?

684
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,258
I can't, the butterflies won't let me.

685
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,725
- JENNY: Yo, Adam? You guys in there?
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)

686
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:23,988
ADAM: Oh, shit.

687
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:28,957
There you are. Hey!

688
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:31,569
How come you guys didn't meet us
at the chair lift this morning?

689
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,796
You were going to show me some moves.

690
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:35,305
Hi, baby. I missed you.

691
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:39,401
I must have forgot.

692
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,502
Perv. That's from Mandy.

693
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,039
- Hey, new guy. What's up?
- Hey.

694
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,964
So we're in 214. I'm gonna go get ready.

695
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,329
- Okay.
- Meet me in my room, okay?

696
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,835
- Okay.
- Okay.

697
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:51,639
Love the PJs, Nick. You look hot.

698
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:54,973
Poison's tonight.

699
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:56,168
Wow!

700
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,075
I don't remember her
being that fucking beautiful.

701
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,408
And tight.

702
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:01,744
She's so tight.

703
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,874
She's really fucking tight!

704
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:04,315
She's the great white buffalo, man.

705
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:05,647
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.

706
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:07,346
Don't start that.

707
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:08,889
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.

708
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,015
Why did I ever break up with her?
Why would I break up with her?

709
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,924
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
'Cause you have to do it again. Right?

710
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,621
Right, right, right.

711
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,992
JACOB: All right.
We're all gonna meet back here.

712
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:19,157
Hopefully that hot tub's fixed
and we can get the fuck out of here.

713
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,734
Okay, let's party like it's 1986.

714

All right. On three?

- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

716
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:24,867
- Hot tub time machine!
- Wait...

717
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:25,962
What are we... What's the...

718
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:27,041
Who said, "Hot tub time machine?"

719
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:28,302
We didn't tell you about
the new thing, with our hands?

720
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,877
- No.
- On three, we always...

721
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,275
From now on, we're gonna say,
"Hot tub time machine."

722
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,607
I told you, I think that's fucking stupid.

723
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:33,681
You were in the bathroom.

724
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:34,749
No, but this is a real
bonding event for us.

725
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,839
This doesn't happen all the time.

726
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:37,316
- Come on.
- I'm telling you, it's stupid.

727
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:38,613
- Do it once.
- Do what you want to do.

728
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
It would have been 3-to-1 anyway.

729
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,250
ALL: One, two, three...

730
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,414
...hot tub time machine!

731
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:43,650
It felt good. Admit it.

00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:56,415
Hey!

734
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,452
Let's get this party started!

735
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:02,217
Who is carrying me home tonight?

736

Mom?

- Sweet fucking Lord.
- Kelly.

738

- Hey, bro, Nicholas.
- Hey, girl.

- Who's the geek?
- He's your son.

- He doesn't look cool.
- LOU: He's not that cool.

Hey, Kelly.

Lou Dorchen. Yeah...

750

- You don't remember this?
- I don't remember everything.

751

What the fuck, man?
This is freaking me the fuck out.

752

You freak out every time
you leave the basement.

753
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:34,717
All right, kiddies, get your snow boots on

754
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,089
because tonight
there is gonna be a blizzard.

Really? It looked pretty clear out.

756

Anybody wanna go for a little sleigh ride?

You can't do cocaine!
It's so unhealthy for you.

758
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:47,133
- Kelly, in public?
- Whatever.

759
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:48,830
I'm gonna go to a party
at the ski patrol house,

760
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:52,932
I'm gonna find a sexy instructor
and I'm gonna wax his fucking pole.

761
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:55,409
Later, homos. Don't drink my fucking drink.

762
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,571
Ugh!

763
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:58,882
Hey, Adam?

764
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:02,316
What she means is that she works
at the ski rental place, right?

765
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,580
And that's her job, is cleaning the poles.

766
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:07,156
I could be off, but I think
it's in reference to blowing a dude.

767
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:10,227
Thank you, Nick. But that's...
You don't need to...

768
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,956
Or fucking a dude. Because the wax,
it can be interpreted either way.

769
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,430
She was a free spirit, you know?

770
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:20,334
Or maybe she's the pole
and there's two dudes that she's waxing.

771
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:23,031
Let's just get it done, man. Come on.

- What?

773
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,943
Did my mom, like,
sleep with a bunch of dudes?

774
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:29,012
I don't know. Shut up.

775
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:30,478
JACOB: But she seems kind of slutty, right?

776
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:32,845
Does she seem that way to you?

777
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,747
It's just, she never told me who my dad is.

778
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,285
It could be any one of these guys.

Hmm...

1376
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:22,265
I'll tell you something
I haven't told somebody for a long time.

1377
00:59:22,603 --> 00:59:23,729
When I was a kid,

1378
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:27,000
every Friday night, my father
used to take my sister Kelly and me

1379
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:30,702
to this place called Flatirons
for steak sandwiches.

1380
00:59:30,811 --> 00:59:31,835
It was a family tradition.

1381
00:59:31,946 --> 00:59:33,709
That's sometimes a good thing.

1382
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:36,405
But one year, we saw this commercial

1383
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:39,644
for this place called
The Enchanted Forest of Pizza.

1384
00:59:40,354 --> 00:59:43,949
So the next Friday,
my dad's loading us up into the car.

1385
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:47,150
We're like, "Daddy, we want to go
to The Enchanted Forest of Pizza."

1386
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,956
And he's like,
"What are you talking about?

1387
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:51,031
"We always go for steak sandwiches."

1388
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:52,462
But we just stay at him

1389
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,726
and we're whining, and we're badgering,
and finally he relents.

1390
00:59:55,936 --> 00:59:57,369
Nice. So, you win.

1391
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:00,099

Before he died,
he looked at me and he said,

"Adam, you did this."

1396
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:11,682
No, he didn't.

1397
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:13,011
Yes, he did,

1398
01:00:13,454 --> 01:00:14,478
with his eyes.

1399
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:17,284

that's what he meant with his eyes.

the guilt of this in very different ways.

She went wild, right?

She didn't want
to have control over anything.

1403

But I vowed to master the chaos,

1404

- to impose order.
- Adam, I really don't think

1405

that you can let a poison pizza
ruin the rest of your life.

1406

You got to embrace the chaos.
You have to.

But seriously, a lot has changed.

2017
01:29:05,447 --> 01:29:09,281
So, whatever happens, stay the fuck calm.

That's incredible.

Yeah, what happened was
a snowplow came along

2025
01:29:31,673 --> 01:29:33,231
and it took my arm right off.

- Yeah. We know...

Mr. Dorchen anticipated
that you might say that,

2035
01:29:53,662 --> 01:29:56,460
so I took the liberty
of printing up some Lougle maps for you.

01:29:56,665 --> 01:29:58,496
- You mean "Google"?

Correct.

Baby, how was your weekend?
I wasn't expecting you today.

01:31:18,447 --> 01:31:21,382
Baby. Baby. I got something to tell you.

I know about what you did

Steve? Our receptionist?

Baby, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

01:31:34,062 --> 01:31:35,654
You think I'm fooling around?

2070
01:31:35,764 --> 01:31:38,494
First of all, I would never screw around.

2071
01:31:38,934 --> 01:31:41,232
And you remember I told you
about that crazy wrong number

01:31:41,336 --> 01:31:42,598
I got when I was nine.

Hey, Mom. I made you a drink.

2084
01:32:06,928 --> 01:32:08,395
Is there alcohol in that?

I'm very happy to be right here
