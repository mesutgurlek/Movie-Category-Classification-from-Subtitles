for your birthday.

guns.

your other presents, too.

in the storeroom,

682
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,459
Well, you told me I have a plethora,

and I just would like to know
if you know what a plethora is.

what it means to have a plethora.

691

692

693
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,035
Could it be because you are turning 40 today?

No.

695

to sleep in her cell instead of with you?

I have seen all of your films,

Little Neddy Knickers.

Well, that was a long time ago.

876
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,620
It was this man who inspired me
to learn the art of the quick draw.

01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:53,623
I looked up to this man.
I studied his every move.

It was my dream
to be as fast as Ned Nederlander.

I practiced every day for hours and hours.

880

He was a god to me.

But it is nice to meet a fan.
You know, often I think...

883
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,975
Then, I found out about movie tricks.

884
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,311
Trick photography. I was crushed.

885
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,062
I never used trick photography.

886
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:19,816
That is impossible.
No one can be as fast as you appear to be.

887
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,610

It's our only hope.

Sew, very old one. Sew like the wind.

984
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,299
Okay, dig here.

01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,220
Now they're over there, El Guapo.

Now they're over there.

992

Shoot them!

993
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,275
They're over there.

994
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,948
Now they're over here.

995
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,832
EL GUAPO: What the hell
is happening around here?

996
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,168
Shoot, shoot!

997
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:13,714
JEFE: Now they're over there,
on top of the church.

998
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:17,343
El Guapo, they are everywhere.

999
01:33:18,386 --> 01:33:19,512
They're over there, too.

You traitors!

1004
01:33:53,254 --> 01:33:55,256
I'm still here, El Guapo.

1005
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:14,066
You stupid horse!

1006
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:03,407
That was some good trick.

1007
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:09,914
Come closer. I have something to tell you.

1011
01:35:32,353 --> 01:35:34,814
I'm gonna miss you, senor Dusty.

1012

I'm gonna miss you, too, Pablo.

Here, I want you to have my watch.

I wanna go with you.

1015
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:05,177
No, Pablo, there's still much to be done here.
Your village needs you.

1016
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,513
And your family needs you.

1017
01:36:08,556 --> 01:36:10,558
We are men without homes.

1018
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,352
We were meant to wander.

1019
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,023
You will always have a home
here with us in Santa Poco.

1020
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:22,778
Goodbye, Dusty.

You have done what you said you would do.

1022

Long will the memory of the Three Amigos
live in the hearts of the people of Santa P000.

1023
01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:53,142
I'll come back one day.

you will find us.
