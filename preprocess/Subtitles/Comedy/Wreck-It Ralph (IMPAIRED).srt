00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,569
- Take it easy, big boy!
- Stay away from me!

807
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,691
He's getting away!

808
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,161
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

813
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,183
I got to get my medal back.

814
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,806
The pot goes to the winning racer!

815
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,018
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

817
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,538
Hello, fellow racers!

818
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,582
It's that little crumb snatcher.

819
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,373
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

820
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,038
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

821
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,049
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

822
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,217
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

823
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,544
I built it myself.

824
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,260
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

825
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,507
Check her out.

(HONKING)

827
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,191
Oh, Vanellope, it's so... You.

(CHUCKLING SMUGLY)

829
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,271
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

830
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,988
Oh, no, I don't,

831
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,862
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

832
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,118
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

833
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,121
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

834
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,708
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

835
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

836
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,709
To protect us. Say I'm you.

837
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,545
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

838
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,218
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

839
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,300
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

840
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,885
I'm (STAMMERING) glitching!

841
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,350
(GASPS) - Hey!
- See?

842
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,473
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

843
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,563
Oh, no! I (STAMMERS) glitched, too!

844
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,936
Uncool.

845
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,773
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

846
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,312
Please!

847
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,740
I just want to race like you guys.

848
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,281
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

849
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,446
And that's all you'll ever be!

850
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,116
Hey! Leave her alone!

Scram, you rotten little cavities!

855
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,130
Before I throw you in the mud!

856
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,355
What are you looking at?

857
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,934
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

858
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,313
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

859
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,069
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

860
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,492
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

861
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,535
Coin, medal, whatever.

862
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,326
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

863
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,745
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

864
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,497
I won it in <i>Hero's Duty.</i>

It's not that kind of duty.

868
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,880
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

869
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,220
in a game called <i>Hero's Doodie!</i>

(LAUGHING)

What did you win the medal for, wiping?

872
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,516
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

873
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,021
- Listen!
- One more, one more.

874
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,524
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

875
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,686
- Say "why."
- Why?

876
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,859
Because it was his doodie!

877
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,778
How dare you insult <i>Hero's Duty?</i>

and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

881
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,947
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

882
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,828
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

883
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,287
I can't help you!

Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

887
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,887
You're never going to break...

Leave me alone.

Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

893
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,062
So here's what I'm thinking.

894
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,445
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

895
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,577
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

896
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,284
You want me to help you?

897
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,749
All you got to do is
break something for me.

898
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,581
Come on. What do you say, friend?

899
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,287
We are not friends.

900
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,458
Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun.

901
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,968
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

902
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,466
Ah. Come on, chumbo.

903
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,049
Ralph, my man. My main man.

Hey!

905
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,141
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

906
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,732
(GRUNTS) You better win.

907
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,229
Well, I'll say this much,

908
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,781
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

909
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,533
There's the shuttle.

910
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
Is he in there?

911
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,283
Nope. Lucky for him.

912
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,957
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

913
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,622
No Cy-Bug, either.

914
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,422
Got to find it before it
lays its filthy eggs.

915
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,010
It came this way,

916
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,755
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

917
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,306
are jamming my sensor.

918
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,808
Can't get a read on it.

919
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,219
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

920
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,474
Why did he go AWOL?

921
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,097
I wish I knew, ma'am.

922
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,933
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

923
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,644
Going on about cake and medals...

924
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,696
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

925
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,027
"Go Turbo"?

That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

928
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,412
<i>Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.</i>

<i>- And Turbo...
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

<i>- He loved the attention.
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

<i>So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in</i>

932
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,254
<i>and stole Turbo's thunder...</i>

933
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,836
New game. All right!

934
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,845
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

935
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,350
<i>So jealous that
he abandoned his game</i>

936
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,014
<i>and tried to take over the new one.</i>

in this game? Aw, come on!

Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

I know, right?

947
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,627
That's why I have to get Ralph home

948
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,835
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

There you are. Hello!

1286
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,845
- You!
- I come alone, unarmed.

1287
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,389
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1288
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,387
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1289
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,513
(SHUDDERING)

1290
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,269
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1291
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,393
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1292
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,905
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1293
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,323
(GASPS)
- What do you want, Candy?

1294
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,901
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1295
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,953
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1296
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,037
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1297
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,076
My medal. How did you...

1298
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,873
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1299

01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,708
Whoa.

1301
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,840
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1302
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,379
About what?

1303
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,432
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1304
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,096
about being a king is?

1305
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,895
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1306
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,142
Get to the point.

1307
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,436
Point being, I need your help.

1308
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:17,146
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1309
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,318
Why are you people so against her?

1310
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,576
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1311
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,448
If Vanellope wins that race

1312
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,618
<i>she'll be added to the race roster.</i>

1313
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,163
<i>Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.</i>

1314
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,037
<i>And when they see her glitching</i>

<i>and twitching and just being herself,</i>

1316
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,754
<i>they'll think our game is broken.</i>

1317
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,360
<i>We'll be put out of order for good.</i>

(SCREAMS) No!

1324
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,903
...she'll die with it.

1325
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,072
You don't know that will happen.

1326
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,403
The gamers could love her.

1327
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,618
And if they don't?

1328
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,918
I know it's tough,

1329
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,217
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1330
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:27,007
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1331
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,511
So can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1332
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,435
Very good.

1333
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,026
I'll give you two some time alone.

Did you miss me?

1337
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,102
Yeah... Uh... Can we talk for a second?

1338
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,262
Wait. First, kneel down.

1339
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,690
- What? No, we really...
- Will you just do it?

1340
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,558
Okay.

1341
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,733
- Now, close your eyes.
- Vanellope...

1342
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,155
Shush! Close them!

01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,323
Okay. Open them up.

Turn it over.

1347
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,167
I made it for you.

1348
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,332
Just in case we don't win.

1349
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,801
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1350
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:45,923
we're not going to win.

1351
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,717
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1352
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:53,719
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1354
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,014
Um...

1355
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,813
- I've been thinking.
- That's dangerous.

1356
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,066
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1357
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,614
(LAUGHS) That's not very funny, Ralph.

1358

No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

to build the car and everything...

1360

Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

What?

1365
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,505
Why would you...

1366
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,384
Wait a minute.

1367
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,961
No!

Where did you get this?

Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1370

- King Candy?
- Yeah.

No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1376
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,856
You're a rat!

1377
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,397
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1378
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,232
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1379
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,075
Put me down! Let me go!

1380
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,318
No, you listen to me.

1381

Do you know what's going to happen

when the players see you glitching?

1383

They'll think the game's broken.

I don't care! You're a liar!

1385
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,913
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1386
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:00,994
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1387
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,124
I'm not listening to you!

1388
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,002
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!
