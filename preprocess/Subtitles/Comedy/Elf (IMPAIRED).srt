Oh, hello.

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,230
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,999
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,434
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,237
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,806
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,841
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,546
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:51,951
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,520
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,221
While, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,926
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,561
You can bake cookies

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,395
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,498
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,967
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,736
[Screaming] I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,272
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,541
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,911
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,782
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,012
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,521
I-It's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,389
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,324
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,460
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,429
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,296
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,632
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:49,275
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,078
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,114
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,016
That's where our story begins.

35

Wow!

Here we are.

We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

Here we are.

There you are.

48
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,408
It's time to go to sleep.

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,935
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

50
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,211
Merry Christmas, my angel.

[Cheering music playing]

All right, all right.

56
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,530
We've had another very successful
year.

[Cheering]

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,300
So, after all that hard work,

59
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,503
It's time to start preparations

60
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,138
For next Christmas!

Is that?

[Elves:] Wow...

64
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,556
[Male elf:] A baby...

65
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,566
[Elf:] "little buddy diapers."

66
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,701
His name is buddy. He must've...

67
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,070
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

68
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,571
What do we do?

69
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,741
[Papa Elf:] So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

70
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,843
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

71
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,177
Santa's a... a pushover.

72
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,380
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,347
Who had always wanted a child?

74
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,883
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

75
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,721
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,355
Santa.

77
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,592
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

78
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,861
I was his adopted father.

79
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,596
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

80
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,800
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

81

Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,612
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

86
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,646
Shall we?

87
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,313
Number one.

88
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,283
"Treat every day like Christmas."

89
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,084
Number two.

"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

"The best way to spread Christmas

Is singing loud for all to hear."

00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,598
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

95
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,935
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

before.

I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

102
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,221
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

knows that.

Don't believe in Santa Claus.

Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

Well, there's a rumor floating around

That, uh, that the parents do it.

That's... that's ridiculous.

all in one night.

What about Santa's cookies?

114

I suppose parents eat them, too?

He's... he's certifiably insane.

Terms with reality,

He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

You know, it's a little
complicated,

00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,081
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

the seven levels

Of the candy cane forest,

787

Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

788
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:33,104
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

789
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,323
Ahh.

spaghetti.

Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

795
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,245
Yes.

796
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,150
You like sugar, huh?

797
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,718
Is there sugar in syrup?

798
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:15,919
Yes.

799
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,187
Then yes.

800
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,690
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

801
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:25,796
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

802
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,466
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

803
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,668
You mean I can stay?

804
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,202
Of course you can. Emily.

805
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,705
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

806
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,340
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

807
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,677
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

808
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,413
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

809
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,211
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

810
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,520
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

811
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,189
Clearly he has some serious issues.

812
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,425
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

813
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,293
Why not? He loves the snow.

814
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,795
He's told me 15 times.

815
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,355
Walter, he's your son.

Did you hear that?

You are so weird.

Dad?

I am not gonna tuck you in.

Fine.

Well, this is really something.

I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

So, did you, um...

850
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,050
Did you sleep okay last night?

851
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,552
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

852
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,851
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

Where did you get all the wood?

Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

breakfast.

So, dad, how many scoops?

00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,887
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

863

So, dad...

864
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,693
I planned out our whole day.

865
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,894
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

866
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,530
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

868
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,934
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

869
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,637
I've got to go to work, buddy.

870
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,872
Oh, and another thing...

871
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,540
If you're going to be staying
here,

872
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,475
You should think about, you know,

873
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,177
Getting rid of the costume.

874
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,545
But I've worn this my whole life.

You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

You wanna make me happy, don't you?

More than anything.

878
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:12,456
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

I see.

892
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,250
And, uh, is this an emergency?

893
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,451
There's a horrible noise

Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

895

It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

It's, uh, it's a radiator,

And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

Yes, it is.

okay?

How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

Believe me, uh,

We're already looking for new
printers.

933

This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

934
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,820
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

in there,

this quarter?

00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,656
Why is your coat so big?

982
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,126
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

983
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,628
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

984
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,363
How was school? Was it fun?

985
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,265
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

986
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,433
Do you have any friends?

987
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,767
Do you have a best friend?

988

Does he have a big coat, too?

989

Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,988
We better get outta here.

996

You know what? We can take 'em.

997
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,827
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

Wow.

Oh, yeah

1009

1010

1011
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,735
Lots of snow and ice everywhere

outside my door

All these things and more

1014
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,245
I wish dad were here.

1015
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:08,545
Why?

1016
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,482
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

1017
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,350
Are you kidding?

1018
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,919
He's the worst dad in the world.

1019
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,254
What do you mean?

1020
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,489
All he does is work.

1021
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,924
Working's fun.

1022
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,959
Not the way he does it.

1023
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:23,994
All he cares about is money.

1024
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,098
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

1025
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,931
Well, he is on the naughty list.

1026
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,307
You like her?

1027
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,298
Like who?

1028
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,311
The girl you're staring at.

1029
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,979
Oh, uh...

1030
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,844
Yeah.

1031
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,285
Why don't you ask her out?

1032
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,286
Out?

1033
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,389
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

1034
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,290
Food?

1035
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,059
Yes, real food, not candy.

1036
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,094
And if she says yes,
you're in.

1037
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,359
It's like a secret code
girls have.

1038
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,968
Well, look who it is.

1039
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,096
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

1040

Oh, uh, this is Michael.

1041
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,468
I'm his brother.

1042
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,478
Hi.

1043
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,314
So, what are you doing here?

1044
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,616
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

1045
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,485
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

1046
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,544
They gave mea restraining
order.

1047
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,625
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

1048
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,561
Ho ho ho!

1049
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,830
But... I really wanted to
see you,

1050
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,901
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

1051
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,371
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

1052
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:45,671
And, um, my tongue swells up.

1053
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,876
So...

1054
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,377
Do you wanna go eat food?

1055
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,354
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

1056
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,355
Mm-hmm.

1057
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:03,657
You know, uh, the code... food.

1058
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,523
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

1059
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,568
Oh, okay. I understand.

1060
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,537
But I'm free on Thursday.

1061
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,006
Thursday! Thursday!

1062
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,175
Come on. That'd be great.

1063
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,176
All right.

1064
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,945
[Buddy:] Was that okay?

1065
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,573
You did great, man.

1066
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,449
What should we put on it
first?

1067
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,151
Lights! Oh, good.

1068
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,185
And then, after that?

1069
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,052
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1070
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,557
What the hell's that?

1071
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,393
[Michael:] A Christmas tree.

1072
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,093
A Christmas tree?

1073
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,221
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1076
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,537
They were just having a
little fun.

1077
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,105
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1078
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,908
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1079
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,909
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1080
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,210
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1081
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,946
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1082
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,416
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1083
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,551
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1084
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,020
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1085
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,622
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1086
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,924
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1088
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,095
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

How are we gonna get the star
on top?

I mean, what are we gonna do?

1092
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,948
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1093
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,473
He's gonna destroy the place.

Why don't you, um...

1095

Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1096
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,790
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1097
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,126
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1098
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,627
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,254
What would you like to do?

1304
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,347
I got some ideas.

1305
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,364
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1306
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,822
Don't look. There you go.

1307
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,437
Well?

1308
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,508
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1309
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,772
[Chuckles] No.

1310
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,080
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1311
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,582
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1312
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:57,320
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1313
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,856
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1314
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:04,527
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1315
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,295
[Laughing] what are you doing?

1316
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:10,066
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1317
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,401
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1318
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,097
Now, look at the size of this one.

1319
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,474
Come with me.

1320
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,447
Watch out. [Tires screech]

1321
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:25,848
Yellow ones don't stop.

1322
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,510
The yellow ones don't stop.

1323
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:38,120
Wow... that's a big one.

1324
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,416
I'm sorry.

1325
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,584
You missed.

1326
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,519
What do you mean I missed?

1327
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,043
You missed.

1328
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,357
[Elevator chimes]

1329
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,142
Miles finch.

1330
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,076
Miles finch.

1331
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,912
Miles finch.

1332
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,885
All right, let's do this.

1333
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,220
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1334
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,621
Yeah.

1335
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,023
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1336
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,893
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1337
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,622
Here you go.

1338
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,597
[Finch:] Great.

1339
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,067
All right... clears throat

1340
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,569
What have you guys got so far?

1341
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,171
Go ahead.

1342
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,205
Uh...

1343
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:59,442
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1344
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,444
We open on a young tomato.

1345
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,579
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1346
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,448
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1347
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,983
No. No tomatoes...

1348
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:08,584
Too vulnerable.

1349
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,453
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1350
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,687
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1351
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:13,556
I told them the very same thing...

1352
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,223
And no farms.

1353
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,692
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1354
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,095
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1355
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:19,962
What about this?

1356
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:22,965
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1357
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:27,595
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1358
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,643
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1359
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,145
I have no time, so, you know,

1360
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,179
If you've got a story here...

1361
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,982
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1362
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:42,051
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1363
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,253
Psyched out of my mind about.

1364
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,455
You know, it's one of those ideas

1365
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,023
Where you're just like, uh...

1366
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:48,958
Yes!

1367
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,193
Whoa! [Chuckling]

1368
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,596
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1369
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,966
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1370
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,968
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1371
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,471
And I don't care who knows it!

1372
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,205
Buddy, not now, uh,

1373
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,608
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1374
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,776
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1375
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,280
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1376
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:16,185
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious, 
my friend.

1377
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,487
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1378
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,157
The story, please. All right, okay.

1379
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,291
[Clears throat]

1380
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,792
So, on the cover above the title...

1381
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,328
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1382
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,497
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1383
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,633
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1384
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,501
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1385
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,069
[Finch:] Hey, jack weed,

1386
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,671
I get more action in a week

1387
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,072
Than you've had your entire life.

1388
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,676
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1389
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,111
Oh. Each one of them

1390
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,113
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1391
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,614
So, I suggest you wipe

1392
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,016
That stupid smile off your face

1393
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,585
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1394
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,253
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1395
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,689
Call me elf one more time!

1396
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,528
[Whispers] He's an angry elf.

1397
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,134
[Growling] Look at you.

1398
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,040
Ow! Hey, what...

1399
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,840
Aah!

1400
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,542
I wasn't ready for that.

1401
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,610
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1402
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:18,080
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1403
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,581
Ooh...

1404
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,549
Call me elf one more time!

1405
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,051
Call me elf!

1406
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,076
You're an elf.

1407
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,080
[Glass shatters]

1408
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,122
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1409
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,897
Listen, miles...

1410
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,165
Listen, miles! Door slams

1411
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,896
He must be a South Pole elf.

1412
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,339
You get the hell outta here.

1413
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,608
Where do you want me to go?

1414
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,575
I don't care where you go.

1415
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,110
I don't care that you're an elf!

1416
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,111
I don't care that you're nuts!

1417
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,347
I don't care that you're my son!

1418
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,282
Get out of my life now!

1419
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,761
[Emily:] Hi, it's me.

1420
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,329
I really can't talk right now.

1421
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,632
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1422
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,401
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1423
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,670
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1424
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,205
It's Christmas Eve.

1425
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,140
Walter... wait, um.

1426
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,276
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1427
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,437
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1428
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,947
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1429
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,182
We found this in the conference
room.

1430
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:27,683
What is it?

1431
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,618
It's miles finch's notebook.

1432
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,788
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1433
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,455
I mean, look at that.

1434
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,326
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1435
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,628
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1436
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,296
What, uh, what do we do?

1437
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,632
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1438
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,300
Uh, how much time we got?

1439
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,168
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1440
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,170
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1441
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,438
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1442
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,940
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1443
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,475
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1444
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,739
Oh, boy! Go.

1445
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,950
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1446
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:06,889
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1447
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:12,293
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1448
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:18,267
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1449
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,700
God...

1450
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,370
Hey, buddy.

1451
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,450
Buddy?

1452
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,426
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1453
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,794
To get the company back on
track.

1454
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:49,031
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1455
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:53,502
When I say... this better be good.

1456
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,337
Before I get into the story, uh,

1457
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,339
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1458
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,007
Now, just picture this...

1459
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,910
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1460
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,512
Walter: Michael, what is it?

1461
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:04,780
Buddy ran away.

1462
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,882
What? He... he left a note.

1463
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,551
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1464
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,954
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1465
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,490
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1466
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,894
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1467
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:21,055
All you care about is yourself.

1468
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,289
Hey, Michael.

1469
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,435
Wait.

1470
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,243
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1471
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,744
We don't have time to reschedule.

1472
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,045
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1473
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,247
Son, you'll have to wait.

1474
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:42,274
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1475
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,788
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1476
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,590
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1477
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,925
And I intend to.

1478
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,427
It's gonna have to wait.

1479
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,462
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1480
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,431
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1481
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,442
Well... up yours.

1482
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,536
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1483
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,481
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1484
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,283
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1485
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,819
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1486
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,377
You're finished!

1487
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,596
I don't belong anywhere.

1488
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,978
Buddy!

1489
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,847
Buddy!

1490
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,008
Buddy, where are you?!

1491
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,894
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1492
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:02,464
Vixen, up, up!

1493
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,591
Santa?

1494
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,003
Come on, you can do it.

1495
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,632
Pull up! Pull up!

1496
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,583
Dad! What?

1497
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,085
Michael, where you going?

1498
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,450
Michael!

1499
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:42,971
Santa.

1500
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:47,676
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1501
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,445
Buddy, is that you?

1502
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,413
Are you okay?

1503
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:54,016
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1504
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,920
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1505
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,557
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1506
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,059
And then the strain was too
Much...

1507
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,551
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1508
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,103
I need an elf's help.

1509
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,706
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1510
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,108
I... I can't do anything right.

1511
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:24,947
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1512
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:27,049
And the only one who I would want

1513
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,718
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1514
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,687
Really? Really.

1515
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:34,089
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1516
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,925
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1517
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:37,759
You gotta find it first.

1518
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,562
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1519
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:43,498
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1520
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,602
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1521
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,003
[Chuckles]

1522
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,671
I'm standing here outside
central park

1523
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,208
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1524
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,110
What we do know is that
authorities

1525
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,978
Have closed the park

1526
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,245
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1527
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,982
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1528
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:03,485
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1529
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,753
I've got an eyewitness with me

1530
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,955
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1531
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,190
What did you actually see?

1532
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,726
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1533
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,995
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1534
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,062
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1535
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,097
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1536
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,466
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1537
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,167
It was Santa's sleigh!

1538
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,802
[News woman chuckles]

1539
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,671
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1540
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:23,538
Santa's in Manhattan.

1541
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,708
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1542
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,977
But New York one has just received

1543
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,013
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1544
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,115
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1545
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,518
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1546
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,020
Wandering through central park.

1547
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,023
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1548
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,058
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

1549
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,660
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1550
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,151
News is top priority.

1551
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,175
What the heck...?

1552
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,075
Hey!

1553
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,207
You found it. Buddy!

1554
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,254
I need to tell you something.

1555
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:13,555
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1556
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:14,289
I have to tell you right now.

1557
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:18,160
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1558
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,197
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1559
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,632
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1560
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:26,368
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1561
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,538
I... I don't want you to leave.

1562
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,201
You're my son, and I... love you.

1563
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,349
Uh, buddy, uh...

1564
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:44,219
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1565
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,588
Oh, right. Come with me.

1566
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,385
Right. Come on.

1567
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,098
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1568
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,400
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1569
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,568
Sir, what did you see?

1570
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,802
I think you're great, charlotte.

1571
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,138
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1572
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,372
Right into the middle of central
park.

1573
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,742
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1574
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,576
Thank you.

1575
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,610
Could you tell me a bit more?

1576
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,878
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1577
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,246
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1578
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,148
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1579
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,250
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1580
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,120
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1581
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,088
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1582
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,323
The area has been cleared.

1583
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,893
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1584
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,728
These forces are highly trained,

1585
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,130
But rarely see action.

1586
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,266
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1587
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,200
When called into duty,

1588
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,636
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1589
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,672
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1590
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,908
Are still under investigation.

1591
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,310
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1592
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,643
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1593
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,284
That ta boy.

1594
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,650
[Chuckles]

1595
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,123
So, uh... you're, uh...

1596
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,785
Santa Claus. Right.

1597
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,898
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1598
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:03,431
Sure.

1599
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,635
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1600
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:10,298
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1601
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,666
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1602
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,450
That ta boy, thank you.

1603
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,154
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1604
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,890
You never can tell, kid.

1605
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,758
Tell me, Michael,

1606
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,459
What do you want for Christmas?

1607
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,527
I wanted a skateboard.

1608
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:37,732
Oh, not just skateboard.

1609
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:41,703
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

1610
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,171
Looked here...

1611
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,240
How do you like them apples?

1612
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,970
Go look and see.

1613
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:55,749
Whoa.

1614
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,491
What happened?

1615
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,228
You made my sleigh fly.

1616
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:06,995
What do you mean?

1617
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,197
Well, before the turbine days,

1618
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,200
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1619
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:17,005
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1620
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,007
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1783
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,758
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1784
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:30,531
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1785
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:36,904
And never brought to mind

1786
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:44,212
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1787
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,749
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1788
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,017
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1789
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:53,221
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1790
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,856
The book was elf...

1791
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,791
A, uh, fictional story

1792
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,360
About an adopted elf named buddy

1793
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,995
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1794
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:02,997
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1795
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,465
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1796
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,735
And eventually saved Christmas.

1797
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,505
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1798
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,840
"Of the candy cane forest,

1799
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,445
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1800
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:22,283
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1801
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,552
And as for me, I can't complain.

1802
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:26,954
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1803
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:31,259
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1804
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,061
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1805
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:37,265
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1806
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,800
You're welcome, papa.

1807
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,804
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1808
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:44,338
Hey, Suzie.

1809
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:45,273
Come here, little one.

1810
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,809
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1811
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,310
Papa wants to see you.

1812
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,914
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1813
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:53,314
Buddy...

1814
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:55,616
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1815
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,885
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1816
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,344
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1817
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:27,582
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1818
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:31,986
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1819
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:36,390
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1820
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:41,629
Later on, we'll conspire

1821
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:45,566
As we dream by the fire

1822
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:50,004
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1823
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:54,108
Walking in a winter wonderland

1824
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:58,636
Walking in a winter wonderland

1825
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,559
I really can't stay

1826
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:16,063
But, baby, it's cold outside

1827
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,164
I've got to go 'way

1828
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,902
But, baby, it's cold outside

1829
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:23,204
This evening has been

1830
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,940
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1831
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,375
So very nice

1832
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:32,580
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1833
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,416
My mother will start to worry

1834
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,652
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1835
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:41,055
And father will be pacing the floor

1836
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,057
Listen to that fireplace roar

1837
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:46,093
So, really, I'd better scurry

1838
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,462
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1839
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,966
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1840
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:54,735
Put some records on while I pour

1841
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,938
The neighbors might think

1842
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:59,473
Baby, it's bad out there

1843
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:01,208
Say, what's in this drink?

1844
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:05,413
No cabs to be had out there

1845
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,148
I wish I knew how

1846
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,517
Your eyes are like starlight now

1847
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,485
To break the spell

1848
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:16,524
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1849
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,460
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1850
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,596
Mind if I move in closer?

1851
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:24,699
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

1852
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,969
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

1853
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,704
I really can't stay

1854
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,739
Baby, don't hold out

1855
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:38,736
Ah, but it's cold outside

1856
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,289
I simply must go

1857
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:52,259
But, baby, it's cold outside

1858
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:54,228
The answer is no

1859
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:57,498
But, baby, it's cold outside

1860
01:33:57,498 --> 01:33:59,300
This welcome has been

1861
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,003
I'm lucky that you dropped in

1862
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,971
So nice and warm

1863
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:09,010
Look out the window at that
storm

1864
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,779
My sister will be suspicious

1865
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,281
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1866
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:17,518
My brother will be there at
the door

1867
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,754
Waves upon tropical shore

1868
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:23,124
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1869
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:25,226
Oh, your lips look delicious

1870
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,628
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1871
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:31,165
Never such a pleasure before

1872
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,000
I've got to get home

1873
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,736
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1874
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,571
Say, lend me your comb

1875
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:41,575
It's up to your knees out there

1876
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:43,678
You've really been grand

1877
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,713
I thrill when you touch my hand

1878
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,848
But don't you see

1879
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:52,820
How can you do this thing to me?

1880
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,322
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1881
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:58,526
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1882
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,262
At least there will be plenty
implied

1883
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,265
If you caught pneumonia and died

1884
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:05,866
I really can't stay

1885
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,335
Get rid of that hold out

1886
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:12,339
Ah, but it's cold

1887
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:18,073
Outside
