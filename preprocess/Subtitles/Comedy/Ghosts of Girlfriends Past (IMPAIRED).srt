00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,735
- I'll be damned.
- That's probably true.

151
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,769
- Hey, the bride's unsupervised.
- I'm on it.

152
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,136
- Buddy, we're not done talking about this.
- Done talking about what?

153
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,240
- Options.
- Options.

154
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,573
Yeah, listen to me, Connor.

155
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:55,843
This is the biggest weekend in Sandy's life.
If you detract from her wedding...

156
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,613
...I will sneak into your room
and cut off your favorite appendage.

157
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,518
Now, the first part sounds nice.

158
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:04,125
I can make it look like an accident.
Don't push me.

159
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,457
Just try to be supportive. Normal.
Just not a train wreck for once.

160
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,861
- I'll be on my best behavior.
JENNY: That worries me.

161
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,024
I will, I'll be supportive. Whatever.

162
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,567
- Really?
CONNOR: Yes.

163
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:15,965
JENNY:
Come on.

164
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,902
See? I knew there wouldn't be
any weirdness between you two.

165
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:23,239
- Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you, Sandra?

166
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
You know, it's not too late
to get out, gorgeous.

167
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,078
He's joking.

168
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,048
And you know the bridesmaids.

169
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,586
Oh, yes, I do. Deena, Donna.
How are you?

170
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,916
- And, uh...?
- Denice.

171
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,651
CONNOR: Nice to meet you, Denice. Ladies.
- Me too. How are you?

172
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,660
PAUL: My groomsmen.
Guys, this is my brother, Connor.

173
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,831
- We've heard the stories, man.
CONNOR: Oh, okay.

174
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,059
- An honor to be serving with you.
- And with you.

175
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,863
It's "mice" to "neet" you.
Damn it, I blew it.

176
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,131
JENNY: Sorry to break up the bromance,
guys, but...

177
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,935
...I need you right here
where I can keep my eyes on you.

178
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,635
- Absolutely.
- Are we ready?

179
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:57,904
Yes, sorry, sarge.

180
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,609
Sarge?
Are they getting married by a cop?

181
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,980
Sergeant Major Volcom,
United States Marine Corps.

182
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,951
I am not a cop.

183
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:12,258
- Where'd you find this ray of sunshine?
PAUL: He's Sandra's dad.

184
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,522
Sarge, this is my brother, Connor.
Connor, this is the sarge.

185
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,689
He was ordained right after the war.

186
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,234
Little war called Korea.
Perhaps you've heard of it, slick?

187
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,235
Lost more men than Nam.

188
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,772
We didn't get a wall.
We didn't get a movie.

189
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,399
We got a sitcom with Alan Alda
which was all nonstop laughs...

190
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,978
...unless you were the one
watching his friends die.

191
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,673
The war's over, Dad. It was a tie.

192
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,717
You know, we should probably try
to keep going on schedule.

193
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,253
- Hua.
- Hua.

194
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:44,484
Following the kiss at 1530 hours,
on my mark...

195
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,628
...groom will take bride's left forearm...

196
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,857
...rotate 180 degrees,
orienting north by northwest.

197
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,900
Then I will announce you
as husband and wife.

198
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,061
Following which...

199
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,901
Following which,
you will live happily ever after.

SANDRA:
Oh, Daddy.

DENICE: So sweet. Oh, my God.
DEENA: That is sweet.

- I'm surrounded by huggers.
- There we go.

- No, we're cool, man.
- Come on.

205
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,805
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

206
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,802
Ah, the world's a lot less fun
without you in it, buddy.

207
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:43,916
Oh, no. Oh, no.

208
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,578
No decorations in here. No.

209
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,248
No. No.

210
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,656
And, yes.

211
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:53,852
No.

212
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,666
- No! Wha...? What did...? What the...?
- Something wrong?

213
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,629
I got over 30 scented candles
in my room.

214
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,537
- Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.
- The wedding scent?

215
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,645
- And people wonder why I'm not married.
- Not really.

216
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,510
I mean, seriously, Jenny, my Uncle Wayne
is rolling over in his grave right now.

217
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,651
No, come on. Wayne loved a good party.

218
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,880
Party, yes. A wedding? No.
Back in the day that man used this place...

219
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:25,584
...for mind-numbing, clothing-optional,
weeklong orgies, okay?

220
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,059
Do you know Dean Martin
slept in that bathroom?

221
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,358
He drank from the bidet
and sang the Canadian national anthem...

222
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,831
...in Spanish.
- In Spanish.

223
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:38,599
- Yeah, I remember Wayne telling us that.
- Yeah. Now that, that was a party. Not this.

224
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,875
You know, people were taking bets
on whether or not you'd even show up.

225
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,446
- Miss my kid brother's wedding?
- That's what I said.

226
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,073
The whole asshole thing you do
is to get insecure women to sleep with you.

227
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:54,086
- Deep down, you're a big sweetheart.
- Oh. Look who's got me pegged.

228
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:58,056
And there's the sarcasm to cover up
the accidental display of affection for Paul.

229
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,694
Hey.

230
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,053
I'm not covering anything up.

231
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:07,963
And I would also be more than happy to
take off the rest of my clothes to prove it.

232
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:12,369
Then there's the cheap sexual innuendo.
All the old Connor Mead tricks are back.

233
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,704
Well, don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

234
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,870

Oh. Kids?

241
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,397
What? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

BOTH:

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,837
- Heard, understood, acknowledged.
- Sandy.

for the rest of the guests.

- Gonna photograph your brother's wedding?

No. No, I'm not a wedding photographer.

- Right.

He's not good at taking pictures of people
with their clothes on.

- What is this?

- Endive arugula salad. You did well...
- No, no, no. The salad I ordered had figs.

Yeah, because fruit is the new crouton.

to be loving the salad, right?

- Anybody missing figs?
- The dressing is a panoply...

you've ever had.

WAYNE:
So here's a couple of tips.

667
00:38:57,118 --> 00:39:01,953
When you first meet a girl, you give her
two compliments, above the neck.

668
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:05,581
You tell her she's got nice lips,
nice eyes, nice hair...

669
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,321
...she's intelligent, her moral ethics,
whatever crap comes to your mind.

670
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,728
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another, you know...

671
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,802
...vanilla-nice guy that she can tool around
with all night without getting naked...

672
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:23,474
...you insult her. Flip the power dynamic,
and you let her know you're here to play.

673
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:27,910
- Well, Jenny said she doesn't like games.
- Forget about that broad.

674
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,779
- I thought all this was to get her back.
- That's why you gotta forget about her.

675
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,353
It's your feelings for her
that are killing your game.

676
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,724
If there's one thing
that you learn tonight, it's this:

677
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:45,127
The power of a relationship lies
with whoever cares less.

678

Amen to that, brother.

...you know, thinking about love.

681
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,001
And at that moment,
you have gotta get up.

to brass tacks here.

We'll deal with reflective surfaces
at another time.

- No.

"I'm a fag. Let's be friends."

01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:44,269
Yeah. Four Seasons, please.

1054
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,373
- Come on, start. Aah!
- Where do you think you're going?

1055
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:58,419
Oh, Mel. God, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

1056
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,783
Aah!

1057
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,020
Really, did you learn nothing
from the last ghost?

1058
01:03:04,497 --> 01:03:06,522
- You're the ghost of girlfriends present?
- Mm-hm.

1059
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,031
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, tell me about it.

1060
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,433
But as sad as it is,
I'm the only consistent woman in your life.

1061
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:16,803
So here I am,
just working on the weekend. Again.

1062
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,466
But we never...

1063
01:03:18,644 --> 01:03:20,111
I mean, you...

1064
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:22,338
- You're totally gay, right?
- What?

1065
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:23,539
You're not?

1066
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,777
No. There was just one time in college.
I went to Barnard.

1067
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,546
- Okay.
- I had no choice.

1068
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,314
Hey, I'm sorry, Mel.

1069
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:34,051
If I'd have known,
I would of hit on you a lot sooner.

1070
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,127
Aw. Ha, ha.

1071
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:39,958
- Ow! What was that for?
- Because tonight, I'm the boss.

1072
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:41,599
You ready?

1073
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,331
What are you doing?

1074
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:53,805
Aren't we gonna, like,
fly off or something?

1075
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,746
It's the present, you idiot.
We're here already.

1076

PAUL: Okay, no. That is not what I said.
WOMAN: I don't care.

1078

He's a beautiful piece of a man.

1079
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:14,626
Hey, look at how much fun they're having
now that you're gone.

1080
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,625
- He's not shallow.
- Shallow?

1081
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:19,635
Honey, he spends every Christmas alone
at the Knicks game.

1082
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:20,931
Yeah, he is all surface.

1083
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,702
Yeah, but in his defense,
it's a really hot surface.

1084
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:26,970
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, he's not that bad.

1085
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:30,582
- Thank you, Paulie.
DEENA: Paul, he hit on your mother in law.

1086
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,548
- I've banged worse.
- Thank you, Vonda.

1087
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,277
ALL:
Oh!

1088
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,685
You guys just don't know him like I do.
You don't.

1089
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:41,190
You know, that guy practically raised me.

1090
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:46,928
I was 2 when our parents died.
Connor was just 7.

1091
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:52,994
You know, at an age when he's supposed
to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one.

1092
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,565
He taught me how to read.

1093
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,873
He taught me how to ride a bike.

1094
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,973
He beat the crap out of any kid
who ever teased me.

1095
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:09,485
You know, he always said,
"Paulie, it's you and me against the world."

1096
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:16,060
My point is, I had the opportunity
to be a nice kid and Connor didn't.

1097
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:20,056
Now, I know he seems like a joke
to you guys...

1098
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:25,499
...and trust me, you all have fair points,
but that guy is the only family I've got.

1099
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,502
And if there's one thing family does...

1100
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:32,576
...it is believe, against all odds,
in the best of each other.

1101
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,110
I love him.

1102
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:43,278
And as long as I live,
I'll believe he can change, because he's...

1103
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,258
He's my big brother.

1104
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:52,954
I'm gonna call my brother.

Of course,
that doesn't mean anything to you.

1107
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,966
Because love doesn't exist, right?

1108
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,236
It's just, "magical comfort food
for the weak and uneducated"?

1109
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:10,678
Wow, that is as close as I will ever come
to feeling something for Connor Mead.

1110
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,284
- Kudos.
- I saw you chatting him up at the bar.

1111

Well, I still wanna do him,
but now I'll be scrumping a tragic figure.

Ooh, like when Denice hooked up
with Gary Coleman at Lollapalooza.

1113
01:06:23,963 --> 01:06:28,161
I was drunk
and he had such delicate hands.

1114
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,534
Denice, you think that's bad? I mean,
look at what Connor is doing to poor Jenny.

1115
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:35,731
He has got that girl so twisted up
into a pretzel...

1116
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,173
...she can't even appreciate
that fine slice of wedding beefcake...

1117
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:42,178
...that Sandy has flown in for her.

Now, wait a second, are you actually trying
to repair this wedding cake?

1126
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:22,013
Maybe.

1127
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:26,722
- I mean, a little.
- I used to moonlight as a pastry chef.

1128
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:29,884
- Tell me this guy's gay.
- He's not. Trust me.

1129

- Really?
- No. Not really.

You wanna talk about it?

1132

As your designated wedding sex,
everything you say is privileged.

But I see him again, and I am just right back
to where I was before.

1136

My attending in med school used to say
that doctors never break up...

drawn to the most hopeless patients.

How did he fool all of us?

Yeah, but the weirdest thing, really...

to fall in love with him.

I am sorry about destroying
your wedding cake...

...going to second base with your mother,
knocking your dad unconscious right there...

breaking up your wedding.

Because you don't actually care.
