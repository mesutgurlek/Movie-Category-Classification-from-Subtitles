00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,937
Okay, do it again.

160
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,098
Do it again.

161
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,041
- Ouch.
- Okay. You'll block it every time.

162
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,738
Have a seat.

163
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,111
Now, in addition to
what you just saw...

164
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:51,947
if you study with my eight-week program,
you're gonna learn these things.

165
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,987
First off...

166
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,988
Rex Kwon Do,
we use the buddy system.

167
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,584
No more flyin'solo. You need somebody
watching your back at all times.!

168
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:03,926
Second off, you're gonna learn
to discipline your image.

169
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,999
Do you think I got
where I am today...

170
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,795
because I dress like
Peter Pan here?

171
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,298
Take a look at what
I'm wearing, people.

172
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,839
Do you think anybody wants
a roundhouse kick to the face...

173
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:16,705
while I'm wearin'
these bad boys?

174
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:19,939
Forget about it.
Last off...

175
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:24,074
my students will learn
about self-respect.

176
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:28,622
Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure
because I go home to Starla at night?

177
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:31,191
Forget about it.!

178
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:34,227
Now, for only $300,
you can sign up right now...

179
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,558
for my eight-week program.

180
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:46,306

was a rip-off.

So me and you are pretty much
friends by now, right?

Yes.

193
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:48,657
So, you got my back
and everything?

194
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,196
What?

195
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:54,667
- Never mind.
- [Chattering]

- Yes.

00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,839
Have you met anyone to ask yet?

198
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:04,502
No. But I probably will
after school.

199
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,842
Who you gonna ask?

200
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,973
That girl over there.

201
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,382
She braided my hair one time...

202
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,681
Summer Wheatly? How the heck
are you gonna do that?

203
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,451
Build her a cake
or something.

204
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:21,060
Yeah, my old girlfriend
from Oklahoma...

205
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:23,096
was gonna fly out here
for the dance...

206
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:25,893
but she couldn't 'cause she's doing
some modeling right now.

207
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,525
Is she hot?

208
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:35,542
See for yourself.

209
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,735
Wow.

210
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:43,510
Yeah, I took her to the mall to get
some glamour shots for her birthday one year.

211
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:47,248
- I like her bangs.
- Me too.

[Chattering]

How long did it take you
to grow that mustache?

214
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,065
A couple of days.

215
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,429
I wish I could grow one.

216
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,873
Are you gonna eat your Tots?

217

No.

00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,107
Can I have 'em?

219
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,302
You see that girl
over there?

220
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:47,142
She came over to my house
the other day.

221
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:49,216
- Why?
- I don't know...

222
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,944
but she left all this crap
on my porch.

223
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,880
She's pretty good-looking.

224
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,049
Do you dare me
to go talk to her?

225
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,320
Sure.

226
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:16,239
I see you're drinking one-percent.
Is that 'cause you think you're fat?

227
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:22,076
'Cause you're not. You could be
drinking whole if you wanted to.

228
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:27,820
Well, I have all
your equipment in my locker.

229
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:32,154
You should probably come get it 'cause
I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.

230
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:35,529
Where's your locker?

231
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:46,970
Hey, can I have
one of your key chains?

- Come on. Give me some of your Tots.

No. I'm freakin' starved.

Your grandma took a little spill at
the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.

What? Since when
does she go to the dunes?

you don't know about her.

Not sure.

with us. We're not babies.

Talk to your Auntie Caroline.

What the flip was Grandma
doin'at the sand dunes?

260
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:59,123
She was on a date...
with her boyfriend.

go back in time.

No. Not really.

- Why is that?
- Well...

276
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,980
she's jealous.

277
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:24,880

too much in '82.

Well, things are gettin'
pretty serious right now.

281
00:25:34,928 --> 00:25:38,125
I mean, we chat online for,
like, two hours every day...

282
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:41,668
so I guess you could say
things are gettin' pretty serious.

283
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:47,469
I'm just really tryin'to raise a few bucks right
now so I can bring her around for a few days.

00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:51,441
Yep. Well, what's she look like?

285
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,877
She's, uh...
She's got sandy blonde hair.

286

She's, uh, pretty-look...

pretty good-looking
face, but...

I'm just gettin' really...
just kinda T.O.'d...

289
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,188
because, I mean, she hasn't even
sent me a full body shot yet.

I got a little project...

that we might be able to
make a little moola with.

- I'm dead serious.

How much you want to make a bet I can
throw a football over them mountains?

307
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:40,954
Yeah. If coach would've put me
in fourth quarter...

308
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:43,887
we'd have been
state champions, no doubt.

No doubt in my mind.

310
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,225
You better believe things
would have been different.

311
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:52,457
I'd have gone pro...
in a heartbeat.

00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,864
I'd be makin'
millions of dollars and...

livin' in a...
big ol' mansion somewhere.

anything like time travel?

319
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:20,660
Easy.

320
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:23,628
I've already
looked into it for myself.

I don't think so. Why?

329
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,637
Just wondering.

00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:11,938
Can you, uh,
give this to him for me?

Okay.

you want to play me?

- A liger.

What's a liger?

338
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,650
It's pretty much
my favorite animal.

339

It's like a lion

just a little bit east of the cemetery

No. I just...
I have a chat room meeting at 4:00.

I gotta be back here by then.

for that?

you're on, like for minutes on the phone?

Yeah. Grandma's still

Before we get started on our new project,
I have a few concerns.

383
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,042
First off, I'm concerned about
your transportation situation.

384
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:37,514
I mean, do you... you got a car
you can borrow from someone?

385
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:39,517
Well, that's the problem
right now.

386
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,519
At the moment,
nothing comes to mind.

387
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:52,988
You can borrow my van for the time being.
l... I do better on foot anyway.

388
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:56,899
We also need some way to make us
look official, like we got all the answers.

389
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:59,369
How about some gold bracelets?

390
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,575
We need, like,
some name tags...

391
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,769
with our picture on it,
all laminated and whatnot.

I mean, we gotta
look legit, man.

That's true. That's true.

394
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:11,578
Say, you know of a... a place
we can get our picture taken...

395
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,585
like a... a photo store?

on more of a slant.

and slowly ease it up
underneath your chin.

that I can wear?

anything to you yet?

No, not yet.

00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:35,363
Well, she said no.

She did?

- The one that left all that crap on your porch.
- You mean Deb?

- Yes, her.
- What about her?

420
00:34:47,814 --> 00:34:50,612
- Well, I asked her out too.
- What?

421
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:25,807
Well, nobody's gonna
go out with me.

- Have you asked anybody yet?
- No, but who would?

- I don't even have any good skills.
- What do you mean?

who have great skills.

Aren't you pretty good
at drawing, like...

429
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:50,174
animals and warriors and stuff?

430
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,437
Yes.

431
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:54,877
Probably the best
that I know of.

432
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:57,609
Just draw a picture of the girl
you want to take out...

433
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:00,345
and give it to her
for, like, a gift or something.

434
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:03,718
That's a pretty good idea.

435
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:34,320
Now, if you invest
in the 24-piece set...

436
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:36,889
I'm gonna throw in
a little gift.

437
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,254
So, what's the gift?

438
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:44,556
I bet you folks
don't have one of these.

439
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,763
I want that.

440
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,863
You see, this ain't
your run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware."

441
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:58,603
These are some serious
"NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.

442
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:01,703
So, if we purchase
the 24-piece set...

443
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:03,749
the mini sailboat
is included?

give that a nice tear.

Can't.

450
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,970
So, uh...

451
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,548
how does the "dealio"

- Is Trisha here?
- Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.

- Napoleon's my nephew.
- Oh, that's nice.

457
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:33,572
Could you just give this
to her for me?

458
00:38:33,673 --> 00:38:38,440
- I certainly could.
- Thanks.

459
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:40,479
Bye-bye.

460
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:47,945
Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him
while his grandma's in the hospital.

461
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:51,588
He still wets the bed
and everything.

462
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:53,591
You're kidding.

463
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:57,629
Yeah, he's a tender little guy.
He still gets beat up and whatnot.

464
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:01,361
Anyway, uh...

465
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:07,303
so we still feelin' pretty good about this,
uh, 32-piece set here?

466

- Ow!

doin' at my girlfriend's house?

I think you're bruisin' my neck meat!

What the heck
are you guys doin'?

470
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,408
Tryin' to ruin my life
and make me look like a friggin' idiot?

471
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,818
I'm out makin' some

Hey, Kip.

I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that, Napoleon.

477

I made, like, 75 bucks today.

Napoleon, it looks like
you don't have a job.

So why don't you
get out there and feed Tina.

- It's hanging in my bedroom.
- Really?

524
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:30,861

to finish the shading on your upper lip.

It's probably the best drawing

Yeah, it's really...
nice.

or something.
