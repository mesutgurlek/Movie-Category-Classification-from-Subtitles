CALVIN: Gus Delario--
the invisible man is Gus.

2
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,891
He's one of those guys...

3
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,560
who you feel like
you know them really well...

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,562
but when
you think about it...

5
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,731
you don't really know them
at all, you know what I mean?

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,566
And, you know, obviously...

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,568
you look at his track record
of all the movies he's done--

8
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,904
He's been very successful.
Almost every actor in town...

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,840
wants to work in, you know,
one of Gus's movies.

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,579
FRANCESCA: I've done
some mean things in my life.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,551
Yeah. And sometimes,
the--ahem, ahem--

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,753
the worst part is
is that sometimes...

13
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,522
it doesn't bother me.

14
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,457
I just say, well,
yeah, this is mean.

15
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,193
I wanted to be mean,
and I was mean.

16
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,888
Period.

17
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,933
LEE: Well, I have to be
somewhat judgmental...

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,302
because of what I do,
you know...

19
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,171
so I don 't think
that it's such a bad thing...

20
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,106
to be judgmental.

21
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,010
I think that's
how you get through life.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,845
You have to assess things...

23
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,549
and people do it
about you all the time...

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,484
and that's life,
and it's too bad.

CARL: I think there is
no amount of money...

26
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,058
I could have been paid--

27
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,094
there is no deal
that I could have made...

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,198
that she would not have felt
that I had been too passive...

29
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,934
and that--I think that...

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,636
her opinion of me
on that level...

31
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,073
was formed before
the movie was ever sold.

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,065
I think it has nothing to do
with the movie, frankly.

33
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,681
ARTHUR: It's frightening.
It's monstrous.

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,117
It's evil
to not have feelings.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,752
So I spoke to Carl about it,
and we discussed it...

36
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,855
and we went immediately...

37
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,389
to the most monstrous
character...

38
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,991

42
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,867
Well, they never have
introduced me to anyone...

43
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,536
but they always talk about
how I should be dating.

44
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,538
But they're
trying to set me up now...

45
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,042
with this producer friend
of theirs--a guy named Gus.

46

Uh... we'll see.
I don 't think...

00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,312

for me, but I don 't know.

expect to have to work

I'll tell you what it's like.

OK, you know,
I work at this magazine.

165
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,828
This magazine is great.
It's very good.

166
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,763
It has very high standards,
I think.

I think they can do
really good work.

But I think the guy
who runs the thing...

is just not very smart.

I mean, you know,
this is between us...

171

but I just don 't think
he's very smart.

172
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,742
I think his instincts
are all wrong...

that they're
enjoying themselves,

to enjoy yourselves,

00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,371
One second,
You know when we do,,,

472
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:51,173
that first scene
where I'm exercising,,,

473
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,175
you guys gotta have
athletic supporters,

474
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,044
You know what, stop. Stop.

475
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,480
Hey, guess who the world
doesn't revolve around?

476
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,148
You. OK? I'm trying--

477
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:01,050
Maybe you want to come out here
and look at it,

478
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,551
Give me the jacket--

479
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,587
Can I talk to you for a second?

480
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:06,021
I'm fucking giving my all here,

481
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:07,189
I know, I know,

482
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:09,692
I'm giving my all, and
I'm really fucking worried, OK?

483
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,494
Because last week you tell me,,,

484
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:13,429
you want me to play it
like Danny Kaye, right?

485
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,097
This morning,
you come in, and you say,,,

486
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:16,899
"Hey, why don't you play it
like Alan Alda,"

487
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:18,434
What am l, fucking Danny Alda?

488
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,002
OK, I think

you're really distracted,

489
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,504
You've been
on the fucking laptop,,,

490
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,340
Iike a little crack monkey,
logging onto Expedia,,,

491
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,008
for this fucking chick
in Tucson?

492
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,877
Let me tell you something, man,
This is art,

493
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:30,980
I dumped my girlfriend
the day we started rehearsals,

494
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,982
You're not here, man,

You're not present,

495
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,483
I am here, I am here,

496
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:37,319
You're not, OK?

And I'm starting to question,,,

497
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,655
whether you and Carl know what
the fuck you're talking about,

498
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:40,823
Because let me tell you
something,,,

499
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:43,392
Peter Ustinov said,

"To act is difficult,,,

500
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,928
"but it's more difficult
to write a bad play,,,

501
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:47,696
"than to give
a bad performance,"

502
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:50,532
You know what? You know what?

503
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:53,067
What a great fucking idea,
watching me squirm,

504
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,136
What are you talking about?

505
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:59,240
-Catherine,
-What are you talking about?

506
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,342
-The letter,
-What letter?

507
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,435
Uh, the letter,

508
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:08,942
-May l?
-Oh, yeah,

509
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,214
You're acting crazy,

510
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,356
Hmm,

511
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:22,462
Wow, Well,

512
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,936
Pretty extraordinary,

513
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,904
Really?

514
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,543
This is a prank, right?

515
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:38,046
I mean, that's cool,

You can tell me,

516
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,048
I don't think it's a prank, no,

517
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,849
You didn't write this?

518
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,385
Is it your fantasy
that I wrote it?

519
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:46,054
Oh, don't, Don't do that,

520
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,722
I don't know what to tell you,

521
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:49,223
OK, here's the deal,

522
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:51,492
This right here,
you can't write about,

523
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,928
-I can't?
-No, you cannot, It's not fair,

524
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:55,229
You know, they really do
have ovens back there,

525
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,131
I am onto you, girl,

526
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,233
Well, I think I'm onto you,
all right?

527
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,369
Look at me,

528
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,894
-Look at me,
-Oh, my,

529
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,232
Come on,

did you write the letter?

530
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,010
It's OK,

531
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:18,678
See?

532
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:24,892
Ahem, I'm just not gonna play
this game with you anymore,

533
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:27,452
I ain't even thinking about you,
Look,

534
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,706
You missed a piece,

535

[Sighs]

536
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:46,647
CARL: So, Tracy--
is that your given name?

537
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:48,416
-Yes,
-Mm-hmm,

538
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,519
And what's your porn name?

539

I'm--

Do you know about porn names?

-No,
-OK,

542
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,692
Your porn name
is your middle name...

543
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:02,363
and the name of the first
street you grew up on.

544
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:03,531
OK,

545
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:07,168
So, like, my porn name
is Andrew Highland.

546
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:10,471
[Laughs] It's terrible.
It's not very sexy.

547
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,174
So, you're Tracy...

548
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,443
I don't have a middle name,

549
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,911
Oh, well, you can--

550
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:21,782
Yeah, well, you can also use
the name of your first pet.

551
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:25,252
We weren't allowed to have pets,

You are very impressive,

I don't think
you're allowed to do this,

in the lobby, please.

569
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:12,099
You'll have a great time.
I know you'll love Gus.

570
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:14,301
I can't go to a party like that,
I have nothing to wear,

571
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,904
LEE: Wear the green dress.
You look great in it.

572
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:18,873
It's too tight,
It doesn't fit me anymore,,,

and it has a stain that's--

LEE:
You always have an excuse.

575
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,910
It's not an excuse,
Lee, that's a reason,

576
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,245
There's a difference,

577
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:25,646
Look, are we still

having lunch today?

578

Because I have
a birthday present for you,

LEE: It's tomorrow.

You know what? I know
when your birthday is, OK?

Yeah, I think about him a lot.

589
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,641
You know? It's hard.
I found him in the basement.

590
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:57,044
And then I found Lee...

591
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:59,280
who was outside, I think,
or somewhere else in the house.

592
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,481
I mean, I remember screaming...

593
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,017
and then I remember her
appearing.

594
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:06,153
Uh, and then, you know,
no one else was home...

595
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:09,924
so she ran to a neighbor's...

596
00:32:09,924 --> 00:32:14,228
and, uh, I stayed with him.

597
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:18,165
And then neighbors came, and...

598
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,633
and then my mom was home.

599
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,034

So, it was surprising...

604

My friend Gus says that people--
the straight world--

will always be fascinated
by gangster sagas,,,

because, here are these guys,,,

611

they say,
"We're not going to live,,,

otherwise, there would be chaos,

of corruption,

that you called today,,,

629
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,920
because l--ahem--
I needed to see you,

630
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,412
I have an idea, I have an idea,
I think it's a cover,

631
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,406
You got slobber
all up on your,,,

632
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,998
Mmm,

633
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,911
What time is it?

634
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:13,314
Oh, I feel--I feel nauseous,

635
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:15,816
Are you ready to talk
about this?

636
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:19,453
Ohh, Nicholas,,,

637
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:22,022
Iook, I think

that you're very talented,,,

638
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:25,693
and I'll probably write
a very nice piece about you,,,

639
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,896
but you're really annoying
about this whole letter thing,

640
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:32,466
No, You're annoying,

641
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,569
Mm-hmm, OK,

642
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:39,340
CARL: You see, I think that is
worth discussing. I really do.

643
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,610
Well, Carl, I'll discuss

anything with you anytime,,,

644
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,145
because every time
you've come into my office,,,

645
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:47,481
every time
I've asked to see you,,,

646
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,883
or you've come to see me
with an idea,,,

647
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,652
about a cover
or a feature story,,,

648
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,220
or anything you want to do,,,

649
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,290
it always has validity,
It always has,,,

650
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,959
it's important to me
to hear your ideas, you know?

651
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,127
Thank you, thank you.

652
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,629
Let me ask you a question.

653
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,397
The reason I called you in
today, actually...

654
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:05,399
Yeah, Sorry, Ahem,

655
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,734
I have a question for you...

656
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:10,971
and it's kind of important
to me to hear the answer,

657
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,506
And the question is,,,

658
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:16,210
when you go to your
refrigerator in your home,,,

659
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,080
and you open the door,
and you see a bottle of beer,,,

660
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,949
do you take
that bottle of beer,,,

661
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:24,151
and pour it into a glass
and drink it,,,

662
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,517
or do you drink it
from the bottle?

663
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:34,361
Um, I--I--
well, I drink it from a glass.

664
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,330
Ah, you see?

665
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,566
Ohh, That's the problem,

666
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:45,527
You see, I want this magazine
to drink from the bottle,

667
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,114
In talks? What the fuck, Alex?

668
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:56,918
Tch, All right, in talks,

669
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,545
I need this,

670
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,623
All right, all right,

671
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,192
NICHOLAS:
I suppose we've come a ways...

672
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,761
since Sambo, Mr. Bojangles.

673
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,596
"Step and fetch it, boy. "

674
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:12,267
"What?
Man, call me Mr. Tibbs... "

675
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,902
we've heard Poitier say.

676
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,770
It's a new day, some say.

677
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,940
Because every now and then,
black men are even in.

678
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,111
Motion picture heroes.
It's the American way, Wesley.

679
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,313
Be cute
and still save the world.

680
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,115
Yes, we will, Will.

681
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,817
Go from Boy in the Hood
to Man of Honor.

682
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:31,519
Show 'em the money now, Cuba.

683
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,454
Give 'em funnies
like Chris Rock or Tucker,

684
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:35,857
Or just cool it,
be anybody, like Denzel,

685
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:40,128
But wait, He ain't even really
getting no loving,,,

686
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:43,631
Iike Sidney before him
and whoever after him,

687
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:46,100
Romancin' and dancin'
with amore's passion,,,

688
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,436
ain't in the script's equation,

689
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,205
But can even Mr, Washington,,,

690
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,106
briefly be seen kissing
a Pretty Woman,,,

691
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,175
underneath a Pelican Moon?

692
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,911
Can even he be a romantic lead?

693
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:00,014
Check it, From Sambo to Sidney
to Denzel to me,

694
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,717
Brothers ain't getting
nor giving no love now,

695
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:06,321
I don't want to complain, but
my doctor says I'm suffering,,,

696
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:08,990
from underloved syndrome,

697
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,627
Maybe it is a conspiracy,
But do folks still fear,,,

698
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:16,064
the black man's sexuality
like that?

699
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:20,301
A fear that could be wiped out
just by seeing us love,,,

700
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,370
not by race, but by heart,

701
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,806
And can't a brother
get some love?

702
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:26,874
Now, that, Catherine,,,

703
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:29,344
is a question
for the screen pages,,,

704
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:31,679
written by folks
who rarely look like me,,,

705
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,149
but want to see me
run and jump and shoot,,,

706
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:39,220
but don't care to see me kiss
a woman with my skin tone,,,

707
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,624
and would shoot me if I were
kissing a woman of their hue,

708
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:45,059
Who are you?

709
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,428
Who are you? Who are we?

710
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:50,198
We are human, too,,,

711
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:54,602
and we love loving, and,,,

712
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,805
can't a brother get some love?

713
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,574
That's the state of being,,,

714
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:03,533
a chocolate leading man
in Hollywood today,

715
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:07,882
[Click]

716
00:38:07,882 --> 00:38:07,948
I keep bringing it up,,,

717
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:09,049
I keep bringing it up,,,

718
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:10,216
because I don't want you
to think I forgot,

719
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:12,085
Look, you just pay me back
when you have all of it,

720
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,254
-I have half now, so--

-Keep it, I don't want--

721
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:16,256
-lt just feels awkward,
-Please,

722
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:19,392
-Hi,
-Right this way,

723
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,593
-Thank you,
-Thanks,

724
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:21,761
What would you like
to start with?

725
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:23,596
Some evian or pellegrino?

726
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:25,999
-Thank you,
-You're welcome,

727
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,969
You still going on your weekend
with that guy from the internet?

728
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:30,370
Mm-hmm,
No, I haven't cancelled,

729
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,038
I'm putting myself out there,
I'm going,

730
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:33,573
Good,
You need money for that,

731
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:35,508
You want me to meet men,

and I'm meeting men,

732
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,676
You could meet men there,
There'll be plenty,

733
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,845
I can't come tonight,
I can't,

734
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:40,947
On the internet?
How is that meeting?

735
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,141
It's encountering,

736
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,353
What airline are you flying?

737
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:47,520
Southwest.

738
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,888
-Southwest?
-Yeah,

739
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:51,458
That's a good airline,

740
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,561
Southwest, younger man,,,

741
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:57,197
new underwear, Tucson,

Holiday lnn,

742
00:38:57,197 --> 00:38:58,365
What is your point?

743
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,899
Have you ever stayed
at a Holiday lnn?

744
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,368
No, Have you?

745
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:02,969
I think that's what's
really bothering me.

746
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,170
You know what, Lee?

He's paying for it,

747
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,772
So if that's what's
really bothering you--

748
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,774
-What does he do?
-He's an artist,

749
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,242
-An actor,
-A painter,

750
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,410
In Tucson?

751
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,178
Yeah, He says the desert
inspires him,

752
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:15,382
-Lend me what?
-What is wrong with you?

753
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:19,452
Seriously, what is wrong
with you right now?

754
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,455
Friday. Fridays are good.
T. G. I. F. Fridays are good, Lee.

755
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,480
You're acting insane.

756
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,729
I'm going to have the squash,

757
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,699
But this is
a boundary issue, man!

758
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,637
What I do off-stage is
my process and my business, OK?

759
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,305
And I don't care
what anybody thinks.

760
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,408
And it's my business
to put on a play,

761
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:44,144
And now I've got three hours
to find a new Eva Braun,

762
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:46,413
Oh, OK, You know what?

Fuck her,

763
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,548
And here's why, Number one--

764
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:51,017
anyone who's offended
by drinking blood,,,

765
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:52,819
obviously doesn't drink blood,

766
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,855
Number two--anybody who drinks
as much blood as I do,,,

767
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:57,757
knows it has no effect,

768
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,592
Number three--

769
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:02,062
there is absolutely
no scientific connection,,,

770
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:03,897
between drinking
a shot of blood a day,,,

771
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:05,799
and being
an extraordinary actor,

772
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:10,370
And number 4--it is impossible
to prove number 3,

773
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,472
You know, do the words Masai

mean anything to you?

774
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:13,873
Do you know who that is?

775
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:16,042
Yeah, Herzog made
a documentary about them,

776
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,278
The herdsmen of fire,
warriors of Africa.

777
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,879
They drank blood.

778
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,948
Jack fucking LaLanne
drank blood in the fifties.

779
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:23,750
Yeah, granted,
his wife wouldn't kiss him...

780
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,285
but this is bullshit, man.

781
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:27,353
I don't care what you do
outside of this theater,

782
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:30,623
I don't give a shit, You could
eat the ass out of a dead wolf,

783
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,525
I don't care,

784
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:34,761
Just keep it to yourself, OK?

785
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:37,163
Just keep it to yourself,

786
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,599
I think it's fucking hysterical
that she walked,

787
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,601
And I know comedy,

788
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,069
LINDA: I don't understand.

789
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,737
I don't understand
what's wrong.

790
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,239
I mean, birthdays are fun.

791
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,709
Well, OK, this is mom

when I was four,,,

792
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,811
at my birthday
introducing me to people,

793
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:57,217
"And this is Lee, She ruined
my body, didn't you, dear?"

794
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:58,818
-There,
-Thanks,

795
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,720
I won't be here tomorrow,
so happy birthday.

796
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,390
Oh, It's smaller than the gift
you gave me last year,,,

797
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,292
for my fortieth birthday,

798
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,228
You know what, Lee, you make
forty a bigger deal than it is.

799
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,964
You have no idea about forty,

800
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,799
I'll be forty.

801
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,567
What did I give you last year?
I don't even remember.

802
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,605
You know, that--that thing,
That,,,

803
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:22,942
-Oh, You didn't like it?
-No,

804
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,445
Well, honestly,
I would have rather had...

805
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:27,147
just, like,
a card or something.

806
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,448
OK, God,

807
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:29,849
It's just a weird gift
to give your sister...

808
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,885
who's married,
on her fortieth birthday.

809
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,887
You know what Gus gave me
last year for my birthday?

810
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:36,823
First edition of Bernard Shaw's
The Sanity of Art.

811
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:39,425
Did you get anything out of it?

812
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:41,723
-Which?
-The gift I gave you,

813
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:46,065
Are you kidding?

814
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:49,068
No, I mean, yes or no,

815
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:50,537
But for my fortieth birthday?

816
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:53,439
Well, I have one, so,,,

817
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:55,441
I used it once.

818
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:59,078
OK, All right,
Well, what happened?

819
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:01,239
Um, I got stuck in the chair,

820
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,786
You used it in a chair?

821
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:10,423
Well, yeah,
that's what's on the box,

822
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:13,026
Different ways. I've never...

823
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:15,361
Not in a chair. I've never...

824
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,530
Well,,,

825
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,433
gift-giving--
you know, it's an art,

826
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,802
You should have
the person in mind--

827
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:25,338
OK, I'm sorry, I thought
you'd like it, I like it--

828
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:27,607
Well, that's--
but you should give people...

829
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:29,175
what you think
they would want--

830
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:30,710
you know, something personal.

831
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,012
How much more personal
could that be?

832
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:36,015
But then, you and that guy--
what was his name?

833
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:37,317
-Tom,
-Tom,

834
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:39,919
Yeah. You sat at
the other end of the table...

835
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,788
and just stared
at each other the whole time.

836
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:43,756
You didn't even
really socialize.

837
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:46,059
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,
Lee, forgive me, OK?

838
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,262
I happened to be in love--
for a brief period of time,

839
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:50,897
Once--which happened
to include,,,

840
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:52,265
the week of your birthday,

841
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,833
-This is all a year later,
-You don't get it,

842
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,535
Christ!

843
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:57,136
You know what?
Gift--it's a gift,

844
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:58,805
A gift is a gift,
Don't question it,

845
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:02,241
At least not to the giver
and out loud a whole year later,

846
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,002
Chr--

847
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:08,381
-OK, now I know,

-What?

848
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:09,949
Well, that it meant something
to you,

849
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:11,918
What?

850
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:15,285
Just the whole thing,
that you put thought into it,

851
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,518
You know,
it's for your small change.

852
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,535
FRANCESCA: So he gives me
this injection...

853
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:31,338
and I become invisible.

854
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:33,039
And I can do anything, right?

855
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,874
Because, you know,
I'm invisible.

856
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:39,779
What do I do? I go to
one of my colleagues, Carl...

857
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,782
and I make him
sign a confession...

858
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:45,986
while I hold a knife
to his neck.

859
00:43:45,986 --> 00:43:50,156
Now, it's just weird,
because I really like Carl.

860
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,392
He's a brilliant,

talented man,,,

861
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:55,061
completely misunderstood
by his boss,

862
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:59,866
Well, you know, I'm not
surprised he was in my dream,,,

863
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:04,064
really, because
I think of him a lot,

864
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:08,608
I think I'm actually--

865
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,210
MAN: Wheel in Nicholas.
We're ready for him.

866
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,511
It's funny, because
he's one of these guys--

867
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,213
You know what?
I want to tell you,,,

868
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:16,583
what I think about that,

but I gotta go do this,

869
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:20,178
OK, I'll be here--listening,

870
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:23,523
Hey, Pitty,

871
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:25,525
[Laughs]

872
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:27,027
Hey, man, What's going on?

873
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:29,963
OK, exactly the same thing,
We're starting from over here,

874
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:31,297
It took me a little bit--

875
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:32,499
I needed to do this
with track,,,

876
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:33,666
instead of just the walk-up,,,

877
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,368
so we're gonna do
a little bit of a push-in,

878
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:37,203
There's probably
going to be some focus stuff,,,

879
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:38,705
so we're gonna shoot a few,

880
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:39,873
OK,

881
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:41,541
But just split the extras
as they come through--

882
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:42,876
don't be precious about it,

883
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:44,377
Tell them we're coming through,

884
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:46,679
I will, I will,

885
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,050
R-1 39, take one,

886
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,319
[Man muttering]

887
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:55,755
And background action--action!

888
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,457
Move! Move!

889
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,560
-Out of the way!
-Goddamn it,

890
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,063
Uh, looks like we're late,

891
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:05,131
Looks like,

892
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:07,500
Back to square one,

893
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,469
That's what he thinks,

894
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:12,338
You think different?

895
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:14,507
Like the back
of my big ten-inch,

896
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:17,010
-Oh,
-Come on,

[Sighs]

898
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,414
CARL: One minute
I'm drinking a beer...

899
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:23,349
and the next minute
I'm unemployed.

900
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,651
How does that happen?

901
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:26,175
[Laughs]

902
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:37,030
He said I have confused,,,

903
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,056
my personality quirks
with standards,

904
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:44,037
What the fuck?

905
00:45:44,037 --> 00:45:47,507
CARL: You have no idea
what I have lost just now.

906
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:53,179
This goes way beyond this job.
I could lose everything.

907
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,748
The ripple effect.
It's the ripple effect.

908
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:58,251
It's like, "Oh, yeah,
by the way, you're fired. "

909
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:00,453
"Oh, yeah, honey, by the way...

910
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,355
"uh, you don 't think
I'm so great.

I'm so great at work.

"Hey, maybe I'm not so great. "

913
00:46:06,192 --> 00:46:08,628
Hey, that's simple.
Well, there, I can write that.

914
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:09,762
I can write,
"I'm not so great. "

915
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:11,197
Maybe I can write it...

916
00:46:11,197 --> 00:46:12,899
a hundred-fucking-thousand
times on a blackboard--

917

Oh, I can teach.
I used to teach.

918
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,469
I love teaching.
I do love teaching.

Thanks,

Would you not take a role
if you felt,,,

944
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:28,239
the people of the black
community wouldn't like it?

945
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:31,010
Hmm,

This guy that lives
in my neighborhood--

947

Iives right across the street
from me,

948
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,183
And he dresses like--
yeah, yeah,

949
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:40,220
He dresses like a vampire
twenty-four hours a day,

950
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,622
I don't know if he's got a job,
I don't know what he does,,,

951
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:45,024
but I know
he dresses like a vampire,,,

955

dressed as Dracula,,,

956

Well, you could find out,

to your question is,,,

abso-fucking-lutely,

No,
But, yeah, I'd take it,,,

Don't worry about it,

CARL: Oh, the film.
Well, the film--

997
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,622
Artie and I wrote this.

998
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:57,123
We started working together--

999
00:49:57,123 --> 00:49:59,259
really writing together,
about a year ago.

1000
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:01,261
We tossed around
a couple of ideas.

1001
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:04,831
And Artie's a pretty good
playwright in his own right.

1002
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:07,934
And we thought,
you know, maybe this--

1003
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:11,371
sort of my understanding
of Hollywood and everything...

1004
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,074
and his ability
to actually write...

1005
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:16,076
would be a good combination...

1006
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,144
and so we came up
with this idea...

1007
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:20,647
for what is now
Rendezvous, the movie.

1008
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:24,050
It's almost like a spy film
in the intrigue...

1009
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,287
of this romantic encounter...

1010

that Calvin plays--

Uh, and this woman.

1013
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:40,433
And anyway,
I think it's a neat story.

1014
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:44,070
And I think it's a great cast.

1015

-Oh, yeah, I'm good,

1094
00:54:52,652 --> 00:54:56,288
I've just had really some
sad cases today, so I'm just--

1095
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:58,491
-I'm sorry,
-I'm emotional,

1096
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:01,153
Yeah.
What did you get him?

1097
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:06,198
-Who?
-What did you get Gus?

1098
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:10,136
Oh, They didn't have it,

1099
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:11,728
-What was it?
-Yeah,

1100
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:16,509
-Are you,,,
-lt was a thing,

1101
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:19,645
He's--he's, uh,,,

1102
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:23,015
It was--they didn't--you know,
'cause he's forty today,,,

1103
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:26,018
and I was just gonna get him
some, I don't know, this--

1104
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:27,353
-Are you OK?
-Yeah,

1105
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:29,221
I just have to go,
I'm really late, so--

1106
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:30,654
-Are you sure?
-Yeah,

1107
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:36,529
I'll call you later.

1108
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:38,297
Oh, OK,

1109
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,958
Thank you.

1110
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:43,869
Um, you need to find him,

1111
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:46,838
Um, you need to find him,

1112
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:48,740
I don't know if he knows
I'm here at the office,,,

1113
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,443
so I have to have a contact
name in order to transfer you.

1114
00:55:51,443 --> 00:55:54,446
Um, Harvey's not here
at the office right now.

1115
00:55:54,446 --> 00:55:57,616
He sees on the TV a murder,,,

1116
00:55:57,616 --> 00:56:01,820
and as he listens to the murder,

he just goes white,

1117
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,321
His whole face
just goes white...

1118
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:04,823
and he bolts
from his apartment.

1119
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:06,324
Now, we follow him.

1120
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,727
The murders--they deviate
at this key point...

1121
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:11,730
for reasons nobody can
understand, because--

1122
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,099
T ell Trevors I'm not gonna
do it, I'm not gonna do it,

1123
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,735
Good, good, Go, Sorry, Go ahead,

1124
00:56:16,735 --> 00:56:18,169
Aah,

1125
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:20,972
My brother Bob
should look at this,

1126
00:56:20,972 --> 00:56:24,142
Yeah, Good, Good!

1127
00:56:24,142 --> 00:56:25,310
-Great,
-Good,

1128
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:28,413
CALVlN: Motherfuckers,

1129
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:29,814
Did you see their faces
looking at us?

1130
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:30,949
Yes,

1131
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:32,784
It was like a labrador
staring at a Picasso,

1132
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:33,952
Right,

1133
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,288
Ed, we walked in there

with a china cup,

1134
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:39,157
-They want beer mugs,
-Yeah, right?

1135
00:56:39,157 --> 00:56:41,526
I could so see myself
in that part,

1136
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:43,795
Right?

1137
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:45,297
Fuck!

1138
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:47,565
-It's all right,
-All right, I gotta go,

1139
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:48,964
-See you later,
-See you,

1140
00:56:51,636 --> 00:56:54,105
Hey, Ed, keep the faith,

1141
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:56,608
It was good. It was good.

1142
00:56:56,608 --> 00:56:59,711
-Mr, Liveright,
-Hey, hey, Bill,

1143
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,245
-Come on in,
-Thanks,

1144
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:02,413
-Ann?
-Yeah,

1145
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:05,650
My massage is here,
I'll call you back in an hour,

1146
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,987
-How about in back? Good?
-OK, sure,

1147
00:57:08,987 --> 00:57:12,991
Um, what do you think
about the lighting?

1148
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:14,492
A little light--too bright?

1149
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:16,861
Whatever you're comfortable
with is fine, Yeah,

1150
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:19,864
I think a little darker,

1151
00:57:19,864 --> 00:57:22,333
-Like so,
-Sure,

1152
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,569
-Need some help?
-No,

1153
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,628
Done it before, huh?

1154
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:30,041
"Bill Liveright"--great name,

1155
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:33,211
Well, a name with a message
is a good name, right?

1156
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:36,114
I don't know,
It just always eluded me,

1157
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:39,917
Mmm,
Money is just feminine energy,

1158
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:44,689
Huh, It always seems so male,
I don't get it,

1159
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:47,992
Money: Mater, The Latin,

1160
00:57:47,992 --> 00:57:50,461
You connect with that,

and you're golden,

1161
00:57:50,461 --> 00:57:52,497
You make it sound pretty simple,

1162
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:55,033
-lt is,
-Just connecting with it,

1163
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:56,834
You're catching on, Ann,

1164
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:59,570
Look, don't be

one of the confused people,

1165
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,875
If you have purpose,
you can just wade right through,

1166
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:06,969
It's like running past
people who are asleep,

1167
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:11,914
OK,,,

1168
00:58:13,484 --> 00:58:15,119
you can turn over now,

1169
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,990
I think I kind of drooled
a little bit,

1170
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:22,653
Just scoot your head down,
so you're not in the hole.

1171
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:31,636
[Exhales]

1172
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:33,263
OK,

1173
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:40,078
You're from L,A,?

1174
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:42,814
No, Miami, actually, You?

1175
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:44,611
-New York,
-Oh,

1176
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:48,443
[Sniffs]

1177
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:52,256
Do you find me attractive?

1178
00:58:52,256 --> 00:58:53,348
What?

1179
00:58:57,595 --> 00:58:59,563
Yes,

1180
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,968
In what sort of way?

1181
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:06,459
In a human sort of way,

1182
00:59:10,908 --> 00:59:12,910
-Ann,
-Bill,

1183
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,946
It's my birthday, Ann,

1184
00:59:14,946 --> 00:59:16,080
-Really?
-Yeah,

1185
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,513
Happy birthday,

1186
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,553
What's your philosophy
on release?

1187
00:59:22,553 --> 00:59:24,889
You know what, Bill, I know

where you're going with this,,,

1188
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:27,158
and the thing is,
I don't do it, so,,,

1189
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:29,160
Right, Not even
for a little extra money?

1190
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,830
Mm-mmm, It's not
the kind of massage I do,

1191
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,998
Right,

1192
00:59:33,998 --> 00:59:36,067
I offer a release
of tension and toxins,,,

1193
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:37,568
and sometimes emotion, but,,,

1194
00:59:37,568 --> 00:59:39,303
Yes, well,

that's what I'm talking about,

1195
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,939
-Well, I don't do it, so--

-lt would take thirty seconds,

1196
00:59:41,939 --> 00:59:43,341
Oh, yeah,
You can come in thirty seconds?

1197
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:45,209
-Do you have a second-hand?
-Look, I can't do it,

1198
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:46,577
You could stop
after thirty seconds,

1199
00:59:46,577 --> 00:59:48,079
Five hundred dollars,
When was the last time,,,

1200
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,781
you made five hundred dollars
for thirty seconds of work?

1201
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:51,916
-You're cruel,
-I'm not cruel, I'm practical,

1202
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:54,919
You need the cash,

I need the release,

1203
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:56,788
This is crazy,

1204
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:58,517
Five hundred dollars, Ann,

1205
01:00:03,594 --> 01:00:05,463
You can't make any noise,

1206
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:08,800
-The place is noisy,
-No, You can audibly exhale,

1207
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,301
You can't moan or grunt or sigh,

1208
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:12,570
I can't moan or grunt or sigh,
just audible exhale only?

1209
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,605
-Yes,
-Ahh!

1210
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:17,675
No, Too loud, And if
you do it--it's too much,

1211
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:21,179
I'll be quiet,
OK, Ann, I'll be quiet,

1212
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:22,814
Are you ready?

1213
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:24,582
Fuck.

1214
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:26,951
Are you ready?

1215
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:29,754
Will you just hand me
that plastic bag right there?

1216
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:32,323
Well, why?

1217
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:33,915
No reason,

1218
01:00:44,268 --> 01:00:46,293
[Sighs]

1219
01:00:57,782 --> 01:01:00,117
Oh,

1220
01:01:00,117 --> 01:01:01,778
Oh, my God,

1221
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:16,934
Ahem,

1222
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,562
-Here,
-Thank you,

1223
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,046
GUS: Shit.

1224
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:31,015
-Hey, Ann?
-What?

1225
01:01:31,015 --> 01:01:33,417
I'm sorry,
I thought I had more cash on me,

1226
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:35,419
-That's OK, Bill,

-I saw an ATM in the lobby,

1227
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:38,155
You know what? There's a limit.

1228
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:39,645
There's a limit.

1229
01:01:40,925 --> 01:01:43,294
To the machine, You can only
get three hundred dollars out,

1230
01:01:43,294 --> 01:01:45,596
Could you move that, please?
That bag,

1231
01:01:45,596 --> 01:01:49,000
-You're kidding,
-No, I'm not kidding,

1232
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,269
-I feel bad,
-You should,

1233
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:53,437
You should feel
really bad and ashamed,

1234
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:54,927
It's,,,

1235
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:02,546
-Hold on,
-Forget it,

1236
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:05,283
-Just hold on a second,
-You know what? Forget it,

1237
01:02:05,283 --> 01:02:07,451
It's pathetic.

1238
01:02:07,451 --> 01:02:12,320
"Mater equals money. " I mean,
give me a fucking break.

1239
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:17,984
All the world loves a winner,

1240
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,630
You know why
they love the winner?

1241
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:26,470
Because they think
he knows something,

1242
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,906
I mean, he had to know

something in order to win,

1243
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:35,279
So, we admire him,

1244
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:40,046
But the winner doesn't
learn anything from winning,

1245
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:47,325
No, the loser--the loser

learns something about himself,

1246
01:02:47,325 --> 01:02:49,827
Losing teaches you
about yourself.

1247
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,262

01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:14,057
Oh, my God, Yes, Oh, wow,

1405
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:16,326
Wow, You changed your hair
or something?

1406
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:19,196
Yeah, How do you know Cal?

01:12:19,196 --> 01:12:21,365
-Uh, we--

1408
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:23,300
Yeah.

1409
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,961
Excuse me,

1410
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:29,402
Hey,

1411
01:12:30,407 --> 01:12:31,942
Hi,

1412
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:35,545
Is it--is it upstairs,
or is it in there?

1413
01:12:35,545 --> 01:12:36,813
God,

1414
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:39,082
-Oh, this is wrong,
-No,

1415
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:40,784
-I'm overdressed,
-You look,,,

1416
01:12:40,784 --> 01:12:43,754
-I wasn't sure what,,,
-It's on the roof,

1417
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:44,988
Where's Carl?

1418
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:47,190
He's not here yet,
I just, um,,,

1419
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,359
-We should go up and,,,
-OK,

1420
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:50,360
-Wow,
-You OK?

1421
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,995
Yeah,

1422
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:53,163
You know,

I wish I didn't have this on,

1423
01:12:53,163 --> 01:12:55,599
No, You look great,

1424
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:57,401
Well,,,

1425
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:59,670
You know, I have to admire you
for your belief,,,

1426
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,405
in this project,
but the reality...

1427
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:03,307
is a whole different thing
altogether.

1428
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:04,741
It's all marketplace shit,

1429
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:06,176
And I don't think that
this is a good role for you...

1430
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,444
so don't even push that.

1431
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:09,012
When does this article
come out?

1432
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:11,248
In a couple of months,

1433
01:13:11,248 --> 01:13:12,772
Well, you call me,,,

1434
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:17,487

out of this guy,

1435
01:13:17,487 --> 01:13:19,289
Thank you.

1436
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:20,891
Nice to meet you,

01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:22,552
Nice seeing you,

1438
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:26,530
Huh?

1439
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,395
Huh?

1440
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:33,603
"Meltzin. "

1441
01:13:33,603 --> 01:13:36,902
Name kind of suits him,
Oh, Nicholas,

1442
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:39,610
No, it looks good,
Where'd you get that dress?

1443
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,446
No, it looks good,
Where'd you get that dress?

1444
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:44,014
-Seaver,
-Where?

1445
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:46,116
On Third, Do you know it?

1446
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:48,051
-ls it good?
-Yeah,

1447
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,418
-lt was on sale, I like it,
-No, it's,,,

1448
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:00,760
Oh,

1449
01:14:01,898 --> 01:14:03,422
God,

1450
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:10,440
All chromium is not bad,

though,,,

1451
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,242
because
I get Fitness magazine,,,

1452
01:14:12,242 --> 01:14:13,937
I need a drink,

1453
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,386
No, I'm saying there's
a lot of good chromiums,

1454
01:14:22,386 --> 01:14:24,388
-I read it in a magazine,
-Hey,

1455
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:26,156
Hey, I wouldn't go
to the lengths,,,

1456
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:28,158
of bathing in bottled water,
that's all I'm saying,

1457
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:29,493
I believe what you're saying,

1458
01:14:29,493 --> 01:14:31,495
-Franny Davis?
-Yeah,

1459
01:14:31,495 --> 01:14:32,962
Sam Osborne.

1460
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:37,634
-I'm sorry,
-The Duchess of Malfi,

1461
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:39,970
-Birchers,
-Yeah,

1462
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,739
I was the lighting guy,

1463
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:46,243
Mmm, Oh, my God, Oh, OK, Yeah,

1464
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:47,944
-Sam Osborne,
-Osborne,

1465
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:49,479
-How are you?
-Nice to see you again,

1466
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:51,581
Oh, you, too, Wow, That's funny,

1467
01:14:51,581 --> 01:14:52,749
-Yeah,
-That's--

1468
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:56,353
Do you remember when you said,,,

1469
01:14:56,353 --> 01:14:59,489
"l feel like a waitress
on vacation"?

1470
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:00,824
Oh, God,

1471
01:15:00,824 --> 01:15:04,061
It was, like, just the cutest
thing I've ever heard, and,,,

1472
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:05,262
I don't know why
that just stuck out,

1473
01:15:05,262 --> 01:15:07,864
I don't--yeah,
I just--um, well,,,

1474
01:15:07,864 --> 01:15:10,200
-I was going to go,,,
-OK,

1475
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,669
Jesus, You remember that?

1476
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:14,471
Yeah,

1477
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:16,707
Yeah, I do,

1478
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:19,209
-I got a funny memory that way,
-Oh,

1479
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:21,178
Anyway, hey,
l--I don't want to bug you,

1480
01:15:21,178 --> 01:15:22,579
I know you got
lots of people to see,

1481
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:24,648
I just wanted to say
how happy I am for you, and,,,

1482
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:25,916
Oh, thanks, Thank you,

01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:28,385
It's--I always thought
you had something special,

1484
01:15:28,385 --> 01:15:30,120
This,,,

1485
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,391
You know, it's just amazing
what you've been able to do,,,

1486
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:37,627
-well, from,,,

-From nothing, Ha ha ha!

1487
01:15:37,627 --> 01:15:39,463
Or, well,,,yeah,

1488
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:41,932
No, I'm just--I'm--thank you,

1489
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:44,167

01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,737
-Cheers, Good to see you,
-Thank you, Cheers,

1491
01:15:46,737 --> 01:15:48,105
I couldn't "Cheers" you,
I don't have a drink,,,

1492
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:51,308
but, well, shit,

Sam Osborne,,,

1493
01:15:51,308 --> 01:15:54,144
Ha ha!
Birchers lighting guy,

1494
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:55,312
Birchers,

1495
01:15:55,312 --> 01:15:57,647
Get me a--
why don't you come with me?

1496
01:15:57,647 --> 01:15:59,182
[Laughs]

1497
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:00,951
-Yeah, OK,
-OK,

1498
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:04,187
-Nicholas, Oh, my goodness,
-Oh, God,

1499
01:16:04,187 --> 01:16:06,189
-Uhh,
-Let's get you on the sofa,

1500
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:08,425
-Oh, God, did I just--
-Yes, you did,

1501
01:16:08,425 --> 01:16:10,427
-Ohh,
-Go slowly,

1502
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:12,829
Ah, Catherine, I'm sorry,

1503
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:13,997
Are you all right?

1504
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:15,699
-Here's some water,
-Oh, thank you so much,

1505
01:16:15,699 --> 01:16:18,769
-I feel a little light headed,
-Here, have some water,

1506
01:16:18,769 --> 01:16:20,498
-Yeah,
-Drink it,

1507
01:16:22,105 --> 01:16:23,874
Yeah?
Are you sure you're all right?

1508
01:16:23,874 --> 01:16:26,910
-Mm-hmm,
-Thank goodness,

1509
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:29,936
-I need to ask you something,
-What?

1510
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:34,384
I need you to come back
to New York with me,

1511
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:37,120
-Nicholas, I can't--

-No, It's the letter,

1512
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,257
Catherine, it's that letter,

I can't get it out of my head,

1513
01:16:40,257 --> 01:16:41,591
Well, but that was--

1514
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,461
I've never had anybody
write me a love letter,

1515
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,129
-Never,
-But I just--

1516
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:49,366
No, listen,

You come back to New York,

1517
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:52,602
You're here,
You there just makes sense,

1518
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:57,140
You write the article,

and--and we go from there,

1519
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:59,472
Nicholas, these kind of things--

1520
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:04,970
A moment of inspiration,,,

1521
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:08,977
that's all
anybody ever really wants,

1522
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:12,647
Mmm,

1523
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:16,158
To have an original idea,,,

1524
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,527
to fall in love,

1525
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:21,931
It takes courage,,,

1526
01:17:21,931 --> 01:17:24,433
to surrender these things,

1527
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:27,603
Especially when you have
control issues,

1528
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,264
I get that a lot,

1529
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,697
[Sighs]

1530
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:41,350
I know what
they're going to talk about,,,

1531
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:42,942
when they talk about me,

1532
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:47,456
They're going to talk
about the mustache,

1533
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:51,360
People are so fucking petty,

1534
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,095
People say,
"God, what's up with that?

1535
01:17:53,095 --> 01:17:55,231
"Like, didn't you know
that Chaplin had it first?"

1536
01:17:55,231 --> 01:17:58,962
Yeah! I knew, OK?

1537
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,872
[Sighs]

1538
01:18:02,872 --> 01:18:05,374
It's either the name
of your first pet,,,

1539
01:18:05,374 --> 01:18:08,344
and the first street
that you ever lived on,,,

1540
01:18:08,344 --> 01:18:10,479
or it's your middle name,,,

1541
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,449
and the first street
that you lived on,

1542
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:15,217
Well, which is it?
I think--is it pet?

1543
01:18:15,217 --> 01:18:16,419
-Pet,
-It's pet,

1544
01:18:16,419 --> 01:18:18,487
So, if it's pet...
all right.

1545
01:18:18,487 --> 01:18:21,123
WOMAN: I'm Daisy Bufane.

1546
01:18:21,123 --> 01:18:23,125
Daisy Bufane?

1547
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:24,660
Jo Jo Mountainview,

1548
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,963
[Laughter]

1549
01:18:27,963 --> 01:18:31,133
I would be Peavey Meander.

1550
01:18:31,133 --> 01:18:34,837
-What?
-Peavey Meander,

1551
01:18:34,837 --> 01:18:36,172
Meander,

1552
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:38,607
-Thurston Craddock.
-Hmm.

1553
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:40,843
Uh, Baron Von Hugecock,

1554
01:18:40,843 --> 01:18:43,846
[Laughter]

1555
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:45,881
What?
That's--that was my street,

1556
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:48,350
I lived on
Van Hugecock Avenue,

1557
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,785
[Laughter]

1558
01:18:49,785 --> 01:18:52,254
MAN: The little kid

I don't know
if you can quantify...

1715
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:30,185
the effect that would have
on a ten-year-old girl.

I think Lee is like...

1717
01:25:33,188 --> 01:25:37,492
Have you ever seen
a dog get hit by a car...

but walk away?

1719
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:44,499
And... there's this impact...

1720
01:25:44,499 --> 01:25:46,601
and you know
something terrible...

1721

but it walks away...

1723

and it doesn't seem to even
realize the implications...

'cause it just goes on.

that something terrible...

has happened inside this dog.

LEE:
Why do you think he did it?

Oh, God, I don't know,

It's some weird sex thing,
I don't know,

CARL: So... my wife and I
were having trouble...

1743
01:26:58,206 --> 01:27:01,709
and I said I thought
maybe we were in a rut...

1744
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:03,778
and that maybe
we should try something...

1745
01:27:03,778 --> 01:27:07,449
to liven things up,
and she said, "Like what?"

1746
01:27:07,449 --> 01:27:13,388
And I said like maybe we should
tape ourselves doing it.

1747
01:27:13,388 --> 01:27:15,490
And she was
completely shocked by this...

1748
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:18,093
and she thought
it was beyond disgusting...

1749
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:21,096
and that was that
for, like, four months.

1750
01:27:21,096 --> 01:27:23,364
And then one night,
out of the blue...

she says, "Let's do it. "

you can't come back
from something like that,
