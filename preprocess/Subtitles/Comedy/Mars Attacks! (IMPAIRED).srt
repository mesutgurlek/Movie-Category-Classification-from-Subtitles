from the Martians...

1128
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:36,599
...I proudly present to you
the Medal of Honor.

1129
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,935
You don't have to kiss me if you don't want to.

1130
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:41,521
I have to.

1131
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,484
I prepared a speech. Is that all right?

1132
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,320
Sure, that's very appropriate.

1133
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,077
Hi, everybody.

1134
01:37:56,912 --> 01:37:58,288
First, I just want to say...

1135
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:01,291
MAN:
Can you speak up? We can't hear you.

1136
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,627
Well, I want to say that there's
a lot of people in the world...

1137
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:07,255
...that have, like,
done a lot more than I have...

1138
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:12,302
...and they're the ones
that should be here now getting a medal.

1139
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:18,224
And I want to thank my grandma
for always being so good to me...

1140
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:22,270
...and for helping save the world
and everything.

1141
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:25,815
So I guess, like, now we just have to...

1142
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:29,986
...start over and start rebuilding everything,
like our houses.

1143
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:33,907
But I was thinking, maybe instead
of houses, we could live in tepees...

1144
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:37,827
...because it's better in a lot of ways.

1145
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,292
Okay, that's all I have to say. Thanks.

1146
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,880
- Was that okay?
- Yeah.

1147
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:50,798
Do you got a girlfriend?

1148
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,550
No.

1149
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:56,804
Guys, come on. Give me a break.
Go on in there and start cleaning your room.

1150
01:38:56,972 --> 01:39:00,016
I can't do all this by myself.
Please? Look at you.

1151
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:18,720
Yeah.
