413
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,175  X1:187 X2:476 Y1:379 Y2:446
This kid Dougie's been
killing us all afternoon.

414
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,047  X1:156 X2:507 Y1:379 Y2:446
We need your arm out there.
Let's go.

415
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,055  X1:319 X2:564 Y1:342 Y2:446
Dupree, l'd love to,
but l can't. l kind of
had a rough day.

416
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,814  X1:366 X2:584 Y1:379 Y2:446
And l better go in
and see Molly.

417
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,794  X1:266 X2:542 Y1:379 Y2:446
l like it.
Family first. Priorities.

418
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,063  X1:331 X2:585 Y1:342 Y2:440
Okay, he can't play.
We're gonna have to
do it ourselves.

419
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,365  X1:130 X2:575 Y1:331 Y2:440
Now listen, l want you to
brush him back here, okay?
What's a brushback?

420
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,598  X1:283 X2:561 Y1:342 Y2:445
lt's where you throw it
really close to him.
Scare him a little bit,

421
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,162  X1:362 X2:590 Y1:342 Y2:446
but don't hit him
'cause he's bigger
than you.

422
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,139  X1:170 X2:494 Y1:379 Y2:446
But, Mr. Dupree,
l don't even play baseball.

423
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,233  X1:155 X2:401 Y1:379 Y2:440
l'm in the orchestra,
remember?

424
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,403  X1:221 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:446
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause l'm your team-mate.

425
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,640  X1:229 X2:542 Y1:379 Y2:446
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.

426
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,114  X1:298 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:440
So was Catfish Hunter.

427
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,084  X1:272 X2:571 Y1:342 Y2:446
Let's go. Let's go.
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey, batter, batter...

428
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,121  X1:125 X2:360 Y1:416 Y2:440

429
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,256  X1:463 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:440
lt was fine.

430
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,415  X1:145 X2:592 Y1:368 Y2:445
Good fine? Bad fine?
Fine, fine.

431
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,021  X1:233 X2:574 Y1:342 Y2:446
You wouldn't believe
the response l'm getting
for my Career Day program.

432
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,430  X1:318 X2:560 Y1:342 Y2:446
And l saved a spot
for you on the 15th
if you're interested.

433
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,933  X1:140 X2:342 Y1:416 Y2:445
Yeah, of course.

434
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,768  X1:160 X2:539 Y1:379 Y2:446

and maybe even some models.

435
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,897  X1:140 X2:501 Y1:368 Y2:446
lt'll be fun.
TOSHl: No. Get away.

436
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,464  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:331 Y2:446
DOUGlE: You hit me!
You hit me on purpose!
The kids'll really love it.

437
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,805  X1:186 X2:477 Y1:379 Y2:446
MAN: No more fighting.
Thank you, that's it!

438

474
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:53,278  X1:150 X2:441 Y1:342 Y2:446
He's never truly been

the ape-man of Borneo.
