151
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,277
Once we establish your client's claim
as baseless, our client has instructed us...

152
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,317
to pursue a defamation claim
against Miss Bradley.

153
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,546
Suddenly, her house could be in play.

154
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,815
- I'm not sure we want that.
- Very impressive.

155
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,982
You might advise her
of that as well.

156
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,619
You have an opposing counsel who will stop
at nothing to impress an old boyfriend.

157
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,290
[ Chuckles ]
Given that I don't believe in coincidences...

158
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,835
I'd like to take this opportunity to say
what's needed to be said for some time.

159
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,637
We...

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,107
have no intention of settling.

161
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,507
Here's the motion.
I'll see you both in court.

162
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,549
It was extremely pro-Christian.
There were Bible sessions, Christian hymns.

163
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,757
As a Jew, I found it increasingly
more and more oppressive.

164
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,663
- So you quit?
- It was more like I was forced out.

165
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,827
The office took on
such a Christian tone.

166
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,065
- So you quit?
- I felt ostracized as a Jew.

167
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,801
Alienated. I was forced out.

168
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,309
I have manyJewish friends
who miss going to morning shul...

169
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,404
so they've started forming minyans
at the office during their lunch hour.

170
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,245
- Are you saying that that's wrong?
- There's a difference.

171
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,320
- Tell me the difference, Mr. Abrams.
-Jews are a minority.

172
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,515
And minorities enjoy civil rights
that the majority doesn't?

173
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,058
When we talk about the rights
of minorities in this country...

174
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,991
we're addressing
the evil of oppression.

175
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,555
When you say to a Christian society that
it's okay to start celebrating your religion...

176
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,397
openly and notoriously
in the workplace...

177
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,733
you run the risk of fostering
that very oppression.

178
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,671
- I began to feel oppressed.
- So you just quit the marriage?

179
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,845
The job.

180
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,446
[ Woman ] I've worked
in this household for 3 7 years.

181
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,493
I was the closest thing that man
had to family for the last 1 0...

182
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,392
and that includes her.

183
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,897
By her, you mean Kelly Nolan?

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,458
The way she treated him, parading
her boyfriend around in the house--

185
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,267
If I may ask, how is it that...

186
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,866
you still live here
and Kelly Nolan doesn't?

187
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,571
I mean, it is her house, isn't it?

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,172
She says it brings her
too much pain to live here.

189
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,050
The memory of her husband
dying in her arms.

190
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,419
I guess the memory of lacing
his wine with nitro isn't as haunting.

191
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,892
What makes you think she did that?

192
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,189
I know he wasn't suicidal.

193
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,757
I know she stood to inherit. I know they argued,
and he threatened to disinherit her.

194
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,235
She certainly knew he'd be taking Viagra
if they were going to make love...

195
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,568
which they almost never did,
by the way.

196
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,006
Perfect. Slip him a little nitro.

197
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,078
What a deadly combination.

198
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,944
You seem to have a finely-tuned
sense of delivery.

199
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,244
Having lived in the same house
with her for seven years...

200
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,514
I know she's a cold,
detached... person.

201
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,751
She's capable.

202
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,361
- She's lying. He never
threatened to disinherit me.
- Why would she say that?

203
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,463
I don't know. He never threatened
to cut me out of the will.

204
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,202
If she says that she heard as much
two days before he died--

205
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,303
And let me tell you, the housekeeper
has considerable dramatic flare.

206
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,383
- We cannot let that woman take the stand.
- How do we stop it?

207
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,681
- Bring a motion in limine. It's hearsay.
- My last lawyer tried that.

208
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:13,054
Well, we try again. Frances Stadler
cannot get in that witness chair.

209
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,370
- There they are!
- [ Voices Overlapping ]

210
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,907
Denny Crane. She loves me.
She loves me not.

211
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,408
Denny Crane.

212
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,673
It's a last-minute motion
designed to waste the court's time.

213
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,544
A week before the trial,
I have no interest in wasting time.

214
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,381
Mr. Shore, all motions were to be filed
1 0 days ago by order of this court.

215
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,820
Now, I must admit that I am new
to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...

216
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,824
but I like to stick to my schedules.

217
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:51,863
Of course. Why bother with justice
when there's a day planner involved?

218
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,161
I realize attorneys in Massachusetts
are fond of sarcasm.

219
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,430
You should know I spent most of
my years on the bench in Los Angeles.

220
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,664
And if a lawyer talks back
to a judge in Los Angeles--

221
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,936
He's shot, probably on the freeway.
Can we get back to the justice part?

222
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,446
Justice is not served by preventing
a material witness from testifying.

223
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,447
It's hearsay evidence.

224
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,347
The only thing the housekeeper has to offer
would be what the deceased told her.

225
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,283
As to what the deceased
told Mrs. Stadler...

226
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,845
these were statements made in an excited
state, an exception to the hearsay rule.

227
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,223
- How can you establish that?
- She will establish that on the stand.

228
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,263
- Which brings us to her bias.
- The court is allowing the testimony.

229
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,855
Your Honor, this is a murder case.

230
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,868
We once had a notion in this country
that the rules of evidence...

231
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,235
would be strictly constructed
and interpreted in favor of the defendant.

232
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,935
There's a reason for that. It's to protect
against the incarceration of the innocent.

233
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,706
- There sits an innocent woman.
- [Judge Cooper ] I have made my ruling, counsel.

234
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,749
Miss Stadler may testify.
We are adjourned. That's all.

235
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,822
Sorry. Hug?

236
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,565
- A cello?
- Your Honor, my client is
entitled to her day in court.

237
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,967
- And how are we supposed to understand
what she's saying?
- We have her affidavits.

238
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,835
Plus, as it happens, I speak cello.

239
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,102
Mr. Holmes,
this is a serious matter.

240
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
I assure you, I find nothing humorous
about a sexual assault.

241
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,313
And you don't think
it's trivialized...

242
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,542
by putting her up there
with a musical instrument?

243
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,586
My client is mute.
That should not prevent her...

244
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,214
from getting in the witness chair
and expressing herself to her best ability.

245
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,815
Miss Schmidt, I don't see
how it prejudices anything.

246
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:33,695
- You're not serious?
- We'll begin tomorrow morning, 1 0:00.

00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,290
- We're adjourned.
- [ Bangs Gavel ]

Oh, um, a few
small administrative matters.

249
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,938
Are you involved?
Tell me over dinner. Not to worry.

250
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,845
She won't give you away,
you naughty man.

251
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,950
[ Man ] I began to notice
that many of our employees...

252
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,923
were engaged in
borderline unethical conduct...

253
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,392
be it nondisclosure,
conflict of interest.

254
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,794
I didn't like it. Add to that...

255
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,699
there seemed to be evidence
of some moral decay.

256
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,464
- Moral decay?
- Yes.

257
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,438
There was adultery
going on interoffice.

258
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:21,002
Therejust seemed to be
a bankruptcy of values, if you will.

259
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,172
And we ultimately came
to the conclusion that...

260
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,649
people aren't bringing their spirituality
to work with them.

261
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,085
So you scheduled interoffice prayer sessions
in a financial brokerage firm?

262
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,353
It had nothing to do with pushing
any specific religious agenda.

263
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,360
- Did you discuss this with in-house counsel?
- Of course.

264
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,454
- What did they say?
- Well, they said that there
were some risks involved.

265
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,659
- But I felt strongly enough--
- Objection. That's privileged. Do not answer.

266
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,202
I believe he began answering
the question, thereby waiving privilege.

267
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,829
The witness will not answer
the question.

268
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,809
Your role was to sit at the table.
It was not to speak...

269
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,909
it was not to object, and it was
not to issue directives to the client.

270
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,216
I thought he was about to reveal
privileged information.

271
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,588
I will decide whether to object or not.
Do you understand me?

272
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,561
- You weren't listening.
- What did you say?

273
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,030
I-- I saw your face.
You weren't even paying attention.

274
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,227
- That's why I jumped in.
- Is that how you practice law?

275
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:22,364
You read faces? Garrett,
it would be a mistake to try to read mine.

276
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,475
It won't happen again.

277
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,484

278
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,717
I apologize.

279
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,694
You were right to object.

280
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,993
I was asleep at the wheel.

281
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,126
And I'm out ofline
to be venting on you.

282
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,000
It's okay.

283
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,634

with your husband.

284

[ Chuckles ] My husband and I

286
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,312
I just don't like to fail at things.

287
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:19,193
Again, I shouldn't be taking it out on you.

In the case. What comes next?

290
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:36,310
We have a settlement conference
scheduled during which...

291
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,907
I need to make a convincing showing as to
why they should accept a small number.

292

But what that showing is escapes me.

293
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,052
I have no idea.

294
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,162
What do you think you're doing?

295
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,696

You looked-- I'm sorry.

as an opportunity.

298
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,044
- I guess the boys do as well.
- It wasn't that, I promise.

299
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,050
I was just offering consolation.

300
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,918
Thank you. I'm fine.

301
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,183
Okay.

302
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,522
Well, good-bye then.

303
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,196
- I didn't kill my husband.
- Somebody killed him, Kelly.

304
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,933
Accidental overdose
will be very hard to sell.

305
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,101
The capsule was emptied
into the wine glass.

306
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,611
Who takes nitro that way?
Somebody killed him.

307
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,016
Why aren't you pointing a finger?

308
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:50,054
- Or at least asking questions?
- I think he took his own life.

309
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,055
By inducing a heart attack?

310
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,625
There's got to be a more fun way.

311
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,751
I think he wanted to frame me.

312
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,320
We argued about my affair.
He vowed to get even.

313
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,423
I think he did.

314
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,333
It's like she's
emotionally flatlined.

315
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,775
She speaks with no affect.
It's-It's-It's an associative disorder.

316
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,406
That's what it is. She cannot
reconcile herself with what she's done...

317
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,280
so she emotionally
lobotomizes herself.

318
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,580
If I could just
get one whiff of her--

319
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,624
Catherine, mark up a motion for a continuance
in the Nolan case and file it immediately.

320
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,057
Ah! I knew it! You need more time.

321
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,619
You're in trouble!
She did it, didn't she?

322
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,767
He seems to take particular delight
in all this, does he not, Catherine?

323
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:46,367
We all do.
It's fun to see pretty people fall.

324
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,770
Your little boyfriend is twisted.

325
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,476
Trust me when I tell you
he's not finished killing.

326
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,970
- Would I like him?
- Probably not.

327
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,371
You'd admire his sense of humor.

328
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,877
- Do you see you two getting married?
- Probably not.

329
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,106
You see us two getting married?

330
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,445
Probably not.

[ Chuckles ]

332
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,017
This is why I shouldn't drink, I suppose.
Double scotch, please.

333
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,093
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:40,895
- You know, your client is guilty.
- Says you.

335

Come on.

One kiss, hmm?
Let's get it over with.

338
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,810
I'll see you in court, Malcolm.

339
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,870
Indeed.

340
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,578
How dare you come in here
and seek a continuance!

341
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,343
Your Honor, we need
to conduct an investigation...

342
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,885
having incorrectly assumed
that the police had done one.

343
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:39,116
Mr. Shore, this-this woman
is trying to manipulate this process.

344
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,749
- I will not be manipulated.
- Mad cow.

345
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,886
Silence!

346
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,762
She likely fired her last attorney
because she told him she did it.

347
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,768
And since he can't knowingly put a witness
in the chair to commit perjury...

348
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,306
which is her plan, she was forced to retain
new counsel and keep them in the dark.

349
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,705
And now, we have you... and you.

350
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,573
If this woman wishes
to manipulate me in the dark--

351
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,907
- Denny.
- Silence!

352
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,880
- The eyes.
- Quiet!

353
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,781
This trial will start next week.

354
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,878
Judge, notwithstanding
your tightly-corseted mind...

355
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,618
no defendant in a murder case
can get a fair trial...

356
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,320
with an attorney who has had
less than a week to prepare.

357
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,987
You're wasting my time, counsel.

358
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,089
And to the detriment of Miss Nolan,
you are wasting yours.

359
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,829
Your request for
a continuance is denied.

360
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,470
- You think she's hot for you?
- I didn't say hot. I said interested.

361
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,875
- You're delusional.
- First of all, she made it a point to tell me...

362
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,880
how she was long over her husband.

363
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,644
- What does that--
- And second, she gave me the look.

364
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,380
- What look?
- The look that you can't describe
but you know when you get it.

365
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,082
- Get what?
- The look.

366
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:50,287
Two associates huddled?
Someone better be getting billed.

367
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,393
Settlement conference is at 4:00.

368
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,469
No talking.

369
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,169
Now, Miss Bradley...

370
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,114
I am armed with your affidavit,
and the judge has permitted me to lead.

371
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,380
But in your own way...

372
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,513
I'd like you to tell us
what happened that night.

[Joyful ]

You were headed home.

375
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,696
It was a delightful spring night.

376
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,698
Parents walking with their children.

377
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,793
It seemed so innocent, blissful...

378
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,635
which is perhaps the reason
why you felt safe...

379
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,370
in taking a shortcut
through an alleyway.

380
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,344
It was dark. Suddenly--

-  [ Dramatic ]
- you had a very strange feeling.

- You turned around. Looked around!

And suddenly, a man was coming.

That man! And he grabbed you.

385

You were terrified.
He molested you. He fondled your breast.

He'd show up at the market.

600
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,268
Don't kid yourself.
I'm the ultimate mercenary.

601
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,896
I put myself on the line
for $500 an hour.

602
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,966
It's that simple.

603
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,512
I don't believe you.

604
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,708
You know.

605
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,390
[ Woman ]
In the matter of Bradley versus Carter...

606
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,722
on the count of sexual battery...

607
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,355
we find in favor of... the defendant.

608
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,332
- Yes.
- Oh, bollocks!

609
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,735
- Do over,Judge?
- You can try your luck with
the appeals court, counsel.

610
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
We're adjourned.

611
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:07,339
- Thank God.
- Congratulations, Adam. You stuck to your guns.

612
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,845
Thank you. Thank you, Tara.

613
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,745
You're perfectly welcome.

614
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,189
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

615
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,392
Well, loser has to jump the net.
So I suppose dinner's on me.

616
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,025
I am not having dinner with you.

617
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,367
- Tara?
- See you tomorrow.

618
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,934
I'm, uh, not one to offer advice...

619
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:44,310
but if you're really serious about this, um,
Alan fellow, you don't want to lose him...

620
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,906
at least, by God,
be able to offer the excuse...

621
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,383
that you simply had
too much wine for dinner.

622
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,455
- Hmm?
- Excuse for what?

623
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,457
Excellent. I love a woman
who makes no apologies.

624
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,162
- Let's go.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

625
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:05,327
No? Then why is your hand in mine?

626
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,570
I'll have dinner.

627
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,410
That's it.

628
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,452
Of course.

629
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:43,402
That was quite something
with the judge today, Alan.

630
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,839
Yes, it was.

631
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,775
Dream case, isn't it?

632
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,144
High-profile, splashy.

633
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,878
Big closing. Get the ''not guilty. ''

634
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:59,217
Have sex with the client.
It's all there.

635
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:02,622
Hmm. Do you think she knows
I wanna sleep with her?

636
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:07,959
She probably assumes all men do,
maybe even some of the women.

637
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,330
Mmm.

638
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,835
Savor it, my friend.

639
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:20,441
- Sorry?
- This case.

640
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:24,412
The noise, the jeers, the circus.

641
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,415
Savor it.

642
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:45,194
- She didn't do it.
- What?

643
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,499
She didn't kill her husband.
She's innocent.

644
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,507
Really?

645
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,176
Well, that's good.
Makes her less interesting...

646
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,273
but that's-- that's good.

647
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,909
It's also pressure, Denny.

648
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,288
We've got an innocent client.

649
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,192
This is gonna be a ride.

650
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,534
Yes, it is.

651
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,349
[ Woman ]
You stinker.!
