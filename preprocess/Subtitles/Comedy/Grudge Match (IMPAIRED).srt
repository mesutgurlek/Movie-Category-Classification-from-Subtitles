...but Junior begged me to let him go
in front of the cameras by himself.

450
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,668
This face needs solo exposure.
You know that.

451
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,061
You know, my brother's
the doctor who saw you.

452
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,063
And my other brother,
he's the commissioner.

453
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,383
I can get a dogfight sanctioned if I
needed to. This one was tricky.

454
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,781
Are you saying that I can
bring my dog here too?

455
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,183
That's not what he said. Why do I
feel like there's something coming?

456
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,820
DANTE: Here's the thing. The
conference didn't go as planned.

457
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,187
We gotta sell 5000 tickets, baby.
Five thousand.

458
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,024
So I'm gonna need help promoting it.

459
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,184
Not individuals, both of you.
Together. As a group, okay?

460
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,111
I could never spend more than
three minutes with this bum...

461
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,702
...unless I was beating the brains out of him.
KID: He's got it backwards.

462
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,749
He's punch-drunk.
I was smacking him around.

463
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,982
I smacked him from ring
post to ring post.

464
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,582
A little too much of this in
the head. Little too much.

465
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,742
- When's the fight?
- Boom.

466
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,740
Hey, listen. Bottom line is this: if we
don't sell tickets, we don't make money.

467
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,227
- No tickets, no money.
- "No tickets, no money." I'm in.

468
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,590
- That's my guy. No ticket, no money.
- No tickets, no money. No money, no fight.

469
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,430
No ticket, no money.

470
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,948
No fight, no money, no tickets. Either
way you put it, all three ways:

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,865
No tickets, no fight, no money.
No money, no fight, no tickets.

472
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,102
No fight, no money, no tickets.
What's the third one?

473
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,980
- All three ways.
RAZOR: You got it covered.

474
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,147
What's your problem?

475
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,304
You gonna fight, fight.
You're not gonna fight, don't fight.

476
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,269
You fight,
you have to do these things.

477
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,788
DANTE: The point that I'm making, in
order to do it, we gotta do it together.

478
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,942
Yeah, together. Okay.

479
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,744
<i>ANNOUNCER: It's show time
at the Miroquois Casino.</i>

480
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,268
<i>Slots, entertainment and the best
buffet on the Monongahela River!</i>

481
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,581
<i>Just ask these two.</i>

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,823
Whoa, will you get a load
of that hunk of meat?

483
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,588
Hey, watch your mouth, Billy "The Kid"
McDonnen, onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

484
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,989
I'm right over here. Right over
by the delicious prime rib.

485
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,986
Sorry, Henry "Razor" Sharp,
onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

486
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,828
I didn't hear you as I am distracted
by this mouth-watering chicken breast.

487
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,665
If you got a gambling problem,
if you're a degenerate...

488
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,505
...I wouldn't come down here
because gambling is a cancer.

489
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,504
Cut! Please just follow
the script, Razor.

490
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,786
It's not that.

491
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,501
The pictures make this look glamorous
but it could be a problem for people...

492
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,469
...and I'm saying
it should be known.

493
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,464
What is this, improv night at Chuckles?
Come on, say the words.

494
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,146
Well, maybe I just happened
to hit a sore spot, huh?

495
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,144
Didn't you lose 200 grand
betting the Buffalo Bills?

496
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,481
Who loses the Super
Bowl four times in a row?

497
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,647
I don't know. You.

498
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,710
- I thought they'd win once.
- Maybe you got a talent for losing.

499
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,340
- I got a talent for busting your...
DANTE: Hey, hey!

500
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,946
KID: You're getting personal.
RAZOR: I'm standing here.

501
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,023
<i>RAZOR: I'm gonna put that
shit right up your ass!</i>

502
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,467
Heh. No such thing as bad publicity.

503
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,271
<i>NEWSMAN [ON TV]: Those two ex-fighters
are making news again...</i>

504
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,701
<i>...and are trending on Twitter.
We'll have that...</i>

505
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,261
- What a lot of crap.
- What's the matter?

506
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,505
You gotta fight in 12 weeks, you're doing
stupid publicity stunts. Who's training you?

507
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,862
Well, here's a hint:
Somebody I can trust.

508
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,188
Well, that's easy,
because you don't trust nobody.

509
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,229
- I trust you.
- Ha, ha.

510
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,028
Forget it. I'm a dinosaur.

511
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,106
Come on, we did pretty good
for 13 years together.

512
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,060
In case you haven't noticed, I can hardly
take care of myself. I'm like an infant baby.

513
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,745
Except I got three white pubic hairs.

514
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,222
Heh. You can do this.

515
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,589
I haven't got time.
I gotta find myself a place to stay.

516
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,027
You can stay with me
until I find you a new place.

517
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,990
No. Don't spend any more money
on me. I'm almost done.

518
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,904
It's like polishing a turd.

519
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,426
Do you remember the first time
I came to the gym?

520
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,904
Do you remember what you
said to me? I do.

521
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,744
I said, "it looks like the garbage man
forgot to take out the trash."

522
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,982
Heh. Yeah. Something
cheerful like that.

523
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,745
Then you said:

524
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,426
"if I take you on, kid,
you're stuck with me."

525
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,945
You said that.

526
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,546
Don't quit on me, Light.
I won't quit on you.

527
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,950
Oh, here we go.

528
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,625
Call it.

529
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,261
It's a quarter.

530
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,344
Come on. Light, I need your help.

531
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,787
It'd be fun. One last time.

532
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,626
You know why I said what
I did about the garbage?

533
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,781
No.

534
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,305
I didn't want your head to get swelled
up. You were so goddamn good.

535
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,705
Thanks, buddy.

536
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,544
- Raze?
- Hmm?

537
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,464
Give me my quarter back.

538
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,791
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

539
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,630
How can you be so cheap?

540
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,260
I haven't got any money.
Give me my damn quarter.

541
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,626
Okay. Fine.

542
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,825
Nice car.

543
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,303
Oh, wow! This is exciting. Look who's
here to meet me. Kid McDonnen.

544
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,145
You know him from the Internet.
"Two old guys fighting."

545
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,827
He used to be Light Heavyweight Champ.
Wow, you put on a couple pounds?

546
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,784
- You're gonna get me in shape.
- Oh, really?

547
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,061
He's gonna get me in shape.

548
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,148
- Give us a couple minutes.
KID: They can come.

549
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,984
Watch a real reality show.

550
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,461
- Watch us negotiate.
- Okay. Okay! Ha, ha.

551
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,106
Hey! Ho-ho! All right.

552
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,906
- Let's get real, Kid.
- Okay, let's get real.

553
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,789
Me training you,
it ain't happening.

554
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,831
Well, this might be a problem, because
I already made the announcement.

555
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,028
You, my friend,
are embarrassing yourself.

556
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,547
A great performer knows when
it's time to get off the stage.

557
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,785
- What? Foreman fought when he was old.
- He was 15 years younger than you.

558
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,385
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

559
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,067
I'll go down there and fight
any one of those fighters, the best one.

560
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,669
And then if you see that I don't
have what you want, I'll walk away.

561
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,346
It's over.

562
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,911
Where's your dignity?

563
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,269
You're in my office, begging me
for a comeback you don't deserve?

564
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,900
- Well, take your best shot now.
- Whoa, Kid.

565
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,346
What are you flexing for?

566
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,741
Don't try it. I'm warning you.
I'll lay you out.

567
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,868
- Don't worry, I won't.
- All right.

568
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,590
Oh. Come on, Kid.

569
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,550
- What?
- I saw your fist clench 10 seconds ago.

570
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,351
I saw your eyes dart at my gut
five seconds ago.

571
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,940
You're an old man. You're washed up.

572
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,904
- Ooh!
- Did you see that five seconds ago?

573
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,506
Huh? Huh? What?
My eyes darted there first.

574
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,950
I can't believe you. After what I
did for your father, your family...

575
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,222
...how you ever could say no to me.

576
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,587
You wouldn't have all
this if it wasn't for me.

577
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,391
You wouldn't have this gym
if it weren't for me.

578
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,544
I don't understand.

579
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,180
You mention my father. That's a low blow.
I respect what you did for my family.

580
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,741
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay, I'll let you train here.

581
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,462
Good.

582
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,134
I'll even get some of
my guys to help you out.

583
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,706
But you and I both know
I won't be doing jack.

584
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,464
Okay. Thanks.

585
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,748
- Long as we're clear.
- Yeah, all right.

586
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,631
See? You got me moving
faster already.

587
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,424
Hey. You again?

588
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,266
- Think I can talk to you for a second?
- Why do you keep following me around?

589
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,663
My name's BJ. I'm your son, Kid.

590
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,389
We should get some coffee.

591
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,391
Yeah, I'd like that.

592
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,546
Excuse me, can I just
ask you something real quick?

593
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,987
- You're in training, right?
- Uh-huh.

594
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,507
What are you training for?
A pie-eating contest? Heh.

595
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,503

My dad. Her husband, the guy who raised
me, he passed away recently so...

me coming to see you today so...

You were never curious about me?

Your mother asked me to not make any
contact with you so I respected that.

You respected that, but...

[LAUGHS]

1946
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,667
- Now I wish I was blind in both eyes.
DANTE: Oh, wow.

1947
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,701
See you.

1948
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,861
- He has a certain elegance, doesn't he?
- Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

1949
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,900
I guarantee you, he's gonna
get some snapper tonight.

1950
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,388
Dude, you're a pervert. Like, it
goes right to sex with you. I'm done.

1951
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,908
Give me a towel so I can get this
vinegar off my feet. It's strong!

1952
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,425
Why is it that strong?

1953
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,026
It might be bad. I think
the vinegar might be bad.

1954
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,108
Listen. If you thought Grudgement Day
was big, then this is gonna be huge.

1955
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,343
They're talking Wembley Stadium for
the rematch. Ninety thousand people.

1956
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,588
I can get you seven figures,
maybe eight.

1957
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,584
Bottom line is I can get you
guys paid. What do you say?

1958
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:36,061
- I'm in.
DANTE: That's what I'm talking about.

1959
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,427
- What about you, Evander?
- No.

1960
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,027
Come on, Evander! So the man went
a little batshit and bit your ear off.

1961
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,064
- It's not like he liked the way you tasted.
- Taste like ass.

1962
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,109
Did you hear? You didn't taste good.

1963
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,262
Mike, do me a favor?
Tell him you're sorry.

1964
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,661
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, like you mean it.

1965
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,711
- Sorry.
- I felt that.

1966
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,664
- Come on, Evander. What do you say?
- No.

1967
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,907

1968
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,506
- I get you one month at the Playboy Mansion.
- No.

1969
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,271
- Okay, final offer. I'll throw in a Bentley.
- No.

1970
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:10,387
- I'll get you a part in Hangover IV.
- I'm listening.

1971
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,264
- You son of a bitch.
- Now hold on!

1972
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,950
- Guard your ears.
- Wait, Mike! No!
