The scandal that has rocked
the college football world--

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,640
12 starters from
Blue Mountain State,

3
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:06,442
as well as head coach
Marty Daniels

4
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:09,179
have been suspended by the NCAA
for various rule violations

5
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:12,218
and not allowed to participate in
the National Championship game.

6
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:16,090
Before the suspensions Blue Mountain
State was favored by three points,

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,627
<i>but by game time</i>

8
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:21,165
<i>Blackwell U</i>
<i>was favored by 17.</i>

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,801
Feels good
to be a champion.

10
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:25,872
That was the easiest game
we've played all year by far.

11
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,041
You know, we didn't want
to win it this way.

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,579
We wanted
to beat their best--

13
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:35,252
Thad Castle, Moran,
coach Daniels.

14
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,654
And it sucks

15
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,124
because now there's
always gonna be doubters.

16
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:41,626
And doubters should know
that we'd play

17
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:44,597
- the real BMS team anytime.
- Anywhere.

Reporter: <i>At what point did you realize
that you had won the championship?</i>

19
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:49,603
Well, when we went up
by five touchdowns,

20
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:52,039
<i>our offense took</i>
<i>its foot off the gas.</i>

I'd get you so high
you wouldn't feel a thing,

479

but our asshole captain
burned it to get God high.

480

Yeah, he didn't burn it.

481

What?

482
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,516
He told me to burn it,

You are one

491

Look, there's got
to be someplace

492

where they're
vulnerable defensively.

493

They're kicking our asses.

- I didn't see any, Marty.
- <i>( Doors opening )</i>

This is
a private meeting.

What the hell
are you doing here?

497
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,396
Oh man, I knew
this was a bad idea.

498
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,598
- Yeah, it was a bad idea, asshole.
- Hey.

499
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,667
Marty, shut up
and listen.

500
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,236
What, are you two both that arrogant
to think you got here alone?

501
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,971
Both: Yes.

502
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,440
Marty, your offense is
getting crushed out there.

503
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,676
And yes, Gilday can be
a selfish prick,

504
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,977
<i>but he knows how</i>
<i>to run an offense.</i>

505
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,313
If this team has any chance
at winning today,

506
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,681
it's gonna start
with you two.

507
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,251
You know, I grew up
watching you, coach.

508
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,054
I used to want to be you.

509
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,056
<i>And when I got</i>
<i>to BMS,</i>

510
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,058
I guess I just
wanted it so bad

511
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,826
that I lost sight
of what it was

512
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,895
that I loved about coaching
in the first place.

513
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,631
- What about Stanford?
- Screw Stanford.

514
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,366
I only ever coached at Stanford
because my wife wanted me to.

515
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,402
She left me, by the way.

516
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,005
She said she couldn't stand
being married to a loser.

517
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,778
I am sorry
about everything.

518
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,014
Let me make it up
to you right now.

519
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,419
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

520
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,022
Tell me I'm the greatest coach
that ever lived.

521
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:55,362
You are the greatest coach
that ever lived.

522
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,901
You always come through
for me, buddy.

523
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,972
You want some, Alex?

524
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,341
No, he doesn't.
He needs to focus.

525
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,842
<i>I</i> need to focus?

526
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,145
How did you talk me into this
in the first place?

527
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,747
- This is a stupid idea!
- This isn't over yet!

528
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,649
Might as well be!

529

But it's behind us.

532

<i>You know, what I said</i>

533

about how this game
was about sticking it

to all the people
who wronged us.

535

<i>Well, I was wrong.</i>

536
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:38,806
This game should be
a celebration.

It's just football.

540
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:50,049
I want you all
to close your eyes

541

<i>and think about the
first time in your life</i>

542

545
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,999
You know, Thad, there's no
money in rollerblading.

546
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,000
- So what?
- I'm just saying

547
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,903
you can make a billion
dollars playing football.

548
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:12,305
A billion dollars?

549
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,209
Thanks, dad.
I love you!

Hit this, little cousin,

551

out of each bong.

552
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,958
Yeah!

553
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:36,128
Pack 'em up,
cousin Denis.

554
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,696

Daniels: <i>Now I want you to
do another thing for me.</i>

561
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,538
I want you to stop
playing this game

562
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:18,041
for that
crystal trophy

563
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:21,211
and play this game
for that moment.

564
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,918
All right,
everybody listen up.

565
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,920
We've been running screens
to the left all game,

566
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,991
but in the championship game that was
their strongest side of the line.

567
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,160
Moran, I want you to fake
a screen to the right,

568
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,029
drawing over
the left side.

569
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,398
And that leaves the middle
wide open for a draw.

570
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,333
I've been faking screens all day.
They've been all over me.

571
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:43,736
That's 'cause you're not
selling it, Moran.

572
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,604
You've got to make them
believe that when you pump,

573
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,339
that ball is going to
leave your hand

574
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:49,742
just like you make
every single girl believe

575
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,044
that she's
the only one for you

you take them to bed.

- Sounds mean when you say it like that.

- Yeah.
- It's a pretty good metaphor though.

00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,325
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

631
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:18,420
( Chuckles ) Thanks.

632
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:20,389
Time out, ref!
Time out!

633
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:22,191
- <i>( Whistle tweets )</i>
- Ref: <i>Time out. Blue.</i>

634
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:25,261
What the hell is the mascot doing
calling our last time out?

635
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:27,430
Alex, listen to me.

636
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,365
There's seven seconds
left in this game.

637
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,302
I didn't spend
three days building a field,

638
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:35,071
sleeping in a barn, drinking
milk from a cow's tit

639
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:37,841
and getting punched in the
face by a giant douchebag

640
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,510
for me!

641
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:41,178
I did it for you.

642
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,614
Thanks, bud.

643
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,716
Hey, coach,
last play of the game.

644
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,384
I think we run
a post to the corner.

645
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,652
Their DBs are tired.
Look.

646
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,388
Coach, put me in the game.

647
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,156
We're on offense, Thad.

648
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:57,726
I know, but this might be the last
time I ever put on this uniform.

649
00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:00,228
And I want the weight of this
game on <i>my</i> shoulders.

650
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,797
Look, I can't do that.

651
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,966
He's right, coach.

652
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,036
Who knows if any of us are
gonna play again next year?

653
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,272
No one wants this win
more than the guys

654
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:11,475
who didn't get to play
in the Bowl game.

655
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,577
Now if you meant
what you said in the barn,

656
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:16,013
and you really want us
to play for that moment,

657
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:18,249
you've gotta let us.

658
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:21,452
I want to kiss you so bad
right now, Moran.

659
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,255
All right.

660
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,958
I want in too, coach.

661
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:28,659
Me too.

662
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:31,329
All right, you guys, you can play.
Get in there.

663
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:33,664
I don't know, coach.

664
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,466
Let them play.

665
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,302
All right.

666
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:40,105
All right. Yes.

667
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:42,207
All right, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

668
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:45,444
T-formation, all right?
( Voice fades )

669
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,616
<i>They're gonna come hard</i>
<i>from the left side</i>

670
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:52,718
which should leave the right wide open.
Harmon, you're the quick out.

671
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,820
- Larry, you're the safety underneath. Got it?
- Larry: Right.

672
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:58,190
- Are we good?
- Wait, what do I do again?

673
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,892
Just keep Stalin
off me.

674
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,462
<i>( Girls cheering )</i>

675
00:39:05,232 --> 00:39:07,900
Don't you dare try
to run it at me, Castle.

676
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,905
- All right, you guys remember what to do?
- Stalin: <i>Is this a joke?</i>

677
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,175
- Am I running or are you?
- The only joke is that haircut, Stalin.

678
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,845
<i>Blue 16.</i>
<i>Blue 16.</i>

679
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,713
Hit.

680
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,691
Whoo!

681
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,508
Yeah!

682
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,054
We did it, Sammy!

683
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,663
You know my name!

684
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,124
Yeah!

685
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:34,898
You saved us today.

686
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:36,569
Whoo!

687
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:41,763
- Hey.
- Hey.

688
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,919
You are all right, Moran.

689
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,115
You too, Castle.

690
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:52,411
Awesome job building a field.

691
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,307
Finaly!

692
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:05,139
We did it!

693
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:09,120
Yes! Yes!

694
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,234
We did it, coach.
We finaly did it!

695
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,946
All right, give it back.

696
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:16,531
- What?
- We didn't play for that.

697
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:18,219
- What?!
- Just give it back.

698
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,549
Oh, man!

699
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:26,620
( Music playing )

700
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,743
Hey, Thad. God saved me
enough weed,

701
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:57,805
to add an extra foot
to the mega spliff.

702
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,625
Shit!

703
00:42:00,188 --> 00:42:01,797
Let's light it up!

704
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:07,476
Say " BMS".

705
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:10,969
BMS!
