00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,777
Gilbert, you'd better get up. They're here.

4
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,321
- I'm up.
- You OK?

5
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,657
- Yeah.
- You sure?

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,451
Sure I'm sure.

7
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:56,874
- You remember the first time you left home?
- Yes.

8
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,002
And I was just as scared as you are.

9
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:04,423
I'm not scared. I just don't like
the idea of leaving you here all alone.

10
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:08,343
Oh, I'll be fine. I was fine
when you went away to computer camp.

11
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,805
Mom, that was just for two weeks.

12
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:16,143
I can take care of myself.
I'm much more worried about you.

13
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:20,814
I'm gonna be just fine. Anyways,
I'm not gonna be alone. I got Lewis.

14
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,527
Gilbert? Come on, rise and shine.

15
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,405
Dad's waiting outside in the car.
It's all packed.

16
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,991
Hi, Flo. It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

17
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:35,704
It's gonna be a great year.
Now, I figure with lunch and two ARVs,

18
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:39,791
we should be on the road approximately
7 hours, 18 minutes and 7 seconds.

19
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,378
- ARVs?
- Average restroom visits.

Oh, I'm so proud of you two boys.

22
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:50,344
Come on, Gilbert. Let's go to college.

23
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,971
(braying laugh)

24

Hey, Lewis, what time you got?
I'm tryin' to work out our exact ETA.

25
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:31,301
I got two thirty-seven.
Dad, how fast are we going?

26
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,721
I've got the old cruise control set at 35.

27
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,631
Adams College, home of the Atoms.

28
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,676
Gilbert, this is gonna be really neat.

29
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,429
I sure hope so. What if it isn't, huh?

30
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,390
Don't be so negative.
We'll have the time of our lives.

31
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,976
I'm not being negative. I'm being nervous.

32
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,729
Don't be, cos everything's gonna be great.

33
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,773
- Just like high school, right?
- This is college.

34
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:31,445
Remember, there are
6,127 students at Adams.

35
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,156
- 58 per cent of which are girls.
- So?

36
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,576
So that's 7,107.32 boobs.

37

38

You college guys are all alike.
All you really care about is gettin' laid.

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,338

41
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,642
(Lewis) Wow! This campus is awesome.

42
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:07,940
It's a lot bigger than I expected. Maybe
we should have just gone to City Tech, huh?

43
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:13,445
Tech's nothin'. You know Adams has got
the best computer department in the country.

44
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:17,115
Yeah, you're right. Adams is the best.

45
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,225
(Mr Skolnick) Well, boys...
I mean "men"...here we are.

46
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,360
What an opportunity for you guys.
You're both gonna do great.

47
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:57,948
I'm proud of you. Your father would
have been proud of you, too, Gilbert.

48
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:03,412
I know, Mr Skolnick. Don't tell my mother
I was nervous. I wouldn't want her to worry.

49
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,956
- Of course not. Don't sweat it.
- Thanks.

Hey, Lewis, come here. Sit down.

52
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,382
I envy you, Lewis.

53
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:19,094
This is one of the finest institutions
in the country.

54
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,389
You're gonna do fantastic here.

55
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,852
Try not to break too many hearts.

56
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,146
That hasn't been a real problem yet.

57
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,357
Come on, you're gonna make
some lucky girl very happy.

58
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,485
You're smart, easy-going.

59
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,279

61
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,411
And you got a great sense of humour.
I really believe in you, son.

62
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:48,040
- Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down.
- I know.

63
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,084
Gilbert, help me with the trunk.

64
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,548
- Uh, Gilbert?
- Yes, sir?

65
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,510
College isn't like high school.

66
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,972
You'll be on your own.
I want you to take care of yourself.

67
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:07,809
I will. Anyway, I won't be alone. I got Lewis.

68

Besides, we're college men now, right?

69
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,689
- Right.
- Ow.

- Excuse us.

You know, Gilbert, I feel different already.

83
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:22,342
Like... more mature.

84
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,761
Looks like we're in for quite a change.

85
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:30,100
I'll say. Parties, meeting new people.
This is really gonna be great.

- Where are they?
- I think they're talking about us.

94

- No way.
- Nerds!

the bed by the window, I'll take it.

- Yep. Definite possibilities.

Do you think they'd let us put in
a little refrigerator for snacks?

108
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,519
Are you kiddin', Gilbert? We can put
a fridge and a microwave right there.

109

That'd be a good place

I don't know about the best.
It'll be the messiest.

Wait a minute. We're allowed
to have girls in our dorm room?

All right, men. I want everybody to listen up.
We're movin' out, and I mean now!

154
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:47,603
Move it! Move it! Move, move, move!

155
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,526
(jock) Get outta here!

156
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,237
(whistle)

157
00:13:57,321 --> 00:14:02,993
All right, listen up. I'm gonna see to it that
each and every one of you is taken care of.

158
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:07,998
You will be provided with the best possible
food, shelter and accommodation.

159
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,499
(laughter)

160
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,420
- We will try to provide you...
- Now let's move it out!

161
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,715
Move it! Move, move, move! Move it!

162
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,884
(jocks jeer)

163
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,722
Move it!

164
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:27,017
Get outta here!

165
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,396
(all chant) Nerds! Nerds!
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

166
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,195
(chanting continues)

167
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,455
(Dean) I know this move
has been sudden for all of you,

168
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,210
and you're probably all still very disoriented.

169
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:59,341
I do want to assure you that this move
is in no way permanent. It's only temporary.

170
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:05,681
As you see, we've provided accommodations
for you that are... quite acceptable.

171
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,559
It'll be a nice place
for you to enjoy your studies.

172
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,769
(boy) I don't even wanna go to college.

173
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:14,481
You have a special gift.
You need college to develop it.

174
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:16,608
I wanna be with people my own age.

175
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:19,778
You will be with people your own age
when you're older.

176
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:24,867
But you can't drop me off in a gymnasium.
It looks like we're refugees from a war.

177
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,245
We gotta go now, honey.
Your dad has an appointment.

178
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,414
Bye, son.

179
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,668
(Dean) It is really very comfortable here.

180
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:39,423
Is there anyone here with allergies?

181
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,594
Me too. Uh, for those of you
who do have allergies,

182
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,013
you can request a foam rubber pillow.

183
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:50,893
Also, there's a television
for your viewing pleasure.

184
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:53,770
It is a black and white television.

185
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:58,650
More good news.
Because of the housing situation,

186
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:02,571
we are allowing the freshman class
to join and live in fraternities.

187
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,698
(all) Yeah!

188
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,701
The fraternities will select
their members tomorrow.

189
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,161
(whistle)

190
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:12,998
All right! Enough of this
social bullshit. Grab a cot.

191
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,751
Move it or lose it!

192
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,047
(coach) Go, son.

193
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,673
Move!

194
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,301
Move, move, move, move, move!

195
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:35,687
(Dean on PA) And the Delta Kappa Gamma
fraternity has selected as its new members

196
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:39,233
Oliver Scott and Bill Daniels.

197
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:44,446
(Dean) For those of you
who weren't selected by any fraternities,

198
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,366
you won't be left out in the cold.

199
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,620
You can stay here in the gym
for as long as you like.

200
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,916
Or at least until basketball season.

201
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,212
Please answer when I call out your names.

202
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,715
Poindexter, Arnold.

203
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,053
Latrelle, Lamar.

204
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,639
(effeminately) Lamar Latrelle.

205
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,810
Wormser, Harold.

206
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:15,978
Present.

207
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:18,605
Takashi, Toshiro.

208
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,983
Ah, here, sir.

209
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:25,320
Dawson, Dudley.

210
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,364
Call me "Booger".

211
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,408
All right... Booger.

212
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,827
Rakhim, Raj.

213
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,164
Ah, excuse, please,
but why do they call you "Booger"?

214
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,584
I don't know.

215
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,670
Posquito, Lawrence.

216
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,049
Daniels, Paul.

217
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,844
I knew nobody'd pick us, Lewis.

218
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:53,140
Gilbert, it's probably not over yet.
There's a fraternity for us.

219
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,225
(Dean) Dooley, Edward.

220
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,728
Yozonski, Yosef.

221
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:06,445
- Wait a second. Are you sure about this?
- Gilbert, yes. Come on.

222
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,913
(Lewis) Hi, girls.

223
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,707
Are you guys looking to join a sorority?

224
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,626
A sorority?

225
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,212
No!

226
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:29,509
We need some help. We figured pretty girls
like you might be able to suggest a fraternity.

227
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:35,182
Choosing the right fraternity can be one of
the most important decisions in a man's life.

228
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:39,102
- For sure.
- Guys like you have to choose very carefully.

229
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,481
- Definitely.
- Tell us what frat do you think is us.

230
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:46,151
- You guys are Alpha Betas all the way.
- Totally. For sure.

231
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:50,572
What? Wait. Aren't Alpha Betas,
like, all jocks and face men?

232
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:55,869
Yes. But you guys have got that certain
something I know they'd be interested in.

233
00:18:55,953 --> 00:19:00,165
- I'll tell 'em you're coming.
- Should we ask for a particular Alpha Beta?

234
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,918
- Stan Gable.
- And you're?

235
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,504
Betty Childs.

236
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,340
Thank you, Betty. Ms Childs.

237
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:13,095
Maybe if you're not busy sometime
we could have a cup of coffee or somethin'.

238
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,389
Come on, pal.

239
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:18,475
(Gilbert) I can't believe you asked her out.

240
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:23,230
(Lewis) You know, Gilbert, if we get in,
maybe we can have our old room back.

241
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:26,817
- (Gilbert) These guys will never accept us.
- Why wouldn't they?

242
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,071
These are the Alpha Betas.
They're the football players.

243
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,825
I don't think Ms Childs
would have sent us over here

244
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,161
if she didn't think we had
a decent chance of getting in.

245
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,206
(door creaks)

246
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,292
- (eerily) Yes?
- Hi.

247
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,838
Tell Stan Gable that we're the guys
that Betty Childs sent over.

248
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,465
Follow me, boys.

249
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,634
(door creaks)

250
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,554
Gilbert!

251
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,751
(solemnly) Welcome.

252
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,920
(both) Hi.

253
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,840
(Stan) Hey!

254
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:36,845
You guys seem pretty cool.
Take these for later.

255
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:42,267
Rubbers? What do we need rubbers for?

256
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,520
(sheep bleats)

257
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:49,942
(Stan) Let the initiation begin.

258
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,487
(jock) Have you ever made love to a woman?

259
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,530
- Yes.
- No.

260
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:56,448
- No.
- Yes.

261
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,451
(jocks) Liars!

262
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:02,371
(TV) All right, let's go for the burn.

263
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,040
(horrible tuneless scraping)

264
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:13,215
- OK, Takashi, whaddaya got?
- Oh, I think I have a frush.

265
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,176
- What the fuck is a "frush"?
- A frush.

266
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,221
I got two sevens,
and two sevens beats a frush.

267
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,681
Oh, thank you.

268
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,684
(tuneless violin playing continues)

269
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,822
- Oh!
- Jesus.

270
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:42,578
(violin stops)

271
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:52,504
So, getting into a fraternity can be the most
important thing in a man's life, huh?

272
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:56,049
You know, that cheerleader set us up, Lewis.

273
00:21:56,133 --> 00:22:00,304
I really don't think Betty Childs
is that kind of person, Gilbert.

274
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:04,850
Hey, Lewis?

275
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:07,019
What is it, Gilbert?

276
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,316
I'm really sorry that I snapped at you.
This gym's really gettin' to me.

277
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,610
It's OK. I understand.

278
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:18,906
Tomorrow morning we'll find
a better place to live, OK?

279
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,909
- Good night, Gilbert.
- Good night, Lewis.

280
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,746
- Good night, Lamar.
- Good night, Wormser.

281
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:29,625
- Good night, Takashi.
- Good night, Poindexter.

282
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,794
- Good night, Booger.
- (loud belch)

283
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:35,214
(all laugh)

284
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:40,344
(thud)

285
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,146
Hey, take it easy. The computer's your friend.

286
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,607
I wasn't meant to interface with a machine.

287
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,443
Well, you're just beginning. Relax.

288
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,988
It's no use. It's inhuman.

289
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:03,450
It's not inhuman.
Only humans can be inhuman.

290
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,203
Here, let me show you.

291
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,293
Working with a computer's great.

292
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:16,755
I mean, it's godlike, in a way,

293
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:19,675
cos you can have complete control.

294
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,388
- That's good.
- Thanks.

295
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:30,727
You know, some people,
they can create with their hands.

296
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:36,024
But when you're working with a computer,
you gotta build something with your mind.

297
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:41,154
If you're good, you can do somethin'
no one's ever seen before.

298
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:44,199
It's a definite high.

299
00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:54,251
Uh... what's your name?

300
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,879
- Judy.
- Hi, Judy. Gilbert.

301
00:23:57,254 --> 00:24:00,883
- (Judy) Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

302
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,600
- Hello, Lewis.
- Hi, Gilbert.

303
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:13,562
- Did you find a house?
- No.

304
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,772
I met a girl.

305
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:18,066
Gilbert!

306
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,612
- Her name's Judy.
- Judy's a nice name, Gilbert.

307
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:25,616
- Yeah. She's a nice girl.
- Big deal. Did you get in her pants?

308
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:29,369
- She's not that kind of a girl.
- Why? Does she have a penis?

309
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,293
You gonna eat this?

310
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:44,718
- Smell this one, nerd.
- Oh, Coach, Coach.

311
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:48,180
I got to find a place to live.
Is OK I leave early?

312
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,682
No.

313
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,101
Oh, OK.

314
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,645
- You know karate?
- No.

315
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:56,605
Good.

316
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:03,111
I've programmed him with
all the rental units in the area.

317
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:07,157
For optimum efficiency,
I've assigned each of you a part of the list.

318
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:11,787
This'll prevent doubling up.
We'll be able to blanket the area in no time.

319
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,997
Booger.

320
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:16,583
Wormser.

321
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:19,294
Toshiro.

322
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,886
(speaks Japanese)

323
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,890
(replies in Japanese)

324
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,393
Nerd!

325
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:48,031
- Hi.
- All right?

326
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:51,034
- Mr Wilson?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,080
Just checking.

328
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:58,166
(woman) Hi there, big boy.

329
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,962
Hi. I came about the room for rent.

330
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:06,216
It's right next to mine.
It'll be perfect for us.

331
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:11,513
(buzzer)

332
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:16,852
(man) Who's there? What do you want?

333
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:20,564
- Is this the Stewart residence?
- Why are you here? What do you want?

334
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,567
- I've come about the room.
- Go away.

335
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,861
- Do you have a room to rent?
- Not for rent.

336
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:28,405
- I thought it was for rent.
- Fuck off.

337
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,457
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Gilbert.

338
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,876
- How are you?
- Fine. Where are you going?

339
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,712
I gotta go find a place to live.

340
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:48,217
- It's horrible you having to live in the gym.
- Oh, yeah, well...

341
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:51,720
- What is that? Is that yours?
- It's my accordion.

342
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:53,931
- You play the accordion?
- Yeah.

343
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,183
- I love the accordion.
- Really?

344
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:59,811
- Are you very good, or?
- No, not really.

345
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:02,481
I'm on my way to class.
Do you wanna walk with me?

346
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:05,150
Yeah, sure. Oh, no. Here, let me get it.

347
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,953
- I think I found a house.
- (nerds cheer)

348
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:18,455
(Booger) About fuckin' time!

349
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:26,296
Isn't it fantastic?

350
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,591
(? "One Foot In Front Of The Other"
by Bone Symphony)

351
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,615
(imitates Dracula) Welcome.

352
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:16,096
- Are you feeling anything yet, Takashi?
- Oh, Booger, I feel nothing.

353
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,682
You better have another hit.

354
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:31,570
Oh, this counter. Could be good.

355
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,457
Agh!

356
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,005
- Feeling anything now?
- Oh, no.

357
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:54,509
I feeling... nothing... at all.

358
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:58,472
How about now?

359
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,669
I can't believe what
they've done to that house.

360
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,588
That's amazing.

361
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:36,301
- Looks terrific, doesn't it, Stan?
- Yeah, well, it won't look terrific for long.

362
00:29:37,594 --> 00:29:40,264
What are you lookin' at, nerd? Huh?

363
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:47,771
I thought I was looking at my mother's
old douche bag, but that's in Ohio.

364
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:51,066
Seven and eight. And stretch those arms.

365
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,653
Come on. Looks great. Come on, Wormser.

366
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,744
- Morning, Poindexter.
- Uh.

367
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:07,249
Agh! Excuse me.

368
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:14,006
Ah, thank you very much.

369
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,760
OK, Takashi, show me your cards.

370
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:21,471
OK. Two and four kings. That's good, yes?

371
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:25,017
No, you got too many kings.
So you gotta get rid of these here.

372
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,355
Take three of these kings out,
and replace them with... three fresh cards.

373
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:33,192
Oh, OK. Thank you.

374
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:37,070
- (Toshiro) When do I deal?
- (Booger) You gotta win a hand first.

375
00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:40,157
I told you we'd find a better place.

376
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,452
Yeah. This is way better than the dorm.

377
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,748
(motorcycle drives away)

378
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,089
It says "Nerds get out."

379
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:58,217
What is a nerd?

380
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,385
We are.

381
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:05,933
I don't know what this world is comin' to.
You see that man over there?

382
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:08,810
We arrested him for mopery.

383
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:13,857
- What's mopery?
- Exposing yourself to a blind person.

384
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:19,613
I'm sorry about your windows, fellas.
It's out of my jurisdiction.

385
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:24,368
Sounds like a fraternity prank. There's only
one organisation that can handle this.

386
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,954
What organisation is that?

387
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:30,082
The Greek Council.

388
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:34,336
(Dean) Our next order of business:
New membership.

389
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,130
Earl, show the petitioners in, please.

390
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:48,308
(sniggering)

391
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,937
Shh!

392
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,067
Kneel, gentlemen.

393
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:06,869
You are the gentlemen
who wish to form a fraternity?

394
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:09,037
(nerds) Yes, sir.

395
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:17,045
Gentlemen,
as president of the Greek Council,

396
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:20,674
I'm sorry to inform you
that your membership has been denied.

397
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:23,051
Excuse me, but... why?

398
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:27,681
According to our charter, you must
have a national fraternity as your sponsor.

399
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:29,892
Do you have one?

400
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:31,602
(all) No.

401
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:37,024
- I'm afraid he's right.
- But with a national sponsor, we're in, right?

402
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:41,778
Right, right. So I guess
we'll see you in about, say... 20 years.

403
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:44,198
(laughter)

404
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,868
(tuneless scraping)

405
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:55,250
"Dear sirs, thank you for applying
to Delta Kappa Gamma."

406
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:59,504
"We have gone over your application,
and it wasn't even close."

407
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:04,134
"In the future, we recommend
that you not include a group photo."

408
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:08,555
That's 29 rejections so far.
Did we send pictures to everybody?

409
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:13,894
Yeah. Everybody except for...
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

410
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,147
Here's one that will see us.

411
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,066
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda?

412
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:22,402
Yeah. They're gonna love us.

413
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:30,035
As you know, we have
no chapter at Adams College,

414
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:32,663
which is why we agreed to see you.

415
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:38,585
But I must tell you, gentlemen, you have
very little chance of becoming Tri-Lambdas.

416
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:41,922
I'm in a difficult situation here.

417
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:44,633
I mean, after all...

418
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:47,177
you're nerds.

419
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:54,434
According to your bylaws,
you have to take us on a 60-day trial basis.

420
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,563
- I beg your pardon?
- According to your bylaws...

421
00:33:57,646 --> 00:34:03,902
He's right, UN. Any group that petitions
can become a probationary Tri-Lamb chapter.

422
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:06,071
May I see that, please?

423
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:10,075
Thank you.

424
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:20,502
Well, gentlemen...
you are now probationary Tri-Lambs.

425
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:24,006
- Hey.
- Great, UN. Why don't we have a party?

426
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:29,511
You can celebrate with us and observe us
to make sure we're Tri-Lamb material, OK?

427
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:31,555
- Great.
- We won't let you down.

428
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:35,434
We'll have the highest grade-point
average of any chapter you've got.

429
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:41,356
We certainly won't discriminate. Our chapter
will be open to people of all races and creeds.

430
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,775
And sexual orientation.

431
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:47,112
Wonderful.

432
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,157
(door bell)

433
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,247
Hi. Remember me?

434
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,375
- No.
- Well, we're having a party Saturday night.

435
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,628
Would you like to come?

436
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,214
- No.
- Oh, well...

437
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:07,883
(girls'laughter)

438
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,135
Come on, get it up! Get it up! C'mon!

439
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:13,472
You're shit! You're nothin'!
You're scum! You suck!

440
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:16,141
- You're nice!
- No, I'm not!

441
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,352
- Stan?
- Attaway, Ogre.

442
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:21,563
- What's up, Betty? Is somethin' wrong?
- Yeah.

443
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,942
- What?
- One of those nerds just asked me out.

444
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:28,362
- Which one?
- I don't know. They all look alike to me.

445
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,657
- Yeah.
- They can't get any dates for their party.

446
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,869
- Oh, yeah?
- I'll eat their ancestors. I'll kill their parents!

447
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:40,624
No, Ogre. Ogre! Don't worry about it.
Wait a second. Just wait a second.

448
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:45,379
Maybe we could help 'em out.

449
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:47,297
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

450
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:50,759
And I know just what to do.

451
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:52,386
Come here.

452
00:35:56,557 --> 00:36:02,563
We'll put the bar here, the hors d'oeuvres
over there, and we'll pass the cheese puffs.

453
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,648
- Oh, good.
- That sounds expensive.

454
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:09,319
This party's important. If we don't impress
the Tri-Lambs, we'll never get in.

455
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:13,740
- Maybe we can have robster craws.
- What the fuck are "robster craws"?

456
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:17,369
- Have any of you got dates, besides Gilbert?
- I do.

457
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:20,706
- Yeah, but that's with a guy.
- What about you, Booger?

458
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,084
I've been out combing
the high schools all day.

459
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:28,130
- Maybe we should cancel the party.
- No, we can't cancel the party.

460

00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:32,743
- You got other angles?
- Something else?

617
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:36,205
- Go to their room.
- Yeah.

618
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,543
- That's her.
- Go to the right. Go to the right.

619
00:51:41,627 --> 00:51:44,922
Arnold, that's the girl we saw.

620
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:47,424
- (Lewis) Go up.
- (Lamar) Up?

621
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:51,053
Wait a second. Hold it there, Lamar.
Don't move the camera.

622
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:52,763
(Toshiro) Oh!

623
00:51:52,846 --> 00:51:54,640
(nerds) Ah!

624
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,854
I drink to that.

625
00:52:02,147 --> 00:52:06,235
- (Booger) Oh, yes. I like that nightie.
- (Toshiro) Oh, that's very good.

626
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,988
- (Lewis) Can you go in that room?
- (Lamar) Yeah.

627
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:12,157
(nerds snigger)

628
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:15,410
(Toshiro) Oh, here she comes.

629
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,664
God! Take your towel off, please.

630
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:22,376
(Lewis) Oh, yes!

631
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:24,670
Is she cold in there, or what?

632
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:26,922
(braying laugh)

633
00:52:32,135 --> 00:52:34,221
(Gilbert) Focus!

634
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,938
This is bullshit. I want bush. Pan down.

635
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:46,149
(nerds cheer)

636
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:49,486
We've got bush. We've got bush.

637
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,405
Oh, hair pie!

638
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:54,324
(all laugh)

639
00:52:54,783 --> 00:52:56,660
Agh!

640
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:14,803
I'm tired of watching 'em brush their teeth.
See if Betty's up. Dooley, throw me a beer.

641
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:17,264
Thanks.

642
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:21,143
Oh, I getting tired of Betty.

643
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:23,353
Are you kidding? Zoom in.

644
00:53:24,938 --> 00:53:29,568
I could never get tired of Betty. How could
you ever get tired of that ass, Takashi?

645
00:53:29,651 --> 00:53:32,487
Oh, I see your point.

646
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,284
Are you guys still watching the Pis?

647
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,786
- (all) Yes.
- Have you been up all night?

648
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,371
Yes.

649
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:45,500
- Wormser, haven't you had enough?
- No.

650
00:53:46,543 --> 00:53:49,338
(Lewis) I think we got even with the Pis.

651
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:52,883
Now we got a little score to settle
with the Alpha Betas.

652
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:55,677
(braying laugh)

653
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:02,351
- Shit! Hank, what is that stuff?
- Liquid Heat.

654
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:06,939
- It burns.
- You ought to feel it when I don't dilute it.

655
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:15,113
(Toshiro) Get them.

656
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:19,368
Make a pile here.

657
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:28,001
(Toshiro) OK. Here goes.

658
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,840
OK. Don't touch, now.

659
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:38,262
- (Gilbert) Here, hit this one.
- (Toshiro) OK. Looks like salad.

660
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:42,558
The key to each season is homecoming.

661
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,563
You win that one,
you got your alumni support.

662
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:51,066
You got your alumni support,
you get that jock dorm,

663
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:54,278
you get the laundry money,
you get the new cars.

664
00:54:55,028 --> 00:55:00,158
Now, this season started out fine -
we won some big ball games.

665
00:55:00,242 --> 00:55:02,578
But we were lucky.

666
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:06,456
We can't get soft.
We can't sit back on our laurels.

667
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,793
We win homecoming, we take league.

668
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:12,921
We take league, we get a bowl bid.

669
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,465
It's as simple as that.

670
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:18,927
But, gentlemen, you have got to want it.

671
00:55:19,636 --> 00:55:22,097
- Do you want it?
- (jocks yell) Yeah!

672
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:24,433
- I can't hear you.
- Yeah!

673
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:27,644
We can't let up. We gotta stay tough.

674
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:30,439
You can do it. You can do it.

675
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:33,275
You can do it. You can do it.

676
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,320
You gotta believe that you can do it!

677
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:40,991
- You gotta let them know that you want it!
- I want it!

678
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:42,951
- Good.
- (groans)

679
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:45,120
Shower up!

680
00:55:45,204 --> 00:55:47,789
(jocks groan in pain)

681
00:55:48,832 --> 00:55:51,335
Shit. We forgot to practise.

682
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,131
- You put what?
- (Gilbert) Liquid Heat.

683
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:59,343
- On their what?
- In their jocks.

684
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,095
- That's outrageous.
- Are you angry, UN?

685
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:07,017
No. I'm not angry.

686
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,896
I'm glad to see you nerds...
you guys finally fought back.

687
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:14,816
You'd make a fine addition to Tri-Lambda.
I want to welcome you aboard.

688
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,361
- Congratulations.
- All right!

689
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:21,615
- You'll tell the guys?
- Oh, I will. (braying laugh)

690
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,701
OK, everybody ready?

691
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:27,246
OK, I focus now.

692
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:29,873
I set timer.

693
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:33,293
- Now say "Hi, UN."
- (all) Hi, UN.

694
00:56:37,714 --> 00:56:41,593
(Lewis) Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to UN Jefferson,

695
00:56:42,177 --> 00:56:46,723
who, in his ultimate wisdom,
chose to accept us

696
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:50,060
into our new fraternity,
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

697
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:52,646
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda.

698
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:06,827
Before we take this matter to a vote,
I would like it clearly stated in the record...

699
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,787
Miss Childs...

700
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:13,709
that the evidence is
overwhelmingly against the Alpha Betas,

701
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:16,753
and I urge that they be found guilty.

702
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,922
Point of order.

703
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:23,927
Dean Ulich, I am an Alpha Beta,

704
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:26,680
and I know that no member of my fraternity

705
00:57:26,763 --> 00:57:31,393
could have perpetrated such
a callous, heinous act against the nerds...

706
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:33,687
or the Tri-Lambs.

707
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:38,525
Therefore, I feel a vote at this time
would be, shall we say, premature.

708
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:40,861
- Premature?
- Yes.

709
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,113
You see, instead,

710
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:47,910
I am going to organise a special,
blue-ribbon, fact-finding commission,

711
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:52,164
made up of myself and... Miss Betty Childs.

712
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:55,542
We will get to the bottom
of this dastardly deed.

713
00:57:55,626 --> 00:57:59,838
- Wait a minute, you can't get away with this.
- Oh, no, I'm afraid I can.

714
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:05,010
You see, only the president
of the Greek Council can call a vote.

715
00:58:05,093 --> 00:58:08,055
- That's completely unfair.
- This is bullshit!

716
00:58:08,138 --> 00:58:09,932
Meeting adjourned.

717
00:58:16,688 --> 00:58:20,817
Guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake
as long as Stan Gable is president.

718
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:24,571
The only way to become president
is to win the homecoming carnival.

719
00:58:24,655 --> 00:58:28,700
That's right, Arnold. And that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

720
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:30,911
(fanfare)

721
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:39,503
I take great pleasure in officially opening
this year's homecoming carnival.

722
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:41,964
(cheering)

723
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:53,267
(Dean) The overall winner
will be determined by total points from:

724
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,103
Number one - field events,

725
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:59,690
number two - the charity fund-raising booth,

726
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:04,570
and number three -
the musical show and skit competition.

727
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:08,282
And now, let the games begin!

728
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:11,702
(cheering and fanfare)

729
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:22,671
OK. The object of the race
is to complete 20 laps around the track,

730
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:25,924
while stopping every lap
for a mandatory pit stop,

731
00:59:26,008 --> 00:59:28,886
at which time the driver will chug a beer.

732
00:59:29,928 --> 00:59:32,222
You don't have a fucking chance, nerd.

733
00:59:32,306 --> 00:59:35,934
- Oh, thank you. Good luck to you, too, Burke.
- Fuck off.

734
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:39,146

You got 'em! Kick his ass!

741

742
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:29,029

Come on!

745
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:45,003
- One more lap.
- It's just you and the Alpha Betas.

746
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:48,966
- Danny, let that nerd beat you, you're nothin'!
- No sweat.

747
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:52,302
- He no stand no chance now.
- Go, Takashi!

748

Go on! Let's go, Burke!

749

Oh, no!

750
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:59,685

Oh, I won!

755
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:31,508
Times are changin', Betty.
These nerds are a threat to our way of life.

756
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:35,095
If they win homecoming,
they'll take over the Greek Council.

757
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:37,848
And we'll be up to our necks in nerd shit!

758

01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:50,939
Ooh, ah...

772
01:03:51,023 --> 01:03:53,609
(Coach) On your mark. Set.

773
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:56,278
(whistle)

774
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:01,867
You win.

775
01:04:07,164 --> 01:04:09,666
(Dean chuckles)

776
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:21,595
I'm not too wild about this next event,
but it has become a tradition here at Adams.

777
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:23,305
The belching contest.

778
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:29,019
Our first of two finalists,
Frederick W Polowoski.

779
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:33,398
Ogre You Asshole.

780
01:04:34,191 --> 01:04:36,068
Ogre.

781
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:43,492
(belches loudly and long)

782
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:46,245
(cheering and applause)

783
01:04:57,339 --> 01:05:01,885
And, from the Lambda-Mu team,
Dudley Dawson.

784
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:04,054
- Booger.
- Booger.

785
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:14,231
(belches louder and longer)

786
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:34,877
Our next event goes all the way back to
the Peloponnesian War - the javelin throw.

787
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:14,917
- All right, baby!
- What did you expect?

788
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,544
You won it.

789
01:06:17,628 --> 01:06:19,713
(laughter)

790
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:25,969
- (Gilbert) Wait for Lamar's throw.
- (Judy) How come?

791
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:29,765
Wormser's a master at aerodynamics.
He designed the javelin to fit

792
01:06:29,848 --> 01:06:32,434
with Lamar's limp-wristed throwing style.

793
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:37,773
(? Parody of music from "Chariots of Fire")

794
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,882
Wormser, it worked!

795
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,260
I can't believe it. Did you see that?

796
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:15,561
I love you all. I love you all.

797
01:07:15,644 --> 01:07:17,729
Thank you. Thank you.

798
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:27,673
(Dean on PA) The Alpha Beta-Pi team leads.
The Lambda-Mus are a surprising second.

799
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:31,385
Now let's see what happens
at the charity fund-raising booths.

800
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,221
Eat a Pi for charity. C'mon, let's go!

801
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,689
Take a break, Chip.

802
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,527
Hi.

803
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:53,073
- Hi, Betty.
- A nerd.

804
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:59,580
- I'm not kissing a nerd.
- You have to. I've paid my money.

805
01:08:01,165 --> 01:08:03,584
It's time for my break.

806
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,587
Kiss this, nerd.

807
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:09,840
- (Betty) Stan?
- Yeah?

808
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:15,262
I wanna do it.
All this kissing's made me horny.

809
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:17,931
God, Betty. You're like a goat.

810
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:24,521
Next.

811
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:55,135
Stan!

812
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,599
Changed your mind.

813
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,729
I'm glad. Come on.

814
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:15,155
(Lewis mimics Darth Vader's breathing)

815
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,378
D'you wanna do it on the moon?

816
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:51,191
Take off your mask.

817
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:53,360
Oh, Stan.

818
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:55,738
You're so kinky.

819
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:04,872
(Booger) Eat a Pi for charity.
C'mon, step right up. C'mon, step up.

820
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:08,667
Eat Pi for charity. Thank you very much.

821
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:10,419
Eat a Pi for charity.

822
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:15,799
- Gable, how we doing?
- Great. 1258 bucks. Better than last year.

823
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:19,595
- The nerds are over 2,000.
- For selling pies?

824
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:23,599
They got a line around the corner.
Guys are buying two, three pies apiece.

825
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:27,936
There's something fishy about these pies.
C'mon, let's go check it out.

826
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:40,032
This can't be. Ogre, go get a pie.
Find out what the hell's goin' on here.

827
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,080
Thanks, wimp. Get yourself one.

828
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,834
- Well? How is it?
- Good.

829
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:53,629
- Is it good or is it great?
- It's good.

830
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:56,298
Just good?
Then what they sellin' so many for?

831
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:59,385
This why. Uh-oh.

832
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,725
That's my Pi.

833
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:17,736
Oh, Stan!

834
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,239
That was wonderful.

835
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:23,492
You did things to me
you've never done before.

836
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:25,160
(gasps)

837
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:27,830
- You're that nerd!
- Yeah.

838
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,875
God, you were wonderful.

839
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,836
Thanks.

840
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:39,133
- Are all nerds as good as you?
- Yes.

841
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:40,968
How come?

842
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:43,637
Cos all jocks think about is sports.

843
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:47,099
All we ever think about is sex.

844
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:51,812
- What's your name?
- Lewis.

845
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:58,027
Lewis... would you meet me
after the pep rally tonight?

846
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,987
Sure.

847
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:09,955
(Dean on PA) It's all tied up. The musical
and skit competition will decide the winner.

848
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,833
So, let the music begin!

849
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:17,254
? Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

850
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,548
? Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

851
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,218
? Life is but a dream

852
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:26,138
(cheering and applause)

853
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:31,685
What did the Pink Panther say
when he stepped on an ant?

854
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:35,397
(? "Pink Panther" tune) Dead ant. Dead ant.
Dead ant, dead ant, dead ant.

855
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,776
What is the dirtiest thing
ever said on television?

856
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:39,860
Tell me.

857
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:43,697
"Ward, I think you were
a little hard on the Beaver last night."

858
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:50,287
(all chant) Gable, Gable, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Burke can.

859
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:53,791
Burke, Burke, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Ogre can.

860
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:55,334
- Gimme an A!
- A!

861
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,086
- Gimme a D!
- D!

862
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:58,962
- Gimme an A!
- A!

863
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,631
- Gimme an M!
- M!

864
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:02,174
- Gimme an S!
- S!

865
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:05,010
- What's that spell?
- Adams!

866
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,974
? They always call him Mr Touchdown

867
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:14,561
? They always call him Mr T

868
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:17,981
? He can run and kick and throw

869
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:20,693
? Give him the ball and just look at him go

870
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:24,446
? Hip, hip, hooray for Mr Touchdown

871
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,157
? He's gonna beat 'em today

872
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:30,661
? So give a great big cheer
for the hero of the year

873
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,789
? Mr Touchdown USA

874
01:13:33,872 --> 01:13:35,165
Hurrah!

875
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:38,377
(loud cheering and applause)

876
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:56,687
(? Electronic dance music)

877
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,529
(well-played violin riff)

878
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:58,082
? Clap your hands, everybody
And everybody clap your hands

879
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:02,544
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

880
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:07,132
? We come here on stage tonight
to do our show for you

881
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:09,426
? We got a rockin' rhythm and a hi-tech sound

882
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,679
? That'll make you move
your body down to the ground

883
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:16,266
? We got Poindexter on the violin
And Lewis and Gilbert will be joinin' in

884
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:20,854
? We got Booger Presley on a mean guitar
And a rap by little old me, Lamar

885
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:23,482
? We got Takashi beating on his gong

886
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:25,693
? The boys and the Mus are clappin' along

887
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:28,028
? And just when you thought you'd seen it all

888
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:30,322
? Along comes a Lambda four foot tall

889
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,533
? So, Wormser, come on out here on the floor

890
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:34,952
? So we can work our bodies
like never before

891
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,871
? Break

892
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,738
(wild cheering and applause)

893
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:34,511
I'd like to present the trophy
to this year's champions,

894
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:37,514
Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu.

895
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:48,942
They will be able to select the president
of next year's Greek Council.

896
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:57,493
I'd like to announce we've made
our selection already. It's Gilbert Lowe!

897
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:05,250
This sucks! I gotta get rid of this anger.
C'mon, Betty, let's pump iron.

898
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,878
No, Stan. I don't think so.

899
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:11,673
What d'you mean, you don't think so?
C'mon, let's go. Why not?

900
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:14,927
I've got a date with a Tri-Lamb.

901
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,596
- A Tri-Lamb!
- Here's your pin.

902
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,642
Take it.

903
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,936
Wait. Betty...

904
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,646
C'mon.

905
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:29,191
God! I'm in love with a nerd!

906
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:33,821
- Gable.
- Yeah, Coach.

907
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:39,493
I wanna see you and the other girls
in the locker room now!

908
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,787
Yes, sir.

909
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:52,506
You know, when you were
a baby in your crib,

910
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:56,802
your father looked down at you,
he had but one hope -

911
01:17:57,428 --> 01:18:00,180
"Someday my son will grow to be a man."

912
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,601
Well, look at you now.

913
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:12,735
You just got your asses whipped
by a bunch of goddamn nerds.

914
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,239
Nerds!

915
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,494
Well, if I was you, I'd do something about it.

916
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,374
I would get up and redeem myself

917
01:18:28,459 --> 01:18:32,671
in the eyes of my father,
my Maker and my coach!

918
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:35,507
- Let's get those nerds!
- Nerds!

919
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:37,092
Nerds!

920
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:39,595
What are we waitin' for?!

921
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:52,191
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

922
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:55,402
(chanting) Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

923
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:04,995
(Stan) Come on!

924
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,748
Come on!

925
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,569
I'm a nerd.

926
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,615
Welcome to the real world.

927
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:44,535
I never really wanted to believe that.

928
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:47,329
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

929
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,998
We're nothing.

930
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:52,459
We let them destroy our house.

931
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:56,213
- We'll control the Greek Council next year.
- Big deal!

932
01:19:57,756 --> 01:20:00,926
You'll be dead by then, Gilbert.

933
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:05,305
Nobody cares. Don't you understand that?
The university doesn't care.

934
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:07,975
There's nothin' we can do about it.

935
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:11,770
We got something good goin',
and I won't let 'em take it away from us.

936
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:16,066
Gilbert, don't be a fool.
You'll just get yourself hurt again.

937
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,777
- Big deal.
- Gilbert?

938
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:27,119
(? Brass band plays marching tune)

939
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:43,886
I'd like to introduce the men
that will bring you a homecoming victory

940
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:46,513
against State tomorrow.

941
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:49,391
At defensive back,
number 38, Kevin O'Leary.

942
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:54,688
Offensive guard,
number 64, Rich Valrow.

943
01:20:56,065 --> 01:20:59,568
At centre,
number 53, Harry Reagan.

944
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:03,864
- Look who's comin'.
- Where you goin'?

945
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:07,493
You went way too far this time,
and you're not gettin' away with it.

946
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:12,456
Oh, is that right? Well, let's see if shit floats.
What do you think of that idea?

947
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,959
Come on! Put me down!
Goddamn! Put me down!

948
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:19,088
(Stan) Fire away!

949
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:21,507
Now our tri-captains.

950
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:27,638
Leading the conference in reception,
at wide receiver, number 84, Danny Burke.

951
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:33,477
Our defensive captain,
number 79, Fred Polowoski - the Ogre.

952
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:40,776
Now our two-time all-American quarterback,
number ten, Stan Gable.

953
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:48,659
Hold it, son. Hold it, hold it!

954
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:51,370
Leave him alone.
Coach, I said leave him alone.

955
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:54,540
What did you say?
I'll break his goddamn neck.

956
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:58,210
You will do nothing of the sort.
Don't touch that boy.

957
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:04,383
Says who?

958
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:09,513
Says me... you asshole.

959
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:14,560
Hold it, Coach.
You just hold it right there.

960
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:52,514
OK, kid.

961
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:56,477
Say what you gotta say.

962
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,437
Thanks.

963
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:10,699
Uh... I just wanted to say that...
that I'm a nerd.

964
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:15,996
And I'm here tonight to stand up
for the rights of other nerds.

965
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,501
I mean, all our lives we've been laughed at

966
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:23,462
and made to feel inferior.

967
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:29,593
And tonight those bastards,
they trashed our house.

968
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,304
Why?

969
01:23:32,388 --> 01:23:35,140
Because we're smart?

970
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,060
Because we look different?

971
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,771
Well, we're not.

972
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:46,360
I'm a nerd, and... I'm pretty proud of it.

973
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:54,660
Hi, Gilbert.

974
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:57,746
I'm a nerd, too.

975
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:01,583
I just found that out tonight.

976
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:04,211
We have news for the beautiful people.

977
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:08,173
There's a lot more of us than there are of you.

978
01:24:08,716 --> 01:24:10,926
I know there's alumni here tonight.

979
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:16,056
When you went to Adams,
you might have been called a spaz,

980
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:20,310
or a dork, or a geek.

981
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:23,063
Any of you that have ever felt...

982
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:27,443
stepped on, left out, picked on, put down,

983
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,197
whether you think you're a nerd or not,
why don't you come and join us?

984
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:33,782
Come on.

985

986
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:41,665
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

987
01:24:41,749 --> 01:24:44,376
Just join us, cos, uh...

988
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,961
Hi.

989
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:50,841
(Gilbert) No one's really gonna be free
until nerd persecution ends.

990
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:27,711
You know, Coach, I think I'm gonna let
these boys live over at the Alpha Beta house,

991
01:25:27,795 --> 01:25:30,673
while you and your boys rebuild theirs.

992
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:34,301
- And where the hell are we gonna live?
- What about us, huh?

993
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:37,388
You're jocks, go live in the gym.

994
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:41,725
(all, softly) Nerd. Nerd. Nerd.

995
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:44,395
(all chant loudly) Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

996
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:46,897
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

997
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,406
