- Mmm-hmm.
- Good!

335
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,335
Let's go get ready to meet some people.

336
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,136
Okay.

337
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,472
Hold the corner down. Thank you.

338
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,887
Hey. Hey, everybody.

339
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,143
Here's what's happening.

340
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,102
It's no secret that
we've been trying to have a family

341
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,934
and we got some good news.

342
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,944
I know it's all of a sudden.

343
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,025
His name is Timothy.

344
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:50,534
And please don't ask
too many questions.

345
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,994
BRENDA:<i> When were
you going to tell me,</i>

346
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,619
<i>and how old is he,
and where did he come from?</i>

347
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,502
It was all very sudden
and kind of miraculous.

348
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,920
Huh.

349
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,833
I mean, I thought
you were trying to have a real kid.

350
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,634
I mean, you know, one of your own.

351
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,927
He felt like mine
from the first time I saw him.

352
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,017
These are the coals.
I'm going to put that down for a second.

354
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,563
Well, with a little heads-up, I could've
helped with the clothes at least.

355
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,396
Hey, guys.

356
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,856
- Hey.
- Hi.

357
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,029
- How's it going?
- Yeah, good. You know.

358
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,321
- Is it going?
- Yeah.

359

How's everything going over there?

360

(WHISPERING) Who invited him?

361
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,581

- Hey, Timothy.

364
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,203
Hey.

365
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,046

366
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,248

This is my Aunt Mel and my Uncle Bub.

374
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,600
They practically raised me.

375

- Hello, Timothy.
- Hi.

376
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,608
Hello, young man.

377
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,523
Hello, old boy.

378
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,408
Did you know I invented

379
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,157
the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

380
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,539
Did you know I'm a big fan of your work?

381
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,037

382

Well, goodbye.

- Hi.
- Hey.

387
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,346
So you all came from
your mom's tummy?

388
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,141
How was that?

389
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,558
This all you got?

390
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,810
I know.

391
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,558
Who wants to play?

392
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,146
JIM SR.: The object,
boys and girls, is to dodge,

393
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,697
so how about we start with you?

394
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,773
ALL: Oh!

395
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,071
Out! You're out!

396
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,367
You got to move!

397
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,662
You got to dodge the ball, Timothy.

398
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,578
JIM SR.: Come on!
Gotta move, gotta move, gotta move.

399
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,954
Into prison. You're out.

400
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,034
CINDY: You have to coach him

401
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,994
because he clearly doesn't understand.

402
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,705
Timothy, Timothy. Timothy, Timothy.

403
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,131
Look, it's just down to five kids.

404
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,129
Move your feet. Move around.
Keep an eye on the ball.

405
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,176
JIM SR.: You're going down.

406

Stick and move,
stick and move! Come on!

Oh!

Get in there. Go. Help him out.

409
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,175
Oh!

Ahh!

412
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,101
Let's just call this...

413
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,898
I don't think this is a good idea.

414
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,191
You're not going
to spoil all the fun, are you?

415
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,611
- No, but... Could you just...
- Go, go, go, go.

416
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,314
Okay. Hey. Here we go,
here we go, here we go!

417
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,819
You got to dodge the ball.
Move your feet.

418

CINDY: Take it easy, Big Jim.
This is not the Olympics.

419

420
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,029
you never know what you're getting.

421
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,036
They have issues sometimes. Medical or

422

otherwise.

423

And if he has any issues,
we'll deal with them.

- Like any normal kid.
- Okay.

425
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,590
I mean, that's not normal.

I'm about to say this,</i>

433

after he bonked the boy
with leaves in the head?

434

Hmm. It's complicated.

- I didn't say anything.
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,709
that I would do things
differently than my dad.

439
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,885
I would be much better...

440
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,964
Jim decided that
he would be the father he never had.

441
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,725
What about you?

442
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,265
I decided that

443
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,563
our son would not be
seen as different or weird.

444
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,479
He'd be treated like a normal kid.

445
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,605
Yeah.

446
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,027
Because that's what he was going to be.

who can do this, he's the guy.

he had a doctor burn that puppy off,

that you started to lose your hair

660
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,407
and you convinced Brenda and me

661
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,993
that if we gave you ice cream at night,
it would grow back?

Cinderella, do you remember
that painting you made?

664
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,918
No. What painting?

665
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,596
You know, when your mom was your age

666
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,015
she was quite an artiste.

667
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,134
Not really. I was not.

668
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,935
Oh, she was never happier

669
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,853
than when she had
a paintbrush in her hand.

670
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,351
That's right.

671
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,435
She worked on this
one painting for days.

672
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,488
Wouldn't let anybody see it.
Had to get it right.

673
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,360
You remember that?

674
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,029
No.

675
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,611
It was a self-portrait.

676
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,500
(STAMMERING) We didn't get it.
It was ahead of its time.

678
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,963
Boy, did you cry.

679
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,048
You ran away,

680
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,799
and when you came back,
the picture was gone.

681
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,130
You'd thrown it away.

682
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,214
Oh!

683
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,221
I always felt so bad about that.

684
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,392
No!

have a little rest.

Something you want to ask me?

695
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,214
Is it true you also invented the BLT?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

- Maybe you should get him.

Yeah.

"it feels to me that with a pencil"

00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,546
All of these...

824
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,592
All of these notebooks from that day,

825
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,558
I just filled them with ideas

826
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,928
of things that I wanted to make.

827
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:11,518
Because I thought
to be a part of making something,

828
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,602
that was a great feeling.

829
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,363
God, to think that
we may not be making these any more.

830
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,580
Why not make a new kind of pencil?

831
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,586
- That's easier said than done.
- Yeah.

832
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,255
Well, you can design it

833
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,547
and you can draw it.

834
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,928
Then you guys can both build it.

835
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,806
I want to write a note to Joni.

836
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,388

something's not possible?</i>

838

840

We didn't want to disappoint him.

841
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:57,268
No. We got busy.

00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:59,186
JIM: Not that we thought
that we could do it.

843
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:00,809
CINDY: At least Timothy
would know that we tried.

844
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,141
JIM:<i> Yeah. We stayed up
all that first night.</i>

845
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,230
CINDY:<i> We stayed up
several nights after that.</i>

846
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:05,435
JIM:<i> Cindy started making sketches.</i>

847
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:06,770
CINDY:<i> Jim started carving.</i>

848
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:10,653
<i>It turns out we weren't
the only ones making something.</i>

849
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:14,828
JIM:<i> Yeah. We both came up
with the idea to use leaves.</i>

850
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:15,904
CINDY:<i> Leaves.</i>

851
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,252
See? Now just wind it.
The other way. Yeah. You got it.

852
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,007
Just a little more.

853
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:30,217
JONI: Yeah, see?
Just put it right through.

854
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:32,170
- Like this?
- That's good.

855
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,966
CINDY: So we've got
our leaf slurry pretty much ready.

856
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:38,310
JIM: Okay. Right on in.

857
00:56:40,345 --> 00:56:41,847
- Perfect.
- That should do it.

858
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:44,850
Let's see. Help it... Help it push it down.

859
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,273
Okay.

860
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:48,774
Oh, yeah!

861
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:53,696
Okay.

862
00:56:54,442 --> 00:56:56,319
BOTH: Ta-da!

863
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:59,656
Oh, my gosh!
This is the pencil. You really did it.

864
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,116
CINDY: - We did.
- You made it.

865
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,624
So we're to believe
that you made a pencil out of leaves?

866
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:07,164
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, it was a prototype.

867
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:10,171
You do realize if any part of
your story doesn't check out,

868
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,672
we are done here.

869
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:14,300
And we will be
checking it out. Thoroughly.

870
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:15,505
- And you should.
- Well, good.

871
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:19,809
Anyway, that Monday
was take your kid to work day.

872
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:21,553

<i>and the next thing you know...</i>

883
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,870
Little man, what do you think of that?

884
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:48,747
Not much.

885
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,628
Well, that's honest.

886
00:57:50,707 --> 00:57:51,754
Timothy's very honest, ma'am.

887
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:56,009
That was done by a renowned artist
at great expense.

888
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:57,760
I would have done it for free.

889

Are you suggesting
you could do it better?

890

You know, that you do with your arms

1009

Fine.

1029
01:05:54,565 --> 01:05:58,741
I don't think that
you're the best influence on my son,

and I want you
to tell me what you know about him.

I thought so.

1033

So you know that he's got...

1034
01:06:07,662 --> 01:06:09,209
You know that he's different.

1035
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,674
Yeah. It's what I like about him.

1036
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:15,257
Well, it's a hard world to be different in.

1037
01:06:16,379 --> 01:06:17,756
And I don't want him to be hurt.

1038
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:20,216
By you or anyone. I won't let it happen.

1039
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:21,433
That's good.

1040

What is this?

1041
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:28,266
He's going to be misunderstood.

1042
01:06:29,725 --> 01:06:31,727
Lots of people hate anything different.

1043
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:35,319
I wish it wasn't this way, but

1044
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:38,571
I wish a lot of things. I wish...

01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:20,284
Yeah. Timothy and I did it together.

Yeah, we made mistakes
trying to fix our mistakes.

1057

Tell me, what would you do differently?

1058
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:41,843
We'd make better mistakes?

1059

- Better?
- Different. New.

have time to waste.

crack his knuckles,
