Previously on...
<i>Suits</i>

2
00:00:01,537 --> 00:00:02,757
We just went
through a civil war,

3
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:03,763
and the world knows it.

4
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,031
You're using
privileged information

5
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:06,199
to target our clients.

6
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,034
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

7
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,782
I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

8
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:12,271
I did nothing wrong.

9
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,373
Jesus!

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,707
You're the guy
that nobody wants

11
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:15,842
but we can't get rid of.

12
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,276
You order me to rescind
an offer

13
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:19,045
due to a firm-wide
hiring freeze.

14
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,047
Two minutes later,
you hire a fifth-year.

15
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,181
Katrina Bennett.

16
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,850
I need you to waive
my non-compete

17
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,985
so I can take a position
at another firm.

18
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,087
- You went to Louis?
- He didn't betray us, Harvey.

19
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,856
He found the problem.

20
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,693
You may have fended off
this attack,

21
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:35,201
but we're not
the only ones circling.

22
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,897
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

23
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,899
I want my name
on the door.

24
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:52,578
Nice!

25
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,654
- Ugh!
- H-o-r-s.

26
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,656
That means you get an "e,"
you lose.

27
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,258
- Thank you. I can spell.
- Too bad you can't shoot.

28
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,759
Crumpled paper.

29
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,361
Winners don't blame
the ball or the rim

30
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,029
or the wind speed
in a closed-off room.

31
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:11,197
The fan was on.

32
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:12,565
Excuses don't win
championships.

33
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,033
Oh, yeah? Did Michael Jordan
tell you that?

34
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,169
No.
I told him.

35
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:18,738
Come on.
All right.

36
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,374
That was going in.
We're in the middle of a game!

37
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,475
If you two
are playing horse,

38
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,110
then one of you needs
to thank me.

39
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,578
Thank you.

40
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:28,281
Pussies.
Out.

41
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:29,482
Would you like to finish
this game?

42
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,083
Winner gets to be
name partner.

43
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,386
See, that's funny because
you're already name partner--

44
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:34,987
Derek Portis died
this weekend.

45
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:36,322
What took him so long?

46
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,723
- Harvey.
- What?

47
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,659
He lived a long life.
He was an old man.

48
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,828
- He was 56.
- Didn't look a day under 70.

49
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:43,496
Man dies,
and the first thing you think

50
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,465
to say is that
he looked older than he was.

51
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:46,899
No. That's the first thing
I said.

52
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,407
The first thing
I thought to say was,

53
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,070
"dead or alive,
Derek is a dick."

54
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,638
A dick that convinced
Folsom Foods

55
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,874
to settle with us
for $10 million.

56
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:56,108
Well, we'll just have
to tell his replacement

57
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,710
the settlement needs
a signature.

58
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:01,347
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why? Who's replacing him?

59
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm gonna have
the cornish hen,

60
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,388
and we're gonna start
with the foie gras special,

61
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:10,523
two of them.

62
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,891
You're gonna love it.
Just one.

63
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,826
I'm okay. Thank you.
Dad.

64
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,528
I'm watching
what I eat.

65
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,530
- On my birthday?
- [Chuckles]

66
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:19,232
I'm trying to be
disciplined.

67
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,200
Listen...

68
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,337
I'm taking a case
against Pearson Hardman.

69
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,072
It's Folsom Foods.
Do you know it?

70
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,541
Um, of course. It's
the gender-discrimination case.

71
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,443
Well, I wanted to give
a chance to get off it,

72
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,012
if you were on it.
Well, I'm not, but okay.

73
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,013
It's just that I know

74
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,517
you keep a low profile
at work.

75
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,619
That was supposed to be
between me and mom.

76
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:42,421
Well, I wish you could tell me
these things,

77
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,291
and I wish
that you didn't keep the fact

78
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,893
that I was your father
a secret.

79
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,196
It's not a secret.
I just don't broadcast it.

80
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:53,165
People treat me differently once
they find out you're my dad.

81
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,067
Are you worried
that they're judging you

82
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:57,203
for being a paralegal?

83
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,272
No, Dad.

84
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,041
Only you judge me
for being a paralegal.

85
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:04,610
- I do not judge you.
- It doesn't matter.

86
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,779
I'm not planning on being
a paralegal forever.

87
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:09,649
[Laughs]
I know.

88
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,686
Right there.

89
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,087
You can't even pretend
to believe

90
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,923
I have what it takes
to be a lawyer.

91
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,126
Rachel,
you are a beautiful woman,

92
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,527
and you can do whatever
you want.

93
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:22,929
Beautiful, not smart.

94
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,636
Honey, I am trying
to give you a heads-up.

95
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,532
And you're taking
the whole thing

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,701
as an indictment.

97
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,104
Do you believe I have
what it takes to be a lawyer?

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,876
It's been five years,

99
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,544
and...

100
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,379
It hasn't happened.

101
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:42,014
I just wonder
if you've considered

102
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:43,549
trying something else.

103
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,884
Of all days--

104
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,886
"Hey, Rachel,
how was your birthday?"

105
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,855
"Great. My dad told me
that I should aim lower."

106
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:52,325
Please, Rachel,
that is not what I meant.

107
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:54,827
Let's just have lunch.
No, Dad.

108
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,375
Really, I wouldn't want you
to overeat

109
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,197
on the day that you told me
that I won't amount to anything.

110
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,299
Rachel.

111
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,303
Hi.

112
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,839
Excuse me.

113
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:10,343
But I think you might be
in the wrong office.

114
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,311
Oh, I'm in the right office.

115
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,549
You're Katrina Bennett,
Harvey's mysterious new hire.

116
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,484
I'm afraid that puts me
at a disadvantage,

117
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,252
because I don't know
who you are.

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,488
That's our problem
right there.

119
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,156
- We have a problem?
- Oh, yeah, a big one.

120
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:25,591
You haven't come
to see me yet.

121
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,959
Again, I don't know
who you--

122
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,028
I oversee the first-
and second-year associates.

123
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,796
It's a responsibility
that I take as seriously

124
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,633
as holding the nuclear
launch codes in my hands.

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,021
Well, if you take it
so seriously,

126
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,736
then why are you in
a fifth-year associate's office,

127
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:38,371
trimming your fingernails
at her desk?

128
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,839
Trimming?

129
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,541
This is a gold-plated
nickel alloy cuticle sculptor

130
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:43,542
from the south of Denmark,

131
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,211
and I will sculpt
my nails

132
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,612
wherever I damn well please.

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,682
Why don't we see
what you're up to?

134
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,790
That's password-protected.

135
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:54,020
Please. Prosecutor99--
third try.

136
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,055
That's a violation
of my privacy.

137
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,558
Oh, yeah?
Who are you gonna tell?

138
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,027
[Keys clacking]

139
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,029
I see you're representing
Chad Ritter.

140
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,766
And this is your defense?
Wow, it's like you're a baboon.

141
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,035
I'm in full control of
Mr. Ritter's defense strategy.

142
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,536
It's not a strategy,
it's a prayer,

143
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,538
which is why I'm going
to be forced to supervise you.

144
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,040
I don't need
a babysitter.

145
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,474
You're not getting
a babysitter.

146
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,244
You're getting Louis Litt.
This is unacceptable.

147
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,313
Be that as it may,

148
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:24,550
you can either welcome
my tutelage,

149
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,019
or you can crawl back
to the D.A.'s office

150
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:29,555
from whence you came.

151
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,827
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

152
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,105
You got a minute?

153
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,540
Maybe.

154
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,175
It's not about us.
It's about work.

155
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,242
Oh.
Then, yeah.

156
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,444
Folsom Foods--

157
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,245
Missy Dietler's
your paralegal on it, right?

158
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,847
Yeah, when she's not texting
her boyfriend

159
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,348
every five seconds

00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,908
Let me guess.

317
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,409
He's pulling the same bullshit
right now.

318
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,278
Told me the world knows
we need a win,

319
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,113
tried to leverage that
to get me to settle.

320
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,481
Son of a bitch.

321
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,551
That's not bad faith.
That's below the belt.

322
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,987
You know what I do to someone
who hits me below the belt.

323
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:15,055
Cut 'em off at the knees.

324
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:22,363
[Juicer whirring]

325
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,799
Louis.

326
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:29,570
[Juicer continues whirring]

327
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:33,741
I just need--

328
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:37,211
I just--

329
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,582
[whirring slows]

330
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,021
[Juicer turns off]
Yeah.

331
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:50,157
Looks delicious.
What is that?

332
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,892
It's a spinach
and kale power smoothie.

333
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,660
I'm in the middle
of my quarterly cleanse.

334
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,796
What do you want?

335
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:57,831
To apologize...

336
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,900
for any misunderstanding
we might have had.

337
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:01,668
That <i>you</i> might have had.

338
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:05,706
I had.
And it was huge.

339
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,008
I looked up your record.

340
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:11,612
You're a white-collar genius.

341
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,880
Go on.

342
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:16,750
I don't just accept
your tutelage.

343
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:20,521
I'm begging for your help.

344
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,523
Well, beg away.

345
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,358
My motion to dismiss
is Wednesday

346
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:25,626
with Judge McIntyre.

347
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:28,195
I've never been able
to connect with him.

348
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,897
Yeah, that's 'cause you
don't understand him.

349
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,598
Well, all I know is
he's punitive.

350
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,766
No, he's a stickler.

351
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,034
Don't be late,
don't be sloppy,

352
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,536
don't be disrespectful,
and he'll love you,

353
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:38,205
just like he loves me.

354
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:42,276
Since you know him
so well,

355
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,611
would you do me
the honor of signing on

356
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,046
as first chair?

357
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:49,450
I can.

358
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,052
And I will.

359
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,355
You've forgiven me
with grace,

360
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:58,025
and now you're saving me
in my hour of need.

361
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,726
You're my knight
in shining armor.

362
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:02,996
Ah.
[Chuckles]

363
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,399
I will see-eth you
on Wednesday, milady.

364
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:08,001
[Laughs]

365
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:17,845
[Clears throat, sighs]

366
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:22,950
Um...
[Clears throat]

367
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,785
You wanted to see me?

368
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,421
Yes,
but usually that means

369
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,889
the person tells Donna
they're here.

370
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:31,024
Then Donna tells me.
That's how it works.

371
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:35,996
- Donna's not there.
- You think that's by accident?

372
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,231
Apparently not.

373
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,032
You know why you're here?

374
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,935
Because my last name
is Zane.

375
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:44,705
You know why Donna isn't?

376
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,974
Because you know
we're friends.

377
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,709
And you're about to ask me
to do something

378
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,644
that she would tell me
not to do.

379
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,679
And what exactly do I want
to ask you?

380
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,482
You want to know if I want
to be in on the deposition.

381
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,152
- You did ask on the case.
- Yes, I did.

382
00:14:58,219 --> 00:15:00,154
And before you ask me
if I'm tough enough

383
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,321
to be in there,

384
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,856
I want you to know
that I am tough enough.

385
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:04,725
That's not
what I wanted to ask.

386
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,694
I want you to know if you think
it'll rattle your father.

387
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,429
Frankly,
I don't think he'd care.

388
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,231
Good.

389
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,566
Why good?

390
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,635
Because if that's
what you think about him,

391
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,937
then your relationship
is worse than you think,

392
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:20,274
and he cares about you more
than you know.

393
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:42,196
Is this a joke?

394
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,131
She doesn't need to be
in there.

395
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,499
Sloane Moseley?

396
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,067
You know
who I'm talking about.

397
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,435
You think having her
in the room

398
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,237
is gonna keep me
from doing my job?

399
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,338
The relevant question is,

400
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,739
what is she gonna think
about you

401
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,641
after you eviscerate
Sloane Moseley?

402
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,579
You accuse me of being cruel,
and you orchestrate this stunt.

403
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:00,480
We had a deal.
You pulled it.

404
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:02,216
Put the deal back
on the table,

405
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:04,718
this whole thing ends now.

406
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,462
Harvey,
what did you do?

407
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,664
My job.

408
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,700
Miss Moseley...

409
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,994
why did you choose
this particular field?

410
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,643
Because I have
a love of food.

411
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,246
Is it really a requirement
of excellence

412
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,214
in an executive
that one love food?

413
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:36,649
It's not a requirement,

414
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,884
but it's a food company,

415
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,553
and it's what I thought
made it a perfect fit.

416
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,888
Well, if it was such
a perfect fit,

417
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,323
why were you looking
for a job in another field?

418
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,927
Because I spent nine years
killing myself for your client

419
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,196
and got passed over
for promotion after promotion

420
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,498
in favor
of less-qualified men.

421
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,666
Okay, let me get
this straight.

422
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,501
So you hit a wall,
you blame my client,

423
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,003
and rather than figuring out
what it takes

424
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,471
to make it
in this perfect fit,

425
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,673
you give up and fold
like a house of cards.

426
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,041
I don't know what law school
you went to,

427
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,309
but I was always taught

428
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,211
that depositions
require questions.

429
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,680
I went to Harvard.

430
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,115
And here's your question.

431
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,384
After all these interviews
for all these jobs,

432
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,686
why didn't you just pursue
one of them

433
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,555
and switch careers?

434
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:18,057
It would require
a step backward.

435
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,626
Isn't it true it didn't
require a step backward?

436
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:21,994
But that's all
you could find,

437
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,362
cause no one thought
you were any good

438
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,364
at the job you had
in the first place.

439
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:26,532
You don't know that.

440
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,235
I have sworn testimony
from a headhunter

441
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,437
who said
nobody wanted you.

442
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,839
Okay,
you're badgering her.

443
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,274
Well, the truth is
you're untalented and pathetic

444
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:36,642
and blaming other people

445
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,578
because you don't have
the skills or the fortitude

446
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,214
or anything else to make it
in your chosen field.

447
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,049
And you don't even have
the courage

448
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:45,117
to try something else.

449
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,452
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure

450
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,454
that the court reporter
got all that.

451
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:49,856
Did you hear it down there?

452
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,424
We heard it.

453
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,192
Good.

454
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,861
I have a few more questions.

455
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,796
No.

456
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,732
This deposition is over.

457
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,967
This is the men's room.
You know that, right?

458
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,843
Don't do that
shit again.

459
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:11,944
Excuse me?

460
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,279
I don't need
your protection.

461
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,580
That's what my dad does.

462
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,115
Rachel,
the only thing

463
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,516
your father and I
have in common

464
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,985
is that you're angry
at both of us.

465
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,686
Well, all you did in there
was embarrass me.

466
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,455
Embarrass you?

467
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,458
I wasn't even watching you.
I was watching our client.

468
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,559
You're trying to say

469
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:28,527
you didn't call that off
because of him?

470
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,296
No, I'm trying to say I didn't
call it off because of you,

471
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,198
even though evidently
you went to Harvey

472
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,799
to ask in
to make it about you.

473
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,534
I didn't go to Harvey.
He came to me.

474
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,770
Look, Rachel, you might want
to make this Zane versus Zane,

475
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:39,071
but it's not.

476
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:41,007
It's Folsom Foods
versus our client.

477
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,942
But you're so eager to prove
how tough you are

478
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,078
that you seem
to have forgotten about her.

479
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,518
- How dare you?
- How dare I what?

480
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,154
I just got a $3,000 fine
from Judge McIntyre

481
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,023
for missing my own hearing.

482
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,124
I know.

483
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,892
I was wondering
what happened to you.

484
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,862
I thought maybe your horse
took fever, my liege.

485
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,130
Uhhuh.

486
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,932
You said it was Wednesday,
and you know it.

487
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,566
No.
I said Tuesday...

488
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:11,037
as is confirmed
in the documents I gave you.

489
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:15,341
This here is a fight
you don't want to have.

490
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,144
- I didn't pick it.
- Yeah, you did.

491
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,645
And now you're gonna pay
that fine,

492
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:20,980
and you're gonna write
a letter

493
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,349
expressing how sorry you are
to Judge McIntyre.

494
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,152
No. I'm not.

495
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,421
I'm gonna count to five.

496
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,323
You can count to 500.

497
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,793
The only thing I'm sorry for
is getting stuck with you.

498
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,128
You lied to me...

499
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,197
and you know it.

500
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:40,066
Oh, yeah?

501
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,735
Who you gonna tell?

502
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,883
Here it comes.
Speech number 162--

503
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:59,719
14 reasons
why I'm an asshole.

504
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,654
No, no.
This is gonna be 216.

505
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,189
That's uncharted territory.

506
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,024
And you're still
not gonna like it.

507
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,093
If it's coming from you,
that goes without saying.

508
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,521
Look, I'm just saying
that you went

509
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,029
out of your way to put Rachel
in that deposition.

510
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:11,430
You promised
uncharted territory.

511
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,865
We've been here before.

512
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,834
No, usually you're accusing me
of making things personal.

513
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,702
But this time
you're making things personal

514
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,770
for Robert Zane.

515
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:19,271
No.
He made it personal.

516
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,840
And how exactly did
he do that?

517
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,675
He threatened our firm.

518
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,378
And on top of that,
he tried to show Sloane Moseley

519
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,114
what she'd be in for her
if this goes to trial.

520
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,182
So I'm just returning
the favor.

521
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,610
Yeah, well, it didn't seem to
have much of an effect on him.

522
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,686
Trust me.
It will.

523
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,187
And did you think
about the effect

524
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,323
it'll have on Sloane Moseley,
not to mention his daughter?

525
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,657
Here we are,

526
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,127
right back to good old 162.

527
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:43,129
Did you misunderstand me
when I said

528
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,764
to cut Robert Zane
off at the knees?

529
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,032
You too?

530
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,600
Oh, don't tell me
you think I went too far.

531
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,135
I don't think
you went far enough.

532
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:50,970
- What?
- Your client just called.

533
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:53,906
She wants to take
Zane's bullshit settlement.

534
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,245
You're gonna want
to turn your hips

535
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:02,481
to transfer your weight
through the ball.

536
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,484
Nice job tracking me down.

537
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,819
You think
you're the only one

538
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,521
who knows
where Judge Benjamin plays?

539
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:09,722
No.

540
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,691
But I'm the only one here
he plays with.

541
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,829
Now, did you come here
to caddie for me?

542
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,631
I came here to negotiate.

543
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:20,833
Bullshit.

544
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,906
Your client caved
after that deposition,

545
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:29,608
because she knew she couldn't
make it through a trial.

546
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,877
So I'm gonna negotiate
for you.

547
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,979
The offer on the table
was 2 million.

548
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,215
It just went down to one.
Robert.

549
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:37,850
Now it's 500,000.

550
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,151
You're pretty good
at this.

551
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:41,053
Remind me to have you buy
my next car for me.

552
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,721
Now it's 100,000.

553
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:45,624
No, wait.

554
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,160
Here.

555
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:51,163
No one wins
if we go to war.

556
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,768
You don't have children,
do you?

557
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:59,305
You came to my house
and threatened my firm.

558
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:01,140
"Your house"?

559
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,042
You put my little girl
in that deposition

560
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,111
so she could see me
shred that woman,

561
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,146
which I did
because that's my job.

562
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,115
And I was trying to protect
that woman.

563
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:10,816
That was my job.

564
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,686
Well, your client is scared
shitless.

565
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,287
So I guess that means
that I did my job

566
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,722
a lot better
than you did yours.

567
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,291
The settlement is gone.

568
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,293
You want something...

569
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:24,663
you come take it at trial.

570
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,226
What do you need?

571
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:38,359
A napkin.

572
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,028
No
social security number,

573
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,596
date of birth,
favorite color,

574
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,864
allergy to nuts--
I don't know.

575
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:44,332
What's it gonna take?

576
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
I don't think
I need to steal

577
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,235
your father's identity
just yet.

578
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,203
Mike said he pulled
the settlement,

579
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,272
and we can't let that happen.

580
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,975
- "We"?
- Yes, "we."

581
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,877
I work here too.

582
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,413
- Now I get it.
- Get--

583
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,115
No, no, no. This isn't
about me and my father.

584
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:02,450
This is about the client.

585
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:05,320
No, I meant
why Donna likes you so much.

586
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:07,455
Oh.

587
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,090
Thank you.
I-I like her too.

588
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:10,391
You know what?

589
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,294
I was gonna give in
and drop this case.

590
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:16,531
But now that you accosted me
during my me time,

591
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,201
I'm gonna change my mind
and do what you say.

592
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,503
You were gonna continue
with it anyway.

593
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,272
- Yes.
- Right.

594
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,841
Would you like to eat
my bagel now too?

595
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:31,045
Oh, thank you. I...
[Laughs]

596
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,848
I'm so sorry.

597
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,551
Thank you.

598
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,367
Hi.

599
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,435
What are you doing here?

600
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,004
I just came by to tell you
that you were right.

601
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,338
This is your case, not mine.

602
00:23:57,406 --> 00:23:59,641
I'm no longer first chair.

603
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,075
Fine.
We're best friends.

604
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:02,610
Now please leave.

605
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:06,114
Okay, I came to give you
your files back.

606
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:07,348
All rise.

607
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,817
No way.
I wasn't born yesterday.

608
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,386
I've got my files
right here.

609
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,855
Okay, Katrina, I'm offering us
both a way out here.

610
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:17,325
You keep whatever's in those
files the hell away from me.

611
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,460
Okay.
You got me.

612
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,463
I'm not to be trusted.
All right, let's get to it.

613
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:24,451
Ms. Bennett, I believe
you have something for me.

614
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,167
Your Honor,

615
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,236
Mr. Gibbs charged my client
with securities fraud,

616
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:30,238
but he neglected
to disclose discrepancies

617
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:32,974
between the S.E.C.'S findings
and the IRS's.

618
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:37,612
I have with me an exhibit.

619
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,180
I'm sorry.

620
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,015
You must've accidentally
somehow gotten

621
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,216
the file of pictures of me

622
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:45,720
photoshopped
as various American presidents.

623
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,522
I actually like that one.

624
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:48,756
I look pretty sharp,
don't I?

625
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,591
What you're really looking
for was this...

626
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,026
[Patting folder]
like I offered.

627
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:54,328
But per your request,

628
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,731
I'm gonna keep it
the hell away from you.

629
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,267
Is this some sort of joke?

630
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,935
No.
Your Honor.

631
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,037
Bring that folder up here
right now.

632
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:04,939
And if they're not
legitimate court documents,

633
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,341
you are in for one hell
of a fine.

634
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,211
Uh...

635
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,120
What are you working on?

636
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:21,823
I'm going through the reviews
for every executive

637
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,192
promoted at Folsom Foods
for the last five years.

638
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,960
You?

639
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:29,263
Reviews of every executive
promoted at Folsom Foods

640
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:30,932
for the past five years.

641
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,001
[Both chuckles]

642
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:37,872
You were right.

643
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,174
This is not Zane versus Zane.

644
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:42,477
And I don't want to talk
about my dad anymore.

645
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,479
Good.

646
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,481
It's like
he was sitting me down

647
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,349
and looking me in the eye

648
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,220
and telling me...
What?

649
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,822
That I'm untalented
and pathetic

650
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,858
and don't have
the skills or the fortitude

651
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,527
or anything else it takes
to make it in my chosen field.

652
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,195
He was talking
to a client.

653
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,564
You got a 172.
You're going to law school.

654
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,200
He can't deny that.

655
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:09,704
Yeah.
He--he doesn't know that.

656
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,609
Rachel, you--

657
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,544
[sighs]

658
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,713
When I, um...

659
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:22,550
told him that I was
high-school salutatorian...

660
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:27,054
Guess what the first words
out of his mouth were.

661
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:29,524
He wanted to know
who the valedictorian was.

662
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:30,792
Nope.

663
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,660
He said...

664
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:34,929
"Number two ain't bad."

665
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,798
He thought
it was funny.

666
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:44,272
Everyone's always said
that my mom is beautiful

667
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,010
and that my dad is smart
and powerful.

668
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,515
And all I've ever wanted
is for him...

669
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,728
He's never gonna see
a different side of you

670
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:11,399
if you don't show him
a different side of you.

671
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,569
He knew I was sitting
right there.

672
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:17,446
You chose to be sitting
right there.

673
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,749
[Knock on door]

674
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:30,384
- Louis.
- Hi, Donna.

675
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:31,385
What can I do for you?

676
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:32,820
Not for me.

677
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:34,789
For Katrina.

678
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,558
- Which one's Katrina again?
- Okay, you know what?

679
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,227
You've had your fun.
Time to let it go.

680
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:40,962
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna let anything go

681
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,697
until that woman kneels
before Zod.

682
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,999
First of all,
you know who Zod is?

683
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,634
And second of all,
you think you're Zod?

684
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,369
General Zod
was a visionary leader

685
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:50,304
who was underappreciated
by his entire planet.

686
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,772
Of course
I know who he is.

687
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,474
Okay, well,
Katrina isn't Superman,

688
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:56,777
so what the hell
do you want from her?

689
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,047
Okay.
I get it.

690
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:01,816
Harvey is Superman,
and he hired Katrina,

691
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,517
instead of you getting
your first-year.

692
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,586
Her name was Maria,
and this is not about that.

693
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,955
What this is about
is me getting respect

694
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,657
from a new employee, so...

695
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,759
You beat her.
You want her respect?

696
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,761
Make up with her
and leave her alone.

697
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,230
Oh, really, Donna?
Is that a sign of respect?

698
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,999
Leaving someone alone,
like you and Harvey

699
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,400
left me alone
since Daniel?

700
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,502
Louis, Harvey
welcomed you back.

701
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,803
"Welcomed"?

702
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,872
He ripped up
my letter of resignation,

703
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,274
and he didn't say a word.

704
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:27,575
- Louis.
- You know what?

705
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,143
Over the years,
all the ribbing

706
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:31,445
and all the practical jokes
between you and Harvey--

707
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:33,681
I found that to be
a sign of respect.

708
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,050
But you haven't had
one conversation with me

709
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,318
since you told me
you never wanted

710
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,486
to see my smug face again.

711
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,554
So you know what?
You go tell Katrina

712
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:43,024
that I'm not really
in a forgiving mood.

713
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:58,839
I had an idea
about Folsom Foods.

714
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:00,741
- You too?
- What?

715
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,276
You are not getting
my bagel.

716
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,811
Why would I want
your bagel?

717
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,546
Never mind.
What do you got?

718
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:06,881
I checked the review
of every promotion

719
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,049
from the last five years.

720
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,817
Every time
they don't promote a woman,

721
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,653
they use some combination
of the same 16 words.

722
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,855
- And the men?
- No.

723
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,157
What are the words?

724
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:18,993
"High-strung, sensitive,
aggressive, abrasive..."

725
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,561
Coded language.

726
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,296
They went out of their way
to shield themselves

727
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,665
from any one person bringing
a gender-discrimination suit,

728
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,567
which means they treated
all of them the same.

729
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:27,568
As a class.

730
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:30,237
Yeah.
And guess how many.

731
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:33,841
113 female employees
across all 22 divisions--

732
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,409
you know
what they have in common?

733
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,677
All denied promotions

734
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,212
due to the fact
that they're women,

735
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,514
not that they're untalented
or pathetic

736
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:44,552
or lack the fortitude
to excel in their chosen field.

737
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,920
This is a crock of shit.

738
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,788
You didn't want to settle
for 2 million.

739
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:49,957
You'll be lucky to settle
for 200 million.

play all the golf you want.

get you out of this one.

Then why did you take it?

Because you took me out
for my birthday

786

and told me you were picking
a fight with my family and said,

00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,073
You remember what happened
at those tryouts?

792
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,075
Yeah.
I didn't get the part.

793
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:12,312
- And it killed you.
- I was a child.

794
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,249
And most children
let things go.

795
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,618
But you never tried out
for a play again.

796
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,620
I did other things.

797
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,490
But why aren't you doing
other things now?

798
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:27,194
I am watching you fail

799
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:30,664
and stall
and beat yourself up.

800
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,501
And it rips me up inside.

801
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,105
I took the LSATs.

802
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:42,609
I got a 172.

803
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:43,944
When?

804
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:46,146
Six weeks ago.

805
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,617
And you're just
telling me now.

806
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:54,921
[Scoffs] I didn't want to hear
some joke about your 177.

807
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,790
- Ah, but--
- When we were in that room,

808
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,124
I know you were talking
to her,

809
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:01,628
but it was like you were aiming
everything right at me.

810
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,129
And then I thought,
"you know what?

811
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:05,031
Maybe you look
at all of us that way."

812
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,101
- Rachel.
- Well, we're not all the same.

813
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,703
And you need to toughen up

814
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,673
because I am not
that little girl anymore.

815
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,715
So who's gonna kneel
before Zod now?

816
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,316
I'm not kneeling
before anybody,

817
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:24,718
let alone the person
who framed me

818
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,019
and put me
in this jail cell.

819
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,921
You humiliated me
with Judge McIntyre.

820
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,656
Oh, please.
You did the same thing.

821
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,191
Missing an appearance
is different

822
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,026
from looking
like a buffoon in open court.

823
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,695
I gave you a way out,
so don't come crying to me.

824
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,431
Rapist, murderer...

825
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:42,002
these are the kinds of people
I'm used to dealing with.

826
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:43,603
And you know
where they are?

827
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,405
Spending the rest
of their lives

828
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:49,109
realizing that I wasn't just
a pretty face.

829
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:51,077
Is that what you think
this is about?

830
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:53,880
You treated me like shit
because I'm a woman.

831
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,116
How dare you?
I worship women.

832
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:59,119
My mother, my grandmother--
God rest her soul--

833
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:02,756
Hillary Clinton,
Gwen Stefani.

834
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:06,693
Then what the hell
is your problem?

835
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:10,697
You took a job from somebody
who deserved it more.

836
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:16,770
I went to resubmit my motion
to dismiss.

837
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:19,873
Turns out judge McIntyre
already received it...

838
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,541
from me.

839
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,210
The client needed it,
and you wrote it.

840
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,713
For me to put my signature
on it would just be wrong.

841
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,816
Well, it worked.

842
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:33,386
Are you ready to call
a truce?

843
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:35,789
Are you gonna frame me
for murder if I say no?

844
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,892
Not as long
as you keep these

845
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,260
in your own office.

846
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,234
Robert.

847
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:50,070
What a coincidence seeing
you here.

848
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:52,572
- It's not a coincidence.
- I didn't think it was.

849
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,507
I got to give it
to your man Harvey.

850
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:55,875
He comes full throttle.

851
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:57,877
He has his pros and cons.

852
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,813
They all do.

853
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,481
Did you bring
your checkbook?

854
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,217
Thank you.
I brought this.

855
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,856
You're going to decertify
our class?

856
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:11,624
I'm gonna bust it
wide open.

857
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,973
You see, after you brought
my daughter to that deposition,

858
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,429
I realized not
all women are the same.

859
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:19,733
No way this gets
busted up into 113 cases.

860
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,901
I'd say a minimum of 45.

861
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,003
Some you may win,
some you may lose,

862
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,606
all of which are gonna drain
your resources.

863
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,575
You're threatening me again.

864
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:31,711
- I have another option.
- Which is what?

865
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:35,749
I told you--
not all women are the same.

866
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:39,052
[Laughs]
You got to be kidding me.

867
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,921
"Not all women are the same."
What the hell does that mean?

868
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,690
He wants to merge.

869
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:44,758
What?

870
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:46,459
Pearson Zane.

871
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,862
No. No way.
I'm not doing that.

872
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,096
Oh, excuse me?

873
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:51,844
We didn't fight off Hardman
to end up here.

874
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,427
Well, you went
after the man's daughter,

875
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:54,734
which is what put us here.

876
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,369
You told me to cut him off
at the knees.

877
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,438
If you're gonna go that low
to put someone down,

878
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:02,041
then you better make damn sure
that they don't get back up.

879
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:03,777
It doesn't matter
if it's Robert or not.

880
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:05,378
They're gonna keep coming.

881
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,767
Until I put your name
on the door.

882
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,516
That's not
what this is about.

883
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,652
We can only take these hits
for so long.

884
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,655
Death by a thousand cuts.

885
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,591
[Scoffs]

886
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,059
All right.

887
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,995
Well, if they're
gonna keep coming,

888
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:26,666
then we may as well
just make it one big brawl.

889
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:44,545
Jessica.
What a coincidence.

890
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,381
Skip it.

891
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,616
I'm guessing
by your tone

892
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,218
that our merger
is off the table?

893
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:52,120
It was never on the table.

894
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,588
- What's this?
- A press release.

895
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:56,190
"Female head
of major law firm

896
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,579
"is going to the ends
of the earth

897
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,528
to fight 45 cases
of gender discrimination."

898
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,996
This is bullshit.

899
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:05,266
Look at me.

900
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,035
You'll cripple your firm.

901
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:09,470
I would rather lose my firm

902
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:13,041
than get married staring down
the barrel of a shotgun.

903
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,942
You're not gonna be able
to have my daughter

904
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,010
in every deposition.

905
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:17,512
This is 45 cases.

906
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,014
And it will cost you
45 times the amount

907
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:22,784
that you could settle
for right here.

908
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,289
Yeah, I know you.

909
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:33,261
The chess master--
you think you're Bobby Fischer.

910
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:36,898
This isn't chess.
It's dominoes.

911
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,367
Now, the first case
might be tough.

912
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:41,169
But after that,

913
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:44,205
one by one...

914
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:45,973
And when it's all said
and done,

915
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,642
I'll be
the last one standing,

916
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,945
holding a big, fat check
in my hand.

917
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:06,961
Remind me
to get the papers ready

918
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:11,866
for, uh, the deposition
tomorrow, the 19th.

919
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,868
Uh, that would--

920
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:18,806
holy shit.

921
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,743
Who the hell did this?

922
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,412
All right, Norma, if you're
gonna keep letting people

923
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,280
into this office like this,

924
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,016
then what the hell
good are you?

925
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,418
Oh, yeah, wait.

926
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:33,387
And by the way, remind me
to buy socks for next week.

927
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:35,823
I'm running low.

928
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,999
I got to admit,

929
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:48,369
you do look
kind of hot as a bad boy.

930
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,139
You tell me right now
this was not Katrina Bennett,

931
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,573
'cause this is not a truce.
Oh, please.

932
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:54,876
Katrina had nothing to do
with this.

933
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,677
- Then this was you?
- No.

934
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,713
Harvey?

935
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:02,083
You're not lying.

936
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,417
Nope.

937
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:05,286
Does this mean
that you and I are good?

938
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:07,021
No.

939
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:09,056
Not yet.

940
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:10,858
Bye, Louis.

941
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:13,294
Wait, don't go.

942
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,664
We're back!

943
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,700
No, we're not.

944
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,969
Oh, shit.

945
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,873
[Knock on door]

946
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:28,676
- Hey.
- Hey.

947
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,348
I'm dropping the case.

948
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,620
Why?

949
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,223
Because I never should have
taken it in the first place.

950
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,559
- Dad.
- You said it yourself.

951
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:47,028
I picked a fight
with your family,

952
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,730
told you to sit it out,

953
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:52,533
and those aren't words a man
should ever hear from--

954
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,236
from his daughter.

955
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:59,574
You're not tough enough?

956
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:01,709
Not even close.

957
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,846
[Laughs]

958
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:06,714
Well, we never finished
our lunch.

959
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,649
Tomorrow?

960
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:11,252
Tomorrow.

961
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,021
But we'll have to pick
a new place.

962
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,659
I already tried
that foie gras of yours.

963
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:22,163
- You did?
- Yep.

964
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:23,164
And?

965
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:26,033
It tasted like ass.

966
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,636
Come on.
[Laughs]

967
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,972
[Chuckles]

968
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:39,547
Looks like
you guys made up.

969
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:42,016
It's a start.

970
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:43,684
I didn't want
to interrupt,

971
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:45,720
and I know
I'm a few days late,

972
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:47,722
but...

973
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,759
Is that my--

974
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,728
Your LSAT score?

975
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:56,564
Yeah.
I figured...

976
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:59,734
You shouldn't keep things
like this a secret.

977
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:01,302
Thanks, Mike.

978
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,237
Happy Birthday.

979
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:06,807
How did you know
it was my birthday?

980
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,645
Oh, right.
I must have told you once.

981
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:12,513
You did, yeah.
I mean, I forgot.

982
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,949
Yeah, this is from Donna.

983
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,184
[Imitating Robert]
Come on.

984
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:18,552
That is exac--

985
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,321
- I just saw that.
- [Laughs]

986
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,555
Yeah, that's how fast I am.

987
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:24,859
You're impressed.
It's no big deal.

988
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:30,665
How did it go down?

989
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,700
Did you tell him if he puts
one of ours in the hospital,

990
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:34,468
we put one
of his in the morgue?

991
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,104
No, Harvey. I did not quote
<i>The Untouchables</i> to the man.

992
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:40,207
You should've,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

993
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:41,609
That's really funny,

994
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,779
you lying member
of a no-good--

995
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:46,380
Robert.

996
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,649
Oh, I hate to interrupt
in the middle

997
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,184
of a <i>Untouchables</i>
<i>quote fest.</i>

998
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,186
Two doors down,
they're doing <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

999
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:53,754
You'd fit right in.

1000
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:55,756
I'm more
of a <i>Beaches</i> man myself.

1001
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:57,591
I assume you're here
to settle.

1002
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:58,926
I'm afraid not.

1003
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:01,228
I wanted to tell you
that my firm

1004
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,964
has a conflict of interest,

1005
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:05,199
so I decided to farm out
the case.

1006
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,668
Whose ass
are we gonna kick now?

1007
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,638
Actually,
an old classmate of mine.

1008
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,174
Let me guess...

1009
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,010
Daniel Hardman.

1010
