if it weren't for the fact
that Milly is...

305
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,720
She's at a crossroads
in her life.

306
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Another hard left
and I really...

307
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,960
She's like this person
who's too sensitive.
You know what I mean?

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,280
She's an innocent.
She's a pushover.

309
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm usually not this
in-the-muck-of-it.

310
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,760
I mean, actually,
I consider myself
a reasonably sane mother.

311
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Well, yeah,
it is a crazy love, though.

312
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,880
I mean, who's to say
I wouldn't do the same
for my own kid?

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Mmm.

314
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,080
Excuse me. I'm Jason Grant.
I don't mean to interrupt.

315
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
I've been waiting
over by the bar,

316
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
but I only have so much time
before I have to
get back to work.

317
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,720
DAPHNE: I just wanted to
ask you about your family.

318
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah, well, my dad is an
engineer who was always
a closet architect.

319
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
- And I grew up with a love of old buildings.
- I know what you mean.

320
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,560
So I suppose I became
the architect that he always
dreamed of being.

321
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,960
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

322
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Oh, thank you, dear Lord.

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Can I order you something?

324
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,800
You know, actually it turns
out I'm so not hungry at all.

325
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Let me get you the "funghi"
"chitarrina misto". It's the
best-kept secret in the city.

326
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
Can we have two orders
of that, please?

327
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
And a bottle of the
Castellare Chianti Poggiale.

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,040
- If you insist, huh?
- No, I do, I do.

329
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,880
Do you mind my asking why
a man like you hasn't found
a woman already?

330
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Well, I'll admit
I'm a bit of a workaholic.

331
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
It's a very important time
in my career right now.

332
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,720
I've found women
but just not the right one.

333
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.

334
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,840
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts."

335
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720

338
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
No, I fake Italian.

339
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
I'd really love to learn it.

340
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,520
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.

341
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,560
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.

342
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,240
- Oh, wow, I was going to go there this fall.
- Really?

343
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.

344
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,880
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.

345
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
Oh.

346
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
You're going to need
a caterer then.

347
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I mean, those kinds of
occasions should be marked,
don't you think?

348
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,640
- You are good. So James Bond.
- Yes.

349
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.

350

Well, Jason, my pleasure.

351
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,760
Got to love a woman
in polka dots.

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,600
- Not everyone can pull it off.
- Thank you.

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
Oh, yes.

357
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,200
And the winner is?

358
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,800
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.

359
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
- Him?
- Yes.

360
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,160
Oh, I don't trust that guy.

361
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,120
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.

362
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
He was not.

363
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,320
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.

364
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
He has empty eyes.

365
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
They were not empty.
And who am I supposed to
choose anyway, huh?

366
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,680
- Who do you think is better?
- Me.

367
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
What?

368
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,680
I like you.

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,120
And I have an odd instinct
that I'd like her too.
Maybe I should meet her.

370
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?

371
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,880
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.

372
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,200
And that's why I know
you would be
a horrendous choice

373
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,440
because I'm not looking for
a great affair
for my daughter.

374
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,800
You know, like,
gorgeous musician
who's going to break her heart.

375
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm looking for
a life partner.

376
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
That's great. Thanks.

377
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah, no, I love being reduced
to a cultural cliché.
That's just terrific.

378
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.

379
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,080
Uh...

380
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,440

I have them.

I hope you have a great life.

But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.

384
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
Yeah, of course you do,

385
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,920
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
I beg your pardon?

387
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,600
Maybe you do.

388
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,440
Maybe I do.

389
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,080
Nice to meet you, Daphne.

390
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,840

Almost here.

- Yeah, we've landed. We're in heaven.
- Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120

Minnie Mouse. I don't even
know if I like it. Do I?

I'm hearing you hate it.

- Me, too.
- Oh, please, just try it on.

Why?

Because I said so.

Honey, look,
it might surprise you.

401
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,520
Anyway, you look beautiful
in dresses. In fact,
you know what I think?

402
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,680
I think that you should
wear it to that catered affair
on Sunday.

To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.

404
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,440
- Oh, come on, just try it on.
- All right.

405
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,720
Okay. That's incredible.

406

It's not really me at all.

It is totally you.

more you in a way.

I'm going to get it for you.

No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.

and it's absurd for work.

Hello, Jason, this is Bond.

458
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,120
James Bond. Call me.
I'm hearing rave reviews.

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,400
All right, I just pulled up.
I'm walking in.

No, no, they're not angry.

They're not... Hold on. Sorry.

They're just... They're
probably hungry or something.

from the Adams wedding

Okay, bye.

There's a lot of static
out there.

You can say that again.

470
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
There's a lot of static
out there.

471
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
You know it's caused
by a lack of humidity
in the air

472
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,440
that causes an imbalance
of the positive and negative
charges.

to cut the static cling
in 98% of most cases.

but I'm really late to work.

And I'm so sorry.
Nice tattoo, though.

477

Why don't you get me
your favourite?

Okay.

Oh, no, no. The Dreamsicle.

Wait. Is that
the tall rainbow one

483
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
that's really
embarrassing to eat,
but it's really, really good?

Okay. Never mind.

I will have the Dreamsicly one
that has the green wrapper

on it.

Thank you.

like I'm never going to
meet anyone

and it's making me
feel hopeless.

Well, as I've said before,
Stuart, Sheila was a huge
loss, but that was 1993.

491
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Oh, it's still so fresh.

492
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,920
This makes me feel like
when I was in the 2nd grade,

493
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,760
and I walked around
with a booger in my nose
all day and nobody told me.

494
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
Why didn't they tell me?

495
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,560
Well, more to the point,
why didn't Sheila tell you
she was unhappy?

496
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,160
Oh, God, this is making me
feel nauseous.

497
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,680
Maybe I should change
my appointment time

498
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,200
from Thursdays at 3:00
to Mondays at 1:00.

499
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,800
No, Stuart,
we've tried that before.

500
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,560
You had Fridays at 1:00
and Tuesdays at 11:00.

501
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,440
It really didn't help
your hypoglycaemia.

502
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,600
Now let's focus
on where we ended last time.

503
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,200
Meeting new people,

504
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,040
joining an adult-education
class or a book club.

505
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,120
I did go to an
Internet dating service.

506
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Good for you.
That's very brave.

507
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,280
It was a nightmare,
Dr. Wilder-Decker.

508
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,480
It made me
want to kill myself,
even more than the last time.

509
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,480
Wow. Well, what triggered
those feelings, Stuart?

{GROANS}

511
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,720
This mother put an ad out
looking for a mate for her
daughter and I answered it.

512
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,280
A mate for her daughter?

513
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
Stuart, some people
really shouldn't have kids.

514
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,400
I guess I didn't pass the test
because she made me
feel about this big.

515
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Stuart.

516
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,040
Imagine how screwed up
any daughter of hers would be.

517
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,640
And then when I pressed her
as to why I couldn't
meet her precious daughter,

518
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,560
- do you know what she said?
- I really hear it didn't go well.

519
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,880
"Because I said so.
That's why."

520
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,240
Mother, how could you?
When are you planning
on telling her?

521
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,240
Well, why does
she need to know?

522
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,720
I mean as long as she's happy,
that's all that's important.

523
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
And, my goodness, who knows?

he made mothers."

it was too corny.

you ought to mix it up
a little bit?

but I once had the choice

910
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,560
between a mature,
responsible young man
like Jason,

911
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,520
and your father,
who, of course,
I was infatuated with.

912
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,480
- And to this day...
- Okay, okay.

913
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,560
You know what?

914
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,360
To be fair, you're reading
a lot into a guy that you've
met for ten minutes.

915
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,480
Truth be told,
that Johnny has heartbreak
written all over his face.

916
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,880
No, no, no. Truth be told,
you know absolutely
nothing about him.

917
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,040
And know what, Mom? I got to go
'cause I'm getting
my bangs cut.

918
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,680
What?
No, no, you go ahead.

919
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,800
No, that's okay, you go ahead.

920
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,840
- Yes.
- Fine.

921
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,680
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.

922
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,440
To be truthful, you know
nothing about him.
He's actually a good parent.

923
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,440
- Hiding your incredible eyes.
- I can't do this.

924
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,240
Milly, I love you
and you may be brilliant,
but you're not smart.

925
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,520
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.

926
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,120
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought
I had a life.

927
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car

928
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,480
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.

929
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,520
That's not a life.

930
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,640
Milly, I'm your mother.
I love you enough
to tell you the truth.

931
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,400
- Your version of the truth, Mom.
- No. No.

932
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,840
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.

933
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,600
It's not something
that just sort of happens.

934
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,640
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.

935
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,440
There's still time, Mom.

936
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,480
Not if you waste
another minute of it.

937
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,760
I mean for you.

938
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,480
And I don't say
"great" too much.

939
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
MILLY: This is great.
This is great.

940
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,440
The view is great.
The night is just so great.

941
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,160
You warm enough?
You want to go inside?

942
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,440
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.

943
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay, all right.

944
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,320
And don't you just love
my mom's orange blossom
cheesecake? So good.

945
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,160
- Get a big bite.
- Wow.

946
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,560
It's great, right?

947
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,440
It's superb, which is
a synonym for great, if you're
ever looking for one.

948
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,560
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.

949
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,920
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.

950
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,280
Let me grab that.

951
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
- Be careful with that.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

952
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
I'm so sorry.

953
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,080
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you
another one...

954
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,800
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.

955
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, my God. Jason.

956
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,880
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

957
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,480
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.

958
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,400
My alarm clock
didn't go off today
and that's why I was late

959
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
and I've just been
so stressed with
the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,

960
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,160
but that's a whole...

961
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,560
You just seem really angry.

962
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,800
Nope.

963
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,960
I'm great.

964
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,120
Okay.

965
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,520
MILLY: I promise you
they're the best
chocolate soufflés ever.

966
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,160
- Well, they better be.
- They're worth it.

967
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,600
Touchdown.

968
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

969
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,040
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.

970
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,280
I'm sorry. I bumped
into, like, a parking
meter yesterday

971
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,960
and I'm always breaking stuff.

972
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,800
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.

973
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,400
Lionel, put some shoes on
before you come back
in here, all right?

974
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,680
Look, I know he can be a lot
and it gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.

975
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,960
But here you are making us
chocolate soufflés
and you're apologizing.

976
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,520
Sometimes, I think you let
people make you feel bad
about yourself.

977
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,800
Yeah, like you are right now?

978
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,960
{GRUNTING}

979
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,640
What is going on
with us today?

980
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,640
We're having an off day,
that's all.

981
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

982
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,840
I'm leaving because
you're miserable

983
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,840
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.

984
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,200
No, I said "off day."

985
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,800
And, yes,
we've had better days,

986
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,840
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones

987
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,720
if we stay together. So what?

988
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,240
- Johnny.
- Give me your hand.

989
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,560
- What?
- I'm going to try something here.

990
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,200
- What are you doing?
- Just a little something.

991
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,560
Oh.

992
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,680
- The soufflés are done.
- No, the timer didn't go off.

993
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,800
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.

994
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,320
- Those look beautiful.
- Thank you.

995
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,000
The one thing I can
actually do right.

996
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,560
- You have perfect timing.
- Thank you.

997
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,640
Come here.

998
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,720
Don't apologize.

999
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,400
He has this way
of calming me down.

1000
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,720
- A huge plus.
- Yeah.

1001
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,960
But then the whole
Lionel thing.

1002
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,040
I just worry and wonder,
would I be a good mother
to him?

1003
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,040
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.

1004
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,000
They've been through
so much, though,

1005
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,360
with Lionel's mom, like,
freaking out and splitting
when he was so young.

1006
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,160
I don't know, not that we're
anywhere near talking
about any of this yet.

1007
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,440
Just the fact
that you're wondering,
though. God.

1008
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,720
I mean the fact is
you don't know either
of these guys that well.

1009
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,360
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?

1010
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
JASON: Absolutely.

1011
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,760
Four kids.

1012
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,680
And I want to name the first
one Charlie after my father

1013
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,360
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.

1014
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,080
Then I want to design
a huge Craftsman house
for the whole brood.

1015
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
The exhibit's in here.

1016
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,360
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't let me in the museum.
Too many breakables.

1017
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,600
Don't worry. They're insured.

1018
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,120
Hey, listen.

1019
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.

1020
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
You felt bad enough already.

1021
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,600
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.

1022
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,560
Another family heirloom.

1023
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,480
He buys jewellery.
Well, it's a no-brainer.
He's the one.

1024
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,120
- He felt remorse, Mae.
- DAPHNE: Well, that's a lovely quality.

1025
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,640
No, he knew
he should feel remorse.
Oh, my God, Milly.

1026
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Those empanadas are amazing.

1027
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,400
- They're going to be perfect for Mom's party.
- Oh, my party.

1028
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,600
- Mom, what about these for your party?
- Oh, shoes, please.

1029
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,320
Why are you making
such a big deal
over this dreaded event?

1030
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,240
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?

1031
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,680
Come on, Mom.
It's not that bad.
Snap out of it.

1032
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,840
Well, I mean, it is
a milestone, and actually,
I am taking stock of my life

1033
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,480
and trying to find
some peace and quiet
in my old age,

1034
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,720
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?

1035
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,240
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.

1036
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,520
I understand,
but isn't it my choice
who I bring?

1037
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,320
- I think it is.
- Thank you.

1038
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,080
All right.

1039
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,560
Okay.

1040
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Oh.

1041
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,600
{DAPHNE MOANING}

1042
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,000
Oh, my God.

1043
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,560
Mom, Eli says
that's what I say
right before I...

1044
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,200
No kidding? Me, too.

1045
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,520
And, you know, it was funny,

1046
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,800
the other night,
we hadn't had sex
in so long, by the third one,

1047
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,040
I was setting off
the car alarms
in the neighbourhood,

1048
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,280
and dogs were barking...

1049
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,480
Three? Is that normal?

1050
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,920
Please. Everyone knows
I hold the record
in this family.

1051
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,640
Why are you so quiet?

1052
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,200
'Cause she's doing
the Oompa-Loompa
with two guys, Mom.

1053
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
- Stop it.
- What?

1054
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,640
DAPHNE: Wait a minute.

1055
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,400
At this point,
are you doing it
with both of them at once?

1056
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,680
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.

1057
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,640
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation
with Jason.

1058
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,280
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.

{EXCLAIMING}

1060
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,440

Things have gotten
so out of hand
I broke my first bundt cake.

1063
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,920
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?

1064
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,560
Believe me, it's not in here.

1065
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,400
I left it on the bed.

1066
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,760
...that it happened to you.

1067
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,600
You're making me hate you
and I don't ever want to
see your face...

1068
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,600

- Happy birthday.

MILLY: Your favourite butterscotch cake.
We made it.

1073
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,160
MAGGIE: Well, some of us made it.
MAE: We helped, okay?

1074
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,040
- It's really yummy. I tried some.
- All right.

1075

- Make a wish, make a wish.
- Make a wish, Mom.

I'd like to propose a toast.

1080
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,320
To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,

1081
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,480
the fearless leader of
the Wilder women, who I hope
to someday call family.

1082
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,720
You've created
a wonderful family,

1083
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,160
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,

1084
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,880
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1087

- Cheers.
- WOMAN: Cheers.

1088
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,360
Thank you so much.

1089
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,160
Thank you, thank you.

1090
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,360
- What was that exactly?
- Did you know he was going to do that?

1091
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,200
Did he just propose?
Because I think
he just proposed.

1092
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,440
I think he did.
The question is, to who?

1093
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,000
Maggie, stop being a killjoy.
All right, girls,
what do you think?

1094
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
- He seems well-read.
- He's tall.

1095
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,120
- Okay, you guys don't like him at all.
- Don't listen to your sisters.

1096
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,280
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.

1097
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,320
Here's what I'm thinking.

1098
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,520
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.

1099
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,840
They're a little conservative,

1100
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,080
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.

1101
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,480
- Just this once, honey?
- Stop.

1102
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,880
It's just a gesture,
just make them
more comfortable.

1103
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,240
I understand it's a gesture
but, Mom,
this is moving very quickly.

1104
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,240
- He just said all of this. It's...
- Milly, don't fight it.

1105
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,400
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

1106
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,120
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.

1107
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,360
I hate pleated skirts.

1108
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,440
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?

1109
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,680
- That's a great idea. Come on, Mils.
- Yes, yes.

1110
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,840

00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?

1114
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,840
<i>And I dated him Wednesday</i>

1115
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,000

- Yes.

Milly? Will you take
the soprano?

1118
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,600
You know, that's it.
That's it.

1119
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,720
No, no. You're so
out of control.

1120
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,840
What'd I do this time?

1121
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,720
You're forcing me.
Jason's here.
You're making me...

1122
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,200
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?

1123
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,200
Will I need one?

1124
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,080
Oh, yeah.

- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1127
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,600
You're not going to go.
You're out of control.
Milly's right.

1128
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,960
- I don't know how she can take it.
- I can't. I can't take it anymore.

1129
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,800
Well, excuse me for just
one moment here. I thought
that this was my birthday.

1130
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,400
My very big, special birthday.

1131
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,040
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.

1132
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,080
That's how you should remember

1133
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,280
- you're too old...
- Old?

1134
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,080
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.

1135
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,000
You're pushing her
like you pushed her
into Girl Scouts.

1136
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,720
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.

1137
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,800
- You have to stop.
- Yeah.

1138
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,000
You have to change
at some point.

1139
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,520
Fine. But I just want you
girls to understand something
about motherhood, okay?

1140
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,720
Mom.

1141
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
- Okay?
- MAGGIE: Yeah, okay.

1142
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,480
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.

1143
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,920
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.

1144
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:39,040
All I know is, it's absolutely
fine for me to teach you
how to walk and talk,

1145
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,080
and then you grow up and you
head off in the wrong
direction toward a cliff.

1146
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,960
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,

1147
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,320
"Well, kids, good luck.
It's Mom. I'm here."
Well, I can't do that.

1148
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,240
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1149
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,200
Am I supposed to just put my
feet up at the end of the day
and say to myself,

1150
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,880
"Well, you know,
they're on their own
and she says she's fine."

1151
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,000
Well, you won't be.

when you're doing it.

you're meeting his family

I wouldn't say it that way.

would you say it?

Are you going to stop
seeing him?

- No, it doesn't.

That's not true.
That's not true.

JASON'S MOTHER:
Jason's finally met
such a wonderful girl.

1360
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,680
She's so sweet.
She has the loveliest spirit
about her.

1361
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,080
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.

1362
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,000
Not like in our day.

1363
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,360
That somehow reminds me

1364
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,760
of people writing
a phone number
on the bathroom wall.

1365
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,240
- Sweetie, I think that we should...
- Are you dating somebody else?

1366
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,240
What?

1367
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,720
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about

1368
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,960
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.

1369
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,320
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.

1370
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,840
I'm surprised
and I don't even know
if I have the right to be,

1371
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,600
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you

1372
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,640
that I'm also dating
somebody else.

1373
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:52,240
Well, first of all, to be
honest, you didn't need to
be so honest.

1374
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,040
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

1375
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,880
But since we're being honest,
this is something
that I was saving for later.

1376
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,080
What?

1377
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,200
My mother's personal ad?

1378
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,200
Oh, my God.

1379
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,640
You sounded just like her there.

1380
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1381
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,400
Hey, hey, hey.
What does it matter
how we met?

1382
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,440
You and my mom have been
totally scheming

1383
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,600
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.

1384
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,880
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.

1385
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,880
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.

1386
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,440
What matters is that
we did meet and how good
this is between us.

1387
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,520
And the truth of that...

1388
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,840
The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?

1389
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,480
Because you've been living
a lie and I've been
lying to you, Jason.

1390
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,840
And it doesn't
change anything.

1391
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,640
How does that not
change everything?

1392
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,840
Because you're here.
I think you already
made your choice.

1393
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,680
But if it helps, I'll say it.

1394
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,840
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.

1395
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,960
Close enough to spend
the rest of our lives
together.

1396
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,160
I knew I had you
the day I met you.

1397
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,760
How could you know
something like that?

1398
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,040
'Cause you were so nervous,

1399
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,440
you laughed like a hyena
in that beautiful polka dot
dress of yours.

1400
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,640
Really?

1401
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,640
Mmm-hmm.

1402
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,080
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1403
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,080
You did not have me
the moment that we met

1404
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,680
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact

1405
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,960
that your staff talked
about you behind your back
at the dessert table.

1406
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,800
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,

1407
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,360
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me

1408
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,120
on our first date,
except the calamari.

1409
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,000
And okay, fine, yes,
it was nice to not have
to think for a change,

1410
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,760
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?

1411
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,080
Look, and sometimes you laugh
when I cry and say, "Huh?"
when I make perfect sense.

1412
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,600
And never, ever, in my life
have I burned a chocolate
soufflé until now

1413
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,040
and that, in and of itself,

1414
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,520
oh, my God, should have
told me I don't feel
like myself around you.

1415
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,880
And I would have decided that
a long time ago
if it weren't for my mother.

1416
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,800
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena

1417
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,720
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?

1418
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,920
I love that dress.

1419
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,280
Take her out.

1420
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,720
Hey.

1421
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,960
- Stuart, this is an emergency.
- Well, should I wait?

1422
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,760
- Let's reschedule.
- But I'm suicidal.

1423
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,640
Oh, wow, this is making me
feel like when I was
the last pick in kickball...

1424
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,520
Right and that's exactly
where we'll begin next week.

1425
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,640
Maggie, you promised me
after Willie Matthews,

1426
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,120
you would never
lie to me again.

1427
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,640
- Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
- Stop.

1428
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,000
Well, I'm sorry.
Mommy made me promise
not to say anything

1429
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,720
- or she'd be furious.
- Mommy?

1430
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,600
Mommy made you promise?
Where is your own moral code?

1431
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,080
Your adulthood?
Your sisterhood?

1432
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,360
Just...

1433
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,520
- I'm feeling rejected by you.
- Okay.

1434
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp

1435
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,640
when Jimmy Feldon and
Eric Fishman both transferred
out of my bunk.

1436
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,400
I totally understand, Stuart.

1437
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,560
Come back today
and we'll do a two-hour
session at 3:00 p.m.

1438
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,120
Listen, you're right.

1439
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,880
I didn't handle this well
and I understand
you feel betrayed.

1440
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,440
But, really,
isn't some of this anger
a little misplaced?

1441
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,040
No, no, Maggie.
It's placed exactly
where it should be.

1442
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,760
And there is plenty to
go around, so don't worry,
Mom will be getting hers.

1443
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,360
- Okay...
- Maggie.

1444
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,080
Stuart, I am asking you
to empower yourself and leave.

1445
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,200
This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.

1446
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,680
This makes me feel like when
I was 13 and no one came
to my bar mitzvah.

1447
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,480
Why didn't they come?
I don't get it.

1448
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,280
Stuart, you have
a blood sugar problem, okay?

1449
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,960
Just get some lunch,
you'll be fine.

1450
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,200
Honey, I know this is painful.

1451
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,840
Do you have any snacks in here?

1452
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,280
Third shelf on the right.

1453
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,760
Honey, instead of blaming Mom,

1454
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,880
you should really focus on
the fact that both of these
guys went along with it.

1455
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,840
I am, I am. Because
I just told Jason that...

1456
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,040
Guys...

1457
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,320
Guys?

1458
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,760
That was plural, wasn't it?

1459
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,720
I feel like I don't know
what you guys
are talking about

1460
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,800
and it's making me feel
very much out of the loop,

1461
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,520
and it's making me want
to jump out the window.

1462
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,320
Stuart. For ten years,
my sister has sat here

1463
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,000
and told me that you're
about to commit suicide.

1464
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,160
Well?

1465
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,080
You mean she's been
talking about me?

1466
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,680
Wow. God.

Okay, so the orange-cranberry
muffins are in here?

They're in there.

are in here too?

Mother, I told you
on the phone I need distance.

Okay. But it's a new recipe.

how can I be happy
if she's not happy, hmm?

<i>Okay.</i>

What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,560
What are... Nothing.

1509

Just do nothing.

<i>Hi, Milly.
This is your mother.</i>

1513
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,920
Hopefully, you still have
a mental picture of me.

1514
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We have the same hands
and earlobes

1515
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,960
and love of Bauer pottery.

1516

not to call you</i>

you might like to know</i>

that I found Grandma's recipe
for your favourite
Lady Baltimore cake.

1520
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,680
The one from my
third birthday.

1521
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,960
The one from
your third birthday.

<i>You know what, Milly?
Okay, you were right
about Johnny.</i>

1523
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,840
Obviously,
he has more character.

1524
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,160
I mean,
he's really a good guy.

1525
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,800
<i>And you should know
that he never saw that ad,</i>

1526
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,920
<i>and, in fact,
we met by chance.</i>

1527
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,000
He was just an
innocent bystander.

1528
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,000
I know that I'm
saying too much.
I've learned my lesson.

1529
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,160
Good.

1530
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,120
Because, Milly,
it's your life.

1531
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,680
Yup, that's right.
That's absolutely right.

1532
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,280

Leave me a message.</i>

and it's fine with me that
you've chosen not to pick up.</i>

1534
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,480
But, Milly,
if you're in any way
still pulled to Johnny,

1535
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,160
then please don't let
your pride or our differences

1536
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,200
come between you
and getting what you want

1537
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,600
otherwise, honey,
you're going to end up
like some pathetic character

1538
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,760
<i>in a Tennessee Williams play.</i>

1539
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,600
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

1540
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,960
Okay.

1541
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,880
Milly...

1542
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,800
<i>Milly?</i>

1543
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,400
I never meant to
hurt you, sweetie.

1544
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,960
And I promise I will never
ever interfere ever again.

1545
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,720
<i>I was, I was only, I mean...</i>

1546
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,280
I guess what I'm trying to say is

1547
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,920
that I was just
trying to protect you
from becoming me.

1548
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,160
My sweet girl.

1549
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,920
Mom?

1550
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,760
Hi, honey.

1551
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,440
I miss you.

1552
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,680
I miss you, too.

1553
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,600
Solo on the four chord.

1554
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,720
Alternate the bass line, will you?

1555
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,960
Too late for spring sign-up.

1556
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,440
I've actually been here before.

1557
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,480
I came once on a Tuesday
when it was closed,
and I just wanted to...

1558
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,000
You know, I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.

1559
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,200
Please.

1560
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,200
I miss you.

1561
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,560
I miss us

1562
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,400
and I'm not seeing anybody.

1563
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,640
That doesn't change
anything for us, Milly.

1564
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,960
Yeah, but Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I'm so deeply sorry,

1565
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,440
and I wish I could find
a less cliché word
for sorry, but...

1566
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,600
It was an aberration.
It's not who I am,

1567
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,120
and I know
we can't start over,
but maybe we could...

1568
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,560
Maybe we could try this again.

1569
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,120
I need to get back up there.

1570
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,480
LIONEL: Okay, you're driving
a bus. Seven hundred
and fifty people get on.

1571
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,880
Two get off.

1572
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,120
Thirty thousand
seventy-one get on.

1573
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,800
Four hundred and five get off.

1574
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,240
A thousand get on
and nine hundred
and ninety-nine get off.

1575
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,760
Get off.

1576
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,240
What colour are
the bus driver's eyes?

1577
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,640
I don't know.

1578
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,600
I said you're driving the bus.
Get it, dummy?

1579
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,680
You dummy.

1580
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,040
Dummy.

1581
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,200
You did say that, Lionel.
That's right. That's so good.

1582
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,760
- He did.
- That is so great. That is so great.

1583
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,800
Want to hear it again?

1584
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,080
Well, I mean, I don't know.

1585
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,840
Actually, I thought
you really nailed it
that last time, so...

1586
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,320
- Didn't he?
- Just one more time. Please?

1587
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,360
Okay.

1588
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,760
Okay, you're driving a bus.

1589
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,280
- Five people get off. Six people get on.
- Really?

1590
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,960
Seven hundred
and seventy-five thousand
get on.

1591
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,640
Seven hundred
and thirty-five million
and one...

1592
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,120
- Oh, no.
- Hey, guys.

1593
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,760
You know, I forgot
a few things at the market.

1594
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,880
I'm just going to...
I'll be right back.

1595
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,440
Dad, Dad, you got to
hear this punch line.

1596
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,840
Yeah, yeah. You really,
really... You have to
stick around for this.

1597
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,880
Think you got to, Johnny.

1598
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,280
- LIONEL: Okay, now.
- What is it?

1599
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,960
- You are driving a bus.
- Yeah.

1600
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,320
A billon million catrillion get on.

1601
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,080
I cannot believe
you are here.
You are truly insane.

1602
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,640
Two hundred billion million get off.

1603
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,960
Well, I... This is
a surprise to you?

1604
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,240
Daphne, you're not listening.

1605
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,320
Honey, oh, no, no.
I swear, of course,
I'm listening.

1606
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,760
Okay. Dad and Daphne.
You're driving a bus.

1607
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,600
Five hundred catrillion
cazillion get on.

1608
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,840
- But zero...
- Lionel, look.

1609
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,320
- A blimp.
- Where?

1610
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,920
- Right there.
- I can't see it.

1611
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,960
- Right there. Look harder.
- Where? Show me.

1612
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,360
- I can't see it.
- Up, up. Look harder.

1613
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,280
I've wanted to talk to you
for the past few days
and I haven't had the nerve.

1614
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,440
That I find hard to believe.

1615
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,040
Johnny, you have
too much pride.

1616
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,520
I prefer to call it
common sense.

1617
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,800
It's pride,
and it's a quality
you and I share.

1618
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,840
It's an admirable one,
until it becomes a wall.

1619
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,400
"Well, yes, I am alone,

1620
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,480
"but at least
I have my righteous anger
to keep me company at night."

1621
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,440
Come on, that's not a life,
and you know it.

1622
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,920
And let's face it.
I mean, if it wasn't for me,

1623
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,080
obviously Milly
never would have betrayed you
in the first place.

1624
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,920
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?

1625
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,600
Why waste one more minute
of your life?

1626
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,400
And I'm right.

1627
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,680
I'm so right.

1628
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,760
Damn it.

1629
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,440
For once, she is.

1630
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,800
Jeez, you guys,
no one's listening.

1631
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,440
If Milly was here,
she would get my joke.

1632
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,160
You're driving a bus.
Ten people get on.
Ten people get off.

1633
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,400
Thirty thousand get on.
Thirty thousand get off.
A million get on...

1634
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,760
See, that's the fun
of the tuna pasta toss,

1635
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,880
'cause it's delicious
and it's easy,

1636
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,480
because when
you're cooking for one,

1637
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,040
it's really important
to look forward to
the end result. You know?

1638
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,560
JOHNNY: What if you want to
make it for two?

1639
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,880
It's a little bit
more complicated,
but I think it can be done.

1640
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,080
I see some of you
have gone ahead

1641
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,360
and already
added your carrots
and your pickled relish.

1642
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,400
And remember
that some people like dill.

1643
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,680
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.

1644
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,680
And once I saw
you were a woman
with profound static cling,

1645
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,200
I wanted to be
that force around you.

1646
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,240
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough

1647
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,480
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,

1648
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,680
and I also really love

I love that
when I breathe you in,
you smell of cake batter.

01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,160
And I love that
you have this insane way

01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,360
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.

Me.

I get you.

That's wonderful.
But, you know,
my bladder is about to pop.

Can you hold it for a minute?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?

1659
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,800
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,

your mother.

- Well, it should have started 20 minutes ago.

- That's not like her.
- I mean, the ceremony has to start soon.

I don't know
where she is, though.

Hi, Mom. Where are you?

Honey, I just have to
talk to you a little
bit later, okay? Mil...

Oh, my God. I kind of think
she's having sex
with Joe right now.

- Great.
- Awesome.

Would she like us to explain
that to all the guests,
or just the preacher?

She is a woman after
my own heart.

All right, Mom?
We are going to give you
five more minutes.
