00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,144
If the Flight Surgeon
won't clean bill you,

634
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:11,745
what do you expect me to do?

635
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:15,947
Just... talk to him.
He listens to you.

636
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:23,017
I mean, you got the same respect
on this base as the old man, so...

637
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,931
I'd rather be dead than on the ground.

638
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,576
Easy, you're the best friend I got.

639
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,340
Please don't do this to me.

640
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,144
General Luntz, Colonel Bullard.

641
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,082
[LUNTZ]: Thank you, Lieutenant.

642
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,557
- Colonel, please.
- Thank you.

643
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,692
No, thank you, sir.

644
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,197
Colonel, I'm in a hell of a fix
with our target in Europe.

645
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,928
Our boys are getting cut to shreds.

646
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,534
I read the action report
from Operation Shingle.

647
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:17,675
Eight kills in your first wave.
Thirteen in all.

648
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,738
That's a right trick.

649
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,846
Colonel, I'll give it to you straight.

650
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,911
I can't afford the kind of losses
my bombers have been suffering.

651
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:30,652
Do you have film of the air cover
your bombers are getting now, sir?

652
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,724
[LUNTZ]: We need to change
the way we fight.

653
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,600
I need pilots who will fly close and tight
to the heavies all the way.

654
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,603
Not put my men in harm's way
by chasing rabbits.

655
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,543
So you're asking me to tell my men
not to shoot down Jerry fighters?

656
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,242
I'm asking them to put the bombers
ahead of themselves.

657
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,513
I don't care if they never splash
another Jerry fighter.

658
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,248
I need to get my heavies
to the target and back.

659
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,723
The losses from enemy air, I believe
my men can get that down, sir.

660
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,586
If you can bring back one or two more
of my planes every mission...

661
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:13,123
Sir, I believe we can cut your losses
by 70% or 80%.

662
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,437
Colonel, the word is you're arrogant.

663
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:21,705
If "arrogant" is the only word
people use to describe me now,

664
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,372
I would say I think I'm making progress.

665
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,788
Can you help us?
I'm asking you man to man.

666
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,460
Can you help save lives?

667
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,662
We need new planes.
No more hand-me-downs.

668
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,497
If you get us new planes,

669
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,438
we can help your boys.

670
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,806
I got a bullet right through my canopy.
I ought to be dead, y'all.

671
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,910
But nothing happened to me though.
It's Black Jesus, I'm telling you.

672
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,888
Oh, go on with that. Let's play.

673

Don't sass Black Jesus,
now you might need him one day.

674

00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,885
(CHUCKLES)

792
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:49,235
The American pilots flying escort now
go for every kill they can score.

793
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,739
That's how they were trained.
That's how they fight.

794
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,337
Here's how we change up the strategy.
Lights up.

795
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:03,582
At all costs, under every circumstance,
you protect the heavies.

796
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,880
Colonel.

797
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,854
We signed up to shoot Germans,
not babysit planes.

798
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,826
[BULLARD]:
You signed up to follow orders.

799
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,153
One bomber, that's 10 men.

800
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:20,998
You getting one Jerry
so you can put a cross on your plane,

801
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,094
that doesn't balance that.

802
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,902
We count our victories...

803
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,375
by the bombers we get to their targets.

804
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,743
By the husbands
we return to their wives.

805
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:37,148
By the fathers
we get back to their children.

806
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,953
What has not changed,
what will never change,

807
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:45,687
from the last plane, to the last bullet,
to the last minute,

808
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,785
to the last man, we fight.

809
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,326
We fight!

810
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,694
[ALL]: Yes, sir!

811
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,675
We've secured new aircrafts.
P-51's.

812
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:03,767
(ALL MURMURING)

813
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,608
The best the AAF's got.

814
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:09,973
As soon as we get the A-okay,
we'll begin ferrying them in from Bari.

815
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,851
Dismissed.

816
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,069
Say cheese, say cheese.

817
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:32,529
Whoo-hoo!

818
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,040
My, my, my!

819
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,876
Hey, Maurice! How are they flying?

820
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,746
Like angels.

821
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,783
I don't know any angels
with six 50-caliber machine guns.

822
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,445
All right, men, get your manuals.
Get familiar.

823
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,112
- Coffee!
- Yes, sir.

824
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,180
We'll need them all marked up
and ready to fly.

825
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,281
It's taken care of.

826
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,920
The Major says paint their tails
bright red, so they stand out.

827
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,153
Like the Red Baron.

828
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,196
- Loud and proud.
- Appreciate it.

829
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,430
Beautiful.

830
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:10,767
(BLUE SKIES PLAYING)

831
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:15,043
Blue skies smiling at me

832
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:20,479
Nothing but blue skies do I see

833
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,114
This will definitely make
the group distinctive.

834
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,184
Bright red tails and black pilots?

835
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,254
You can't call us nothing else
but distinctive.

836
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,327
(CHUCKLES)

837
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,760
From now on

838
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,171
Never saw the sun shining so bright

839
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:43,608
Never saw things going so right

840
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,339
What do you think?

841
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,473
It's like it's speeding
even when it's sitting.

842
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,118
I never even met a girl
as beautiful as this plane.

843
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,123
Well, take good care of her.

844
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,659
What do you mean?

845
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,752
I twisted the Flight Surgeon's arm.

846
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,560
Got you back on the roster.
You going up with us next mission.

847
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,127
(LAUGHING)

848
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,564
Uh...

849
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,538
Sorry. Thank you, sir.

850
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,935
I'm going to tell the guys.

851
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,009
[DEKE]: Heavenly Father, we thank you
for this glorious day.

852
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:56,081
We ask that you send your angels down
to surround us as we fly through the sky.

853
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,413
We know
that it's part of your master plan...

854
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:01,546
that we've made it all the way
from Tuskegee here to Ramitelli.

855
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,250
We are very confident in our abilities,

856
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:08,352
but we ask that you give us
the vision, the sight,

857
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,827
and the speed and power
to make it through this mission.

858
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,333
All the airmen say,
"In Jesus' name we pray". Amen.

859
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,460
[ALL]: Amen.

860
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,596
- [NEON]: Nothing's difficult.
- [ALL]: Everything's a challenge.

861
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,640
- [NEON]: Through adversity...
- [ALL]:... To the stars!

862
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,641
From the last plane,
to the last bullet,

863
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,574
to the last minute,
to the last man, we fight!

864
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,304
- [ALL]: We fight!
- We fight! We fight! We fight! We fight!

865
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,450
Anybody got eyes on the bombers?

866
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,146
Uh...

867
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:34,450
we are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.

868
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:38,886
Right on target, and according
to my reckoning, 32 seconds early.

869
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,519
We're here. They're not.

870
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:43,061
Maybe the bombers turned back.

871
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,261
Damn! Maybe they went on without us.

872
01:05:47,996 --> 01:05:49,472
Red One, there they are.

873
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,335
Nine o'clock low.

874
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,945
Junior, head on over to the bomber leader.

875
01:05:58,139 --> 01:05:59,515
Let him know We Te friendlies.

876
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:00,948
Roger that.

877
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:07,621
Bogies! Three high.

Everybody, an your guns.

879
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:12,592
Counting' close to 70 chicks,
We got one coming down,

880
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:18,434
Hold your fire. They're ours.

881
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,396
Red tails? I don't recognize the markings.

882
01:06:22,196 --> 01:06:23,674
He's colored.

883
01:06:23,764 --> 01:06:25,069
[CAPTAIN]: Yeah, right.

884
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,134
Hell if I'm joking! Look.

885
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:32,184
[CAPTAIN]: Jesus Christ.
They can't all be colored.

886
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,944
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!

887
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,823
What the hell do we do?

Decoy Squadron, move in
and draw off those fighters.

[EASY]: They're not attacking.
Let them go.

895
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:13,414
Let them go?

896
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,651
Our orders are to stay with the bombers.

897
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:18,593
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.

898
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:22,526
You heard Colonel Bullard.
Forget the prize, save the lives.

899
01:07:22,825 --> 01:07:24,996
God, I hate this war.

900
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:30,069
[LEAD BOMBER]: Look at that.
Those Red Tails are staying put.

to save our asses.

01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,738
Break!

905
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:45,047
[EASY]: Here we go, Lightning.

906
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:46,145
Right behind you.

907
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:54,363
Where'd this jackass come from?

908
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,004
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!

909
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,009
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.

910
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:11,513
Stop fooling around! Damn it, I'm coming.

911

[LIGHTNING]: No, you're not, stay put,

912

I'm gonna show him
a little trick I learned.

out of here.

Flak's getting thick.

921
01:08:57,653 --> 01:09:00,596
Break off. Circle clear of the flak
until the bombers return.

922
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,195
Good luck, bombardiers!

923
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:26,383
All bombs away!
Let's get the hell out of here.

924

Move in...

927
01:09:36,324 --> 01:09:37,393
concentrate on the stragglers!

928
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:43,576
Hey, Junior!
You got a bandit on your left!

929
01:09:43,877 --> 01:09:45,277
Get outta there.
I'll take him.

Junior, get outta there!

931

Where is he?
I can't see him!

932
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:54,077
Ah!

933
01:09:55,977 --> 01:09:57,751
Junior, where are you? Are you all right?

934
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,347
I'm all right!

Junior, you ire on Ere!

936
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,092
Junior, get out of the plane!

937
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:05,560
Junior!

938
01:10:09,892 --> 01:10:11,098
Come on, Junior, bail!

939
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:18,409
Geronimo!

940
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:49,273
We didn't lose a single plane.

941
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,206
Well, that's a first.

942
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,346
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!

943
01:10:56,506 --> 01:10:58,144
Don't look good.

944
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:01,684
Deke, talk to me. What's your status?

945
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:04,114
I'm all right.

946
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:08,021
I got gas spraying everywhere,
but I think I'm gonna be okay.

947
01:11:08,318 --> 01:11:12,526
I'm a little dizzy,
but other than that, I'm fine.

948
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,465
All right, listen up.

949
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,937
I'll give escort to Deke.

It's my call, Lightning.

953
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,382
Your calls have been a little off lately.

954
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:30,317
What? What are you talking about?

955
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:31,780
Junior shouldn't have been up here.

956
01:11:33,643 --> 01:11:35,143
You got a problem with
the way I'm running this squad,

957
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:37,056
you talk to Bullard about it, all right?

958
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:38,854
Until then, I'm in control.

959
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:41,395
And my order for you right now
is to head back to base.

960
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:44,991
Damn!

961
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:48,625
All right, Deke, you'll be all right.
I'll see you back at the ranch.

962
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:50,138
You got Black Jesus with you, boy!

01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,828
Thanks, Smokey.

Well, get me home, Easy.

No, sir.
You're going to get yourself home.

What the hell put the Captain
in such a bad mood?

967

He gets like that sometimes.

968
01:12:13,952 --> 01:12:16,725
He knows good and well
he shouldn't have let Junior fly.

969
01:12:16,785 --> 01:12:17,821

I hope we meet up
with those Red Tails next time.

You guys are taking the long way.

975
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:47,059
I'm going to take a shortcut
down the coast.

976
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:49,792
Come on now, Lightning.
Ain't no need to get all crazy.

977
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:51,131
You know you got to stay
with your squadron.

978
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:54,634
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.

979
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:56,140
And what if you turn up missing?

980
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,841
Then I'll have to break it
to Major Stance.

984
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,613
And keep him out of trouble.

985
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:12,085
Don't worry. I'll stick with him.

All right.

You're diving, Deke.
You need to pull back on your stick.

01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,063
Oh, I'm pulling up! I'm pulling up!

Stay with me.

01:15:14,799 --> 01:15:18,680
Nah. You need about a 500-pound bomb
to put a dent in that thing.

01:15:19,303 --> 01:15:22,149

Lightning, no, all right? Don't be crazy.

1015

If the big guns don't kill you,
your plane will get messed up,

I once was a happy man.
Never did not have a smile on my face.

1262
01:36:13,407 --> 01:36:15,718
That was before you guys started
tearing up my beautiful planes.

1263
01:36:16,612 --> 01:36:18,613
I could tolerate the P-40s.

1264
01:36:18,682 --> 01:36:21,923
But these new babies getting beat up?
It breaks my heart.

1265
01:36:22,617 --> 01:36:26,326
Come on, Coffee. I only came back
with two holes this time.

1266
01:36:27,089 --> 01:36:28,833
Uh. Six. Six holes.

1267
01:36:29,524 --> 01:36:31,936
Well, that ain't nothing compared
to what's gonna happen to you

1268
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:35,269
when you run into those jets
those bomber jockeys was talking about.

1269
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,867
I ain't afraid of no jets.

1270
01:36:37,665 --> 01:36:39,873
Don't go trying your old tricks,
Lightning.

1271
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,074
If you end up too close
behind one of those jets,

1272
01:36:42,136 --> 01:36:44,376
the turbulence alone will blow
your black ass right out of the sky.

1273
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,812
Trust me, I'm gonna be the first one
to shoot one of those things down.

1274
01:36:47,874 --> 01:36:49,081
And I'll be the second.

1275
01:36:49,145 --> 01:36:52,125
My advice is, you see one, run like hell.

1276
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:56,126
The only thing in life that makes me
want to run like hell is you, Coffee.

1277
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:57,390
(LAUGHING)

1278
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:02,297
That's gonna get you killed out there.
I'm not dancing with you.

1279
01:37:03,794 --> 01:37:07,367
The target is a tank factory
on the outskirts of Berlin.

1280
01:37:08,196 --> 01:37:13,614
Shut that down, you shut down Jerry's
ability to shore up a Berlin defense.

1281
01:37:13,836 --> 01:37:17,411
General Campbell's wing
will be leading the bombardment.

1282
01:37:17,574 --> 01:37:19,680
You have recon on the area?

1283
01:37:19,776 --> 01:37:24,451
In the air, we're expecting everything
the Luftwaffe's got, 1005, 1095, 1905.

1284
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:28,358
A possibility of 262's,
German jet fighters.

1285
01:37:28,586 --> 01:37:31,223
- Jet fighters?
- The boys are gonna love this one!

1286
01:37:33,158 --> 01:37:35,661
The target area isn't your concern.

1287
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:40,464
The 52nd will escort
the General's planes into Berlin.

1288
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,936
Is there a reason, sir?

1289
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:48,883
Sixteen hundred miles to Berlin and back.
The fighters need to take it in stages.

1290
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:51,942
With external fuel tanks,
the 51s can make it.

1291
01:37:52,006 --> 01:37:53,784
I guarantee our pilots can.

1292
01:37:53,977 --> 01:37:56,858
I'd prefer the Red Tails take the leg
where we need protecting.

1293
01:37:57,446 --> 01:38:00,290
Our first major air offensive over Berlin.

1294
01:38:01,385 --> 01:38:03,831
From a propaganda point of view,

1295
01:38:04,288 --> 01:38:06,825
a lot of attention gonna be paid to this
and a lot of ink spilled.

1296
01:38:07,325 --> 01:38:10,235
And Negro pilots
aren't part of that story.

1297
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,264
Colonel, A.J.

1298
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:18,870
This is coming from way above me.

1299
01:38:19,839 --> 01:38:24,284
If you didn't have my respect,
I wouldn't be talking to you face to face.

1300
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:28,355
But we don't win this war, all my regard,

1301
01:38:28,413 --> 01:38:31,326
everything that you
and your men have done,

1302
01:38:33,117 --> 01:38:35,119
none of it means a thing.

1303
01:38:43,826 --> 01:38:45,067
Colonel.

1304
01:38:45,895 --> 01:38:49,207
Please see to it that
the General gets to his plane.

1305
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:50,937
Sir.

1306
01:39:01,114 --> 01:39:02,522
You like it?

1307
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:13,493
I wa nt you

1308
01:39:14,259 --> 01:39:16,668
stay in Italia.

1309
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:21,238
You want me to stay?

1310
01:39:25,034 --> 01:39:26,671
Does that mean...

1311
01:39:27,437 --> 01:39:29,247
Does that mean you'll marry me?

1312
01:39:30,775 --> 01:39:33,119
Yes. Marriage.

1313
01:39:40,687 --> 01:39:42,061
I love you.

1314
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:48,532
I can't believe it.

1315
01:39:52,499 --> 01:39:54,274
I'm getting married.

1316
01:40:01,107 --> 01:40:04,576
Okay, we're going to throw it, all right?
There you go.

1317
01:40:05,876 --> 01:40:08,188
There you go. All right. Throw!

1318
01:40:12,184 --> 01:40:13,527
(LIGHTNING LAUGHING)

1319
01:40:29,268 --> 01:40:31,578
I'm looking for Captain Julian.

1320
01:40:32,168 --> 01:40:33,549
Right here.

1321
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:38,878
You the one they call Easy?

1322
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:42,082
I guess some people do.
What can I help you with?

1323
01:40:42,347 --> 01:40:46,091
I'm Captain Miller.
I was in prison with Lieutenant Gannon.

1324
01:40:46,686 --> 01:40:49,221
He asked me to give his tags to you.

1325
01:40:53,259 --> 01:40:54,632
Four of us got out.

1326
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:59,270
The deal was, if we made it and he didn't,
I'd get his dog tags back to his unit.

1327
01:41:01,636 --> 01:41:03,375
Ray was a good man.

1328
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:07,248
To whoever it matters,
you tell them from me.

1329
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:10,075
Ray was the best soldier I ever met.

1330
01:41:11,707 --> 01:41:13,054
Thank you.

1331
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:32,703
A moment, Colonel.

1332
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,975
What is it, Captain?

1333
01:41:40,973 --> 01:41:43,077
[EASY]:
Ray Gannon's dog tags, sir.

1334
01:41:45,946 --> 01:41:50,085
A soldier brought it by today.
He and Ray were prisoners together.

1335
01:41:51,051 --> 01:41:53,692
They got out from under the Germans,

1336
01:41:55,021 --> 01:41:56,932
but Ray didn't make it.

1337
01:42:02,764 --> 01:42:06,301
Sir, Ray Gun wasn't fit
when I put him back in rotation.

1338
01:42:06,732 --> 01:42:07,979
The Flight Surgeon
wouldn't clean bill him,

1339
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,080
so, I talked my way
right past him.

1340
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:19,851
I just don't feel like I'm fit
to lead the squad any more.

1341
01:42:22,884 --> 01:42:24,487
I've made so many mistakes.

1342
01:42:24,552 --> 01:42:27,157
No, you've made one big mistake.

1343
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:30,429
That self-pity of yours,
that's your weakness.

1344
01:42:30,792 --> 01:42:33,236
But it ends right here, right now.

1345
01:42:34,226 --> 01:42:36,732
You man up, you lead your squad.

1346
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:42,236
Every decision that you make
isn't gonna always be the right one.

1347
01:42:51,544 --> 01:42:53,422
[STANCE]: All right, this is it.

1348
01:42:54,145 --> 01:42:57,254
For the first time, the bombers
are going all the way to Berlin.

1349
01:42:57,786 --> 01:43:01,927
They'll be up against 109s and 2625,
the new jet fighters.

1350
01:43:03,957 --> 01:43:05,061
(ALL CHEERING)

1351
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:14,238
Unfortunately, we're only going to escort
them on the first leg of their mission,

1352
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,075
so I don't expect you'll see much action.

1353
01:43:16,704 --> 01:43:19,809
You will rendezvous
with the relief escorts at 0830.

1354
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:23,917
I know this is disappointing to you.
It's not the job you wanted.

1355
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:26,580
But those are your orders.

1356
01:43:27,049 --> 01:43:28,650
- Understood?
- [ALL]: Yes, sir!

1357
01:43:28,782 --> 01:43:32,127
Full briefing at 0-400.
On the flight line at 0-530.

1358
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:33,323
Spread the word, gentlemen.

1359
01:43:33,585 --> 01:43:35,727
Julian. A moment.

1360
01:43:42,763 --> 01:43:47,340
Captain, if your relief doesn't arrive,
as squadron leader, it's your call.

1361
01:43:47,403 --> 01:43:49,609
If you think you can make it.

1362
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:51,544
Sir.

1363
01:43:52,007 --> 01:43:53,644
That is all, son.

1364
01:44:39,054 --> 01:44:40,499
[CAMPBELL]: We're past
the rendezvous point.

1365
01:44:40,555 --> 01:44:42,865
Tail gunner,
has the 52nd squadron arrived?

1366
01:44:43,227 --> 01:44:45,398
No, sir. No sign of them.

1367
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,795
Anybody got eyes on our relief fighters?

1368
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,167
[SMOKEY]:
Not a dang thing, Red One.

1369
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,740
Are we going all the way, sir?

1370
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:54,975
[EASY]: Fuel-wise,
we're looking good.

1371
01:44:55,305 --> 01:44:56,850
But I'm guessing
the hours there and back,

1372
01:44:57,051 --> 01:44:59,151
it'll definitely be one
for the record books.

1373
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,119
Come on, Easy. it's Berlin.

1374
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,249
Let's go. We can make it.

1375
01:45:11,187 --> 01:45:15,257
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.

1376
01:45:16,258 --> 01:45:17,672
Yeah! We fight!

1377
01:45:17,926 --> 01:45:20,837
Ha-ha! Watch out, Hitler, here we come!

1378
01:45:20,892 --> 01:45:24,070
Just remember, we're here
to protect the bombers.

1379
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,113
Under all circumstances,
we stay on mission.

1380
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,180
What's that about?

1381
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,583
I think we've got the Red Tails
for the duration.

1382
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:45,030
[WINKY]: By my reckoning,
we're deep into Germany.

1383
01:45:45,087 --> 01:45:47,327
It's a little creepy
we haven't seen any fighters yet.

1384
01:45:48,557 --> 01:45:51,332
Maybe they found out
we were flying escort...

1385
01:45:51,395 --> 01:45:53,430
and decided not to show up.
(LAUGHS)

1386
01:45:53,663 --> 01:45:55,199
That'd be nice.

1387
01:45:55,264 --> 01:45:57,470
Wouldn't mind that, would you, baby?

1388
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:08,280
Colonel! it's from Mission Control.

1389
01:46:08,744 --> 01:46:12,589
The 52nd didn't make the rendezvous.
They didn't join up with the 5th.

1390
01:46:13,682 --> 01:46:15,221
Did our boys turn back?

1391
01:46:15,384 --> 01:46:17,297
No, sir. They're headed on to Berlin.

1392
01:46:17,889 --> 01:46:20,300
I gave Captain Julian the option.

1393
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:24,296
Headquarters wants to know
if we're gonna call them back.

1406
01:47:31,595 --> 01:47:32,767
I see them.

I'm on it, Red One.
We'll get down there and cover him.
