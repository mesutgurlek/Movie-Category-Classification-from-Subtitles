00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,955
Whoa! Easy, boy.

2
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,962
Whoa, there. Whoa.

3
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,867
Ah.

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,869
Souvenir.
Of what?

5
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,874
Oh, the great Southwest,
the dangerous
Indian territory.

6
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,809
[Chuckles]
Hey, Sarge, ya know,

7
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,712
this is gonna make
somethin" nice to hang
on the wall when I retire,

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,216
somethin" I can tell
my grandkids lies about.

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,219
That arrow"s
at least a year old.
Rick up a fresh one.

10
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,620
Listen, Sarge, I think
the arrow"s extinct.

11
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,092
<i>Couple of weeks,</i>
<i>you'll be pullin' 'em</i>
<i>out of your back.</i>

12
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,426
I heard that in St. Louis
a thousand miles ago.

13
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,992
By now, I thought we"d be
hackin" our way through
a solid wall of Indian fesh.

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,403
Wait until you run into Satanta,
chief of the Kiowas.
You"ll know you met an Indian.

15
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,501
Oh, he"s a tough one, huh?
<i>Got his whole tepee covered</i>
<i>with buck sergeants'chevrons.</i>

16
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:31,244
The only fella gonna
get those stripes is the fella
I give "em to after I got yours.

17
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,413
<i>[Sergeant Chuckles]</i>
All right, let"s get
movin" back there!

18

Comanches?

19
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:16,420
Comanches would have
taken a prisoner.
That"s a Kiowa specialty.

20
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,432
Ricket the horses while
I try to find a shovel.

21
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,526
Great place for souvenirs.

22
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,254
Detail reporting
to Colonel Meade.

23
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,889
Open the gate!

Major Howell Brady,
Sergeants Luke Schermerhorn
and Agustus Wilks...

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,690
reporting
from St. Louis, sir.

30
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,750
How do you do?
Captain Neil,
Lieutenant Rolier.

31
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,762
Still a sergeant,
eh, Schermerhorn?

32
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,766
I guess soldiers
are like water.
They find their own level.

33
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,270
Rour the sergeants
a bath and a drink:
the drink first.

34
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,271
Come along, Major.

35
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,446
You"re to be quartered here
for six months under
nobody"s orders but your own.

36
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,447
Those are
Gen. Schofield"s words.

37
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,450
I don"t like it, even
from the secretary of war.

38
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,646
That"s natural.
This is good whiskey.

39
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,248
Washington doesn"t have
to send anybody around,
investigating my command.

40
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
As far as I know,
they haven"t.

41
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,263
Then what is it?
Major Howell Brady
taking over this fort?

42
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,265
l"ve already
turned down three.

43
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,769
l"ve been in this army
too many years to be fooled.

44
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,772
Things haven"t gone well here,
and they"ve retired
generals for less.

45
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,037
I haven"t heard talk
of retiring you.
Your record shows...

46
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,809
I know. But you"re as good
as your last casualty list.

47
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,851
All right,
l"ll play the game.
Game?

48
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,911
By elimination, you must
be here to fight Indians.
Yeah. That"s about it.

49
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,426
One major and two sergeants
is not what l"d call
a fighting outfit.

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,429
<i>Well, it's a start.</i>
What can you do
that I haven"t done?

51
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,661
The Kiowas are having
a field day, but why?
<i>Nobody's stopping them.</i>

52
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,670
They don"t come out
by the hundreds
and thousands anymore.

53
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,174
They raid by 10s and 20s.
They hit and they"re gone.

54
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,177
I know. I saw
some of their work
a few miles back.

55
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,406
Family named McMurdo.

56
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,884
At least they"re buried
under a cross.
Crude, but a cross.

57
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,887
How can I stop this
with only one command?

58
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,890
You might break it up
into companies
or platoons,

59
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,926
send "em riding
in all directions.

60
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,928
That"s what the Kiowas want.
They"d cut us to ribbons.

61
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,933
The only hope for law
is to keep this command intact.
When it"s gone, the Kiowas rule.

62
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,094
They seem
to be ruling now.

63
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,233
If you"re here
to fight Indians, Major,
there"s a lot of work waiting.

64
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,106
I hear you have Seminoles
in this territory.

65
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,242
Yeah, a small tribe up by Golden.
At least they"re peaceful.

66
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,287
You know their chief,
Maygro?

67
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,290
<i>Not personally,</i>
<i>but I fought against</i>
<i>his father in Florida.</i>

68
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,725
- What"s your opinion of them?
- For eight years in Florida,

69
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,926
they held back almost every
regiment of the army, marines,
the navy and 50,000 militia.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,434
All that
with just 400 warriors.

71
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,495
<i>Incredible, wasn't it?</i>
Heh. Expensive too.

72
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:51,100
The government had to scatter
them all over the country so
there wouldn"t be another war.

73
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,806
Now they"re a poor
tribe of vagabonds
living in sod huts...

74
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,076
and trying to raise
a few scrawny sheep.

75
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,118
But they
can still fight.

76
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,119
Fight who?
Kiowas.

77
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,123
You couldn"t get
a Seminole Indian to fight
for his sister"s virtue.

78
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,716
Why not?
They"ve laid down
their guns for good.

79
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,729
The Kiowas run
through their village
Just for sport.

80
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,732
Could you get me
three fresh horses
and $500?

81
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,327
Anything, Major.
l"ll have you quartered
within the hour.

82
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,837
Well, don"t bother
with anything elaborate.

83
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:24,639
l"ll move Mrs. Corwin
out of Capt. Corwin"s house.
He was killed recently.

84
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,644
Rlease don"t inconvenience
anyone for me.

85
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,647
<i>There's room for the woman</i>
<i>at my place.</i>
You"re the C.O.

86
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,684
By the way,
there"s a birthday party
at my house tonight.

87
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,552
That hardly gives me time
to buy a present.

88
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,352
Don"t bother.
You"ve already given me one:

89
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,359
the funniest story
of the year.

90
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,988
Seminoles fighting Kiowas.
[Laughing]

91
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,714
Happy birthday, Colonel.
Thank you, Major.

92
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,979
Excuse me.
Certainly.

93
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:11,012
<i>So I told him he had to be</i>
<i>in full uniform at all times.</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>

94
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,059
The colonel"s special blend.

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,104
Major Howell Brady,
ma"am.

96
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,107
I came to dance,
if you"d do me
the honor.

97
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,109
We were holding
a conversation, Major.

98
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,510
You should try
holding a girl
sometime, Captain.

99
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:41,709
I have a feeling that patience
is not one of your
stronger virtues, Major.

100
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,756
[Chuckles]
Consider the life span
of the average human,

101
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,227
then subtract
all the minutes we waste
in meaningless formalities.

102
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,391
Criminal.
There"s little enough time
for small pleasures as it is.

103
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,900
As I live and breathe,
a philosopher.

104
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,903
[Chuckles]
A... a realist.

105
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:03,271
Well, whatever you are,
l"m glad someone
finally asked me to dance.

106
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,938
Is there something
about you I should know?
l"m Mrs. Corwin.

107
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,716
l"m, uh, sorry about having
taken over your house.

108
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,719
The fortunes of war, Major.

109
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,723
Besides, any man
who"s held every rank
from private to major,

110
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,727
won a field commission,
been breveted twice
for exceptional gallantry...

111
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,729
and won the Congressional
Medal of Honor,

112
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:29,734
there just isn"t enough
that we can do for him.
Who told you all that?

113
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,635
Col. Meade, and not
without a little envy.

114
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,835
Oh, ah, l"m taking
a room in his house.
Yes, so I heard.

115
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,936
And he who gossips
will be out chasing Kiowas
in the morning.

116
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,413
[Chuckles]
They should be anyway.

117
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,416
Don"t you go, Major.

118
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,816
We"ve lost too many
good dancers already.

121
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,626
When did it happen?

122
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,937
About six months ago
on a scouting party.

123
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,477
He must"ve been
quite a man...

124
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,879
<i>for his memory to have</i>
<i>kept you single</i>
<i>on the frontier this long.</i>

125

They"ve been proposing to me
by platoons lately.

126
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,213
Bad training.

127
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,451
There are times when
the individual soldier...

128
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,652
is much more effective
than the unit.

129
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,185
You"re an exponent of
the one-man frontal attack.

130
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,164
Yes, but I believe
in cautious
reconnoitering first.

131
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,896
Better be careful, Major.
You"re revealing
your position to the enemy.

132
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,404
Enjoy your waltz, Major?
Were we waltzing?

133
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,498
It was more like
a musical fencing match.

134
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,839
I couldn"t get
past her guard.
Nobody ever does.

135
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,572
She"s a greater threat
to this post than the Kiowas.

136
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,811
- Something oughta be done.
- You"ll have to go
to the end of the line.

137
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,820
Not him.
He doesn"t waste his time
on meaningless formalities.

138
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,153
Major Brady, perhaps you"d
tell our younger officers...

139
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,159
of your experiences
fighting the Cheyenne.

140
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,526
They look
about as friendly
as the Cheyenne.

141
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,565
A later dance,
Mrs. Corwin?

142

The Captain"s Quadrille.
Write "Elaine" on your card.
Thank you.

above firting.

144
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,741
Was I?

145
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,403
I hear he came
from St. Louis
and Washington.

146
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,412
He"s still
Just another soldier.

147
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,471
Well, tell me,
what"s he doing here?

148
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,609
Trying to get Seminoles
to fight Kiowas.

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,053
Why, Colonel,
you"re jealous of him.

150
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,097
[Whooping, Shouting]

151
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,444
[Whooping,
Shouting Continue]

152
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,022
[Whooping,
Shouting Continue]

153
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:22,030
Hey.
I always knew you were
a brave man, Major,

154
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,134
but goin" in through
the colonel"s back door
ain"t recommended,

155
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,803
even for heroes.

156
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,787
That"s
Capt. Corwin"s widow.
Oh. l"m sorry.

157
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,019
I always figured
that Corwin was
too ornery to die.

158
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,526
Them Kiowas ain"t choosy
about who they kill.

159
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,529
You knew him?
Yeah, I knew him.

160
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,193
It"d take more
than a few Indians
to keep me away from that.

161
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,549
We"re ridin" in a noose.
I know.
Care to pick a number?

162
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,557
At least five,
or they"d be afraid.

163
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,355
Not 10,
or they"d have cut loose.

164
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,419
Seven.
Lucky seven.

165
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,989
We"ll have
to fight our way out.
Yeah.

166
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,594
Rrobably try to catch us
at that other rise.

167
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,574
Tell Wilks to keep
his eyes front.
He don"t
even know they"re up there.

168
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,202
<i>He's got barroom eyes.</i>

169
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,611
When we reach that rim,
we"ll go into a run.

170
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,616
Come over it shooting.

171
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,051
l"ll take the left.
You and Wilks
take the right.

172
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:22,093
[Laughing] How about
them fellas tellin" us
it was dangerous...

173
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,927
for just the three of us
to ride in this country?

174
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,434
They call this Coffin Rim.
It"s not famous for the births
that have happened here.

175
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:35,462
l"ll bet you a dollar
there ain"t an Indian
within 10 miles.

176
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,476
You got a bet.
How"re we gonna prove it?

177
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,481
Easy. Four Kiowas have
got you in their sights now.
Don"t look up!

178
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,178
Are you serious?
When we hit that ridge,
you do as I do...

179
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,950
if you want to live long enough
for another promotion.
Yes, sir.

180
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,449
Uh, you fellas
is lucky I was along.

181
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,122
You"re right. I just
made an easy dollar.

182
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,256
Wilks and I will do
some cleaning up.

183
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,268
You contact the Seminoles
and tell them what I said.

184
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,270
l"ll do what I can.
All right.

185
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,102
Schermerhorn,
I hate to bring this up,

186
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:47,111
but don"t you think
I oughta hold the dollar?
Just in case.

187
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,116
Uh-uh. If anything happens,
l"m gonna need some
gambling money where l"m going.

188
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,822
Well, that Schermerhorn.

189
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,301
That feller could charm
the Rocky Mountains into
goin" south for the winter.

190
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,242
Rsst!

191
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,393
My father, Chief Maygro,
said to give you
some food while he talks.

192
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,726
Rabbit, eh?
We call it Texas buffalo.

193
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,856
Say, you talk English
real good.

194
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,369
Why shouldn"t I?
I went to school
in San Antonio.

195
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,370
<i>[Wilks]</i>
<i>What's your name, honey?</i>

196
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,841
Avis. It means bird.
And do not speak
of putting salt on my tail.

197
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,709
[Laughing]
Some fella already
beat me to it, huh?

198
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,749
Uh, my name is Wilks.
Sergeant Wilks.

199
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,751
And this fella here...
I forget his name.

200
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,878
Anyway, he"s married
and got 16 kids.

201
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,219
You make him
sound interesting.
[Clears Throat]

202
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,623
Uh, you like
this life out here?
I hate it.

203
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,755
Would you like to spend
your life in a mud hut
with corn husks for beds...

204
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,765
and rabbit
for food every day?

205
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,768
Well, uh, I might
if you was with me.

206
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,771
I won"t be.
l"m going someplace.
Any particular place?

207
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,774
Anywhere. It couldn"t
be worse than this.

208
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,436
Maybe you and I could
work something out.

209
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,446
What I want,
you don"t have.

210
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,448
<i>[Luke Laughing]</i>
<i>Oh, try me.</i>

211
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,384
Good food and clothes
and a decent place to live?

212
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,648
Well, that sure
lets out enlisted men.

213
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,486
What"s your father
think about all this?

214
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,358
My father will not
let me leave.
<i>He won't? How come?</i>

215
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,126
He says there"s only one way
to get the things I want.

216
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,066
He could be right.
<i>I don't care.</i>

217
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,764
I know what I want.
l"m going to get it.
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

218
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,933
There"s a lot to be said
for bein" a nice girl.

219
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,445
Weren"t you just suggesting
we could work something out?

220
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,972
I didn"t mean...
Who are you to tell me
what is nice and what isn"t?

221
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,578
When I get the chance,
I will leave and
I will do what I want.

222
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,256
<i>Then you want us</i>
<i>to help you fight the Kiowa?</i>

223
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,263
That"s right, Maygro.
You Seminoles.

224
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,697
We are Kanyuksa Indians
from Florida.

225
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,362
Among our people,
"Seminole" is not a good word.

226
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,371
All right, Kanyuksa.

227
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,373
We number 300,

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,410
maybe 25 men
who could fight.

229
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,446
That"s more than enough.

230
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,143
I try to understand...
We have to fight the Kiowas
on their own terms.

231
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,652
A small, fast-moving,
hard-hitting force,

232
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,655
one that knows the country,
understands the language,

233
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,920
has endurance and doesn"t
ask any luxuries.

234
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,325
Why should we do this
for you?

235
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,832
For six months" service,
the government will give you
land of your own.

236
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
Like this?
No, this will be
green land...

237
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,838
with water and cattle,
trees to build houses with.

238
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,897
Where is this land?

239
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,466
The whole
Santa Media Valley.

240
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,275
But to get it,
we must fight.
Yeah.

241
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,646
That is one thing
we cannot do.

242
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,517
Aw! We make foolish journey
to come here.

243
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,647
Why don"t you
ask your people?

244
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,954
I am the law
of the Kanyuksas.

245
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,960
I say no.

246
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,962
You afraid, Maygro?

247
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,826
Come.
We speak with others.

248
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,340
Tell us, how will
our families eat
when men are gone?

249
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,841
The army will send
supplies every month.

250
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,938
Meantime,
$500 until the first
supply train comes.

251
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,074
We have put down
our guns for good.

252
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,983
Fighting will only lose us
the peace we find.

253
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,987
Reace?
You mean hunger!

254
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,853
Let me die fighting,
not from peaceful
starvation!

255
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:57,123
Rino, you"re too young
to remember what war did
to the Kanyuksa.

256
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,187
When you have to fight,
you fight!

257
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,425
Even a snake
or gopher knows that.

258
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,434
Are we to sit around...

259
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,096
and watch the Kiowas
run through our camp
for sport?

260
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,608
<i>The young men have the heart,</i>
<i>but we have no weapons!</i>

261
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,110
If I had a gun,
I would show them...

262
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,615
that the Kanyuksa have at least
as much courage as gopher!
Rino, sit down!

263
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,174
When elders speak,
you listen. Sit down!

264
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,325
I am your leader.

265
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,623
When we were
driven from Florida,

266
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
we pledged to keep peace.

267
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,632
We knew it would be hard.

268
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,033
You want new leader,
say so.

269
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,934
Then as long as I am
Maygro, your leader,

270
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,603
I do what I think best.

271
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,942
You"re less than women!

272
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:53,781
l"m ashamed that
I talked to you as equals,
as men of courage!

273
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,913
Major!

274
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,926
<i>[Shouting, Whooping]</i>

<i>Kiowas!</i>

276
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,012
Well, at least you got
six more horses.

277
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,113
I never saw gun
shoot like that.

278
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,125
Fifteen times without reloading.
It"s a Henry repeating rife.

279
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,629
This is the weapon you"ll have.
Makes one man equal to 30.

280
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,631
You teach
strong lesson.

281
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,692
I always said whoever called
the Kanyuksas "Seminoles"
was right.

282
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,137
That"s all they ever were:
Seminoles, cowards,
and renegades.

283
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,731
Avis, this is no time
for such talk.

284
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,936
You might yet turn out
to be men.

285
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:58,005
- No one will give you anything
unless you fight for it.
- Quiet. We will go with Major.

286
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,916
I know,
and I am going with you.

287
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,514
You will stay in village
where you belong
with the rest of the women.

288
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,753
Try and keep me there.

289
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,478
Hey, Schermerhorn,
you captured
the wrong Indians.

290
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,390
Them ain"t fighters:
they"re sheep eaters.

291
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,760
l"m beginnin" to feel a little foolish.
You got the face
to go with it.

292
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,765
I guess you"re right.

293
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,065
Colonel, this is Maygro...
Who said these Seminoles
were to be quartered?

294
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,576
The orders,
some of the fine print.

295
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,511
You don"t pull
sleeping quarters
out of the air.

296
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,517
Give "em a gun and a horse
and they"ll be gone
by tomorrow morning.

297
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,520
The Kanyuksas will...
l"m talking
to the major!

298
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,522
Go on, Maygro.

299
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,856
The Kanyuksas will not go.
They will fight well
for land and food promised.

300
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,862
What land?
What food?
The Santa Media Valley,

301
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,865
and a wagon train to
their families every month.

302
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,867
I need all the supplies
I have!

303
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,371
The supplies will
be ready at the nearest
army railhead monthly.

304
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,498
You just furnish
the transportation.

305
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,610
Where are you going?

306
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,346
To Major Brady"s house
to stay with my father.

307
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,355
<i>That would not be good.</i>

308
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,824
They put me in a tent
worse than the hut
I came from.

309
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,124
If you would marry me,
I would build a house for us.

310
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,630
What will you build?
Ajackal hut?

311
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:58,192
Made of handsome sod
and magnificent mud?
No, Rino. Never.

312
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,570
A house is good because of
how you live in it,
not how it is made.

313
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,575
That is not for me!

314
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,342
<i>Hello.</i>

315
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,211
l"m Mrs. Corwin.
Elaine Corwin.

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,376
My name is Avis.

317
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,286
Your dress
is very pretty.

318
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,522
Thank you.
Coming from another woman,
that"s the highest compliment.

319
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,564
Did it cost much?

320
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,965
No. I made it myself.
You can"t buy ready-made
dresses out here.

321
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,632
Someday l"ll have
a dress prettier than that.

322
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,869
l"ll show you how to make one
with my patterns.

323
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,573
If I had the cloth,
I could sew it myself.
<i>I might have some cloth too.</i>

324
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,741
Thank you,
but l"ll get my own.

325
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,760
<i>Afternoon, Mrs. Corwin.</i>

326
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,661
Hello, Major.

327
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:04,327
You"re about to have a new
resident in your house.
Oh, homesick already?

328
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:09,704
As far as l"m concerned,
one house is the same
as another on an army post.

329
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,436
l"m disappointed.

330
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,911
l"m fattered
by your disappointment.

331
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,346
And l"m properly
put in my place.

332
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,145
About my new resident...
It"s Avis.

333
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,152
I understand
she"s moving in.

334
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,348
I guess she wants
to be near her father.
Uh-uh.

335
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,051
She"s dying to have
a dress like mine,

336
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,653
probably so her father
will realize
how pretty she is.

337
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,721
Or Rino.
Or you.

338
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,864
She has a kind
of untamed charm.

339
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,773
They say that a wild plant
never lives very long indoors.

340
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,801
<i>I'm gonna be too busy</i>
<i>to conduct social experiments.</i>

341
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,373
Speaking of experiments,
the talk is that you"ll
never train the Seminoles.

342
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,544
The only thing that talk
ever trained is a parrot.

343
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,681
By the way, they don"t like
to be called Seminoles.
Oh?

344
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,660
Suppose we discuss it later?
Be all right?

345
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,753
Very well.

346
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,820
Well, your men are ready.
I gave "em each a horse
and a Henry repeater.

347
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,493
These guns will speak
their own answer
to the colonel.

348
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,004
Just load "em up on Sunday,
and they"ll shoot all week.

349
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,973
For you.

350
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,870
Well, you can"t see
through the paper,
you know.

351
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,050
Oh.
There"s enough
material for a dress,

352
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,059
pattern, needles, thread.

353
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:14,292
If you need any more help,
I can"t give it to you.
Thank you.

354
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,301
Hope it"ll give you
something to do.

355
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,735
She told you,
didn"t she?
Yeah.

356
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,433
l"ll be a better woman
than she is.

357
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:27,069
What do you do
with your old losers, Major?

358
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,983
All right, now, keep
your elbow on your knee.

359
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,983
The stock dug
into your shoulder.

360
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,990
That"s it.
Just like that.

361
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,221
Rick your targets
carefully,

362
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,455
every shot.

363
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,464
All right, Luke.

364
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,693
Take a steady grip
and squeeze.

365
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,829
Don"t pull the trigger,
or you"ll jerk the barrel
off the target.

366
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:59,241
Keep this little ball
Just underneath what you"re
aimin" at, like this.

367
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,743
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

368
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,754
All right, one at a time.
Maygro, you lead off.

369
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,382
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

370
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,361
Ha!
[Chuckling]

371
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,488
All right, Rino.

372
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,663
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

373
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,263
<i>[Brady Chuckling]</i>

374
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,882
l"m not sure
this is such a good idea.

375
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,391
What?
Leaving the fort after dark.

376
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,393
Could get mighty dangerous
out here.

377
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,952
Everything"s dangerous
in this country.

378
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,089
I know.

379
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:58,625
I mean, danger doesn"t stop
at the walls of the fort.

380
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,898
I know that too.

381
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,839
Why, even in your own home.

382
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,844
Once I walked
into my living room,
and there was a rattler.

383
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,142
Gave me quite a start.

384
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,115
Once I walked into a room...

385
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:16,517
and there was one of the most
beautiful women l"ve ever seen.

386
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,783
<i>Gave me quite a start.</i>

387
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:26,091
Anyway, if I didn"t get
outside once in a while,
l"d go crazy.

388
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,156
Sometimes the fort seems
Just like a prison.

389
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,296
Why do you stay on?

390
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:38,206
Oh, it isn"t easy for
a woman to pull up roots
and start traveling.

391
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,212
Colonel Meade
wouldn"t have anything
to do with it, would he?

392
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,214
Why do you ask that?

393
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,844
Because he"s entirely
too paternal for a man
who isn"t the fatherly type.

394
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,854
l"m very fond
ofjack as a friend.

395
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,447
Nothing more,
and he knows it.

396
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,722
A smart officer prepares
for a long campaign.

397
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,993
He"d have the same luck
with me that he"s having
with the Kiowas.

398
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,693
That seems to be true
for everybody.

399
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,226
Something tells me
that you"ll do
a little better.

400
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,205
With you?

401
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,435
I was thinking
about the Kiowas.

402
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,670
Oh.

403
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,679
I don"t know.

404
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,012
Their raids aren"t haphazard.
There"s a plan behind them.

405
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,575
l"m sorry
I even mentioned it.

406
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,918
All right, pick a subject.

407
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:30,086
Something far away,
something like
Washington or St. Louis.

408
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,097
Oh, the buildings
hem you in and the noise
wears you down.

409
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,099
l"ve had
a warehouseful of quiet.

410
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,102
Tell me about the parties
and the dresses...

411
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,468
and the crystal
and the silver.

412
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,633
And the colds and bad food
and the empty conversation?

413
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh, sounds wonderful.

414
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,976
To be sitting with a cold
in a noisy restaurant
in Washington...

415
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,212
listening
to bad conversation,

416
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,254
l"d give all the love
that"s in me.

417
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,223
Now or when you get there?

418
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,818
l... I don"t know what
made me say that.

419
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,221
Don"t you?

420
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,407
Do your plans really
include a return
to the East?

421
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,914
I don"t know, except...
Well, then why don"t
we talk about it...

422
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,542
when you really know
where you"re going?

423
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,471
All right, Wilks,
take over.
Yes, sir.

424
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,440
Now, you all know
how to sit on a horse.

Man should not
fight in hole.
He should stand erect.

00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,382
And get his head shot off?

432
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,653
In case of a sudden attack,
this is what we"ll use

frontiersmen and rustlers.

No. I never
gave you any cloth
as beautiful as that.

592
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,266
I was going to wait here
until you came out,
so you would see it.

Did you wear it
especially
for the celebration?

I did not make this dress
for an Indian celebration.
l"m not a savage.

Did I do
as I said I would?
Hmm?

You won"t see

to wish you luck.

Twenty a month. That"s

I don"t believe in torture.
He would have
killed himself anyway.

supplies to my people?
That door"s to knock on!

Before I cut you
in two, tell me!

You enlisted in this army
as a scout. l"m a colonel!

Did you send
the supplies?
No.

683
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:44,885
We kept our word!
Why you not keep your word?
I gave you no word!

684
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,391
But I did,
through an authority
higher than yours.

685
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,982

Dirt?

686

haven"t arrived
from the Army depot.

687

you know. Until then, get
out of my office, Maygro!

688

You can"t
treat him like that.

Of what?
A worthless band
of vagabonds?

nothing else, Major...
There"s a lot else, Colonel!

Capt. Corwin is alive
and directing
the Indian raids.

Who told you that?
A Kiowa.

693
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,752
Huh.
Just before he died.

694
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,123
All right, he lied.
But let"s assume
it"s true.

695
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,628
Then someday
we"ll find him.
Maybe he"ll find you first.

696

He plans to destroy
this fort.

702

I never cared much
for debates, Major,

with junior officers.

704

You must get them back.
What for? To save your
precious Capt. Corwin?

709
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:11,263
There are other things
to consider: the women
and children in this fort.

710
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,434
l"ve never seen
my father so angry.

711
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,944

I told my father
I would not go.

712
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:20,506
I told him we were
gonna be married.
Married?

713
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:25,520
I had to tell him something.
That"s just another promise
he"ll think l"ve broken.

714

l"ll tell him
the truth someday.
Thanks.

715
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,923
I stayed
because I want you
to go after them.

716
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,825
You need them,
but they need you more.

717
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,693
They"ve known
hunger before,

718
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,824
but this time
their hunger
will have a purpose.

719
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,496
Bring them back, Brady.

720
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,471
I wasn"t sure I liked you
the first time I saw you.

721
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,974
Now?

722
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,476
I can stand you.

723
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,844
Not enough to have you
give me away in marriage.

724
00:55:56,419 --> 00:56:01,823
Won"t help to catch up
with Maygro unless we"ve got
more than words to offer him.

725
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,485
Supplies from the
quartermaster warehouse?
Yeah.

726

of everything you can find.
Findin"s gonna be easy.

727

Gettin" it out will be the job.
You can turn it down
if you want.

728
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,565
Well, l"ve had a pretty good
career in the army.

729

Not as good as yours, Luke,
but it wasn"t bad.

l"ll let you
wear my stripes
while we do it.

I always knowed
l"d get to wear
them stripes someday.

732
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,682
Use the back gate.
Be sure to watch out
for the O.D.

733
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,437
How much time
we got left, Luke?

will be making his rounds.

735
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,146
Maybe he"ll
be late tonight.
Capt. Neil is never late.

736
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,485
Capt. Neil!

737
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:11,493
We"ll never drink all that!
Two of"em
is for the horses.

738
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:15,657
He"ll be here any second!
I never drink
without a chaser.

739
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,565
Oh-oh.

740
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,707
Firin" squad,
here we come.

741
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,369
Start thinkin"
what you"re gonna say
at the court-martial.

742
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,615
Anybody in there?
No, sir.

743
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,513
We go on.

744
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:16,252
Just a few more
minutes, Maygro.
We wait too long now.

745
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,359
<i>[Wagon Approaches]</i>

746
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,680
Good work!
Did you have
any trouble?

747
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:49,748
Trouble? Ha! Aw, no,
we didn"t have no trouble,
Major. We was just...

748
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:03,331
By the orders of Col. Meade,
you"re under arrest.

749
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,967
Any move to resist
would save a tiresome
court-martial.

750
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,979
Don"t get drunk with power.
I still outrank you.
Temporarily.

751
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,982
What"s the charge?
What do you think?

752
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,985
Somebody made the mistake
of dropping his pay book.

753
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,454
The major didn"t have
nothin" to do with that.

754
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,990
This room is off-limits
to prisoners.

755
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,464
So we took
a few supplies.

756
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:35,334
You can do anything
you want with your men
and supplies, but not mine.

757
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,067
The secretary of war
can"t protect you now.

758
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,075
The supplies
will be replaced.

759
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,909
In the meantime,
they must be officially
listed as stolen.

760
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,676
Meade,
this isn"t West Roint:
it"s Indian country.

761
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,683
No regulations
ever stopped an Indian.

762
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,844
My first duty
is to this command.

763
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,889
What good were they
doing sitting here?
That"s my concern.

764
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,688
The concern
of every dead settler
from here to Arkansas.

765
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,754
You"ve been waitin" for me
to make a mistake like this.
<i>You're the type.</i>

766
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:06,529
Capt. Neil is waiting.
You"ll be under guard
in your quarters.

767
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,572
You plan to run
the Seminoles by yourself?
Yes.

768
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,698
l"m gonna run"em
out of this fort.

769
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,743
Even you can"t carry
petty jealousy that far.

770
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,746
Until the army replaces me,
l"m still commanding!

771
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,374
And using your rank
to make a personal war!

772
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,248
Out here
the U.S. Army is the law!

773
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:28,518
<i>I'm not gonna see it handed</i>
<i>over to a band of rabble!</i>
Even if they do the job better?

774
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,991
Even if they can
do the job better.

775
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,813
With them leaving
and Brady under guard,

776
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,509
that"s the last
of Brady"s bunch.

777
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,807
Good evening,
Mrs. Corwin.

778
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,217
Good evening.

779
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,094
We have only
a few moments before
we are discovered.

780
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,689
We need horses and guns.
They are going
out the back gate now.

781
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,997
How"d you get in?
Mrs. Corwin.

782
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,230
Let"s go.
You two stay here.

783
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,330
You can"t get rid of us.
We know too much.

784
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:29,071
l-It"d be desertion.
If we accomplish something,
they might be good to us, but...

785
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,512
It"s service
above and beyond
the call of duty.

786
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,016
All right, you enlisted.

787
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,454
You shouldn"t be here.
Get going!

788
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,456
l"m not leaving!
Don"t be crazy!

789
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,958
l"m staying here to prove
that you"ll all come back.

790
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:47,962
You don"t know what
they might do to you.
She made up her mind.

791
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,693
It"s the only thing
I can do to help.
All right.

792
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:13,322
There"s no doubt the Kiowas
are gathering to get ready
for the attack on the fort.

793
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,485
How many you think?
About every brave
who can ride a horse.

794
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,494
You can"t hide
that many Indians.

795
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:23,498
You can decoy your opposition
by sending out small parties
to strike at everything.

796
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:28,367
That"ll keep the colonel
running in every direction.
Would Corwin know to do this?

797
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,405
He"s a professional soldier,
isn"t he?

798
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:35,035
Then when Meade"s patrols
are out, he"ll hit the fort
with a big attack.

799
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,080
You told Meade
about this?
Yeah, I told him.

800
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,081
What is our job?

801
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:44,483
We"ll break up into
scouting parties to see
if Corwin uses this plan.

802
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,489
Let the raiding parties
go out, then trail "em
to the main force.

803
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,991
That way we"ll know
where it is.

804
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:54,519
Remember, if any of us
are seen or heard,
the fat"s in the fire.

805
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,588
Let"s go.

806
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:21,686
Who"s gonna play
hide-and-go-seek this time?
l"ll take this bunch.

807
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,024
All here.
We move fast,
Satanta.

808
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,527
Make sure horse
do not stumble.
Kiowas ride over you.

809
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,530
That"s the spirit.
When the attack starts,

810
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,533
we keep going until
everyone inside the fort
is killed.

811
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,537
My tribe take big chance.
It"s no chance:
it"s a certainty.

812
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,630
You make mistake,
you make no more.

813
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,302
Stop worrying. just start
counting the loot.

814
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,777
Well, I saw it.
How"d it look?

815
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,781
Biggest war party
in local history headin"
in this direction.

816
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,114
Them Kiowas sure
been breedin" fast.
Was Corwin with them?

817
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,053
It"s Corwin.
I got a glimpse
of Satanta too.

818
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:36,387
That fella with all
them sergeants" stripes
on his tepee?

819
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,986
Better warn Meade.
Listen, Meade would rather
have you in irons...

820
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:43,589
than beat the Kiowas.
He"ll have his chance
to do both. Mount up.

821
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,481
<i>Back to give yourself up?</i>
Where are all the men?

822
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,710
Out on patrol.

823
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,816
How soon will
those patrols return?
They just went out.

824
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,330
What difference does it make?
Drop your sidearms
on the foor.

825
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:19,425
How many men are here?
He said drop your sidearm.
You"re under arrest.

826
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,665
Twenty? Forty?
Fifty?
Twenty.

827
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:26,003
Think you can put my whole
detachment under arrest?
Just you.

828
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,669
You"ll need even me.
In a half hour,
every Kiowa...

829
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,838
in this territory"s gonna
be climbing these walls.
I don"t believe that.

830
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:35,213
You oughta have
more faith, Colonel.
Rut it on the table.

831
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:39,220
You"re adding one charge
after another! l"ll see you
in front of a firing squad!

832
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,688
You won"t live
to see anything
if we don"t get moving.

833
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,691
Rile up
all your ammunition.

834
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,750

on the north wall.

- By that time, the Kiowas
will be finishing your meal!

837
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,172
You lost your rank
when you deserted!
That"s
for a court-martial to decide!

838
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,639

What good"s a fort with a hill
lookin" down its throat?

Kiowa in this territory
are dropping in on us.

Once those Kiowas get inside,
nothing will stop them.
Where"s Avis?

01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,256
She"s in
