00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,087
- You're no good to me. Let me
know if there's any change.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,290
How many airplanes
have we got left?

153
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,852
With the three new ones and
working the crews all night,
Nero thinks we can have 18.

154
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,092
- How many are the other
groups putting up?
- Twenty-one a piece, sir.

155
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,657
We'd better camp
on Nero's tail.

156
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,763
No, if he says 18, he's giving us
everything with wings on it.

157
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,774
What did the other
groups lose today?

158
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,606
Two in the 916th,
zero in the others.

159
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:05,014
Our stinking luck. Those flak
gunners had the range good
by the time we made our run.

160
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,851
- What about crews, Doc?
- I could give you a couple
of different answers, sir.

161
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,913
I'd better get started
on routes and timings.

162
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,949
- No coffee, Ben?
- Oh, not now, thanks.

163
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,589
That's getting to be your diet,
isn't it? That and cigarettes?

164
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,724
How long since you've
had your clothes off?

165
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,791
Never mind my pants,
what about crews?

166
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,828
You're crew, when it comes to my
certifying you for a mission.

167
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,001
There's the crew availability.

168
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,944
Colonel, about the route and timing
of tomorrow's mission?

169
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,914
Start on the routes. But I wouldn't
figure on that 9,000-foot altitude...

170
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,976
- until Colonel Davenport
checks with Pinetree.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,988
Thanks for worrying
about me, Doc, only don't.

172
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,991
What about the rest of them?

173
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,186
That brings us
to the two answers.

174
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,391
On that list are 28 men
asking to be excused
from tomorrow's mission,

175
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,695
three times more
than normal.

176
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:59,066
They give a lot of reasons,
colds mostly, and most of them
haven't got colds.

177
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,538
And that doesn't mean that
they've suddenly gone yellow.

178
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,371
It just means that they're
getting their bellies full.

179
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,207
Now, do I okay them physically
and mark them "duty"?

180
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,771
How much can a man take?
What's physical and what isn't?

181
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,842
The rules say a man ought
to go right up to the point
where he may endanger his crew.

182
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,445
I wish I knew what that meant.
If I did, I'd tell you.

183
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,755
Well, can you tell me this...
do I okay Bishop for tomorrow?

184
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,694
He had a tough deal.
Jesse's a tough boy.

185
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:29,325
How tough? What happened today
must have done something to him inside.

186
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,234
It had to have
cost him something.

187
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,832
Somebody's got to give me
a policy, some kind of yardstick.

188
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,400
I wish you'd tell me
what a "maximum effort" means.

189
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,107
Doc, I wish I knew.
I wish I could answer that one.

190
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,980
[Phone Rings]

191
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,988
Hello. Yes.
Hello, Pinetree. All right.

192
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:56,586
Frank, Keith Davenport.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard it.

193
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,119
Look, Frank, I didn't call up
to talk about Lord Haw-Haw.

194
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,532
What about that cockeyed field order
that came down that said 9,000?

195
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,196
What? Oh, you're kidding.

196
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,173
Yeah, but the strike photos don't show
what the flak is like in there.

197
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,369
Listen, are you gonna
be there a little while?

198
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,378
All right. I'll be right up.

199
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:20,112
They meant 9,000. Maybe when I get back
I can give you an answer, Doc.

200
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:48,105
No, no mistake.
It's 9,000.

201
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,480
Well, we've got to try it.
We're not getting hits
on those sub-pens.

202
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:59,722
Yeah, I know. Then twist it.
Had the same request all day.
So long, Curt.

203
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,887
The Wailing Wall is just
around the corner, Keith.

204
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:09,930
Oh, I don't know.
I guess this is it. Sit down.

205
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,061
If you're on the level
about this 9,000 foot stuff,

206
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,470
the boys will drop their bombs
here tomorrow instead of St. Nazaire.

207
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,206
- Look, Frank...
- It won't work. It was tough at
19,000 it'll be suicide at nine.

208
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,341
The guy who dreamed this one up
ought to have his brain
in a glass jar at Harvard.

209
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,885
- Anything else?
- You're kidding?

210
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,684
You've been a group commander.
You didn't lead the first
ten missions for nothing.

211
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,487
- Why couldn't you tell them
what it'll be like? You...
- Keith.

212
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,721
I signed the field order.

213
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,787
Why? That's what
I want to know.

214
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,856
All right, I'll
spell it for you.

215
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,300
We haven't been penetrating
the concrete in those sub-pens, Keith.

216
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,170
We can't get concentration
and accuracy from 19,000.

217
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,506
We've got to go in once
down low to see if we can
get the job done in one trip...

218
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,240
instead of fighting our way
to the target five times
and back for nothing.

219
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,249
Nine thousand feet.

220
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,118
Let's allow from here in that
when the old man cuts a field
order, he's thought about it.

221
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:07,147
There isn't time to take every one
of them apart to see what makes it tick.

222
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:11,093
If I were you, when I got one,
I'd just go ahead and fly it.

223
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,064
I was gonna bring these
down to you tomorrow.

224
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,464
I had to steal them
from the RAF.

225
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,526
Hope they're
the kind you wanted.

226
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,594
Yeah.

227
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,967
Yeah, thanks, Frank.

228
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,614
I won't need them at 9,000
though. It'll be plenty hot.

229
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,610
Well, I better get on back
and get the chores done.

230
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,052
Stay put a minute
now you're here.

231
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:41,024
Thought I might run
down tomorrow to see you.
How many you expect to put out?

232
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,288
Eighteen.

233
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,388
- Pretty bad luck today?
- Not good.

234
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,332
We had one break through
the runway at takeoff.

235
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,234
That threw us late.
We never made it up.

236
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,068
It cost us plenty.

237
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,165
I don't know how anybody
outguesses that one.

238
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,145
No.

239
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,444
I'd like to help you locate
where the trouble does lie, if I could.

240
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,144
What about your formation?

241
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,781
I can tell you where the real trouble
is, Frank. And it isn't formation.

242
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,486
- Shoot.
- It isn't down in the groups either.

243
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,552
It's up here, where a bunch of boys
get to be nothing but a set of numbers.

244
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,621
That's what's the trouble.

245
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,896
Do they know up here what my boys have
been taking for three days in a row?

246
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,802
That they'll be up all night
to get 18 in the air for tomorrow?

247
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,208
How much do you think they can take?
You know they're falling
asleep at briefing?

248
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,277
- Are you gonna drive them
till they crack?
- Take it easy, Keith.

249
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,872
Take it easy?
Bomber Command can take it easy.
Those boys are flesh and blood.

250
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,974
They'll die for you, but they've
got to have a chance and they
know they haven't got one.

251
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,214
Frank, they can add. They know
a man's chances run out in 15 missions.

252
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,654
Somebody's gotta give them a limit,
a goal, some hope of living.

253
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,386
What do you think
they're made of?

254
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,863
- Look, Keith.
- [Buzzes]

255
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,766
- Yes, sir?
- I just got the reports from
the groups. Come on up, Frank.

256
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,359
I'll be there in a minute, sir.

257
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,531
Those things are coming, Keith.

258
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,201
Replacements, combat limits.

259
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,939
But right now
the deal is to hang on.

260
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,676
And look, Keith, you've got to find
a way to save yourself a little.

261
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,777
You can't carry
all the load. It's too big.

262
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,847
Don't worry about me.
If you want something to worry
about, worry about the crews.

263
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,258
You and the old man.

264
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,661
You better go on up and see him.

265
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,360
- Give him my love.
- If I do, he'll send you his.

266
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,063
He rates you pretty high.

267
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,596
Not according to Lord Haw-Haw.
Good night, Frank.

268
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,232
Never mind the reasons.
There it is and you can't
make anything else out of it.

269
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,330
Five missing today and they'll
only put up 18 tomorrow.

270
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,740
- It's getting worse instead of better.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,837
I've just been talking to Keith.
He's low enough about it.

272
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,474
What really happened today?
Did he tell you?

273
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,042
No, I didn't dig into it.
He had tomorrow ahead of him.

274
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,453
What do you make of it?

275
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,756
Hard luck, I guess. There's always
some outfit that picks up a jinx.

276
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,262
You don't believe that.

277
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,321
Fill yourself a drink.

278
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,424
Thanks.

279
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,368
It might scare off
that bug of yours.

280
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:47,968
I don't believe in hard luck.
There's always a reason.

281
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,315
What have you got on your mind,
Frank? Spill it.

282
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,321
I'd rather not.

283
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,390
Let's have it
with the bark on.

284
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,859
You won't like it. I don't.
It's the group commander.

285
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,730
Keith?

286
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,139
It's always the group commander.
It's his job, isn't it?

287
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,581
A little funny, coming from you.
He's your friend.

288
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,708
I didn't ask you
to ask me.

289
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:31,245
- I didn't mean it
to sound like that, Frank.
- It's okay.

290
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:36,784
I don't believe it though.
I don't think I do.

291
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,922
On paper, Keith looked to me like
the best group commander we've had.

292
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,026
He's flown every mission. He gets more
loyalty out of his men than anybody.

293
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,937
Courage, he works hard.
I don't know where to fault him.

294
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,976
If a man like that can't
cut it, we're in trouble.

295
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,139
- What happened downstairs
to change the picture for you?
- Nothing.

296
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,380
Added this to it though.

297
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,356
He's gonna bust wide open.
And he's gonna do it to himself too.

298
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,554
Why? Because he's
a first-rate guy.

299
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,066
Because those are his boys and he's
thinking about them instead of missions.

300
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,034
Over-identification
with his men.

301
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,037
I think that's
what they call it.

302
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,767
And you aren't going
to change it either.

303
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,742
I can't buy it, Frank.
Not yet anyway.

304
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,748
Is Keith still here?

305
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,080
No, he had tomorrow
to get ready for.

306
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,950
I'll give you that much,
we'd better find out.

307
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,081
If it's true, we're in trouble.

308
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,491
Why should the other groups hold
together if the 918th can't?

309
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,122
Call my car, will you, Frank,
while I get my pants on.

310
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,257
You mean you want me
to go down there with you?

311
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,962
You bet I do.
It's your idea.

312
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,276
We were three minutes late
on the target and got most of it
here on our bombing run.

313
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,480
That was a deadly
three minutes, Keith.

314
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,177
The idea was to get all the groups
over the target simultaneously...

315
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,482
so that enemy flak couldn't
concentrate on any one group.

316
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,354
We sure were sitting ducks
out there alone. Maybe I
shouldn't have tried the target.

317
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,394
But we were there and
I figured the boys wouldn't want
to bring their loads back home.

318
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:22,161
No man makes a perfect plan.
You couldn't foresee a plane
breaking through the runway.

319
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,725
Maybe the mistake lay in not
going on to the secondary
target once you were late.

320
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,534
But I figured we could make up the time,
catch up with the other groups.

321
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:32,702
- We could have too if it hadn't
been for our stinking luck.
- Luck? What luck was that?

322
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,439
- It wasn't luck, sir. It was my fault.
- It wasn't anybody's fault.

323
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,981
- I'd like to hear
the lieutenant's version.
- Yes, sir.

324
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:43,282
We had to alter
the navigation in flight, sir,
to cross the enemy coast here.

325
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,720
We picked up an error...
wind change.

326
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,817
And I missed a checkpoint
here at St. Lo.

327
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,954
By the time I had caught it,
here at Rennes,

328
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,125
it had cost us three minutes
and we never made it up.

329
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,830
If there's any fault, it's mine.
I was in command. I ordered
the change in flight plan.

330
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,396
- The weather was thick enough.
Could have happened to anyone.
- Well, I think that covers it.

331
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,571
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you, gentlemen.

332
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,015
- Zimmy.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:16,042
It's okay.
Don't worry about a thing.

334
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,429
Keith, I know you're tired,
but let's talk a little.

335
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,659
Sit down.

336
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,335
Let's talk about luck.

337
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,499
A pretty critical
three minutes, Keith.

338
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,875
- Five crews, 50 men.
- Do you think I don't know?

339
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,676
- I know you do.
Whose fault was it, Keith?
- Primarily it was mine.

340
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,683
- Were you flying?
- Yes, sir.

341
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,084
- Do you fly and navigate or
do you rely on your navigator?
- You have to, but...

342
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,056
- It was the lieutenant's fault.
- He missed the check point, but
it could've happened to anyone.

343
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:57,788
I know and I'll allow
he feels as rotten about it
as any of us do, more so maybe.

344
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,387
But what happens now, Keith?

345
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,956
I don't understand you, sir.

346
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:08,269
We're talking about luck.
I don't believe in it.

347
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,570
I believe that to some degree
a man makes his own luck.

348
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,942
Yours has been pretty bad down here
and it's getting worse, not better.

349
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:20,280
Maybe the navigator's in point.
He blew it. What are you going
to do about it?

350
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,481
General, I don't believe in chopping off
heads because of one mistake.

351
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,650
Well, I just don't think
that's any way to run a group.

352
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,426
I feel sorry
for the boy, Keith.

353
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,798
But what are the men in your
group going to be thinking about
the next mission he navigates?

354
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,360
That he messed up
the St. Nazaire mission.

355
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,204
It's just that much more load
on them. And one day, if they
fall apart, that won't be luck.

356
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,971
There isn't a man in the outfit
who wouldn't stake his life on Zimmy.

357
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,448
General, if it was anyone
but him. He's got two strikes
against him to begin with.

358
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,542
You don't realize. That boy's
got a persecution complex.

359
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,814
He wants to fly every mission
trying to live down the fact...

360
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,755
that his parents were mixed up
in the German-American Bund.

361
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,055
They screened Zimmy plenty
before he ever got overseas.
That's what's riding him now.

362
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:08,326
Keith, good navigators
is the one thing we're not short of.

363
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,371
If you decide that you ought
to relieve this boy, I'll
give you a good replacement.

364
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:19,340
You might as well ask me
to stand him up against the wall
and shoot him in the back.

365
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,779
No, I won't do it, sir. I just
can't do it to him. I won't.

366
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,848
Keith, I want you
to get to bed.

367
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:36,758
Have the flight surgeon give you a shot
that will make you sleep 24 hours.

368
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,889
I guess a man only has so much to give
and I guess you've given it.

369
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,168
Effective now, you are
relieved of this command...

370
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,932
and you will report to me
for duty at Bomber Command.

371
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,600
I'll send someone down
to take over here.

372
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,803
- Good night, Keith.
- Good night, sir.

373
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,250
Major, the 918th will stand down
until a new commanding officer arrives.

374
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,759
Yes, sir.

375
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,256
[Door Shuts]

376
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,600
- Want me to take it, sir?
- No.

377
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,042
I want to talk, Frank.

378
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,653
There's a hole in the dike, Frank.
I'm scared stiff.

379
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,562
Maybe you know how deep
all this goes, and maybe you don't.

380
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,603
I've got to spill it anyhow.

381
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,765
We're fighting
all over the world.

382
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,608
Every theater commander
is screaming for crews and equipment.

383
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,447
Fifty thousand airplanes, that's
what they say they're building.

384
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,952
I wish we had 500.

385
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,749
Our problem right now
narrows down to one group.

386
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,956
If the 918th folds, it can spread
to the other three groups.

387
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,966
It can fold the whole deal.

388
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,559
There's only one hope
of shortening this war...

389
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,730
daylight precision bombing.

390
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,242
If we fold, daylight
bombing is done with.

391
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:10,941
I don't know. Maybe
it means the whole show.

392
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:16,419
We could lose the war
if we don't knock out German industry.

393
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,386
You can smell
what's coming, Frank.

394
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:26,386
I'm promising you nothing except
a job no man should have to do
who's had his share of combat.

395
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,924
I've gotta ask you
to take nice kids and fly them
until they can't take anymore.

396
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,732
And then put them back in
and fly them some more.

397
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,740
We've got to find out
what a maximum effort is.

398
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,369
How much a man can take
and get it all.

399
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,609
[Sighs] I don't even know
if any man can do it.

400
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,048
That's what cracked Keith.

401
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:54,317
What time do you think you can
get down there tomorrow?

402
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,156
Early, I guess.

403
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,492
No squawks?

404
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,499
Pretty hard to have one,
the way you put it.

405
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,592
Thanks, Frank.

406
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,538
- Smoke, Ernie?
- Thank you, sir.

407
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,158
- All right, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,326
- Do you know me, soldier?
- No, sir.

409
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:40,387
- Then why are you
admitting me to this station?
- I saw it was a staff car, sir.

410
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,126
Goering could have been in it.

411
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,602
- Here's my A.G.O. Card.
- The general may proceed, sir.

Soldier, this is

Take a good look at me.

415
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:02,818
If you or any man on this post
passes me up without saluting
even if I'm a block away,

416
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,912
you'll wonder what fell on you.

417
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,153
- You might pass that word around.
- Yes, sir.

418

- Locate my quarters
and drop my bags off.
- Yes, sir.

- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, Ernie.

[Man Humming, Typing]

- [Whistling]
- How do I address you?

422
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,547
I don't think
I quite understand the general, sir.

423
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,817
What's your rank?
How am I supposed to know?

424
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,291
Sergeant McIllhenny, sir,
U.S. Army Air Forces.

425
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,194
It's Private McIllhenny now.
Where's the air exec?

426
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,298
I... I don't think he's
on the station, sir.

427
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,734
He left right after
Lieutenant Zimmerman's funeral.

428

- Zimmerman?
- Yes, sir. Navigator, sir.

429
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,372
- And what happened to him?
- Suicide, sir.

430

- Where's the ground exec?
- In the hospital, sir, mumps.

- And the adjutant?
- I think maybe Major Stovall's

436
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,630
Major Stovall, sir,
Group Adjutant.

437
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:39,199
- Yes, I remember you, Major.
You the only one around?
- Probably, sir.

438
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:43,804
- I presume you've come down
to take over the group.
- That's right.

439
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,415
- Have you been drinking, Major?
- I have.

440
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,456
It's the first time
I've been drunk in 20 years,

441
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,753
but it may not be the last.

442
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,794
- Where's the air exec?
- I don't know, sir.

443
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,992
It's only an opinion, but I think
it's possible he may be drunk too, sir.

444
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,160
- I'll take straight answers,
Major. Is he off the station?
- Yes, sir.

445
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,898
- Where?
- I don't know that, sir.

446
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,964
Send the M.P. S out and find him
and bring him to me under arrest.

447
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:17,109
- Does the general mean
under actual arrest?
- Exactly.

448
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,843
Two... cancel all
leaves and passes...

449
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,216
and make sure that all squadron
commanders are back here by tonight.

450
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,448
Three... bring me
the personnel files,

451
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:29,459
the 66-1 's on Gately
and the key staff...

452
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,724
- including yours.
- Yes, sir.

453
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,958
Four... set up a meeting
for all combat crews...

454
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,559
in the briefing room
tomorrow morning at 0800.

455
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:43,437
- Is that all, sir? Yes, sir.
- That's all.

456
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,089
- Colonel Gately is here, sir.
- Send him in.

457
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,155
Yes, sir.

458
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,185
That's all, men.

459
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:45,027
- May I ask the general why
I've been placed under arrest?
- No.

460
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:56,575
Stand at attention.

461
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,819
You're the son of Lieutenant
General Tom Gately, aren't you?

462
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:13,023
I believe that's
my standard identification, sir.

463
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,464
- What do you think
of him as an officer?
- None better, sir.

464
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,264
That's right.

465
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,239
You're the son of one fine officer
and the grandson of another.

466
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,769
You're a graduate of West Point
with nine years service.

467
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:34,682
You're form five shows that
you have more four engine time
than any man in the group.

468
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:42,454
For those reasons, you could've
done more than anybody to take
the load off Colonel Davenport.

469
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:49,898
The record shows that you've
flown only three missions
since you've been here.

470
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,463
- Is that right?
- If you don't count twice
I turned back, sir.

471
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,449
I take it that you don't even
care about the part you had...

472
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,850
in breaking one of the best
men you'll ever know.

473
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,449
Add to it as air exec you were
automatically in command here...

474
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,790
the moment
Colonel Davenport left.

475
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,457
And you met that responsibility
exactly as you met his need.

476
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:27,527
You ran out on it.
You left the station to get drunk.

477
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,408
And Gately, as far as I'm
concerned, you're yellow.

478
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:40,610
A traitor to yourself, to this group,
to the uniform you wear.

479
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:46,847
It would be the easiest course
for me to transfer you out,

480
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,348
to saddle some unsuspecting guy
with a deadbeat.

481
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:56,128
Maybe you think that's what
you're gonna get out of this,
a free ride in some combat unit.

482
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,363
But I'm not gonna pass the buck.

483
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,405
I'm gonna keep you right here.

484
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:07,910
I hate a man like you so much
that I'm gonna get your head
down in the mud and tramp on it.

485
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,141
I'm gonna make you wish
you'd never been born.

486
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,912
- If that's all, sir...
- I'm just getting started.

487
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,352
You're gonna stay right here
and get a bellyful of flying.

488
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,583
You're going to make
every mission.

489
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,754
You're not air exec anymore.
You're just an airplane commander.

490
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:29,492
And I want you to paint this
name on the nose of your ship...

492
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:35,401
Because in it you're gonna get
every deadbeat in the outfit.

Every man with a penchant
for head colds.

494

If there's a bombardier who can't hit
his plate with his fork, you get him.

495
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,240
If there's a navigator who can't find
the men's room, you get him.

- General Savage, I have a right
to file charges against you...

your lawful authority...

to General Pritchard cowardice,

desertion of your post,
a yellow streak a mile wide.

father so they'll both be proud of you.

I think you've been having hard luck.

not to be afraid. Fear is normal.

I thought you'd be the first one
in line to ask for a transfer.

579
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,151
- No, sir.
- Well, it wouldn't
have done you any good.

580
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,017
- Doesn't go for staff.
You're stuck with me.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:49,184
- You might tell them.
- They thought you'd want to see
them about the practice mission.

582
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,454
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,965
For the general's information, I think
you'll find Major Kaiser a top man.

584
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,227
Thorough,
knows his job, honest.

585
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:03,261
I think Cobb's an excellent man too.
It's just he's a little too frank.

586
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,501
- Thanks, Major.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:17,485
- General, this is Major Kaiser.
- I'm glad to see you, Doc.

588
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,615
- And I think you met Major Cobb.
- Indeed I have.

589
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,218
General, I don't know if you still
want me here after last night.

590
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,388
No need to tell you,
I was stiff.

591
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,523
Well, stiff or not,
you laid it on the line.

592
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,727
You got the job after I saw you
at the club, not before.

593
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,329
You were in the briefing room.
You still want it?

594
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,532
I think I can
cut it for you, sir.

595
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,509
See you at takeoff.

596
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,681
Now, what about the crew
availability, Major?

597
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,344
We have a very critical
morale problem, General.

598
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,354
You gave them the shock treatment
this morning, a bucket of cold water.

599
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,187
I take it that's the key in which
you want me to approach the problem...

600
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,023
as to how much
stress they can take.

601
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:03,054
If a man is physically capable
of handling his airplane, he goes.

602
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,998
Well, that's definite enough.

603
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,005
But some things can't be
accomplished just by issuing an order.

604
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,474
- Have you seen the sick reports?
- Yeah, I've seen them.

605
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,512
Our sick reports indicate
something else to me.

606
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,774
Besides the normal stress
of a lot of flying,

607
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:24,013
these men have had the breaking up
of a strong personal attachment.

608
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,180
They were devoted
to Colonel Davenport.

609
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:30,784
- He was the main thing
they had to hold on to.
- You suggest a treatment?

610
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,352
Yes.
Ease up.

611
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,533
Give them a chance
to get used to you.

612
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,524
Give them a chance
to get used to you.

613
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,530
No, Major.

614
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,443
For two reasons.
First, there isn't time.

615
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:50,641
Second, I can't enter a popularity
contest with Keith Davenport.

616
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,749
I'd lose that one.

617
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,946
And one more thing, I think
they're better than that.

618
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,520
All right, sir.
That's it.

619
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,721
Lieutenant Bishop
to see you, sir.

620
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,555
- Bishop? Who's he?
- A pilot, sir.

621
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:09,064
Yesterday a recommendation
for the Medal of Honor was
forwarded to you at Pinetree.

622
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,829
- Oh, yes. I'll see him
in just a minute.
- Yes, sir.

623
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,393
I think I know how deep
the problem is here, Major.

624
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,997
And I'm convinced that the one thing
that will solve it is pride,

625
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,100
pride in this group.

626
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:26,979
The kind of pride that will
make it the last thing a man
wants to be left on the ground.

627
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,076
And that's my job, not yours.

628
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:34,749
- Paint it with iodine and
mark them "duty," Doc.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,832
- Yes, sir.
- Send Bishop in.

630
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,991
Yes, sir.

631
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,244
I better practice saluting you,
Lieutenant. That goes with the medal.

632
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:59,680
- It was a privilege to add
my name to that recommendation.
- Thank you, sir.

633
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,207
- Sit down, Bishop.
- Thank you, sir, but...

634
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:07,619
- Well, first, I better
tell you why I'm here.
- Go ahead.

635
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,818
The pilots asked me
to be their spokesman, sir.

636
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,260
They want to transfer out.

637
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,731
- How many of them?
- All of them, sir.

638
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:31,810
Well, I can see why
they sent you, Bishop.

639
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,816
You make quite a spokesman.

640
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,548
Have you thought this out?

641
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,420
You're sure that's
the way you feel?

642
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,121
I... I think so, sir.

643
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,495
All right, that's it. Tell them
to put their requests through channels.

644
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,557
Meanwhile, they fly.

645
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,761
- That's all then?
- Yes, sir.

[Intercom Buzzes]

647
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,163
- Yes?
- I just made some coffee.
I thought you might like some.

648
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,396
- Shall I bring it in?
- Thanks, Major.

649
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,494
I'll come out there and get it.

650
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,320
What are you doing?

651
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:54,420
Personal effects of boys who got it
to be sent to next of kin.

652
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:58,194
I'm a little behind.
I always write a letter.

653
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,635
It always takes time
to screen the stuff pretty well.

654
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,868
It might save somebody back home
getting hurt unnecessarily.

655
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:12,246
That's a tough chore.
I don't envy you.

656
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,284
How did you happen
to get into paperwork?

657
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,683
They didn't give me any choice.

658
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,689
See, I'm... I'm a retread.

659
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,555
I had my shot at combat
in the first war.

660
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,594
Of course I kind of wanted
to get into this one,

661
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:29,995
but I guess they figured
I was too old for anything but a desk.

662
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,227
Maybe they were right.

663
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,774
You, uh...

664
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:43,403
You liked Keith Davenport,
didn't you? A lot, I mean.

665
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,447
Yes, sir.

666
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:49,281
I thought he was one
of the finest men I ever knew.

667
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,656
The same way
the boys felt, I'm sure.

668
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,490
Loyalty is a fine thing.

669
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,862
Well.

670
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,236
- Thanks for the coffee, Major.
- General Savage.

671
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:17,337
I'd like to tell you
something else, I think.

672
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:20,280
[Clears Throat]

673
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,080
I'm a lawyer by trade.

674
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,177
I think I'm a good one.

675
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,415
And when a good lawyer takes on
a client, he does it because...

676
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,449
he believes in the client's case,
and that's all that matters.

677
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,462
When I came over to England
I took on my biggest client.

678
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,192
That client
is the 918th Bomb Group.

679
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,497
I want to see my client
win its case.

680
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,800
Does that answer what
you had in mind?

681
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:48,139
- On the button.
- What did you have in mind exactly?

682
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,942
I need time before
those transfers go through.

683
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,813
- Mm-hmm. How much time?
- As much as we can get.

684
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,114
Ten days, anyway.

685
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,485
Well, it'll take those
squadron adjutants...

686
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,855
at least two days
to draw up all those requests.

687
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,759
And, let's see...

688
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:10,526
I believe in thorough, methodical work,
everything in order.

689
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,795
I've got a good deal
of stuff on my desk here.

690
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:16,327
So, it might be three days
before I could get around to them.

691
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,772
- That's five.
- Take a couple of days to check them.

692
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,209
That's seven.

693
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,339
And those squadron adjutants
are pretty sloppy sometimes,

694
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:30,408
and I certainly don't want this group
criticized for sloppy paperwork.

695
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,454
- Do you, General?
- Couldn't permit it.

696
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,785
So my guess is
every one of those requests...

697
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,451
may have to go back to the squadron
adjutants to be done over.

698
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,654
By the time I recheck them,

699
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:43,529
it'll be ten days anyway before
they can be ready for signature.

to run an outfit.

- That's right, sir.

But Harvey,
there can be trouble in this.

I don't think so, sir. I never heard
of a jury convicting the lawyer.

not to do any of it hisself.

726
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:05,103
Hmph. Looks like we just
got ourselves a talking general.

727
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:09,133
"Stack it in there, now."
[Continues, Indistinct]

728
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,687
- [Water Splashing]
- We're alerted, sir!

729
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,887
Field orders
coming in now.

730
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,329
Tell Cobb to wheel and deal.
I'll be right over.

731
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,266
Operator. Operator.
Keep this line clear.

732
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,639
I've got 24 fast calls for you.
Get me the bomb dump and hurry.

733
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,009
[Men] Bless them all
Bless them all

734
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,572
Oh, the long and the short
and the tall

735
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,586
Let's bless all the blondies
and all the brunettes

736
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,487
For each lad is happy
to take what he gets

737
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,616
'Cause we're...

738
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,298
Two missions.
Only one aircraft lost.

739
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,096
Very little battle damage.

740
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,399
That's because most of the time
we flew good, tight formation.

741
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,565
Those enemy fighters
took one look...

742
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,871
and didn't want
any part of the 918th.

743
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,548
The bad side...
the bombing.

744
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,747
Fair. Particularly,
the Low Squadron.

745
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,416
That means we start dropping
practice bombs every day that
we haven't got a mission.

746
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,653
- Cobb?
- Yes, sir.

747
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,752
- That's your baby.
- Roger.

748
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,922
Anybody got
any comment?

749
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,293
Well, I've got some more.
Hanley!

750
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,929
- Here, sir.
- Those strike photos show...

751
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,269
that you've been toggling late
with your bombs the last two missions.

752
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:49,675
- What's your reason?
- No excuse, sir.

753
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,236
Well, I'll say this for you, Hanley,
you're honest.

754
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,148
But nine men risked their lives
to ride with you...

755
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,344
in order to put
bombs on a target!

756
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,289
Gately, here's
a new bombardier for you.

757
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,918
- Pettinghill!
- Yes, sir.

758
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:09,192
We're plenty lucky to have
only one loss on this strike.
Why did you break formation?

759
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,001
Well, sir,
Ackerman was in trouble...

760
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:17,836
Two engines on fire,
and we were getting enemy fighters. I...

761
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,966
I figured I'd better stay back
and try to cover him...

762
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,977
going into the target,
but he couldn't make it.

763
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,654
Ackerman a pretty good
friend of yours?

764
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,781
My roommate, sir.

765
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,527
So for the sake of your roommate
you violated group integrity.

766
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,623
Every gun on a B-17
is designed...

767
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,032
to give the group
maximum defensive firepower.

768
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,799
That's what I mean
by group integrity.

769
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,204
When you pull a B-17
out of a formation,

770
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:56,233
you reduce the defensive power
of the group by ten guns.

771
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,509
A crippled airplane
has to be expendable.

772
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:03,575
The one thing which is never expendable
is your obligation to this group!

773
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,018
This group.
This group.

774
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,216
That has to be your loyalty,
your only reason for being.

775
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,521
- Stovall.
- Yes, sir.

776
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,892
Have the billeting officer work out
a reassignment of quarters...

777
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,454
- so that every man
has a new roommate.
- Very well, sir.

778
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,466
- Gately!
- Yes, sir.

779
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,468
Baxter is promoted
out of the Leper Colony.

780
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,697
Pettinghill's
your new copilot.

781
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,478
Well,
that's all I've got.

782
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,570
Anybody got anything else
they want to bring up?

783
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,615
What about
our transfers, sir?

784
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,691
- Okay, if that's all, dismissed.
- Attention!

785
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,001
- [Knocking]
- [Savage] Come in.

786
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,342
Keith! Come on in.
Glad to see you.

787
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,344
How are you, Frank?

788
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,346
How's the adjutant
business, Harvey?

789
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,076
Just went out of that line of work, sir.
Ground exec now.

790
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,415
- Well, glad to hear it.
You had it coming.
- Thank you.

791
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,853
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you, Harvey.

792
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,982
- Piece of cake?
- Thanks.

793
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,458
Uh, birthday.
It's a little old.

794
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,587
Oh, many happy returns.

795
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,528
Well, seems to me
I've seen this joint before.

796
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,127
It looks better
with you in it, Keith.

797
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,400
Have a drink.
Say, you're in time for chow.

798
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,874
- The boys'll be glad to see you.
- I'm not so sure of that.

799
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,343
I saw Sergeant Keller
at the gate.

800
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,870
- Had to show
my A.G.O. Card to get in.
- [Chuckles]

801
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,248
And I'll pass up the supper, I guess.
I just dropped down for a minute.

802
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,253
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about, Frank.

803
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,256
Well, I'll get on about
my ground exec-ing.

804
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,919
- I'll see you before you go, Keith.
- All right.

805
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,832
- Nice guy, Harvey.
- First-rate.

806
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,834
Sit down.

807
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,565
Aah, tastes good.
Gets the chill out of your bones.

808
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:07,234
- What a stinkin' climate.
- It's pretty bad.

809
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,938
Only I guess you didn't come down
to talk about the weather.

810
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,278
No...
Or maybe I did at that.

811
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,655
- There's a storm coming, Frank.
- The old man?

812
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,420
No. I don't know
if he even knows about it.

813
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,395
There's been a lot of talk
about requests for transfer,
only none have come through.

814
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,456
- Have you been sittin' on 'em?
- I have.

815
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,469
You've got what amounts
to a mutiny on your hands.

816
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,005
There's a rumor that
the inspector general's got hold of it.

817
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,872
If he investigates you,
you're cooked.

818
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,207
Can you slow him down?

819
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,737
You know the Old Man
can't interfere with the I.G.

820
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,807
I know what you're after...
a little time, get a few
good missions under your belt,

821
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,217
maybe the boys'll
change their minds.

822
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,384
- But it won't work that way.
- You got any ideas?

823
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,791
Well, to be perfectly frank
about it, when you took command,

824
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,729
I was hoping you'd fail,
fall flat on your face.

825
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,323
I'm that human.

826
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,335
So now, me,
the guy who blew it...

827
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,702
- wants to tell you
how to run this group.
- Shoot.

828
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,435
All right.
You're blowing it too.

829
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,137
You can't drive those boys.
I told you once before...

830
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,703
they can't just be
a set of numbers, and it still goes.

831
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,773
The fact that I blew it
doesn't mean that idea was wrong.

832
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,013
I figured it was me.
I wasn't good enough.

833
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,419
You've got
to help them, Frank.

834
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:31,255
You've got to take the time
to win something from them,
or they will walk out on you.

835
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:35,024
And that'll be a worse failure
than mine ever was.

836
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:38,123
Give them something
to lean on, you mean.

837
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,327
Call it
anything you like.

838
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,970
Well, Keith,

839
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,310
I don't believe it.

840
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,819
Here's where
you and I part company.

841
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,321
I don't think they're boys,
they're men.

842
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,450
Too bad they have
to find out so young.

843
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:08,257
How old is Bishop?
Twenty-one, maybe.

844
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,289
It's pretty tough to have
to grow all the way up at 21.

845
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:16,634
But that's the only way
we're gonna get the job done.

846
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,469
And I think
they can do it too.

847
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:23,477
Lean on somebody?
I think they're better than that.

848
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,276
And if that's not true
then we're a dead duck,

849
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,250
and we'd better find out
about it right now,

850
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,480
once and for all.

851
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:36,251
Well, that's that.

852
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,785
You called the turn
for me once,

853
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,330
and I couldn't
see it.

854
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,799
Now we're even.

855
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,429
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Keith.

856
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,791
[Men] The stars at night
are big and bright

857
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:18,595
- [Hand Claps]
- Deep in the heart of Texas

858
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,569
- The prairie skies...
- [Man] Not again.

859
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,664
[Teletypes Clattering]

860
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,767
No good, sir. Acknowledgement
from the other groups,
they've already turned back.

861
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,142
- But nothing from the 918th.
- Forget code.

862
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,545
- Try to reach him in the clear.
- Yes, sir.

863
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,583
Pinetree
to Flashlight leader.

864
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,642
Pinetree
to Flashlight leader.

865
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,688
This is a recall.
Do you read me?

866
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,883
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.

867
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,688
This is a recall.
Do you read me? Over.

868
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,124
- Nothing, sir.
- I don't get it.

869
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,031
Weren't all commanders told
to guard channel "B" because
of possible weather change?

870
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:58,334
- It was in the field order, sir.
- Well... something's happened.

871
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,739
They've gone on
to the target alone.

872
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,972
I'm going down there, Keith.
I can't just stand here and take it.

873
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,687
That's 21, sir.
They're all back.

874
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,753
Well, that's something.
I'm glad we still have miracles.

875
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,967
Well, we had
a little weather, sir,

876
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,468
but the target area had
cleared off just long enough...

877
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,506
- for the 918th
to clobber it good.
- That's fine, Frank.

878
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,474
- What about the recall?
- Recall, sir? What recall?

879
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,511
Never heard it.

880
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,411
- Must have had radio malfunction.
- I see.

881
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,507
- Let's get up to your office, Frank.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,848
- The bar's open, Harvey.
The boy's really earned it.
- Yes, sir.

883
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,619
[Pritchard] And you think I'm going
to buy a quick Persian rug...

884
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,028
about a radio malfunction?

885
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,166
And I suppose you'll tell me next
the weather was just bad enough...
