to win victory
before the end of the year.

27
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,240
It is with reluctance that
I bring this subject up again.

28
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,401
You are the life
of the fatherland, you boys.

29
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,674
You are the iron men
of Germany.

You are the gay heroes
who will repulse the enemy...

when you are called upon
to do so.

32
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,952
It is not for me to suggest
that any of you...

33
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,721
should stand up and offer
to defend his country.

34
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,832
But I wonder if such a thing
is going through your heads.

35
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,833
I know that
in one of the schools,

36
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,630
the boys have risen up
in the classroom...

37
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,933
and enlisted in a mass.

38
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,871
But, of course, if such a thing
should happen here,

39
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,445
you would not blame me
for a feeling of pride.

40
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,445
Perhaps some will say...

41
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,846
that you should not
be allowed to go yet,

42
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,512
that you are too young, that you
have homes, mothers, fathers,

43
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,284
that you should not be
torn away.

44
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,826
Are your fathers so forgetful
of their fatherland...

45
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,157
that they would let it perish
rather than you?

46
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,797
Are your mothers so weak
that they cannot send a son...

47
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,304
to defend the land
which gave them birth?

48
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,136
And after all,
is a little experience...

49
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,008
such a bad thing
for a boy?

50
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,345
Is the honor of wearing
a uniform...

51
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,749
something from which
we should run?

52
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,982
And if our young ladies
glory in those who wear it,

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,183
is that anything
to be ashamed of?

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,492
I know you have never desired
the adulation of heroes.

55
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,726
That has not been
part of my teaching.

56
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,894
We have sought
to make ourselves worthy,

57
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,939
and let a claim come
when it would.

58
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,340
But to be
foremost in battle...

59
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,538
is a virtue
not to be despised.

60
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,876
I believe it will be
a quick war,

61

that there will be
few losses.

62
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,917
But if losses there must be,

63
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,717
then let us remember
the Latin phrase...

64
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,726
which must have come
to the lips of many a Roman...

65
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,353
when he stood embattled
in a foreign land:

66
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:44,196
"Dulce et decorum est
pro patria mori."

67
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,068
"Sweet and fitting it is
to die for the fatherland."

68

Some of you
may have ambitions.

69
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,274
I know of one young man who has
great promise as a writer,

70
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,079
and he has written the first act
of a tragedy...

71
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,087
which would be a credit
to one of the masters.

72
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,349
And he is dreaming,
I suppose,

73
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,859
of following in the footsteps
of Goethe and Schiller,

74
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,893

I was too hungry to sleep,

Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?

321
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,241
A lot better than havin'
a hole in your guts.

I'll pick you up in the morning.

is to string a little wire.

We pick it up at the dump
and carry it to where we need it.

a lot of noise and land about
five miles behind the line.

out for are the light ones.

much warning.

I always told you, nobody
should carry as good a watch as that.

618
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:28,103
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.

619
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,610
Do you feel all right?

620
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:36,012
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.

621
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,882
- Just eat decently
and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.

622
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:43,457
You must eat. That's the main thing.
It looks good too.

623
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,989
I have such a terrible pain
in my foot.

624
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,138
Every toe
on my right foot hurts.

625
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:03,036
Well, how can your foot hurt
when your leg's been...

626
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,412
[Hysterically]
I know what you mean!

627
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,555
I know!
I know now!

628
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,818
They cut my leg off.

629
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:23,562
Why didn't they tell me?
Why... Why didn't they tell me?

630
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,463
- Franz! Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!

631
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,695
You must be thankful that you've
come off with only that.

632
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,313
I wanted to be
a forester once.

633
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:44,886
You can yet. They make artificial legs
that are wonderful.

634
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:49,491
And you're through too.
You can go home. Think of that.

635
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,493
We brought your things
for you. See?

636
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,460
Put 'em under the bed.

637
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,030
That's a marvelous pair
of boots.

638
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,441
Look at that leather!

639
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,476
What comfort.

640
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,512
I was just thinking.

641
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,952
If you're not going to be using these,
Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?

642
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,953
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.

643
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,322
My boots give me blister
after blister...

644
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,860
Well, we'll be going,
Franz.

645
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,598
Oh, don't go. Stay just
a little while longer.

646
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,271
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.

647
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,539
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.

648
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,546
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.

649
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,242
[Albert]
You think he'll last till after mess?

650
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,820
- I don't think...
- Done for.

651
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,351
[Paul] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.

652
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,757
[Soldiers]
Good-bye. All right, Paul.

653
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,896
I'm sorry, Paul.

654
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:09,470
I wouldn't touch a thing
of his if he could use it.

655
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:13,598
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire
for him if it'd do him any good.

656
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,041
Only... Only why should
some orderly get those boots?

657
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,478
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.

658
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,983
And good boots
are scarce.

659
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,088
Tell the doctor to come,
please.

660
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,898
Doctor, the man in the next bed
would like to see you, sir.

661
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,635
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.

662
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,642
Poor little fella.

663
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,416
He says next time,
Franz.

664
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,701
Do you think
I'll ever get well?

665
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,670
Why, of course.

666
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:26,038
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.

667
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,889
I don't think so.

668
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,118
Franz! Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.

669
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,594
They fix up worse things
than that.

670
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,859
Perhaps you'll go
to the convalescent home...

671
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,094
in Klosterberg
among the villagers.

672
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,763
Then you can look out of the
windows, across the fields...

673
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,309
to the two trees
on the horizon.

674
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,480
The loveliest time of the year
now when the corn ripens.
