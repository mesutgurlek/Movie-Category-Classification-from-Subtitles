The first star of all

Mwah! Let me make you
some breakfast, Isaac.

391
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,042
After years of struggle,
Abraham has learned

392
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:42,880
that to be chosen by God
is a blessing and a test.

393
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,915
He must prove his faith

When you have
children of your own,

404
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,721
you'll want them
to grow up as big and...

But where's the lamb?

Abraham has passed
the ultimate test.

00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:30,241
He will become the father
of God's nation.

Now it's up to Isaac.

He will have a son called Jacob.

457

God will rename him Israel.

far from the promised land
to Egypt.

Abraham and God

I will be Pharaoh!

Then you'd better start

Run, run!

525
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,239
I will hide the body.

526
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:19,767
My Lord, the amulet of Moses.

527

Shall we hunt him down?

528
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:24,305
No, let him go.

He's no threat now.

[Batya] They worship
the God of Abraham.

have let her keep him.

Even if you have...

Pharaoh is the only God
we have to fear.

My people.

608
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:32,152
Our people.

- God's people!
- God's people!

Old Pharaoh may have
been fond of you.

But it's his son
you'll have to deal with now.

612
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,669
Why would Pharaoh even see you?

613

Oh...

614
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,619
He'll want to see me.

615
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:02,205
You have a son.

616
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,842
An heir. Our dynasty
will last forever.

617
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:17,253
Why are you here, Moses?

618
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:19,955
Have you come to ask
for forgiveness?

619
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,957
No. No.

620
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:25,194
God saved me for a purpose.

621
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,565
Yes?

622
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,767
I come to demand

623
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:35,536
that you release his people
from slavery.

624
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:39,908
Demand?

625
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:42,343
Let my people go.

626
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:46,948
[Laughs] You always
were a fighter, Moses.

627
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:50,117
But you never knew
when you were beaten.

628
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:55,322
If you defy God,
you will be punished.

629
00:56:55,456 --> 00:57:00,560
You return, after all these
years, to threaten me?

630
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:02,495
Tell me.

631
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,532
Is it your invisible God
that's going to punish me?

632
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,901
The one who abandons
his people?

633
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:11,037
The one who runs
from his responsibilities,

634
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,638
from his past?

635
00:57:12,773 --> 00:57:14,306
From his family?

636
00:57:17,077 --> 00:57:18,778
Teach them who God is.

637
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:24,216
I am God!

638
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:28,820
I am God!

639
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:49,740
Moses! You've made
Pharaoh angry.

640
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,777
He will punish us.
Don't make it worse.

641
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:55,378
God has spoken to me.

642
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:58,047
He will force Pharaoh
to free us...

643
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,584
If he has to.

644
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:02,886
What should we do?

645
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,053
Sister. Brother.

646
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:07,055
All of you.

647
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,658
Trust in God!

648
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,959
Pharaoh is over there.

649
00:58:11,094 --> 00:58:13,796
If he didn't listen to you
when you were six feet away,

650
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,231
why would he hear you now?

651
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:23,405
You will see.

652
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:25,807
Put your staff...

653
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:27,642
To the water.

Come out of the water!
There's blood! There's blood!

657
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:20,925
There's blood! Blood everywhere!

Master!

660
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:31,469
You are not a God.

661
00:59:31,603 --> 00:59:34,004
You are just a man.

662
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:39,042
And you will set my people free.

663
00:59:39,177 --> 00:59:40,910
Ah! Ah!

664
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,113
Ah!

665
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,115

Do you doubt, Joshua?

670
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:11,472
All my life,
I have been Pharaoh's.

671
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,544
I will never be a slave again.

672
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,680
God is with us.

673
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:25,453
This is just the beginning.

674

[Abraham] Our Lord
is sending ten plagues

to change Pharaoh's mind.

676
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:37,464
Let my people go.

My... People.

865
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:46,135
God has delivered us
from slavery.

866
01:18:48,438 --> 01:18:50,239
We are free.

867
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:54,375
You have come a long way.

868
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:56,844
I know.

869
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:59,713
But our journey
is just beginning.

870
01:19:00,816 --> 01:19:02,616
We must trust in God.

871
01:19:03,885 --> 01:19:07,555
We must follow his path.

872
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,862
Moses leads the Israelites
to mount sinai,

873

Aah!

879
01:20:13,283 --> 01:20:17,720
God gives laws to Moses,
written in stone.

880
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:24,193
The ten commandments.

God has...

884
01:20:44,514 --> 01:20:48,549
Renewed the promise
he made to Abraham.

885
01:20:49,984 --> 01:20:54,688
We have new laws, preparing
us for the promised land.

886
01:20:54,822 --> 01:20:59,093
If we are true to God,
he will keep his promise.

887
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,194
Abraham's dream.

Our future.

889
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:07,534
You are our people's future,
Joshua.

890
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:12,505
You must take the land
promised to Abraham

891
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,441
and all of his descendants,

892

as numerous as the stars.

893
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:30,355
[Joshua] Lord,

894
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:33,791
I was with Moses when he
handed down these commandments.

895
01:21:33,925 --> 01:21:36,427
I was witness to the covenant,

896
01:21:36,562 --> 01:21:39,297
the promise of a holy nation.

897
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:44,868
Help me to forge that nation,

898
01:21:45,003 --> 01:21:50,006
to lead your people
to inherit their land.

[Others] Aye.

903

Are you ready?

909
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:41,078
We'll search the whole city.

910
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:45,616
Just find me a way in.
We must take Jericho.

911
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,087
It's all that stands between

- It's safe enough.

- Oh!
- No-one is safe.

923
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:04,323

[Angel] The Lord parted
the waters for Moses.

For you he will split rock.

01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:36,544
If we obey the Lord,

anything is possible!

Samson, your strength
comes from God.

Your duty is to drive
the philistines away.

[Uriah] David, the people
will look to you now

to defend them, unite them.

Jerusalem, our new home.

948
01:26:08,742 --> 01:26:10,275
[Saul] When you have my crown,

949
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:13,111
will you not kill
my descendants, bury my name?

950
01:26:13,245 --> 01:26:17,916
Wherever you go
I shall hunt you down!

951
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:24,690
What the Lord gives
he can take away.

952
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:27,224
What is your name?

953
01:26:27,358 --> 01:26:28,859
My name is Delilah.

954
01:26:30,062 --> 01:26:33,297
Your God has abandoned you,
Samson.

955
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:35,632
And taken your strength
with him.

No, he wants me
to destroy you all!

957
01:26:39,805 --> 01:26:41,572
The Lord told me
the house of David

958
01:26:41,706 --> 01:26:44,207
will rule Israel forever.
