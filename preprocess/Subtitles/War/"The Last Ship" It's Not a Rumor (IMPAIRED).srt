00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,649
How are you, ma'am?

163
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:46,852
- Amused.
- I'm serious.

164
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,854
I got to get down to regulation weight.

165
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:52,391
I meant with your trainer.

166
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:53,596
Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]

167
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,199
Well, I haven't seen you since Baltimore.

168
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,534
I heard rumor that you were still with us.

169
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah, well, when I heard
you were headed south,

170
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,472
I figured hitch a ride, go by water.

171
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:09,074
It's faster, and the food's much better.

172
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,043
That's bullshit.

173
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,879
You care for these people
more than you choose to admit.

174
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,015
Oh, easy, killer. You don't have
to get so lathered up about it.

175
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,818
I'm not lathered.

176
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,420
Just saying.

177
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,691
You're glad I'm back.

178
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:28,860
Curious to know why you
left in the first place.

179
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,029
Be mildly intrigued to know

180
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,767
where you went off to, who you went off to.

181
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,540
But that, I suppose, would
be a lot of questions.

182
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:45,115
It's a lot of questions.

183
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:53,485
She's my daughter.

184
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:57,355
Last I heard, she was in Jackson.

185
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,224
How old is she?

186
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,628
14. Lives with her mother.

187
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,033
Haven't seen her in three years.

188
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,935
We'll be near Jackson soon enough.

189
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:14,606
Yeah. I think I'll take
it one day at a time.

- Hey, Doc,

191
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:21,681
I'm ever in the ring,
you can work my corner.

192
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:25,050
Tex.

193
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,288
Yeah?

194
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,293
Thanks for telling me.

195
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,898
Yeah.

196
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,961
Jeter: As you know, we will
be landing soon in Norfolk.

197
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:46,831
We've put out a call over ham
radio and shortwave for pilots.

198
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,235
The hope is, with planes,
pilots, scientists, and doctors,

199
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:53,171
we can get the labs in America
and possibly even overseas

200
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:57,375
up and running and getting
real distribution of the cure.

201
00:09:57,377 --> 00:10:00,645
Also be sending out six land
teams with a twofold mission...

202
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,714
find survivors in the general population

203
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,716
and find our families.

204
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,185
Those with loved ones in
Norfolk will be assigned

205
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:10,555
to the sectors corresponding
to their neighborhoods.

206
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,157
For those who live
elsewhere in the country,

207
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,538
we can only promise your
time will come soon enough.

208
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,643
That's a S.E.A.L.

209
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,721
Signal back.

210
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:45,490
I see more S.E.A.L.s.

211
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,460
You make out any pilots?

212
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:50,228
Yes.

213
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,736
Yes, I do.

stationed up in Little Creek.

216
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,747
When shit went down, we went inland.

217
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,782
We only made it back here a few weeks ago.

218
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:14,052
We got 34 military personnel
in town as far as we can tell...

219
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:17,322
some army, some marines, but mostly Navy.

220
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:21,126
Our intel says there's a
biosafety level 4 lab on base here.

221
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:24,062
There was, but the
equipment got moved someplace

222
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:26,197
and no one here can tell us where.

223
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,667
We've been trying to divide
the city into sectors,

224
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,302
impose a level of control.

225
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:32,470
We got people holed up in
different safe houses...

226
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,073
school gym, supermarkets,

227
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,075
some of them even running
on diesel generators.

228
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:38,877
I don't know if we found them all yet,

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,079
but we're still in the
process of clearing the city.

230
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,748
My people are about to head out there soon,

231
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,617
try to find their families.

232
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,887
Any information I can
give them ahead of time

233
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,829
will be much appreciated.

234
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:00,565
Captain says the S.E.A.L.s didn't recognize

235
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,367
any of the names on the list.

236
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:03,802
Had to figure that, right?

237
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,444
It doesn't mean anything, ma'am.

and we have you.

we are more than our loss,

- [Cheers and applause]
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

We were spared for a reason.

502
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:42,672
We were spared because
we were put on this earth

You were a cop, right, a detective?

524
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:49,299
So, I should just abandon the mission,

00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,868
C.O., and the crew?

526

The captain would understand. Talk to him.

527
00:30:54,273 --> 00:30:57,007
He knew his family was alive,

528
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:00,510
and he turned away to serve the mission.

529

Lost his wife because of it.

Chandler: I've been doing a lot
of thinking, about everything.

534

There's some stuff I didn't tell you,

00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,802
some things that happened to our
crew while we were out at sea.

536
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:30,540
There are people out there
who want the cure so badly,

537
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,810
they're willing to do anything
for it, including kill.

As long as <i>Nathan James</i>

our ship will be a target.

And it is not a safe place for you.

542
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,856
And I can't put my crew in a position

543
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,192
where my own judgment might be affected

544
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:51,795
because I'm thinking
about how to protect you

545
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,229
instead of the mission.

546
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,531
So, you're leaving us?

547
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,835
No. Absolutely not.

There's plenty I can do for
the cause here on the ground,

and I'm not gonna leave you again.

It's a promise I made to you,
and I'm not gonna break it.

So, we're staying here in the house.

558
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:26,096
It's time to rebuild.

00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:28,031
We'll be safe here.

Sounds like your mind is made up.

It is.

562
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,941
Well, I guess we should
start to unpack, then.

651
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,280
Chandler: There's a vacant
house right next to mine.

652
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,152
The S.E.A.L.s will be there,
guarding the area, rebuilding.

653
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,120
My father will be there.

654
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,293
That'll be good for the
children, to be so close.

655
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,028
And, of course, I'll look in on them.

656
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,496
Thank you.

657
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:31,468
Means a lot.

658
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,816
Be safe.

659
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,341
You too.

660
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:05,945
Talking about a Navy ship
came home with a cure,

661
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,783
about planes flying across
the country with scientists.

662
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,551
I don't understand.

663
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,253
How are you hearing this?

664
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:16,222
I told you before, Curtis,
we have people everywhere.

665
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,192
Well, there have been a lot of
rumors floating around like that.

666
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:20,927
None of them have ever been right.

667
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,897
It's not a rumor.

668
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,901
Who's that?

669
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:28,968
What did he say?

670
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,570
The ship with a cure...

671
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,939
it is not a rumor.

672
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:36,042
The only question is, uh,

673
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:39,045
what are you prepared to do about it?

674
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,500
