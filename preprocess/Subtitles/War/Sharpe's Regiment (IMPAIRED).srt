You won't get many men

No draft available? There were eight

33
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,703
Lord Fenner suggested your men
be given to other battalions,

34

your Colors be sent home,

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,481

themselves into other regiments,

It is a pity, I agree.

Wellington was hoping
to have the South Essex in France.

No, well, go to Chelmsford.

then find others.

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,410
Make a knee, listen, smile.

162
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,690
Answer briefly...
yes, no, or thank you.

163
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,970
A word to the wise.

164
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,010
Coming back,

165
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,050
keep your sword from between your legs.

166
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,530
It's not unknown for us to become
entangled walking backwards.

167
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,570
No

168
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,930
Bravo.

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,970
Bravo.

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,370
Bravo.

171
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,730
Major Richard Sharpe. Your Royal Highness.
Of the South Essex Regiment.

172
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,970
How do you do?

173
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,690
Eh?

174
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,730
- Your Majesty...
- What d'you say?

175
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,570
What d'you say?

176
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,490
Did you say "eh"?

177
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,640
He said "eh"!

178
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,010
[LAUGHTER]

179
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,570
What are you doing in rifle green
if you're South Essex? Ain't they red?

180
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,770
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,970
Sir.

182
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,170
Come up. Come up!

183
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,450
Come up!

184
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,570
Now, look sharp!

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,450
[LAUGHS]

186
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,610
May I call you Dick?

187
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,610
Honored, Your Majesty.
[CLEARS THROAT]

188
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,730
Call me... Well, call me Your
Royal Highness, but look you...

189
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,280
Damn me, but I am the one
is honored entirely,

190
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,970
Dick.

[TRUMPETS]

Vive l'Empereur. Vive l'Empereur.

195
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,050
Vive l'Empereur. Vive l'Empereur.

196
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,530
Take it. Dick.

197
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,130
Take it. It's yours.

198
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,770
Now, tell me, Dick,
of that bloody day.

199
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,530
How you fought.

200
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,570
How the flames burn the grass.

201
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,970
Smoke.

202
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,170
How the wounded scream as they burn.

203
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,610
You slaughtered the French.

204
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,250
And the snakes.

205
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,330
You see, all the snakes in the grass
were slithering away

206
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,800
from the flames caused
by our cannonballs.

207
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,850
Do you see?

208
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,450
We were enveloped in flames.

209
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,930
Were we not, Dick?

210
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,290
Oh, that bloody day!

211
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,490
He er... thinks he was there.

212
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,530
Let him.

213
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,090
We were, sir... enveloped in flames.

214
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,740
Oh, every detail etched.

215
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,210
So, Dick, what brings
you back to England?

216
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,050
I...

217
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,810
[CLEARS THROAT] Sir... I'm looking for our
2nd Battalion, sir. It's gone missing.

218
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,970
Missing? Well, that won't do.

219
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,600
They want to break up the 1st Battalion,
abolish the South Essex.

220
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,530
That won't do at all.

221
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,970
Where's Fenner?

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,090
Lord Fenner?

223
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,450
You're the fellow. Come up.

224
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,490
Dick would know where
his men have gone.

225
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,930
Oh, come up, Fenner.

226
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,130
Dick tells me you want to
break up the South Essex.

227
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,490
Oh, no, sir.

228
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,610
Well, he's convinced that you do, you see.
You've spirited them off, he says.

229
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,760
Oh, no.

230
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,010
Well, Dick says you do, though.

231
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,610
And Dick wants them back.

232
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,010
And what of the 2nd Battalion?
Dick tells me it's missing.

233
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,130
No, sir. It marches on paper.

234
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,730
Oh. I never tread there.

235
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,170
Not on paper.
No, my brother Freddy does that.

236
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,690
York. Commander in Chief. You see.
No. Very difficult.

237
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,850
So, not missing, Lord Fenner.

238
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,850
No, the battalion exists on paper,

239
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,010
enabling us to assign stray men -

240
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,250
men who would not otherwise be paid -
until they can be found a proper billet.

241
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,370
Ain't it a miracle the
way it all works?

242
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,930
Do you hear that, Dick?

243
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,090
Not missing.
Just hiding in the paperwork.

244
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,010
What have we got for Dick instead?
We must have a regiment for Dick.

245
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,370
He ain't paper.

246
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,090
We'll find Major Sharpe
a new regiment, sir.

247
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,010
At once, Fenner,
and look sharp about it!

248
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,050
[LAUGHTER]

249
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,410
- You're in London, Major?
- At the Rose Tavern.

250
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,770
Ooh, best have you out of there
before you catch something.

251
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,970
Back to Spain, Fenner,
where we need him.

252
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,650
You'll have fresh orders tomorrow.

253
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,970
Well...

254
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,570
Glad to renew acquaintance,
though, Dick.

255
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,010
More salubrious surroundings
than when we took the Eagle, eh?

256
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,130
Damn me. Was it not hot that day?

257
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,890
Very hot, sir.

258
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,730
Simmerson calls him
a bastard son of a peasant whore.

259
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,090
Does he intrigue you, Anne?

260
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,090
No.

261
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,570
Though he is handsome.

262
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,890
FENNER: Oh he is. He is.

263
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,250
Do what best you can to find
out what he's after.

264
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,530
Major Sharpe?

265
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,880
Perhaps I can help you home.

266
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,930
My carriage is outside.

267
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,770
My room is some
distance away, ma’am.

268
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,330
My room... is not.

269
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,930
Will you not tell me
your name now?

270
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,810
No.

271
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,250
Whores don't.

272
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,730
They do.

273
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,410
Or how will you ask for them again?

274
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,850
You just want to boast
you've bedded one of Prinny's ladies.

275
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,570
No.

276
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,210
What have you to do with Lord Fenner?

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,130
Nothing.

278
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,570
But I'll tell you he's a liar.

279
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,040
He is. He's a politician.

280
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,690
He'd eat the contents of his own gut
for money or power.

281
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,890
So what's Fenner to you?

282
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,930
He's nothing.

283
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,240
He uses me occasionally.

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,930
Do you let him know your name?

285
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,970
Yes.

286
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,370
Then why not me?

287
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,930
You have no need of it.

288
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,690
How did you know Lord Fenner was lying?

289
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,050
He said my 2nd Battalion
marches only on paper.

290
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,410
It doesn't.

291
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,530
No?

292
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,850
I've been told they're still recruiting men.
And I believe it.

293
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,730
Are you going to look for them?

294
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,850
Of course.

295
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,130
Don't.

296
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,170
Forget your battalion.

297
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,210
Don't make Fenner your enemy.

298
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,600
Why not? What can he do to me?

299
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,370
Kill you.

300
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,250
Go back to Spain.

301
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,610
I'll be going back to Spain as soon as I can,
but I'll be taking men back with me.

302
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,810
If you know anything about my
battalion, tell me now.

303
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,970
There are stairs at the back.

304
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,010
You will not be seen leave.

305
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,330
You clawed at me,
dug your nails in my back, used me.

306
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,770
Now tell me what you know.

307
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,050
I'm telling you to go.

308
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,610
So I says...

309
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,530
"Look up at them, ye bunch of cowardly
bastards, and be struck down,

310
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,570
be made of blocks of stone."

311
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,090
Says I.

312
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,770
Ah.

313
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,890
But their thread,

314
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,570
their thread...

315
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,770
The earth shakes from their thread.

316
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,540
So with their bayonets
twirling and twirling,

317
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,170
and the drums going rat-a-tat-tat,

318
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,010
rat-a-tat-tat,

319
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,170
then the whole world goes...

320
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,210
bang!

321
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,610
- [WHISTLING]
- Don't go away.

322
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,810
The plunder, Patrick.

323
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,210
Which is half mine.

324
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,970

01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,610
Yes.

993
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,410
Thank you for this.

994
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,490
They'll come here to wan us of the escape.
Please, hurry.

995
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,250
HARPER: Sir.

996
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,720
- You'll stop the auctions?
- I'll stop them.

997
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,930
What will happen to Colonel Girdwood?
Will he be disgraced?

998
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,610
He'll be finished.

999
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,530
Good. Good.

1000
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,410
I shall not marry him.

1001
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,170
Marry?

1002
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,970
That man?

1003
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,690
That tar-faced creature?

1004
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,130
My uncle demands it.
But if he is in disgrace...

1005
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,170
He will be.

1006
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,130
Don't you worry about that.

1007
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,850
HARPER: Sir.

1008
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,890
Hurry.

1009
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,850
I'll come back.

1010
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,410
Will you?

1011
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,690
Yes.

1012
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,290
My dear Richard.

1013
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,050
- Sir.
- Yes, I heard you were in town.

1014
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,090
And field rank? My word!

1015
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,850
Is this hero the sergeant
I taught to read and write?

1016
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,410
It is, sir.

1017
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,490
And you have ever my gratitude.

1018
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,370
- How do you fare, sir?
- Well. I fare well.

1019
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,090
You? What do you expect here?

1020
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,560
I wait for the Duke of York.

1021
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,690
I have a very grave matter to discuss.
And the Duke of York must hear me.

1022
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,730
Only if you speak up. He's at Windsor.

1023
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,730
When he returns,
I doubt he'll see you.

1024
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,850
Then I need your help, sir.

1025
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,850
There is none I would trust more.

1026
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,010
It is not convenient
that you are here.

1027
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,770
You said this business was urgent.

1028
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,250
I would hardly have disturbed
Your Lordship otherwise.

1029
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,410
The business concerns Girdwood.

1030
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,450
At Foulness.

1031
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,650
Auctions.

1032
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,610
I do not imagine, sir, for one moment
that you know of what I speak.

1033
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:14,200
Let us assume that you have some
influence over those who might.

1034
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,810
- Sir Henry Simmerson, perhaps.
- Let us assume that.

1035
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,570
Should news of Sir Henry's activities
at Foulness become public...

1036
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,890
...a mighty scandal will ensue.

1037
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,410
You know that it would only need a small one
piled on the ones that have gone before

1038
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,370
to have us all out, my lord.

1039
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,610
Did I know of that which you speak,

1040
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,930
I would ask you what proof you have.

1041
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,250
- The word of a distinguished officer.
- What officer?

1042
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,690
Major Richard Sharpe.
I knew him as a sergeant.

1043
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,130
Sharpe?

1044
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,170
He lives?

1045
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,930
You know him?

1046
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:02,970
Of him.

1047
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,850
I saw the gallant major today.

1048
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,770
And he told me all about it.

1049
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,890
I persuaded him to remain silent
for the time being.

1050
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,730
He has no absolute proof.

1051
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,210
And agreed to leave the resolution
of this affair in my hands.

1052
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,610
What do you want?

1053
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,450
I'm sure you have something.

1054
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,330
Major Sharpe wants his battalion.

1055
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,050
There is no battalion, Sir William.

1056
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,770
Paper only.

1057
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,290
Of course.

1058
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,810
Sharpe would, were I to offer it,

1059
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,730
settle for command of a rifle battalion
in the American War.

1060
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,170
America?

1061
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,410
It could be arranged, I suppose,

1062
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,650
so long as Sharpe remains silent
about this preposterous affair.

1063
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,690
If there is no evidence, my lord,

1064
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,240
what does it matter if Sharpe's
silent or not?

1065
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,570

Men of sense and discretion

Which it was Lord Wellington himself,

himself sore pressed,
which he said to me,

1073
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:39,920
"You are the forlorn hope of all our
anticipations, so you are, Patrick."

1074
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,850
He said that to me. To me.

I thought it best to meet you here,
given the way you've behaved.

You're a fool.

Ma'am?

1082
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,010
You go to Horse Guards.

1083
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,485
They, not being foolish,
send for Sir William,

1084
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,235
knowing he had
been your colonel.

1085
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,760
You, in your innocence,
tell him everything.

1086
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,240
Sir William is an honorable man.

1087
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,290
He's an ambitious man.

1088
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,330
He's clever, too.

1089
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,490
He chose to speak with Lord Fenner.

1090
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,770
He went to Lord Fenner?

1091
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,250
Hm, who will reward him
with higher office,

1092
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,610
and you with a rifle
battalion in America.

1093
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,410
I always trusted him.

1094
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,450
I trusted no-one more.

1095
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:47,370
Oh, he means you no harm.
He merely wishes to avoid a scandal.

1096
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:51,770
I, on the other hand,
wish to destroy Lord Fenner,

1097
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:56,010
and you, Major Sharpe,
are the man who will help me.

1098
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,130
Why should I want to help you?

1099
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,010
Why should I trust you
when I don't even know your name?

1100
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,970
My name is Lady Camoynes.

Dowager Countess Camoynes.

1102
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:16,610
I know all about Simmerson
and Girdwood.

1103
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,450
But there must be proof
if there's to be a scandal.

1104
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:24,730
You must find accounts, letters,
anything on paper, and bring it to me.

1105
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,090
You have a day, two days perhaps,
to find written evidence.

1106
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,970
After that, the camp will be gone,

1107
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,050
and the men at Foulness
scattered in a hundred garrisons.

1108
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,290
Why do you wish to destroy Lord Fenner?

1109

He ruined my husband and
caused his death.

I now pay off my husband's debts

by clambering over him and under him
when his needs demand I should.

My name is Major Richard Sharpe
of the 1st Battalion, the South Essex.

1184
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,840
We fight in Spain and are
hard-pressed for men.

1185
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,130
Some would have us too
hard-pressed,

1186
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,850
and would disband us,

our honors and deeds forgotten.

Not I.

1189

There are more honors to come,

1190
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:00,730
more glory to be bitten on,
more French to be confounded and slain.

1191
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:06,130
I am taking some of you back with me
to do these glorious things.

01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,450
We march at first light.

Rouse at two.

1194
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,890
And remove those damn silly stocks
from your necks.

Go on.

But if you do,

you will not march with

Count the money, Smith. Muster the men.
They haven't been paid for weeks.

1221
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,130
Give each man five shillings.

Miss Jane, I am sorry,
but it is duty.

1226
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,290
I ever answer the call of
duty with alacrity.

1227

I pray you give Sir Henry
our most dutiful regards.

1228
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,800
It will be my earnest pleasure.

One day, Miss Jane, duty done,
I look to be constant at your side.

All the recruiting forms

Get the clerks to enter,
where it says Regiment,

"1st Battalion, the South
Essex" on every form.

Oh, and get rid of
O'Keefe and Vaughn.

All right, I'll take care of
those two squaddies.

Sir Henry is not at home.

- Miss Gibbons, where's Girdwood?
- Not here, Major Sharpe.

- In the library, perhaps.
- Miss Gibbons.

- It is that I have defied her and...
- Defied her?

1247
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,800
I am now a prisoner in this house.

1248
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,280
Your money and food,
I stole it.

1249
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,330
Why have you come here?

1250
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:36,050
I need evidence of the auctions,
if I'm to stop them.

1251
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,090
And there must be records, accounts.

1252
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:41,250
Two ledgers.
My uncle made me fill in the figures.

1253
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,720
But Colonel Girdwood
has taken them to London.

- Where in London?
- To my uncle's house.

01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,690
Where will he put them
for safekeeping?

1257
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,370
I don't know.

1258
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:56,410
I've only been once to his house.
I don't go to London.

1259
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,490
Major Sharpe, I am not of them.

1260

I am the daughter of a saddler,

for whatever reasons suit my uncle.

1263
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,890
I ran off when I heard I was to marry
Girdwood, but Sir Henry fetched me back.

1264
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:17,170
- You're frightened of Sir Henry?
- Yes, but I do want to help you.

Could you find the ledgers?

I want to, but it's hard.

1267
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,050
- It would help me disgrace Girdwood.
- I know.

01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,520
I should take the risk,
but I shall be punished.

My uncle beats me.

He let Girdwood watch the last time.

1272
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,010
He thought the colonel should know
how to treat a wife. He uses a cane.

1273

There are marks on his study
wall where he thrashes

01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,075
and the cane scratches
the plaster.

1275

He gets very angry.

1276

How dare he treat you so?

1277
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,490
Yes, I fear it is my lot.

1278

Girdwood is done for.

It is shaming, but I shall need money.

won't see you punished.

Then I shall protect you.
