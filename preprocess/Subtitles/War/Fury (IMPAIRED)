00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,881
All around us, kid,
'cause this is Germany.

165
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:37,849
We're surrounded by krauts.

166
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,084
Ain't that right, Grady?

167
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,419
Coon-ass: That's right.

168
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,030
Can I please
have my book back?

169
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,164
Gordo: Where
are the cigarettes?

170
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,866
I don't smoke.

171
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,501
You're a bastard.

172
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,903
You go to tank school?

173
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,104
Tank school? No.

174
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,008
I've never even seen
the inside of a tank.

175
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,343
I'm a clerk typist.

176
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,078
Was heading
to fifth corps HQ,

177
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,546
they pulled me
off the truck.

178
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,914
They sent me here.

179
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,084
It's got to be a mistake.

180
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,152
Coon-ass: Mistake?

181
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,988
Army don't make mistakes.

182
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,523
It wouldn't do.

183
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,058
You from Missouri?

184
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,727
No.

185
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,028
Are you from Chicago?

186
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,663
You from Arkansas,
ain't you?

187
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,332
No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
Hey, hush up, man.

188
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,967
Nobody gives a fuck where you from.
(Laughter)

189
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,637
Are you a praying man?

190
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,507
I go to church.
(Sniffs)

191
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,042
Which denomination are you?

192
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,077
Episcopalian?

193
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,479
Yeah, you are.
You're a mainliner, ain't you?

194
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,548
Yeah. I am.

195
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,884
Are you saved?

196
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,053
I'm baptized.
(Coon-ass chuckles)

197

Boyd: That ain't
what I asked you.

198
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,656
That ain't what
he asked you.

199
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,258
Boyd: Gordo, what'd I ask him?
See, you got to listen.

200
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,092
Gordo: Say it again.
Boyd: Are you saved?

201
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,230
Wait until you see it.

202
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,432
See what?

203
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,471
What a man can do
to another man.

204
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,675
Coon-ass:
Before you find Jesus,

205
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,744
why don't you come
take a look at your seat?

206
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,779
That's where
you're gonna be.

207
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,049
Get a bucket of hot water from the kitchen.
Get that shit clean.

Fuck.

215

Davis: Weren't supposed to

216
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,266
Tell my platoon that.

217
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,668
Binkowski:
You send five tanks out.

218
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,403
One comes back.

219
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,005
It's hard to believe
we're winning the war.

Soldier 2: Hey!
What's an SS doing here?

Hey, why are you bringing him through here?

Why isn't
he sleeping?

229
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,430
G2 wants a prisoner

00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,498
Oh, I'll question him.

What's your favorite color?

Are you a good dancer?

00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,232
He's an SS.

00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,401
You kill every last one you can.
They're real assholes.

We're meeting

but we can't fuck them,

328
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,441
<i>'cause it says so</i>
<i>in the Bible.</i>

329
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,009
Boyd: Stop, all right?

330
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm done trying to
convert you heathens.

331
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,646
You mind if I continue
invading Germany?

332
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,781
Boyd, do you think
Jesus loves Hitler?

333
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,050
Do I think
Jesus loves Hitler?

334
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,219
I'd assume so.

335
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,687
If Hitler accepted
Jesus into his heart

336
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,055
and got baptized,
he'd be saved.

337
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,857
It ain't gonna save him
from man's justice.

338
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,926
What about your regular-issue Nazi line trooper?

339
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,894
No, I'm not gonna do this with you.
Is he going to heaven?

340
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,796
We've been talking about the
same dumb shit for three years.

341
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,732
You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

342
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey, what about me, huh?
You think you could save me?

343
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,402
<i>Sing me a hymn?</i>

344
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,804
Yeah, sure.
Sing <i>old rugged cross.</i>

345
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,638
I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

346
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,940
Don't.
I like it.

347
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,174
I'll sing it
if you don't do that.

348
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,177
Don't touch me. Stop!
I just wanna touch your mustache.

349
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,079
Why does that bother you so much
when I touch your mustache?

350
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,514
I'll shoot you, I swear!
All right, knock it off.

351
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,782
Knock off the horseplay.

352
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,589
Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck
one of us for a chocolate bar?

353
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,723
(Laughter)

354
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,625
I hope so.

355
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,737
(Laughter)

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,014
(Indistinct chatter
over radio)

357
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,075
Boyd: Ambush! Right!

358
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,010
Right side, ambush!

359
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,513
(Indistinct shouting)
Fuck! Grady!

360
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,449
Coon-ass: You watch that tree line!
We're ripe for an ambush!

361
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,750
(Screaming)

362
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,851
Boyd: Grady, cover right!

363
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,887
(Screaming continues)

364
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:19,924
Parker: Father!

365
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:23,928
(Screaming)

366
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,600
Wardaddy:
What'd you see, Boyd?

367
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,868
Coon-ass: Just go out and blast them little fuckers!

368
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,837
What'd you see?

369
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,004
Boyd: I didn't see nothing.

370
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,662
Norman!

371
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,433
You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

372
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:04,435
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:05,569
I'm really sorry, sergeant.

374
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,639
You see
what a kid can do?

375
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,674
Look!

376
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,343
That's your fault.

377
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,011
That's your fucking fault.

378
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,646
Next German you see
with a weapon,

379
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,081
you rake the dog shit
out of him.

380
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,949
I don't care if it's a baby with a butter knife in one hand

381
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,950
and mama's titty
in the other.

382
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,885
You chop him up!
Yes, sergeant!

383
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,586
(Norman groans)

384
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,657
Bible?
Yeah?

385
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,995
(Panting)

386
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,136
All tanks, Wardaddy.

387
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,871
(Sighs)

388
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,040
Looks like I'm it.

389
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,878
I'll lead the column.
Let's get us where we're going.

390
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,681
(Engines starting)

391
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,761
Man: We have this thing
set up and on the way.

392
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,829
I sent over a couple men
to keep contact,

393
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,264
and the officers have been briefed.
(Distant whoosh)

394
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,265
(Rumbling)

395
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,467
(Rapid gunshots)

396
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,669
Wardaddy:
Stop right here, Gordo.

397
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,106
Baker company?
Yes, sir!

398
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,075
I'm not a sir.

399
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:18,909
Me, neither.

400
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,844
Where's your boss?
Wardaddy: Dead.

401
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,548
Who's in charge
of this column?

402
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,083
I am.

403
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,318
Good. I'm talking to
the right man.

404
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,219
Park it over there.
Old man's waiting.

405
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,266
(Airplanes passing overhead)

406
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,204
(Explosions rumbling nearby)

407
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,673
Man: Yes, thank you, sir,

408
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,875
don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

409
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,444
Unless you want
to come down here,

410
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,546
stand knee-deep in their guts
and form an opinion.

411
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,214
Baker 6 out.

412
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,949
Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

413
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,751
Load the casualties
into a truck.

414
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,853
We're gonna drive them
back to base ourselves.

415
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:03,654
Take care of our own.
Come with me.

416
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,390
Hey, wake up!

417
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,193
All right,
how many tanks we got?

418
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,194
Four.

419
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,363
Four? You're shitting me.

420
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,799
I asked for 10.

421
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,003
Miles! Sergeant Miles!

422
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,237
Yes, sir?

423
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,505
Get first platoon ready.

424
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,307
You're working for him now.

425
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,642
If they can stand,
they're in play.

426
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,909
Roger.

427
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,244
All right,
here's the deal.

428
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,545
I got a platoon
trapped in this beet field

429
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,680
by machine guns.

430
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,414
I sent my tracks in.

431
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,450
Jerry took them out.

432
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,887
So, anti-tank guns there, there,
possibly there, I don't know.

433
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,555
I need you
to rescue my guys.

434
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,857
Take the guns out.

435
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,292
I can do that.

436
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,095
All right, that clears this road into town,
you push forward.

437
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,331
I'll join you there.
We'll clear it up.

438
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,666
Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.

439
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,834
(Sighs)

440
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,236
This high ground,
you got any eyes on it?

441
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,039
I had eyes there, gone.
There, gone.

442
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,307
We're flying blind.
It's you and me.

443
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,677
Krauts got sights
on this road.

444
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,744
I don't want to
show my flank.

445
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,379
Any objection if
I come in here?

446
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,249
You can arrive on a fucking magic carpet,
for all I care.

447
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,985
I know who you are.
I know you know what you're doing.

448
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,689
You just paste them
hard for me.

449
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,191
They murdered some good boys out there today.

450
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,463
Why don't they just quit?

451
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,135
Would you?

452
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,571
We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by mgs.

453
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,174
Krauts got anti-tank
covering the field.

454
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,809
And once we cross
this hedgerow,

455
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,712
we will be in range and in their line of sight,
so be alert.

456
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,213
Hit anything
that fucking moves.

457
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,881
Yeah, unless
they pound us first.

458
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,016
Wardaddy: If they do,
we'll know exactly where they are.

459
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,319
Let's get these boys out of there and smash those guns.

460
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,091
Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

461
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,760
Why are we rescuing kittens instead
of just driving down into Berlin?

462
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,730
Why are you such an asshole?
That's a great question.

463
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,233
March order. Fury, old Phyllis,
Lucy sue, murder inc.

464
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,935
Let's go.

465
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,104
Miles: All right,
fuck sticks.

466
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,238
Mount up! By squad!

467
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,406
Soldier: All right, mount up!

468
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,874
Wardaddy:
<i>All tanks, comm check.</i>

469
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:04,875
Peterson: <i>1-4's up.</i>

470
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,077
Davis: <i>Love 1-3 copies.</i>

471
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,445
Soldier: That's right, man.
Wardaddy: Need you to hold tight!

472
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,092
All tanks, Wardaddy.

473
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,128
When we hit open ground,
line up on me.

474
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,763
(Over radio) <i>Keep your spacing,</i>
<i>don't bunch up.</i>

475
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,331
<i>On my signal,</i>
<i>we'll drop the doughs</i>

476
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,799
<i>and roll up that 75.</i>

477
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,067
<i>Everyone copy?</i>

478
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,301
Binkowski:
Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

479
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,003
Peterson: Copy.
Davis: <i>Love 1-3 copies.</i>

480
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,039
Wardaddy: <i>Gordo, halt.</i>

481
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,042
<i>All tanks halt.</i>
<i>All tanks halt.</i>

482
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,180
(Engine revs)

483
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,652
All right,
let's get the boys off.

484
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,087
Get them off.

How do you know they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

607
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,125
Hit them!
But they're dead!

608
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,860
Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

609
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,628
So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

I fucking give up. I fucking give up.
I can't be here anymore.

617
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,914
This ain't pretty,
you know.

618
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,882
This is what we do.

619

Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

I had the best bow gunner in the
entire ninth army in that seat.

641
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,852
And now I got you.

642
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,391
I promised my crew a long time ago I'd keep them alive.

643
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,729
You're getting in
the way of that.

644
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,598
I'm sorry.

645
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,301
Okay, I am trained to
type 60 words a minute.

646
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,638
I am not trained to
machine-gun dead bodies.

I am trying my very best.

Where'd you get that U.S. army coat?
Where'd you get it? Huh?

650
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,248
Who'd you kill, boy?

651

Where did you

Forgive me.
Let me go, please

653
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,989
Dillard: Who did you kill?
What'd you do?

654
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,291
Don't shoot!

655

Let me go, please, let me go

656
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,960
who'd you kill, boy?
Wardaddy: Sergeant!

657
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,061
Back it up, boys!

658
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,062
Hold on. Hold on!

659
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,197
Back it up, boys.

I can't hear you.
Wait.

you are no goddamn good to
me unless you can kill krauts.

675
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,924
Put a big fat hole

676

Put a big fat hole

No.

Why the hell not?

679
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,070
It's not right.

(Whimpering)

681
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,506
"Not right"?

682
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,808
We're not here
for right and wrong.

683
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,942
We're here to kill them.

Why are you here?

685

You're here to kill him.

You know why he's here?

687

He's here to kill you.
(Speaking German)

He's here
to kill you, Norman.

689

He's here to rip your throat
out with a bullet.

690

Go to hell.

691

(Groaning)

692
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,099
I'm trying to
teach you something.

You here to get me killed?

694
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,770
No.
You gonna get me killed?

695
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:34,704
No.

696
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,705

He kills you,

Simple math.

You or him. Pick.

703

Oh, no, no.
This is the easy part.

All right.

Wardaddy:
She's a good, clean girl.

If you don't take her

01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:31,386
I'm not gonna bite you.
This hand.

Yeah.

988
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,793
Now, you can tell
a lot about a person

All right, this,
you see that?

It means you help people,
you understand them.

Now, look,
there a special gal.

She's down there and
she's waiting on you.

Did you...

1040

All right, don't touch her.
Don't touch her?

Don't touch her.
Don't ever fucking tell me what to do.

You think you get some pussy and
now you can fucking act like a man?

Anyone touches the girl,

Don't touch you?
You a man, right?

Get some pussy,
you a man, right?

1068

Get your fucking
hands off me.

1069

Fucking piece of shit.

Watch this. How about that?
How about I just kill you, huh?

What the fuck is that?
Gasoline?

Taste like gasoline? Hey.

Go have a seat.

1084
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,107
My beverage.

1085
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,681
That's the girl's egg.

That's the girl's egg.

Gordo: Then where the fuck
was my egg?

1089
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,193
You want to say grace?

1090
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,228
This meal's for you.

Ready?

1093

Gordo: Let's do it.

1094
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,568
Our father,

1095
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,403
thank you for preserving our lives another day on earth

1096
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,438
so we may execute
your will.

1097
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,275
Thank you for this meal and this wonderful company.
Amen.

Others: Amen.

1099

Emma.

1100
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:15,690
Offer the girl her plate.

1101
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,562
There you go. Oops!

1102
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,597
Hold on.

1103
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,341
Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

1104
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,443
Let me just fix this
for you real quick.

1105
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,181
I didn't touch her.

1106
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:45,386
(Crying)

1107
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,422
Switch with me.

1108
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,206
Gordo: Y'all were gonna eat like
kings and queens over here.

1109
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,110
And we weren't invited.

1110
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:11,980
I wonder why
we weren't invited.

1111
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:13,715
Coon-ass: Guess
they too good for us.

1112
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,423
I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

1113
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:23,625
Gordo: Are you?
Coon-ass: Enjoying your meal?

1114
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:27,095
And as much as you
want to destroy it,

1115
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:28,630
you're not gonna
fucking stop me.

1116
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:30,265
And neither will you.
No, sir.

1117
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,866
And neither will you.

1118
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,875
Hey, Norman.

1119
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,912
Do you like horses?

1120
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,784
Don likes horses.

1121
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,954
Ain't that right, Don?

1122
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:58,326
(Gordo chuckles)

1123
01:09:58,328 --> 01:09:59,761
We're eating.

1124
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,598
No, we're not.
I'm done.

1125
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,599
I'm fucking done eating.
(Dishes clattering)

1126
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,744
Gordo: Hey, in France,

1127
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,815
we hit the beach right after d-day.
(Silverware clattering)

1128
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,451
Right?

1129
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,755
And we had to fight through
all these fucking hedgerows.

1130
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,659
Fucking pain in the ass,
right?

1131
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:34,862
We finally hit open country,
and we linked up

1132
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,965
with the British and the Canadians
and you know what we did?

1133
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,335
You know what we did.

1134
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:44,239
We trapped an entire kraut
army pulling back into Germany.

1135
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,711
We fucked them up.

1136
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,479
Yeah.

1137
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,781
Yes, we did.

1138
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,817
There was dead
krauts and horses,

1139
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:59,254
busted up tanks
and cars for Miles.

1140
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,323
Miles.
Mmm-hmm.

1141
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,793
Your eyes see it,

1142
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,831
but your head can't
make no sense of it.

1143
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,001
And we go in there...

1144
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,641
And for three whole days,

1145
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,877
we shoot
the wounded horses.

1146
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,512
All day long.

1147
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,915
Sunup to sundown,
just shooting horses.

1148
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,018
And they were
some hot summer days.

1149
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,422
I ain't never smelled
nothing like that, top.

1150
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,859
Gordo: Do you know
how you kill a horse?

1151
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,494
You pet it on the...

1152
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:41,729
Pet it on
the forehead, no?

1153
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,465
And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

1154
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,001
And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

1155
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,904
And the sound of it?
(Clears throat)

1156
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,441
Those fucking
screaming horses?

1157
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,376
Do you remember that, Don?

1158
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,848
All the black clouds of flies just buzzing around.

1159
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,652
It was like being
in a giant beehive.

1160
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,588
But you weren't there.

1161
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,527
(Sniffs)

1162
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,201
That was a real fine story.

1163
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:22,637
Pleasant mealtime talk.
Thank you.

1164
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:25,340
Thank you. Thank you.

1165
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:27,041
It is what happened, Don.

1166
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,880
What happened, happened.
What's gonna happen is gonna happen.

1167
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,949
Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch krauts

1168
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:35,850
ain't gonna change
a fucking thing.

1169
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,085
Shut the fuck up.

1170
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,220
Why should I shut up?

1171
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:40,388
You shouldn't.

1172
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,074
(Choking up)
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

1173
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:15,990
(Door opens)
Man: Where's love 1-6?

1174
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,992
Right here.

1175
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,394
The old man wants you.

1176
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,828
How come?
You got a mission.

1177
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,131
(Man sighs)

1178
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:24,132
Wardaddy: Let's go.

1179
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,436
(Speaking German)

1180
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:29,137
Where are you going?

1181
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,906
To take the next town

1182
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,742
and the next and the next

1183
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,479
until you people quit

1184
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:40,014
Norman: Do you have a pen?
I'll write you.

1185
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:42,216
Y'all getting married?
Is that what the fuck y'all doing?

1186
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,451
This a fucking wedding?

1187
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,521
Hurry up.
There are more of them.

1188
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,990
What am I walking into?

1189
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,095
A recon plane spotted a troop
concentration moving west, here.

1190
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,665
Battalion needs you to
guard these crossroads here

1191
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,067
in this grid on the overlay.

1192
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,271
How many troops did he see?

1193
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,205
I don't know.

1194
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,774
What kind of troops?

1195
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:10,077
They have tanks,
horses, artillery?

1196
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:12,747
I wish I could help you.
He took fire,

1197
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:14,615
he got the fuck
out of there.

1198
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,784
Enough to spook the colonel.

1199
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,154
All the tanks are
driving on Berlin.

1200
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,857
There's a couple of thousand cooks,
mechanics and doctors here.

1201
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,859
Those krauts hit them,
it'll be a slaughter.

1202
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,196
All we got is you.

1203
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,201
We need you to the crossroads fast as you can.

1204
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:35,570
Secure them. Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

1205
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,538
Take my gas if you have to.

1206
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,673
If those troops
get past you,

1207
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,909
they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

1208
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,812
Then the whole
division's fucked.

1209
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,082
All right, sir.
We're on the way.

1210
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,586
Is that gas?
Open it up.

1211
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,489
Yeah, it's good.
Okay.

1212
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,790
Soldier: Incoming!

1213
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:56,624
Boyd: Grady,
jump, jump, jump!

1214
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,192
(People screaming)

1215
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,106
(Rumbling)

1216
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,044
Boyd: Grady, you up?

1217
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,724
You good?

1218
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,959
Boys, good?

1219
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:33,094
Gordo: Thank
the krauts for that.

1220
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:34,495
Binkowski?

1221
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:35,496
Davis, good?
Boyd: Grady!

1222
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:36,597
Soldier: Everybody up!

1223
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,666
Boyd: You up?

1224
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:41,736
Coon-ass: I'm up.

1225
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,274
(Indistinct shouting,
chatter, coughing)

1226
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:53,447
All right, let's get
an aid station right there.

1227
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:55,783
Wardaddy: Check Peterson.
We're gonna mount up. Boyd: Norman!

1228
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:56,984
Norman: Emma!
Coon-ass: I got him.

1229
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,854
Emma!

1230
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,060
Fuck.
Who do you think you are, huh?

1231
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:06,928
Jesus Christ?
(Norman grunts)

1232
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,897
Fuck!

1233
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,566
You gonna raise
her up, Norman?

1234
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,167
Get your ass back
on the fucking tank.

1235
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,136
Fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck are you doing? Huh?

1236
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:16,604
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What you gonna do?

1237
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:18,039
You gonna get mad?

1238
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,974
You don't feel anything?
You piece of shit!

1239
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,642
That's it, come on! Come on.
Fuck you!

1240
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:23,044
You feel it?
Fuck you!

1241
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:24,812
It's called war!

1242
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,514
You feel it?

1243
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:27,315
(Screaming)

1244
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:33,154
Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

1245
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,289
Where the fuck
you think you are?

1246
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,796
Oh, God, why?

1247
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:45,800
Wardaddy: Tankers, mount up!

1248
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,061
<i>¶ ¶</i>

1249
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:37,952
you see that?

1250
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,393
That's an entire city
on fire.

1251
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,371
I started this war killing Germans in Africa,
then France, then Belgium.

1252
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,739
Now I'm killing
Germans in Germany.

1253
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,443
It will end.

1254
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,679
Soon.

1255
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,417
But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:55,943
Boyd: Grady, get down!

1448
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:02,549
(Groaning)

1449
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,518
Shit! Not another
fucking tiger!

1450
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,819
A mine.
Where's it coming from?

1451
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,955
Where? Settle down.
It's a mine. We hit a mine, is all.

1452
01:27:07,957 --> 01:27:08,822
Whew!

1453
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:10,824
Everybody off.
Grady?

1454
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:11,858
Yeah, I'm off.

1455
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,293
Shit.

1456
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:16,463
Wardaddy: How bad is it?

1457
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:19,633
It's broke as fuck.
Busted a bogie, too.

1458
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:20,834
Wardaddy: Can you fix it?

1459
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,437
Yeah, why not?

1460
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:24,838
(Gordo speaking Spanish)

1461
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:29,676
(Coughing, groaning)

1462
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,947
All right, Norman,
you and coon-ass check out that building.

1463
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:34,948
Get my Thompson.

1464
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,183
What?

1465
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,517
Go get the Thompson.

1466
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:39,219
Boyd: Gordo!
Gordo: Yeah?

1467
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:40,254
You got that rope bag?

1468
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:41,355
Right here.

1469
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,053
You can put the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

1470
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:17,991
(Flicks lighter open)

1471
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,730
Can we go now?

1472
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:28,769
Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

1473
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:32,539
I think...

1474
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,776
I think you're a good man.

1475
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:38,512
It's what I think.

1476
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:40,647
(Chuckles)

1477
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:45,085
I think maybe we ain't,
but I think you are.

1478
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:48,021
See, I just...
I wanted to tell you that.

1479
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,025
It's okay.

1480
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,129
(Chuckles)

1481
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:57,631
Come on, let's go.

1482
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,070
Anything?
No, nothing.

1483
01:29:03,072 --> 01:29:05,439
It's an aid station.
They all dead.

1484
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:10,744
Wardaddy: Kid.

1485
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,850
Head up top of that hill,
near those trees. You got outpost guard.

1486
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,686
Can I grab my canteen?

1487
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,589
Yeah, you can
grab your canteen.

1488
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:39,706
Norman!

1489
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,708
Top of the hill,
then work your way from the trees.

1490
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,853
(Wind blowing softly)

1491
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,605
(Wind blowing softly)

1492
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,527
(Birds squawking,
wind whistling gently)

1493
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,484
(Exhales)

1494
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,801
(Men singing in German,
marching in distance)

1495
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:23,944
(Singing,
marching growing louder)

1496
01:31:31,385 --> 01:31:33,987
(Soldiers continue singing,
marching)

1497
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,093
(Singing continues)

1498
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:51,805
(Singing continues)

1499
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:06,720
(Singing continues)

1500
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:15,028
Hey! Hey!

1501
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,432
Good evening, Norman.
Why aren't you at your post?

1502
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:20,834
Slow down.

1503
01:32:20,836 --> 01:32:22,536
They're coming right now.
Who's coming?

1504
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:23,904
The Germans!

1505
01:32:23,906 --> 01:32:25,505
How many?

1506
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:26,373
Too many.
Too many to count.

1507
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,574
How many?

1508
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,645
Oh, about two,
maybe 300 of them.

1509
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:33,513
They got vehicles, too.

1510
01:32:33,515 --> 01:32:35,615
Tanks?
No, no, no, just trucks.

1511
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:37,884
Coon-ass: Probably a bunch of bums
looking to surrender, that's all.

1512
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,853
Norman: No. No, no, no.
They were marching, they were singing.

1513
01:32:39,855 --> 01:32:42,889
Coon-ass: What do you mean,
they were singing? Boyd: Where?

1514
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,157
Norman: I'm telling you.
Right over there.

1515
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,427
(Faint singing in distance)

1516
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:49,462
Hey, you hear that?

1517
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:51,064
It's a goddamn
SS battalion.

1518
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:52,165
Bullshit.

1519
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,700
Jesus Christ.

1520
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,404
Grady, get my gun.
Yeah.

1521
01:32:57,406 --> 01:32:59,372
You want to get the weapons?
Shit.

1522
01:32:59,374 --> 01:33:01,174
What do you want to do?
Let's just get our shit, all right?

1523
01:33:01,176 --> 01:33:04,377
Look, it's about to be dark.
We just get on up out of here, huh?

1524
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:06,313
Let 'em pass on through.
Boyd: Let's him them woods.

1525
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:08,815
Coon-ass: Norman, go get
your shit. Go get your pack.

1526
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,151
Let's go.

1527
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:14,754
We never run before,
I ain't running now.

1528
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,556
What was that?
We're gonna fight it out.

1529
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:17,824
We can't.

1530
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:19,326
I'm gonna hold
this crossroad.

1531
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:22,295
What you mean, you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

1532
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,297
The tank's fucking busted, top! Hey.

1533
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:25,832
Yeah, you said that.
Top, what are you doing?

1534
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:27,267
What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

1535
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:28,301
I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
You want to sit here

1536
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:29,603
and hold off
a SS battalion...

1537
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:31,571
No, it's not what I want to do,
but it's what we're doing.

1538
01:33:31,573 --> 01:33:33,540
There's five of us...
Get to your fighting positions! Mount up!

1539
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,108
What you mean fucking fighting
positions when we ain't got a tank?

1540
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:36,209
How we gonna fight?

1541
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:37,544
We got a Cannon!

1542
01:33:37,546 --> 01:33:38,511
Gordo: Don,
that don't make sense!

1543
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:40,814
Stop! What are you doing?

1544
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:49,122

I'll need you to load.

Boys, get on.
It's all right.

Grady, come on.

1559
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:11,071
We're gonna stay.

1560
01:35:11,073 --> 01:35:11,938
Uh-huh.

What is your plan?

01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,326
Fuck it.

1563
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:39,132

That's it.

1570
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:37,957
Go and grab it. That's it.
Norman: All right, all right.

1571
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:40,059
Grease gun.

1572
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:42,095
Go on, hand it to him.
Another box.

1573
01:36:42,097 --> 01:36:45,064
Coon-ass: Go ahead and get it ready.
Listen, you do not waste one shot.

1574
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:46,399
You hear me?
Wardaddy: Gordo.

1575
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:48,001
Boyd: Grenades.
Wardaddy: Ammo count.

1576
01:36:48,003 --> 01:36:50,036
Boyd: Put that there.
Coon-ass: Make them count.

1577
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:52,405
What kind of rounds
you got up there? Norm?

1578
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:53,673
I only got two.
All right.

1579
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:55,675
Ready?
(Grunts)

1580
01:36:55,677 --> 01:36:56,576
Coon-ass: That's it. Yeah.

1581
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,648
Norman: I'm going through
ammo like water.

1582
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:05,885
That's four rounds of smoke,
and 23 super charge and 33 solid shot.

1583
01:37:05,887 --> 01:37:07,587
What you want, top?
Load super charge.

1584
01:37:07,589 --> 01:37:08,354
Set the point delay.

1585
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,423
Boyd: Norman, get it ready.

1586
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:17,463
Coon-ass: That's it.
Here we go, Boyd.

1587
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:23,036
Coon-ass: Gordo,
grab me that one.

1588
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:30,977
Boyd.
Thank you.

1589
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,512
Norman: Give me that can.

1590
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,563
Might as well
get a little tight.

1591
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:53,066
Won't be around
for the hangover.

1592
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,219
Ah...

1593
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,321
God, that's better than good.

1594
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,090
Mmm.

1595
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:22,528
Give it here.

1596
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:29,502
Give it here.

1597
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:36,142
What you gonna do with that?

1598
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:37,610
I'm gonna drink it.

1599
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:42,782
I know you hate me
preaching. I know it.

1600
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:45,451
But what we're doing here is
a righteous act, gentlemen.

1601
01:38:45,453 --> 01:38:46,686
You hear me, Gordo?
Mmm-hmm.

1602
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:55,161
You know,
there's a Bible verse I think about sometimes.

1603
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:58,331
Many times.

1604
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:00,633
It goes...
