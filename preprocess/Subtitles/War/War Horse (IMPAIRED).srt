he just tossed them out.

he threw them straight in the dustbin

whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.

Hard as it surely was
and however much pain it's cost him,

00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,002

I suppose.

416

You can't. He's mine.

- I trained him.
- Albert.

485

You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

486
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,013
I'm afraid it's too late, lad.
I've just paid 30 guineas for him.

Please. I'll get you money.

He won't obey anyone else.

He won't be any good in the war neither.

I'm volunteering.

- Albert, sir.

- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.

496

- Is that the truth?
- No, sir, but I look 19

497
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,425
and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds,

498

and I'm strong, sir,
and I'm not afraid of anything.

I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert,

to purchase a horse

But it's all I've got.

Will you lease him to me, Albert?
To be my own mount?

I promise you, man to man,
that I'll look after him

507
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,540
as closely as you've done.

508
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,796
I'll respect him and all the care
that you've taken with him.

And if I can, I'll return him to your care.

There are no vets.
There are scarcely any horses left.

It's a horse they found wandering about
in no man's land. Down you go.

He was alive, you see, sir,
where nothing survives.

to the men, sir, he's...

Well, we have high hopes for him.

1302

You should shoot him now.

- It'd be a mercy, lad.

My granddaughter's.

1424
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:31,161
She saved his life.
He was everything to her.

1425
02:12:31,235 --> 02:12:33,203
Where is your granddaughter?

1426
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:35,907
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

1427
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,459
He is all that I have left of her.

1428
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:48,552
(WHINNIES)

1429
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:04,276
Don't be worried, boy, when I go.

1430
02:13:04,393 --> 02:13:06,737
I won't worry over you none.

1431
02:13:06,812 --> 02:13:08,780
Hey, I found you, didn't I?

1432
02:13:10,316 --> 02:13:11,989
And you found me.

1433
02:13:15,988 --> 02:13:17,490
And we'll both...

1434
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:21,289
We'll both know
that we made it through.

1435
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,753
Now come on.

1436
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:26,833
We're the lucky ones.
Always have been.

1437
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:29,260
Lucky since the day I met you.

1438
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:33,256
God be with you, sir.

1439
02:13:36,175 --> 02:13:38,269
Do you know what this is?

1440
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,271
That's my father's.

1441
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:46,936
That's his regimental pennant.

1442
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:55,861
How did you come by this, sir?

1443
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:00,328
You may have this.

1444
02:14:08,457 --> 02:14:11,301
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.

1445
02:14:14,964 --> 02:14:16,341
And this.

1446
02:14:25,558 --> 02:14:26,684
- Sir, I...
- No, no, no.

1447
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:29,653
Not necessary. He belongs to you.

1448
02:14:30,813 --> 02:14:33,783
That is, of course,
what my little girl would have wanted.

1449
02:14:33,857 --> 02:14:35,825
And she was the boss.
(CHUCKLES)

1450
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:48,505
What was her name?

1451
02:14:49,415 --> 02:14:50,758
Emilie.

1452
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:56,171
Her name is Emilie.
