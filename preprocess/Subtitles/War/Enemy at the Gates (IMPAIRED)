1
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:27,682
I am a stone.

2
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:32,678
I do not move.

3
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:39,968
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,637
Then he won't see my breath.

5
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,140
I take my time.

6
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,135
I let him come closer.
I have only one bullet.

7
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:03,426
I aim at his eye very gently.
My finger presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:13,515
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:16,098
I have no fear.

10
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:21,094
I'm a big boy now.

11
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,474
Ready, Vassili?

12
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,308
Now, Vassili. Fire!

13
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:33,304
Fire, Vassili! Fire!

14
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:33,018
Come on, pick your feet up.

15
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:38,013
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.

16
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:49,719
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

17
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,183
All civilians, get out!

18
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,393
Make way, let the civilians off.

19
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:58,891
<i>This is a military convoy.</i>

20
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:03,889
<i>No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.</i>

21
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,972
<i>This is a convoy to Stalingrad.
Only for the soldiers of the Red Army.</i>

22
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:22,388
<i>No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.</i>

23
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:37,056
All aboard!

24
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,974
<i>Autumn, 1942.</i>

25
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,972
<i>Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.</i>

26
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:12,643
<i>The German Third Reich
is at the height of its power.</i>

27
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,395
<i>Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union</i>

28
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,186
<i>towards the oil fields of Asia.</i>

29
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,520
<i>One last obstacle remains.</i>

30
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,936
<i>A city on the Volga where
the fate of the world is being decided.</i>

31
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:28,933
<i>Stalingrad.</i>

32
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:53,061
The Red Army and all citizens
of the Soviet Union

33
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:58,058
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
Must fight to the last...

34
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:21,354
Glorious Comrade Stalin has ordered
not another step backwards,

35
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:26,352
so the people of the Soviet Union
shall be free.

36
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:45,558
Let's go forwards, Comrades.
Not a step backwards.

37
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:07,436
Listen to these letters sent by Russian
mothers to their sons on the front.

38
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:14,143
Volodya, our child,
I know that it is for our motherland...

39
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:22,729
I know it is for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

40
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:43,061
Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

41
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:46,647
Everyone here is proud of you.

42
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,316
Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

43
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:55,311
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists.

44
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,274
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

45
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:38,817
Get back or I'll shoot.
Get back from the rails or we'll shoot.

46
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,812
Shoot the traitors!

47
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:07,648
Prepare to disembark!

48
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:20,189
Come on, come on! Move!

49
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:25,735
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

50
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:30,730
Move or you'll be shot!

51
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:48,982
Over here, stretcher.

52
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:56,899
- The one with the rifle shoots.
-One out of two gets a rifle.

53
00:09:57,112 --> 00:10:02,107
The one without follows him.
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

54
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:09,234
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

55
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:14,278
The one with the rifle shoots.

56
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,987
The one without follows him.

57
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:21,528
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

58
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,524
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

59
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:32,607
The one with the rifle shoots.

60
00:10:57,197 --> 00:11:00,447
<i>Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,</i>

61
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:05,442
<i>from now on,
it is either victory or death.</i>

62
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,030
- Those <i>who</i> retreat...
-I need a rifle.

63
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,821
<i>-...will be shot.
-I need a rifle.</i>

64
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:14,817
<i>There will be no mercy
for cowards and traitors.</i>

65
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:08,283
It's hopeless, Comrades. Get back.

66
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,950
Fall back! Fall back!

67
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:15,367
It's no good. Get back. Get back.

68
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:20,362
In the name of the Soviet Union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot!

69
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:26,825
- No retreat. Not a step back.
-No mercy.

70
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,701
Deserters will be shot.

71
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:33,696
- Fire!
-Fire!

72
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:41,112
No mercy for cowards.

73
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,744
<i>Russians, surrender.</i>

74
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:22,739
<i>You will see your home again.
This is not your war.</i>

75
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:27,826
<i>Join your German comrades.
They understand your suffering</i>

76
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,701
<i>and will care more for you
than your own officers,</i>

77
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:36,699
<i>who are only sending you to your death.
The Third Reich is not your enemy.</i>

78
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:42,950
<i>The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his Bolshevik gang...</i>

79
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:13,907
Fire!

80
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,072
You'll get us caught,
Comrade Commissar.

81
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:39,369
With your permission,
Comrade Commissar.

82
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,791
Which one do you think
I should I aim at first?

83
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:16,785
You should wait till there's an explosion.

84
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:32,577
- Do you know how to shoot?
-A little.

85
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:00,079
Damn!

86
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:28,080
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

87
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,956
Thank you, Comrade Commissar.

88
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:45,250
Danilov. Political officer,
second class, 21st infantry.

89
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:09,833
Vassili Zaitsev.

90
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:14,831
On this day, September 20th, 1942,
a young shepherd boy from the Urals

91
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,754
arrived in the city of Stalingrad
on the banks of the Volga.

92
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:28,748
His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

93
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:33,748
Like thousands before him, he came
to answer Comrade Stalin's call.

94
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,127
Armed only with a rifle, he quickly
made the fascist invader realize

95
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:43,123
that from now on he would be punished
for every step he took in the motherland,

96
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:48,458
that from here on
the only way was back.

97
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,339
What do you think?

98
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,333
I think Comrade Commissar
has been overgenerous.

99
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:18,208
Let me go!

100
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:27,083
By order of Comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

101
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:30,630
Get back there!

102
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:32,339
Move back!

103
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,333
Stand away, or we will open fire.

104
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,673
Stand away!

105
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,294
Keep back!

106
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:52,796
Get back or we shoot.

107
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:55,419
Back! Keep back, there!

108
00:22:55,421 --> 00:23:00,418
Make way for Comrade Stalin's envoy.

109
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:08,669
I carried out my orders.
I sent in all of my boys.

110
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,839
But the Germans engulfed us.

111
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,169
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

112
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:22,129
- And me, what did I have?
-A sacred duty to resist.

113
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,506
I have to report to the boss.

114
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:31,504
Perhaps you would prefer
to avoid the red tape.

115
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:57,583
My name is
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev.

116
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:03,798
I've come to take things in hand here.

117
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,794
This city is not Kursk,
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

118
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:15,173
This city is Stalingrad.

119
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:19,131
Stalingrad!

120
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:24,129
This city bears the name of the boss.
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

121
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:30,338
If the Germans capture this city,

122
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:34,756
the entire country will collapse.

123
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:39,754
Now, I want our boys
to raise their heads.

124
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:45,675
I want them to act like they have balls.

125
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:50,669
I want them to stop shitting their pants.

126
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:56,342
That's your job.

127
00:24:56,342 --> 00:25:01,339
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

128
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:09,339
You, what's your suggestion?

129
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:14,338
Shoot all the other generals who have
retreated and their chiefs of staff, too.

130
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:19,006
Make some examples.
Deport the families of the deserters...

131
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:21,217
That's all been done.

132
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:26,214
Give them hope.

133
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,677
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

134
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:43,008
But there's another way,
a way of courage.

135
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:45,383
A way of love of the motherland.

136
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:48,716
We must publish the army newspaper
again, we must tell magnificent stories,

137
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,551
stories that exalt sacrifice, bravery.

138
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,051
We must make them believe
in a victory.

139
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:59,050
We must give them hope, pride,
a desire to fight.

140
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,717
Yes.

141
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:05,342
We need to make examples,
but examples to follow.

142
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:10,341
What we need are heroes.

143
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,636
Do you know any heroes around here?

144
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:21,631
Yes, Comrade. I know one.

145
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:31,506
That's me. Vassili Zaitsev. That's me.

146
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:35,553
No, you're not dreaming. It's your name.

147
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,678
We made the front page.

148
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,678
They haven't changed a word.

149
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,303
Do you have any idea what this means?

150
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,679
It's not the back page.
It's not the second page.

151
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,138
-It's the front page. The front page!
-Front page.

152
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,217
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere,

153
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:56,512
in the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

154
00:26:56,513 --> 00:27:00,178
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

155
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:03,512
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

156
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:06,638
We're famous, Vassili.
Khrushchev loved the article.

157
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,178
He's promoted me to the general staff

158
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,175
and you to sniper division.

159
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,217
- Well, that's good.
-it's very good.

160
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,219
- It's very good. It's great!
-it's very great!

161
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,513
- It's great!
-it's great!

162
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:23,346
It's great for both of us
because we did it together. Together.

163
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:25,389
Well, now, admittedly,
I did all the hard work.

164
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:26,971
You know, you're very lucky
I can't fight back.

165
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,844
- Why's that?
-Because Khrushchev told me

166
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,178
to make sure nothing happens to you.

167
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,971
- You're too important.
-I'm too valuable.

168
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:35,219
Yes. Careful of my glasses, please,
they're new.

169
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:38,971
Sorry, sir.

170
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,387
- I'm famous.
-I'm famous.

171
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,012
- We're famous.
-I'm famous.

172
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:44,344
<i>Vassili, the young shepherd
from the Urals,</i>

173
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:46,138
<i>killed his 12th German officer today.</i>

174
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:48,346
<i>Used to hunt wolves,
now he shoots fascists.</i>

175
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:51,013
<i>- Today Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd...
-One more colonel shot by...</i>

176
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:52,513
<i>He is an example to us all.</i>

177
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:57,511
<i>Today Vassili Zaitsev
killed his 32nd general.</i>

178
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,473
<i>...thirty-sixth German officer...</i>

179
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:04,719
...the Germans you have killed?
Today Vassili Zaitsev killed...

180
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:09,716
<i>...eleven dog tags retrieved
by sniper Vassili Zaitsev...</i>

181
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:14,469
<i>More and more men and women,</i>

182
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,514
<i>fighters from all branches
of our armed forces,</i>

183
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:21,511
<i>volunteer to join the sniper division
and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.</i>

184
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:30,511
I am a stone.

185
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,679
I am a stone.

186
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,677
I breathe slowly.

187
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:48,969
I aim at the eye.

188
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,848
So it is you.

189
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:22,390
The great Vassili Zaitsev.

190
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,889
My mother makes the best potatoes
and bacon in town.

191
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,054
Sounds good.

192
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:30,640
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

193
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:35,015
- How many today?
-Only two.

194
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,515
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

195
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:42,512
He was only a foot soldier.
It wasn't worth giving away my position.

196
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,390
Bless you.

197
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,390
We know how much we owe you.

198
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,640
We pray for you every day.

199
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:57,638
Every evening we listen to them
talk about you on Radio Moscow.

200
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,556
Thanks.

201
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,056
You've certainly managed well
down here.

202
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:05,681
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

203
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:09,015
Sacha, drop that right now.

204
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:14,014
It's loaded.

205
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:24,719
- This way, Comrade Commissar.
-Thank you, Comrade.

206
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:30,637
Good evening.

207
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:35,721
Comrade Zaitsev.

208
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:41,851
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

209
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:46,642
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

210
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,685
This one's from the workers
of the Kuzbass.

211
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:51,476
They want to name their mine
after Vassili.

212
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:55,351
Right, let's start with the miners.

213
00:30:55,351 --> 00:31:00,346
Come on, let's get to work.

214
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,476
- Dear Comrades from the Kuzbass...
-Kuzbass.

215
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:08,808
...I thank you for your letter of praise.

216
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,804
- Praise?
-R-A-I-S-E.

217
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:17,977
And

218
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:21,686
I hope that I can live up
to your expectations.

219
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,517
A-T-I-O-N-S.

220
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,477
Expectations.

221
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:33,474
You're interested in German literature,
Mrs. Filipov?

222
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:37,186
It's all right. It's our neighbor.

223
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,521
Right. Where were we?

224
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:43,514
- Tania, we have guests.
-Expectations. Your offer to name...

225
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:57,519
I recognize you.

226
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:02,515
It's Vassili Zaitsev.

227
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:08,015
I saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.

228
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:13,019
- And this is his friend, Commissar...
-Danilov.

229
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:15,019
Danilov.

230
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:16,771
Tania's like a daughter to me.

231
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:19,769
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

232
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,187
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

233
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:26,187
- They're yours?
-She studied German at the university.

234
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:31,179
- Which university?
-Moscow.

235
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:39,015
Moscow.

236
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:44,183
- Shouldn't we...
-Yes, let's continue.

237
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:50,101
Your offer to name your mine
after me is

238
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,852
a great honor.

239
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:58,852
H-O-N.

240
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:03,522
- Yes, I know, honor.
-Very good.

241
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:08,517
Shouldn't we try and make the point
that I'm not the only one fighting?

242
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,398
That's an excellent idea, Vassili.
Excellent.

243
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:17,021
We can take it even further, though.
Yeah, we can take it further.

244
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:22,015
Your battle for the production of coal
is as worthy as mine.

245
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:30,023
There's no "K" in coal.

246
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:32,937
Just one

247
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,852
That's it.

248
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,397
Tell me if I'm going too fast.

249
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,523
- No, you're not going too fast.
-Are you sure?

250
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:42,602
I just thought...
ls there any other improvements?

251
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:46,854
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

252
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:50,852
We should carry on. We're not tired.
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.

253
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:55,729
These people took the trouble
to write to us.

254
00:33:55,731 --> 00:34:00,727
Tomorrow, we may not be around
to write back.

255
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,603
I was expecting someone else.

256
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:43,360
Certainly not someone so prestigious.
I imagine you have your reasons

257
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,353
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

258
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:54,735
My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.

259
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,025
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote 25 sergeants

260
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:02,857
to replace the officers shot down
by their sharpshooters.

261
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,360
Those snipers are demoralizing
my people.

262
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,353
This city is no more
than a heap of ruins.

263
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,732
But the fuhrer's persisting.

264
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:23,730
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

265
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:31,860
We should trust the Fuhrer's instinct.

266
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:36,855
He always managed
to lead us to victory.

267
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:42,438
We shall be back home for Christmas.

268
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:49,063
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

269
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:54,355
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

270
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,192
Vassili! Vassili!

271
00:36:58,192 --> 00:37:01,070
- Come on! Time to get up.
-What?

272
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,775
They have a problem in the
department store sector.

273
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:07,773
They need us. Come on.

274
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:19,438
Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store, over there.

275
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:29,105
So far this morning, he's knocked off
five officers plus two machine gunners.

276
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:35,025
Look! Third floor.

277
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:40,025
- Fourth window from the left.
-Fourth window from the left.

278
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,277
See him?

279
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:51,273
Yeah, I see him.

280
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:05,025
- There, you got him!
-Great shot.

281
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:12,690
Let's go get his dog tag.

282
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:15,945
Goodbye, Comrade Commissar.

283
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:20,940
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Filipov.

284
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:29,902
You can borrow whatever you like.

285
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:33,362
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters

286
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:36,860
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

287
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:39,570
There's some Marx, too.

288
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,362
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

289
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,114
No, I volunteered.

290
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,570
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

291
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:49,612
Comrade Khrushchev was telling me
just yesterday

292
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:52,529
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

293
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:56,862
I can't. Our militia is responsible for
all the people in this neighborhood.

294
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:58,195
We're already desperately short of men.

295
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,362
We can take care of that.

296
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:01,570
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

297
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,362
I'd rather stay and fight.

298
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:08,360
Serving the headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

299
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,904
You stay here. You cover us.

300
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:15,697
- All right.
-We go.

301
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:20,695
Take care.

302
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:26,860
Ludmilla, come on.

303
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:20,527
Take the stairway.

304
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:12,237
- It's a trap.
-I know.

305
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:40,907
Move back.

306
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:31,491
He's still here.

307
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:56,616
- They're coming straight for us.
-Ludmilla, stay where you are.

308
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:01,864
He's over there somewhere.

309
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:14,413
We have to get out of here!

310
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:19,409
- We have to get out of here!
-Just stay where you are!

311
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:26,909
- What are we gonna do?
-Ludmilla, stay where you are!

312
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:41,788
Fuck this, I'm going.

313
00:44:41,788 --> 00:44:46,784
Ludmilla, no!

314
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:40,456
What does this mean?

315
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,456
"A little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle.

316
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:48,206
"A Mosin Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-power PU telescope,

317
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:52,038
"pride of precision of Soviet production."

318
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,538
- I've seen that rifle close up.
-Have you?

319
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,831
I even touched it.

320
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:01,826
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

321
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:52,623
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today.

322
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:56,000
- And it was my fault.
-No. I'm sure that's not true.

323
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:58,958
There was a German sniper.

324
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:02,333
I walked them right into his trap.

325
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:05,000
- What else can you tell me?
-He didn't relocate.

326
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,996
A sniper who doesn't relocate
isn't normal.

327
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,208
He was very good.

328
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:17,875
It wasn't just his shooting,
it was his instinct.

329
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,793
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

330
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:24,378
That's because
he knows everything about you.

331
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:29,371
His name is Konig. Major Konig.
They've sent him here to...

332
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:37,663
To find you.

333
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:44,333
At first, we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

334
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:47,460
It seems he's come all the way
from Berlin to stop you.

335
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,793
You've caused them
so many sleepless nights,

336
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:50,125
they've sent their top marksman
after you.

337
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:55,121
- So, what do we know about him?
-He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

338
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:59,210
He's director of their sniper school
in Zossen.

339
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,710
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

340
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,703
He knows all his tricks. From now on
he'll go with you everywhere.

341
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,293
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer

342
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:14,625
against the shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

343
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:19,623
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

344
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,503
It's the essence of class struggle.

345
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:27,625
I'm glad you're so happy.

346
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:31,710
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

347
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,706
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

348
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:47,378
She's been transferred.

349
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:52,373
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

350
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:55,378
Hello.

351
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:59,210
You look very smart
in your new uniform.

352
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,837
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

353
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,833
They probably will.

354
00:49:08,297 --> 00:49:11,960
I've heard the rumor
about the German.

355
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:16,003
- And I wanted to wish you luck.
-Thank you. I'll need it.

356
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:20,998
From what Comrade Danilov tells me,
you're going to win.

357
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,543
It's time.

358
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:29,710
Vassili?

359
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:33,835
- Vassili? Vassili?
-Come to my arms.

360
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:38,712
Look in my direction, here.
Here, Vassili.

361
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:40,545
Put your cap back on.
You'll look more heroic.

362
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,045
- This way, Comrade Zaitsev.
-I love this little fellow.

363
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:45,505
Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?

364
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:46,837
- Vassili?
-Vassili?

365
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,965
How old are you, Vassili?

366
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:49,797
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

367
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:51,880
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

368
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,793
Vassili, tell us, how many fascists
have you killed today?

369
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:56,168
Are you proud to be challenged
by the best sharpshooter in Germany?

370
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,128
It's a sign the Germans
are starting to shit their pants.

371
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,295
Go on, my boy, tell us
how are you going to deal with him?

372
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:04,212
- Or rather, no.
-One more question, please.

373
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:06,505
Tell it to the boss.

374
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:11,503
He likes good hunting stories.

375
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,875
Look at him with pride,
because he's looking at you.

376
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:25,500
The whole country is looking at you.

377
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,875
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

378
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:27,168
So it's not the wolf that chooses
the hunting ground, but the hunter.

379
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:36,128
And I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

380
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:43,128
Except, in this case, I'm the game.

381
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:51,835
However, today what we're going to do
is lure the wolf out of his lair

382
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:57,045
to where we want him to be.

383
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:37,467
You're the one whose life is valuable,
you go first.

384
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:39,677
No. No. We take it in turns.

385
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:44,670
Next time it's your turn to go first.
And then it's you, Volodya.

386
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:04,880
Son of a bitch!

387
00:53:06,177 --> 00:53:11,170
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

388
00:53:15,884 --> 00:53:19,884
Sixteen months I spent in Germany
at the school in Zossen.

389
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:23,802
Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts.

390
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:28,797
When our Joseph and their Adolf
were walking hand in hand.

391
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:37,380
From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?

392
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,884
- Hundred and fifty-five.
-Whatever.

393
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:47,384
That'll make them send out a repair guy.

394
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:52,382
Let's relocate.

395
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:15,380
Hey, Volodya.

396
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:27,382
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't
the same atmosphere anymore.

397
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:32,052
They threw my arse in prison.

398
00:54:32,054 --> 00:54:34,804
"What were you doing in Germany?"

399
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:39,637
"Excuse me," says I, "but it was
Comrade Stalin who sent me there."

400
00:54:39,637 --> 00:54:44,219
"Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

401
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:47,469
"Confess, spy bastard, confess."

402
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:52,465
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

403
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:58,554
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

404
00:54:58,554 --> 00:55:03,549
And bang, it knocked out all my teeth.

405
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:08,679
That's right, boy, have no illusions.

406
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:13,674
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

407
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:21,014
Hey, it's your repair guy.

408
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:26,009
I got him.

409
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:41,387
- It's about soup time, isn't it?
-I'm going.

410
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:44,469
Well, get a move on, Volodya.

411
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:49,467
And try not to spill it all
on your way back, you Marxist bastard.

412
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:03,887
Here's the enemy sniper activity

413
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:08,884
reported during
the past 24 hours, Major.

414
00:56:09,764 --> 00:56:12,554
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector,

415
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:15,391
one artillery observer
in the northern sector,

416
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:19,431
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer
division in the factory sector,

417
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:22,596
three telephone repair men
in the workers' housing sector.

418
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:27,264
They also tell me we've just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

419
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:31,556
- I hope he's still able to speak.
-Excuse me, sir?

420
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:36,389
Nothing. Thank you.

421
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:39,389
So tell us, Volodya.

422
00:56:39,391 --> 00:56:44,387
Which building is he in?

423
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:48,221
There is no way I know that.

424
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:50,764
He moves around all the time.

425
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:55,599
- He jumps from one to the next.
-On which floor?

426
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,594
- I don't know.
-We'll see about that.

427
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,306
Undress him.

428
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:08,304
Put him in one of our uniforms.

429
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:37,516
You see? They're stubborn.

430
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:40,558
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

431
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:45,554
Man, you got to admit,
when they get an idea in their heads...

432
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:02,101
Right.

433
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:07,094
- Let's see if our customer has arrived.
-You ready?

434
00:58:09,476 --> 00:58:13,351
And now, our famous shepherd
from the Urals

435
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:18,346
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot, gets
up to make sure he has hit his target.

436
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:24,304
Major Konig sees him,

437
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:28,099
aims for his helmet,

438
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:32,391
fires, reveals his position,

439
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:37,389
and is shot in turn.

440
00:58:45,143 --> 00:58:50,139
Except Major Konig doesn't fire,

441
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:57,971
because Major Konig isn't there.

442
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:04,431
Koulikov?

443
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:10,808
Don't you think that was strange?
That last one?

444
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:14,393
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

445
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:16,101
It's not natural.

446
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:21,099
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

447
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:24,976
No. No, I'm the one who was stupid.

448
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,395
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

449
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:29,936
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.

450
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:33,768
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

451
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:38,764
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.

452
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:49,893
Whose turn is it?

453
00:59:49,893 --> 00:59:52,978
Mine, I think.

454
00:59:52,978 --> 00:59:56,438
You're such a cheater.

455
00:59:56,438 --> 01:00:01,431
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.
No, no, no. It's my turn to go first.

456
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:10,141
And it's your turn
to get a hole in your breeches.

457
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:29,058
To victory.

458
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:38,063
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

459
01:01:38,063 --> 01:01:43,023
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

460
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:45,398
He's probing, Comrade Khrushchev.

461
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:47,855
He's testing the German
for weaknesses.

462
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:52,525
He's meticulous in his preparation.

463
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:57,518
Vodka is a luxury we have.

464
01:01:57,565 --> 01:02:00,813
Caviar is a luxury we have.

465
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:03,813
Time is not.

466
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:08,811
He's aware of that,
Comrade Khrushchev, we both are.

467
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,315
I assure you he will succeed.

468
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:16,311
Good. it seems your destinies
are entwined.

469
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,393
They're keeping you busy?

470
01:02:46,815 --> 01:02:50,107
I picked this up from the kitchen.
It's from the reception the other day.

471
01:02:50,107 --> 01:02:54,732
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

472
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:57,650
She'll be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

473
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:01,232
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

474
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:03,900
You're Jewish, aren't you?

475
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,775
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

476
01:03:08,775 --> 01:03:12,773
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

477
01:03:12,773 --> 01:03:15,065
You mean the war?

478
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:18,940
He understood
that the hatred of the Jews ran deep.

479
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:23,232
He was saving up
to buy some land in Palestine.

480
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:27,607
He said it was the only land
that we truly belonged in.

481
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,567
The only land we had a duty to defend.

482
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:35,650
He insisted I learn to use a rifle.

483
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:40,645
I learn to shoot.

484
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:46,645
I know that in times of war
personal feelings should be put aside,

485
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,735
-but I have a favor to ask you.
-Of course. Anything you want.

486
01:03:51,735 --> 01:03:56,728
I want to be reassigned.

487
01:03:56,735 --> 01:04:01,728
What's happened, Tania?

488
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:28,938
He shot him.

489
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,150
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

490
01:04:34,152 --> 01:04:36,650
Shot him on the run.

491
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:41,112
It was an impossible shot.
I've never seen anything like it.

492
01:04:41,112 --> 01:04:46,105
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

493
01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:49,067
I don't stand a chance against this man.

494
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:52,735
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

495
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:56,567
What if I told you we've found
a way to track his movements?

496
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,900
We've got someone, Vassili.

497
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:01,900
Someone close to him
passing us information.

498
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:06,898
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

499
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:12,065
I promise.

500
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:22,067
Now I have a favor to ask.

501
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:26,902
From me?

502
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:31,900
It's about Tania.

503
01:05:34,154 --> 01:05:39,150
Come in.

504
01:05:41,322 --> 01:05:43,320
He doesn't even know you exist,

505
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,987
but at that moment you're closer to him
than anyone else on Earth.

506
01:05:46,987 --> 01:05:50,279
You see his face through the sight.

507
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,737
You see whether
he shaved that morning or not.

508
01:05:52,737 --> 01:05:54,237
You can see whether he's married by,

509
01:05:54,237 --> 01:05:58,904
you know, whether
he has a wedding ring on.

510
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:03,898
It's not like just firing at a distant shape.
It's not just a uniform. It's a man's face.

511
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:11,070
Those faces don't go away.

512
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:16,065
They come back
and they get replaced by more faces.

513
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:19,737
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

514
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:23,777
He likes you very much. I think
he'd try anything to change your mind.

515
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,570
Did he tell you why
I asked for the transfer?

516
01:06:26,572 --> 01:06:27,947
No.

517
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:31,404
This morning a list arrived
at headquarters.

518
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,822
It was a list of civilians
who'd been rounded up

519
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:39,817
and sent to Germany in a convoy
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

520
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:45,572
My parents were amongst them.

521
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:47,282
After 30 kilometers,

522
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:52,275
the German soldiers stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

523
01:06:55,904 --> 01:07:00,404
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

524
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:03,362
two by two.

525
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:05,904
Mothers with daughters.

526
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:09,947
Husbands and wives.

527
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:14,114
They lined them up against the railing.

528
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:19,110
And then they fired a single shot
at each pair to save bullets.

529
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:23,447
It worked.

530
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:28,442
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

531
01:07:31,574 --> 01:07:34,864
I know they died together.

532
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:39,860
They would never have let themselves
be separated.

533
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:57,987
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good rifle.

534
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:11,317
Thank you.

535
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:42,153
I know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.

536
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:47,153
The tractor factory is big.

537
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:49,194
I know exactly where.

538
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,613
He crawls through a gutter
under a grate where the vats are.

539
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:56,238
Then he goes out from the workshop.

540
01:08:56,241 --> 01:08:58,698
In between the two
there's a place where he's in the open.

541
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:03,694
It's under a long iron foot walk.

542
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:40,737
Good luck, Comrade.

543
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:27,657
I know exactly
where he's waiting for me.

544
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:33,575
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.
We'll take him out from behind.

545
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:58,700
We'll get to the other end of
the workshop through these pipes.

546
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:04,159
Follow me.

547
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:52,035
- You go that way. I'll go around this way.
-Okay.

548
01:14:08,373 --> 01:14:13,369
Shit!

549
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:21,373
- It's okay.
-You should go back.

550
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,291
- No.
-Go back.

551
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:28,286
<i>- I'll</i> be all right.
-No, you go!

552
01:14:31,293 --> 01:14:36,288
Keep your legs in.

553
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:21,038
Come on. Come on. Come on.

554
01:16:19,251 --> 01:16:23,085
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort.

555
01:16:23,085 --> 01:16:25,087
The fate of the motherland is at risk.

556
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,754
The fate of all those
you love and cherish.

557
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:31,587
It's for them that we fight today.

558
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,918
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

559
01:16:35,919 --> 01:16:39,251
If they're lucky, one in ten of these
soldiers will come back alive.

560
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:41,918
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

561
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:45,376
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

562
01:16:45,379 --> 01:16:49,376
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

563
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:51,754
You have a duty to survive.

564
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:54,420
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
That's what he knows.

565
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,419
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

566
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:03,416
If Vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

567
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:09,540
Where is he? Where's Vassili?

568
01:18:14,922 --> 01:18:16,420
Keep your head down.

569
01:18:16,423 --> 01:18:18,422
- Tell me where he is.
-Stay into that pipe.

570
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:23,416
Tania, stay in. Stay in. Get your head in.

571
01:18:29,089 --> 01:18:31,422
Slow down.

572
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:36,418
Don't shoot.

573
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:44,085
He's over there.

574
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:58,418
You see the pillar in front of you?

575
01:18:58,423 --> 01:19:03,418
I need you to move round behind it.

576
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:14,423
Go!

577
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:19,420
Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.

578
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:25,214
Piece of glass.

579
01:19:25,215 --> 01:19:28,590
You see the kiln?

580
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:33,587
Behind me, to the left of the factory.

581
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,465
- Yes? I can't hear you.
-Yes.

582
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:39,715
Yes.

583
01:19:39,717 --> 01:19:44,712
Do you see the two louvers?

584
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:47,090
Yes.

585
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:52,087
Do you see the one
with the broken slat?

586
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:57,420
- Yes.
-This is what I want you to do.

587
01:20:03,468 --> 01:20:06,715
- Are you ready?
-Yes.

588
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:11,712
Three, two, one.

589
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:34,130
Hello, Sacha.

590
01:20:37,759 --> 01:20:41,258
He was right where you said he'd be.

591
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:46,255
Nearly there.

592
01:20:46,802 --> 01:20:51,795
He's very clever.

593
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:58,713
Tell me about him.

594
01:21:02,134 --> 01:21:06,968
Why was it his grandfather who taught
him how to shoot and not his father?

595
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:11,964
His father's dead. His mother, too.

596
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:18,547
- Does he talk about his father?
-No, he didn't know him.

597
01:21:20,135 --> 01:21:22,052
Did he go to school?

598
01:21:22,053 --> 01:21:27,047
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

599
01:21:27,427 --> 01:21:31,592
- Is it girls who write to him?
-Everyone writes to him.

600
01:21:31,594 --> 01:21:33,802
And is there a girl
he loves in his village?

601
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:37,927
- Not in his village. Here!
-Does she love him?

602
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:42,218
Yes. Because he's handsome,
because he's brave.

603
01:21:42,219 --> 01:21:43,927
And she's very beautiful.

604
01:21:43,928 --> 01:21:46,135
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

605
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:49,760
She went to the university.
They are handsome together.

606
01:21:49,764 --> 01:21:54,757
Later the two of them will get married.

607
01:21:57,635 --> 01:22:01,633
At least, I think so.

608
01:22:01,635 --> 01:22:06,632
And you, Sacha,
why are you helping the Germans?

609
01:22:10,804 --> 01:22:14,594
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

610
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:19,590
And because you like chocolate.

611
01:22:34,096 --> 01:22:37,053
All these people here
know they're gonna die,

612
01:22:37,054 --> 01:22:42,049
so each night
when they make it back, it's a bonus.

613
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:45,885
Excuse me!

614
01:22:45,889 --> 01:22:50,883
So every cup of tea, every cigarette,

615
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:53,764
becomes a little celebration.

616
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:58,429
Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.

617
01:22:58,429 --> 01:23:02,927
It's just something
you have to accept here.

618
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:07,924
Everyone has their time.

619
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:13,304
In the forest,
the wolf lives for three years,

620
01:23:13,304 --> 01:23:18,302
the donkey for nine.

621
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:21,929
Sorry, but that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

622
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:24,054
It makes no sense to me whatsoever!

623
01:23:24,056 --> 01:23:28,264
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

624
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:29,428
It makes absolute sense.

625
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:34,427
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.

626
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:38,179
So,

627
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:42,972
I'm a donkey.

628
01:23:42,973 --> 01:23:47,968
People like you and Danilov
have to survive this.

629
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:53,096
People who've read books,
had an education.

630
01:23:53,097 --> 01:23:58,092
- We'll need you when the war's over.
-And if you survive?

631
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:02,472
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

632
01:24:02,473 --> 01:24:05,764
I want to work in a factory.

633
01:24:05,764 --> 01:24:10,348
My granddad took me to a factory once.

634
01:24:10,349 --> 01:24:15,344
There was this man there
high up on a foot walk.

635
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:20,848
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

636
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,264
The people he was supervising over,
they didn't really understand

637
01:24:24,266 --> 01:24:27,264
what they were doing,
but for him up there

638
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:30,139
it was simple, it was clear.

639
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:35,135
And I thought,
"One day, I could be that man."

640
01:24:41,098 --> 01:24:46,094
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

641
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:50,764
Why shouldn't it?

642
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:54,639
You'll outlive us all.

643
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,635
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

644
01:25:14,516 --> 01:25:17,683
One hundred and fifty meters stand
between the Germans and the Volga.

645
01:25:17,684 --> 01:25:19,683
Today the whole world is watching
these 150 meters.

646
01:25:19,683 --> 01:25:24,678
They are
what make Stalingrad the capital

647
01:25:25,309 --> 01:25:30,304
of the war.

648
01:25:32,184 --> 01:25:36,099
Your friend, Tania.

649
01:25:36,099 --> 01:25:38,266
Have you seen her?

650
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:42,098
She stays over there now
with the snipers.

651
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:44,141
Tell the major we're sending in
all our sharpshooters

652
01:25:44,142 --> 01:25:49,139
to support the attack on the factory.

653
01:25:50,143 --> 01:25:55,139
Tell him Vassili will be there.

654
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:47,894
- I need to talk to you.
-Sure.

655
01:29:49,982 --> 01:29:54,976
Danilov.

656
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:09,559
You have to stop writing about me.

657
01:30:10,607 --> 01:30:13,356
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

658
01:30:13,358 --> 01:30:17,065
Sooner or later he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

659
01:30:17,066 --> 01:30:21,732
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

660
01:30:21,732 --> 01:30:26,397
This time it's different.

661
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:31,394
You've built me up and up
into someone I'm not.

662
01:30:33,732 --> 01:30:38,107
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I want to fight.

663
01:30:38,108 --> 01:30:42,982
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

664
01:30:42,983 --> 01:30:44,690
I understand.

665
01:30:44,691 --> 01:30:47,191
The thing is, Vassili,
you're not a regular soldier,

666
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:52,188
-you're an extraordinary soldier.
-No. I'm what you've made me.

667
01:30:52,525 --> 01:30:57,519
Nothing more.

668
01:30:59,318 --> 01:31:02,776
Why are you telling me this now?

669
01:31:02,777 --> 01:31:07,769
What's happened?

670
01:31:08,523 --> 01:31:13,519
What's changed?

671
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:19,483
Did you speak to Tania for me?

672
01:31:19,483 --> 01:31:21,025
Yes.

673
01:31:21,026 --> 01:31:26,022
Well, will she reconsider?

674
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:32,233
I don't know.

675
01:31:32,233 --> 01:31:35,566
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should. You know that.

676
01:31:35,568 --> 01:31:36,691
Yeah.

677
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:39,650
It'll be easier to get her reassigned
than you.

678
01:31:39,651 --> 01:31:42,442
You see, the Germans are preparing
another offensive in the city centre.

679
01:31:42,443 --> 01:31:44,691
The propaganda battle's crucial
for morale.

680
01:31:44,693 --> 01:31:49,688
We need you more than ever.
Sacha? Hold on. Sacha?

681
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:55,900
- Tell him what you know, Sacha.
-Hello, Sacha.

682
01:31:55,901 --> 01:31:57,858
There was dust on the major's boots.

683
01:31:57,858 --> 01:32:02,401
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

684
01:32:02,402 --> 01:32:05,401
I don't need to tell you
the risks he's taking.

685
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:06,777
The dust was yellow.

686
01:32:06,777 --> 01:32:09,110
There's only one place
where there's dust like that.

687
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:14,105
In the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap along the tracks.

688
01:32:15,236 --> 01:32:17,235
Well done.

689
01:32:17,236 --> 01:32:22,228
Sacha, wait for me outside then.

690
01:32:28,235 --> 01:32:33,231
Danilov, you had no right to use him.

691
01:32:34,904 --> 01:32:39,898
No, I didn't use him, Vassili.
He did it of his own accord.

692
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:45,523
Do you know why?
Because he believes in you!

693
01:32:52,362 --> 01:32:56,110
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
take back the chemical factory.

694
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:59,902
Sacha has informed the major
you'll be there.

695
01:32:59,904 --> 01:33:02,110
So now you know
where you have to wait for him.

696
01:33:02,111 --> 01:33:05,527
- In the middle of an assault.
-I'm following orders.

697
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:09,318
I suggest you do the same.

698
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:14,315
Now, I'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine.

699
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:24,523
Comrade.

700
01:33:48,072 --> 01:33:51,447
That's the Germans up there.
Yesterday, it was the Russians.

701
01:33:51,447 --> 01:33:55,697
We're not very far now.

702
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:58,568
Sacha,

703
01:33:58,572 --> 01:34:02,279
you're playing a very dangerous game.

704
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,404
I want you to win.

705
01:34:05,405 --> 01:34:08,822
See there? Keep going along the river.

706
01:34:08,822 --> 01:34:13,817
It's safe for a while.

707
01:38:49,788 --> 01:38:52,077
He's dead.

708
01:38:52,077 --> 01:38:56,871
We found this on his corpse.

709
01:38:56,871 --> 01:39:00,744
Your reason for being here
has ceased to exist.

710
01:39:00,746 --> 01:39:04,077
Pardon me, <i>Herr</i> General.

711
01:39:04,077 --> 01:39:05,286
But I do not believe...

712
01:39:05,288 --> 01:39:10,282
There's a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

713
01:39:13,288 --> 01:39:18,282
Until then I must ask you
for your dog tags.

714
01:39:18,371 --> 01:39:22,077
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

715
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,952
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

716
01:39:24,952 --> 01:39:29,950
You've already had a near miss.

717
01:39:36,163 --> 01:39:39,161
Also, please take this war merit cross.

718
01:39:39,163 --> 01:39:41,163
It was awarded posthumously
to a lieutenant

719
01:39:41,163 --> 01:39:42,913
of the 116th infantry division,

720
01:39:42,913 --> 01:39:47,907
who fell here
during the first days of the battle.

721
01:39:47,913 --> 01:39:52,288
He was my son.

722
01:39:52,288 --> 01:39:57,282
If the landing is captured,
everything's lost.

723
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:02,950
Come here.

724
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:04,871
What did <i>I</i> tell you?

725
01:40:04,871 --> 01:40:07,621
You've been playing your fiddle
too much.

726
01:40:07,623 --> 01:40:11,413
If it's confirmed that he's dead,
we're sunk.

727
01:40:11,413 --> 01:40:14,246
- Well, you're sunk.
-it isn't true.

728
01:40:14,246 --> 01:40:17,121
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

729
01:40:17,123 --> 01:40:20,871
What do they have to do?
Dangle his body in front of our men?

730
01:40:20,873 --> 01:40:23,288
They're lying-

731
01:40:23,288 --> 01:40:25,038
That's good.

732
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,580
Very good.

733
01:40:27,581 --> 01:40:31,202
Write it then.
Vassili Zaitsev is not dead!

734
01:40:31,206 --> 01:40:33,746
This is what he had for breakfast
this morning.

735
01:40:33,746 --> 01:40:36,998
This is a picture of him
reading today's newspaper.

736
01:40:36,999 --> 01:40:38,664
You're the poet.

737
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:42,956
What? You won't give up the riverbank.

738
01:40:42,956 --> 01:40:46,123
I don't care if you've lost half your men.

739
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:51,119
Lose the other half or lose yourself!

740
01:40:55,373 --> 01:41:00,164
Is he back?

741
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:02,748
He should be back soon.

742
01:41:02,749 --> 01:41:07,744
The German attack cut the lines,
that's why he's late.

743
01:41:09,583 --> 01:41:14,577
Can we go outside?

744
01:41:17,624 --> 01:41:20,499
I wrote to my mother about you.

745
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,581
She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,

746
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:24,790
if there's anything you needed,
anything at all,

747
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:29,499
our family will be there for you.

748
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:34,496
You know I'm here for you.

749
01:41:36,581 --> 01:41:38,791
They're saying Vassili is dead.

750
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:43,124
<i>Vassili Zaitsev will never see
his loved ones again.</i>

751
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:48,121
<i>Surrender. This is your only hope.</i>

752
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:54,249
You're upset?

753
01:41:54,249 --> 01:41:58,415
Because Zaitsev is dead?

754
01:41:58,416 --> 01:42:02,414
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

755
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:07,411
You're Russian like he is.

756
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:10,124
Don't listen to them.

757
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:13,208
It's just propaganda.

758
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:16,291
He isn't dead.

759
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:19,541
And do you know why?

760
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:24,536
Because I haven't killed him yet.

761
01:42:29,293 --> 01:42:31,958
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

762
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:35,750
Only you,
because I know I can trust you.

763
01:42:35,751 --> 01:42:40,746
But you must swear to me
that you won't tell another soul.

764
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:44,626
You swear?

765
01:42:44,626 --> 01:42:47,416
I found a terrific spot.

766
01:42:47,418 --> 01:42:50,583
It's by the exit from the train station.

767
01:42:50,584 --> 01:42:53,376
I'll hide in the water tower.

768
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:56,916
Tomorrow I'll wait for him there.

769
01:42:56,918 --> 01:43:01,584
You'll see. He'll be there.

770
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:06,581
He always is.

771
01:43:13,376 --> 01:43:14,874
I also want you to swear to me

772
01:43:14,876 --> 01:43:18,666
that from now on you'll stay home
where you belong.

773
01:43:18,668 --> 01:43:21,501
Do you swear?

774
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:26,376
Yes?

775
01:43:26,376 --> 01:43:28,460
Good.

776
01:43:28,462 --> 01:43:30,626
We know he's alive,
we know he won't fail us,

777
01:43:30,626 --> 01:43:32,543
we know because
he is a part of us now.

778
01:43:32,544 --> 01:43:37,043
Vassili is eternal.

779
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:40,876
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

780
01:43:40,876 --> 01:43:44,418
Didn't you hear? I was dead.

781
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:49,413
At least, noble sniper Zaitsev

782
01:43:50,419 --> 01:43:53,337
Vassili was dead.

783
01:43:53,337 --> 01:43:57,626
The real one.

784
01:43:57,626 --> 01:44:00,712
Me.

785
01:44:00,712 --> 01:44:04,835
I was asleep. And I missed my chance.

786
01:44:04,835 --> 01:44:09,831
Then I was curled up in a corner hiding

787
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,751
from a man who wants to kill me.

788
01:44:12,754 --> 01:44:15,087
I'll talk to Khrushchev.

789
01:44:15,088 --> 01:44:18,337
He'll send you back to your old division.

790
01:44:18,337 --> 01:44:21,920
- Where's Tania?
-She's at the shelter.

791
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:26,915
- I've been to the shelter.
-I told her you weren't dead.

792
01:44:28,212 --> 01:44:32,251
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

793
01:44:32,251 --> 01:44:37,249
He told me you were waiting for him
at the station.

794
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:43,666
Vassili.

795
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,712
Vassili.

796
01:45:04,713 --> 01:45:09,708
Vassili.

797
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:16,504
My little Sacha.

798
01:45:16,505 --> 01:45:21,501
I knew it.

799
01:45:36,465 --> 01:45:41,459
- Vassili.
-Tania.

800
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:48,587
I knew you weren't dead.

801
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:53,584
- How?
-Because we've only just met.

802
01:45:56,382 --> 01:46:01,376
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

803
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:05,004
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there

804
01:46:05,005 --> 01:46:10,001
waiting to give me the good news.

805
01:46:10,298 --> 01:46:15,293
I think he loves you even more than I do.

806
01:46:37,508 --> 01:46:39,965
To the proper military authority.

807
01:46:39,965 --> 01:46:41,590
I'm calling to
the commandant's attention,

808
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,632
the recent changes noticed
in the attitude

809
01:46:43,632 --> 01:46:47,508
towards fighting
of soldier, Vassili Zaitsev.

810
01:46:47,509 --> 01:46:51,130
He has attempted, on several
occasions, to escape his duties,

811
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:53,589
voiced doubts
on the chances of our victory,

812
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:56,880
and made defeatist comments in public.

813
01:46:56,882 --> 01:47:01,876
The inexplicable duration of his duel
with a Nazi sharpshooter

814
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:07,126
can only be explained by his lack
of belief in the Communist ideal.

815
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:19,802
Good morning, Sacha.

816
01:47:19,802 --> 01:47:23,508
Once again,
he knew exactly where to find me.

817
01:47:23,508 --> 01:47:26,840
Don't you think that's strange?

818
01:47:26,842 --> 01:47:31,257
Apart from me, only you knew.

819
01:47:31,258 --> 01:47:36,251
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.
You've done a very brave thing.

820
01:47:37,133 --> 01:47:40,173
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

821
01:47:40,173 --> 01:47:42,507
But it isn't my camp.

822
01:47:42,509 --> 01:47:45,092
We're both soldiers.

823
01:47:45,093 --> 01:47:50,008
We're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

824
01:47:50,009 --> 01:47:51,467
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha,

825
01:47:51,468 --> 01:47:55,674
for not staying at home
as I made you swear to do.

826
01:47:55,677 --> 01:48:00,670
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

827
01:48:04,342 --> 01:48:09,338
I've never seen anyone frown
so much in their sleep.

828
01:48:11,592 --> 01:48:16,588
- How long have you been watching me?
-All night.

829
01:48:16,718 --> 01:48:19,592
You've been snoring away happily
for hours.

830
01:48:19,592 --> 01:48:22,633
I don't snore, do I?

831
01:48:22,635 --> 01:48:24,217
Like a pig!

832
01:48:24,219 --> 01:48:29,214
- I suppose I talk in my sleep as well?
-Yes.

833
01:48:31,219 --> 01:48:36,214
There's something I should tell you.

834
01:48:40,967 --> 01:48:45,964
On the train coming here,

835
01:48:47,928 --> 01:48:49,718
we were in the same car.

836
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:51,592
No.

837
01:48:51,594 --> 01:48:54,134
I saw you.

838
01:48:54,134 --> 01:48:59,129
You were reading and you fell asleep.

839
01:49:00,094 --> 01:49:05,089
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

840
01:49:05,427 --> 01:49:10,135
You were scary.

841
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:14,389
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

842
01:49:14,389 --> 01:49:17,593
It made me smile.

843
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:22,588
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you,

844
01:49:24,552 --> 01:49:29,053
who'd make you laugh,

845
01:49:29,054 --> 01:49:34,049
how lucky they were.

846
01:49:34,553 --> 01:49:39,549
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

847
01:49:40,139 --> 01:49:45,130
- Was I snoring?
-Like a pig.

848
01:50:15,804 --> 01:50:20,764
What?

849
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:24,554
Oh, my God!

850
01:50:24,554 --> 01:50:26,014
Tania, no.

851
01:50:26,014 --> 01:50:28,096
- No, get off me!
-Tania, no.

852
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,094
- Get off me!
-it's what he wants.

853
01:50:30,096 --> 01:50:32,054
- Get off me!
-This is what he wants.

854
01:50:32,054 --> 01:50:34,594
- Get off me!
-No. He'll kill you.

855
01:50:34,596 --> 01:50:36,014
- Let me go!
-He'll kill you,

856
01:50:36,014 --> 01:50:37,596
-and then I'll run after you...
-Let me go!

857
01:50:37,596 --> 01:50:39,639
-...and he'll kill me, too.
-Let me go!

858
01:50:39,639 --> 01:50:44,634
This is what he wants. I'll get him.
I promise I'll get him.

859
01:50:45,347 --> 01:50:50,342
I'll get his rifle for you, I promise, Tania.

860
01:51:09,054 --> 01:51:14,052
I need you.

861
01:51:14,139 --> 01:51:17,472
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

862
01:51:17,472 --> 01:51:20,097
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

863
01:51:20,098 --> 01:51:23,346
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

864
01:51:23,348 --> 01:51:24,514
You have to gather your things,

865
01:51:24,514 --> 01:51:26,304
and we'll help you carry them
to the landing stage.

866
01:51:26,306 --> 01:51:31,302
I'm not leaving. This is my home.
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

867
01:51:33,014 --> 01:51:38,010
I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.

868
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:41,804
Something very difficult to understand.

869
01:51:41,806 --> 01:51:46,802
It's about Sacha.

870
01:51:57,557 --> 01:52:00,389
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

871
01:52:00,389 --> 01:52:05,385
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

872
01:52:05,391 --> 01:52:10,385
Oh, my God.

873
01:52:11,139 --> 01:52:15,139
Oh, my God.

874
01:52:15,139 --> 01:52:18,848
He's become a traitor.

875
01:52:18,849 --> 01:52:21,932
The poor little thing.

876
01:52:21,932 --> 01:52:26,927
What has he done?

877
01:52:27,391 --> 01:52:32,385
So he's going to stay over there?

878
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:39,596
Yes. He's going to stay over there.

879
01:52:40,599 --> 01:52:43,016
I shouldn't be saying this,
Comrade Commissar,

880
01:52:43,017 --> 01:52:46,183
but maybe it's for the best.

881
01:52:46,184 --> 01:52:48,641
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

882
01:52:48,642 --> 01:52:53,639
I know it's wrong,
but perhaps he's made the right choice.

883
01:53:12,849 --> 01:53:15,849
- Tania!
-Tania!

884
01:53:15,851 --> 01:53:20,846
- Tania!
-Tania!

885
01:53:38,934 --> 01:53:43,929
I need a doctor. A doctor!

886
01:53:47,559 --> 01:53:52,554
I have a pass. I have a pass.
You must let her cross.

887
01:53:55,769 --> 01:53:57,392
Please.

888
01:53:57,394 --> 01:53:59,142
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
-No.

889
01:53:59,143 --> 01:54:04,139
No, she will. She's my daughter.
She's my daughter, I beg of you.

890
01:54:05,269 --> 01:54:10,264
All right. All right, you two,
put this one on the boat.

891
01:54:57,894 --> 01:55:01,684
Where is he? Where's the major?

892
01:55:01,684 --> 01:55:06,559
A few inches from your face.

893
01:55:06,559 --> 01:55:10,978
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

894
01:55:10,978 --> 01:55:13,978
Man will always be man.

895
01:55:13,978 --> 01:55:17,478
There is no new man.

896
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,809
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

897
01:55:20,809 --> 01:55:24,809
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.

898
01:55:24,809 --> 01:55:28,894
But there's always something to envy.

899
01:55:28,894 --> 01:55:33,891
A smile, a friendship.

900
01:55:34,313 --> 01:55:38,478
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

901
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,977
In this world, even a Soviet one,

902
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:47,144
there will always be rich and poor.

903
01:55:47,144 --> 01:55:50,559
Rich in gifts,

904
01:55:50,563 --> 01:55:53,563
poor in gifts.

905
01:55:53,563 --> 01:55:57,144
Rich in love,

906
01:55:57,146 --> 01:56:02,141
poor in love.

907
01:56:04,978 --> 01:56:09,144
Tania isn't coming back.

908
01:56:09,144 --> 01:56:14,142
She's dead, Vassili.

909
01:56:19,896 --> 01:56:22,228
She was cut down by shrapnel.

910
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:27,226
It was quick.
I don't think she even saw it coming.

911
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:29,813
She was on her way back to you,

912
01:56:29,815 --> 01:56:33,478
as soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov
to the boats.

913
01:56:33,478 --> 01:56:37,813
She was coming back for you.
She was right.

914
01:56:37,813 --> 01:56:42,809
You're a good man, Vassili.

915
01:56:44,188 --> 01:56:49,184
I want to help you, Vassili.
Let me do one last thing.

916
01:56:49,356 --> 01:56:54,351
Something useful for a change.

917
01:56:57,898 --> 01:57:02,893
- Let me show you where the major is.
-No, don't do that. Don't do that!

918
02:01:16,489 --> 02:01:21,483
<i>Today, February the 3rd, 1943,
is an ominous day for Hitler</i>

919
02:01:21,572 --> 02:01:26,068
<i>and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.</i>

920
02:01:26,068 --> 02:01:29,986
<i>It is an unforgettable day of hope
for our motherland,</i>

921
02:01:29,986 --> 02:01:34,982
<i>for the people of
the Soviet Union, and...</i>

922
02:01:42,155 --> 02:01:47,150
<i>Today after 180 days of growing combat
in the martyred city of Stalingrad,</i>

923
02:01:49,072 --> 02:01:54,067
<i>and as a result of the valor
and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,</i>

924
02:01:54,364 --> 02:01:57,655
<i>the commander
of our glorious Red Army</i>

925
02:01:57,656 --> 02:02:02,651
<i>received the unconditional surrender
of the German fascist invasion.</i>

926
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,655
I cannot find the matching name
in the book.

927
02:02:21,655 --> 02:02:24,489
Could you check again, please?
This is the address of this hospital

928
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:25,862
-and this is her name.
-She's not here, Comrade.

929
02:02:25,864 --> 02:02:27,197
Yes. This is our address,

930
02:02:27,197 --> 02:02:30,489
-but she's not here.
-We don't have her anymore.

931
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:31,780
This is the address of this place...

932
02:02:31,782 --> 02:02:33,322
- I'm so sorry.
-...so she's obviously been here.

933
02:02:33,322 --> 02:02:34,947
- She wrote to me.
-...three times in the books,

934
02:02:34,949 --> 02:02:36,322
but she's not here.

935
02:02:36,324 --> 02:02:41,318
Believe me. There is no
Tania Chernova. I can't help you.
