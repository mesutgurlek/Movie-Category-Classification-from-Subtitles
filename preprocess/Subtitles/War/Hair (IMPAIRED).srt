Steve...

There's an odd-looking
character over there.

334
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:12,087
And here to the right,
that chap over there.

335
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,467
That colored gentleman over there
with the girl.

336
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,052
See those two girls there?

337
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,970
- Do you know them?
- No.

338
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,725
Why don't you just unobtrusively...

339
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,811
...see if you can find out
who they are, how they got here,

340
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,648
who invited them,
and come back and let me know, will ya?

Are you supposed to be here?

346
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,342
- I mean, who brought you guys?
- Mr. Berger.

347
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,680
Well, enjoy the party.

Who's Mr. Berger?

352
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,819
I don't know.

353
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,948
Don't even suck on it
if you don't want to burn your lips.

354
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,950
- Now?
- Now start puffing on it.

[Man] What's taking so long, love?

361
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,970
Sweetheart, come on. You have a lot
of people waiting to see you.

362
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,431
Will you relax, Daddy?

363
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,891
Well, hurry up.

- They're getting dressed.

365
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,311
Open the door this minute!

366
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,897
- I'm taking care of it.
- I can see you are.

367
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,733
[Knocking]

368
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,276
[Father] Sheila?

369
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,445
- Yes?
- [Giggling]

370
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,698
There's no excuse
for this performance.

371
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,704
Hello.

372

Ted, Ted...

374
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,705
Excuse me. Mr. Berger?

375
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,166
- You can call me George.
- I think that it's a private party.

376
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,336
I think you and your friends
better leave, please.

377
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,589
- You do?
- Yes, I think that's the thing to do.

378
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,217
OK.

379
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,597
- [Hitting glass]
- Mr. Berger...

380
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,681
[Berger] Excuse me, everybody.

381
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,267
- Everybody, please quiet down.
- Mr. Berger...

382
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,645
I think that you and your...

383
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,355
I just wanted to say a few words,
then we'll go.

384
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,233
- I don't care what you have to say.
- I know. Everybody, listen.

385
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,693
- We weren't invited to this party...
- Mr. Berger.

386
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,364
Just a second.
I just want to talk for a second, OK?

387
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,534
- I don't care about that.
- I know you don't care.

388
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,702
- I think you better leave.
- Please, just give me two minutes.

389
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,246
Just wanna talk to
the people for a second.

390
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,873
- All right?
- No.

391
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,251
- Please.
- No, I think you better go.

392
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,752
Please.

393
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,464
I'm losing my patience.
This is a private party.

394
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,675
You were not invited.
You'd better leave.

395
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,760
- You don't understand.
- I have nothing to understand.

396
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,803
You got something to understand.

397
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,805
You don't understand what this man
will be doing for you.

398
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,766
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You should hear about it!

399
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,060
- You know what he's gonna do for you?
- I don't care!

400
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,897
You should care because
he's gonna be fighting for you.

401
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,567
He's going to Vietnam to fight for you,
to save your life!

402
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,986
- I don't care what he's gonna do.
- To save your life!

403
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,487
Or what you're gonna do.

404
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,739
- I want you out!
- You should care!

405
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,328
If you want me out of here,
you'll have to throw me out.

406
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,747
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

407
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,669
I'm gonna get the police. I'm not gonna
muss myself up fussing with you.

408
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,964
- I'll get the police if I have to.
- OK.

409
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,510
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- OK.

Penguin.

411
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,895
Now, my friend, Claude, here,
is in love.

412
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,521
He saw this chick on a horse...

413
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,148
- Excuse me.
- Jesus.

414
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,359
[Man] Now, let's deal
with this as gentlemen.

415
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,571
- OK. OK. Good.
- Quietly. As gentlemen.

416
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,365
- Now may I give you a word of advice?
- Yeah.

417
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,161
Get your ass out of here, now.

418
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,872
Is that it?

419
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,124
- That's it, yes.
- Thank you.

420
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,959
Now, listen.

421
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,586
Claude here is in love.

422
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,173
The girl he's in love with
is sitting in this room.

423
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:11,345
He just wants to sit here
and look at her for five minutes.

424
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,848
He just wants to look at her
and have this picture in his head

425
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,017
when he's off there fighting
in the jungles.

426
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,899
Is that so much to ask?
Hey! This is for you, man.

427
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,360
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.

428
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,072
Sheila, is that OK if Claude
just sits here and looks at you

429
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,407
for a few minutes before we go?

430
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,038

795
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,446
What do you want to do?

796
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,369
Take Sheila home.

797
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:43,000
[Berger] Hey, she's all yours.
Have a good time.

798
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,960
- I'm just taking her home.
- I know.

799
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,004
- Have a good time anyway.
- [Both chuckling]

800
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,764
Come on, Jeannie.

801
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,731
Come on.

802
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,158
- Whoa!
[Jeannie laughs]

803
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,452
Get your pants off and come on in!

804
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,709
You want to go home?

805
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:33,050
- You're just taking me home, right?
- Yeah.

806
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,470
- No, you know what I mean.
- I'm just taking you home.

807
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,097
Because nothing's gonna happen.

808
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,433
No, I'm just gonna take you home.

809
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,358
No. No, no. I think
I'll go home by myself.

810
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,443
No, I'll take you home.

811
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,406
- I don't feel like it.
- Why not?

812
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,037
I don't have to
explain everything to you...

813
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,622
...do I?

814
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,347
Come on! Come on, will ya?

815
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,687
The water is filthy, you know.

816
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,694
Listen, I'm sorry.

817
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,239
I didn't mean to be so...

818
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,533
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't trying to upset you.

819
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,452
That's all right.

820
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,996
It's just sometimes I get so...

821
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,706
I understand.

822
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,541
- You're upset, right?
- Oh, no.

823
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,127
No, you are.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

824
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,880
I just... But I just thought...

825
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,383
- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

826
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,428
So, what's the point?

827
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,890
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it would be different?

828
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,516
Maybe.

829
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,310
Well...

830
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,564
- I might not go.
- Right.

831
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,816
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm serious.

832
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,943
Forget it.
I don't believe you.

833
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:07,037
Hey... Where did everybody else go?

834
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,873
They're around somewhere.
Jeannie's still up there.

835
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,754
Hey, where are our clothes?

836
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,609
- Where did they take them?
- [Snickering]

837
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,948
[Laughing]

838
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,783
Funny, funny, funny!

839
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,953
You guys are so mature.

840
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,747
Don't look at me.
I didn't have anything to do with it.

841
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,753
Don't worry about it.
They're around.

842
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,465
Berger!

843
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,976
Sheila...

844
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,230
- Taxi! Taxi!
- [Taxi tires screeching]

845
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,159
[Chuckling]

846
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,539
[Berger] Don't go!
I've got your purse! Sheila, wait!

847
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,092
I don't believe it, man.
What happened?

848
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,260
What happened?

849
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,137
What the hell did you do that for?

850
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,182
- It was fun, man.
- Fun?

851
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,477
I'm really sorry.

852
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,855
I didn't think she'd ever
pull a stunt like that.

853
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,567
We know where she lives. We'll give
her clothes back tomorrow. It's cool.

854
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,402
I won't be here tomorrow.

855
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,114
You're not still serious
about that shit, are you?

856
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,701
That's none of your goddamn business.

857
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,205
It is my goddamn business, man.
What do you want?

858
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,374
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?

859
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,378
- Is that what you want?
- I can't talk to you.

860
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,506
I'm standing right here.
Talk to me.

861
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,424
I'm right here. Talk to me.

862
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,844
I think you're ridiculous.

863
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,931
I am ridiculous.

864
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,558
I'm totally ridiculous.
I'm ludicrous.

865
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,894
I don't want to go over there
and murder women and babies.

866
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,314
Go ahead and be ridiculous,
and I'll do what I have to do.

867
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,066
Who are you doing it for?

868
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,734
I'm doing it for you, man.

869
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,363
Look, don't hand me that.
If you're doing it for me, don't.

870
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,699
Because if the shoe was on the
other foot, I wouldn't do it for you.

871
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,081
Give me my clothes.

872
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,015
How will she get home? She doesn't
have her stuff. She has no bread.

873
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,856
You better get that stuff to her.

874
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:25,193
- Me?
- Yeah.

875
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,237
Wasn't that what you wanted?

876
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,786
You're telling me I'm ridiculous?

877
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,434

Everything off, please.

No, sir.

Next!
