1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,300
DOWNFALL

2
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,800
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,300
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,300
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,100
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,100
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

8
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:57,100
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,101
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

10
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,601
I also didn't realise...

11
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:10,601
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

12
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:17,101
But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.

13
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:23,925
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:29,425
It's confirmed.
-They can pass.

15
00:01:57,303 --> 00:02:00,303
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer

16
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,803
November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia

17
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:08,303
Sit down, ladies.

18
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:14,803
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:21,303
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

20
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:26,303
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

21
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:28,303
And the Nazi salute?

22
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,803
That won't be necessary...

23
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:35,803
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

24
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,803
Act as normal and relaxed
as you can.

25
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:41,803
I'll see if
if he has time for you.

26
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:48,803
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

27
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:12,309
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

28
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:17,309
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

29
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,733
Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.

30
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,733
Where are you from?
-From Fulda.

31
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,733
And what is your name?
-Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

32
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,233
No need for that.
Where are you from?

33
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,733
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

34
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,733
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

35
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,733
In Pankow, to be precise.

36
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,233
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

37
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:51,233
And you are?
-Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

38
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,733
A lady from Munich.

39
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,233
Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?

40
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:20,233
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

41
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,233
She's much smarter
than most people.

42
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,732
First, sit down, please.

43
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:36,232
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

44
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,732
You won't make nearly as many.

45
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:50,232
You're very young.

46
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:55,233
How old are you?
-22, mein Führer.

47
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,733
My German fellow-countrymen
and women...

48
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,733
...fellow party members.

49
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:10,233
It is, I think, rather special...

50
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:16,733
that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

51
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:26,233
...and that in all those 20 years, his program
never needed to be modified.

52
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,233
I suggest we try it again.

53
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,006
I did it.
He hired me.

54
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,506
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday

55
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,506
two and a half years later

56
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,006
Take cover.

57
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,956
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

58
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,233
Take cover.

59
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,819
That's artillery fire.

60
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,319
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

61
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,319
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

62
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,819
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

63
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,819
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

64
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,819
Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.

65
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,319
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

66
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:13,997
Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.

67
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,818
Where did they come from?
-We don't know yet.

68
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:20,318
I have Koller on the line.
-Give me Koller.

69
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:24,818
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

70
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:28,318
No.
-Can't you hear the shooting?

71
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:31,818
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
-Berlin is chaotic.

72
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,818
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

73
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:38,818
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

74
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,318
It's not long-range artillery.

75
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,318
The anti-aircraft defence near the Zoo-Bunker
reports they're 10 to 12...

76
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,818
... cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

77
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,318
That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?

78
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:59,318
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

79
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,292
This is unheard-of.

80
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,318
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

81
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:09,818
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

82
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:13,318
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

83
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:16,818
That railway bridge over the Oder...
-Nonsense.

84
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:25,318
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

85
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:31,318
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

86
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,818
The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

87
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:40,318
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

88
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:43,818
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

89
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:47,818
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

90
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,318
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

91
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:54,818
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

92
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,818
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

93
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:03,318
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

94
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:07,318
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

95
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:10,318
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

96
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,318
Do you want to die here?
-Absolutely not.

97
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,318
Gentlemen, the Führer.

98
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,246
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

99
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:45,088
What's going on?
-We're leaving.

100
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,588
'Clausewitz' has started.

101
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:52,513
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

102
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:56,088
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

103
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:00,587
Don't ask me, professor.
-This is insane.

104
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,625
Professor.

105
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

106
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,125
Is that so?
-Food supply would collapse.

107
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,125
A good soldier can
always find food.

108
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:35,125
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

109
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,975
It's irresponsible.
-It's an order from the Führer.

110
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:43,476
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

111
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,976
But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

112
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,976
Keep that in mind.

113
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:58,976
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

114
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:03,904
We're leaving.

115
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,433
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

116
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,433
Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.

117
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,318
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

118
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,818
The brown nosing is the worst.

119
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,818
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what.'

120
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:42,242
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

121
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:44,742
Too late?

122
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:48,242
Hewel, come here for a moment.

123
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:53,349
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

124
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:58,849
...and start conducting politics.
-Certainly. We need politics.

125
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,849
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

126
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,349
I'm fed up with it.

127
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:11,349
When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

128
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:17,493
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

129
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:22,239
It's good.
Just go.

130
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,277
He has no strength left.

131
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:47,777
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

132
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:51,777
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

133
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:54,777
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

134
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:59,777
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

135
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,777
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

136
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:06,277
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

137
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,277
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

138
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:14,277
The first contact has been made.
-Careful, that's high treason.

139
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,277
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

140
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,277
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?

141
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,120
Look at that.

142
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,620
The best guests
always arrive late.

143
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

144
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,120
The scorched-earth order...
-I really have to go now.

145
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:48,120
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

146
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,620
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

147
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:09,624
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

148
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:15,124
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

149
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:20,124
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

150
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:27,124
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

151
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,624
You're a true genius, Speer.

152
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:38,624
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know
that the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

153
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:43,624
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

154
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,624
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

155
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:52,124
...that will survive thousands of years.

156
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,425
We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...

157
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:59,425
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

158
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:03,925
...and we know that the people
need that.

159
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,425
Indeed, Speer.

160
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,925
That was my vision...

161
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:17,925
...and it still is.

162
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:25,425
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

163
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:33,424
Eva, you say something.

164
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:36,924
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

165
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:41,924
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

166
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:44,424
I can't do that, my child.

167
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:49,924
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

168
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:55,701
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

169
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,201
Speer...

170
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:02,201
...what do you think?

171
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:06,701
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

172
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,292
Reload.

173
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,435
Go away. Leave me alone.

174
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:41,435
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

175
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,935
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

176
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,935
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

177
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:52,435
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

178
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:55,935
The Führer will decorate him
for it, today.

179
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,435
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

180
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,935
I haven't had
the honour yet.

181
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:06,935
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

182
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,935
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

183
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:13,435
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

184
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:17,435
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

185
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,935
We'll shoot back.
-What with?

186
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:22,435
With the anti-aircraft guns.

187
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:26,435
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

188
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:30,935
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

189
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,935
We promised the Führer.

190
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:37,435
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

191
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:38,935
Coward.

192
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,435
Go away. Right now.

193
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:50,935
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

194
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:59,935
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

195
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:05,435
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

196
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,435
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

197
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:13,934
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

198
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:18,434
...with a ruthless, mighty attack.

199
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:20,434
Using which units?

200
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,934
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

201
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,434
The 9th army is unable to move.

202
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,934
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

203
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,434
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

204
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:41,934
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
-Then it must turn around.

205
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:46,434
Then the western front would be open.
-Do you doubt my orders?

206
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:50,434
I think I've been
clear enough.

207
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:58,934
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

208
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:03,934
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

209
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,434
Mohnke, you're here.
-Mein Führer.

210
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:31,434
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

211
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:36,434
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

212
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:40,934
We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.

213
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:45,434
There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.

214
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:52,934
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

215
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:56,934
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

216
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:02,434
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

217
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,434
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

218
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:09,434
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

219
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,434
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

220
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,934
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

221
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:21,434
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

222
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:25,434
But why don't you tell him that?
-He doesn't listen to reason.

223
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,934
Something has to happen.
-Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

224
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:35,934
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

225
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,434
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

226
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,934
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

227
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:43,934
I beg your pardon?

228
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,095
Where were you?
-None of your business.

229
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,668
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

230
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:32,627
I'm proud of you.

231
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:40,127
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

232
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:45,127
His name is Peter Kranz.
-So you're Peter.

233
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,627
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

234
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,121
Very good.

235
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,393
You've made history.

236
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:14,393
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...

237
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:16,893
...you will be the heroes.

238
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,393
Heil, to you.

239
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:52,888
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

240
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:58,388
What will happen to us?
-I could go if I wanted to.

241
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:03,388
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

242
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:05,388
I can't go either.

243
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:13,388
I wouldn't know
where to go.

244
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:18,388
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

245
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,388
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

246
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:24,888
What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?

247
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,388
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'

248
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,888
Life will go on.

249
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:42,998
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
-We have to go.

250
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:48,998
Go where?
-I don't know.

251
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:51,498
Wherever they need us.

252
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:05,498
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

253
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:06,998
Come on.

254
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,490
Come, children.

255
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,000
We should have fun today.

256
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:31,661
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

257
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,161
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

258
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:40,161
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

259
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:47,661
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

260
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:51,161
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

261
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:56,161
If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost too?

262
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:02,161
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

263
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:05,661
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

264
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,661
Our people turned out weak...

265
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:12,661
...and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

266
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,161
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

267
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:19,161
What remains after this battle...

268
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:24,161
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

269
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:34,388
Come along. You have to dance.

270
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:37,888
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
-I'd love to.

271
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:04,536
May I?
-Go ahead.

272
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:06,536
What's wrong?

273
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,536
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

274
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,036
Or else, come with me.

275
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,114
You'll die.

276
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:53,487
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

277
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,987
Dance.

278
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,049
Do you have a request?
-As long as it swings.

279
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,837
Traudl.

280
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:37,977
It's all so unreal.

281
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:43,977
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

282
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:45,977
It keeps on going.

283
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,477
Gerda, I don't feel well.

284
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:28,953
Traudl, come.

285
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:49,723
I did not move...

286
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:54,223
I did not move
my command post.

287
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:57,571
To the west? How so?

288
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,071
I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
-General.

289
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,807
And, general?

290
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:25,807
I'll be executed.
-What? Why?

291
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,807
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

292
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:34,307
Be sensible, general.
-Come along.

293
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:52,742
Schenck.
-Mohnke.

294
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:57,713
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

295
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,213
I need help.
-That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

296
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,713
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

297
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,586
You're a doctor, aren't you?
-Yes, an internist.

298
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:12,086
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

299
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:15,086
...you can find, to me.

300
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:18,586
I'll do my best.
-Thanks. Hurry.

301
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,778
I need to talk to the Führer.

302
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,278
What about?
-I'm going to be executed.

303
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:17,778
Wait here.

304
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,278
Your weapon, please.

305
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,278
Not here.

306
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:35,211
Guard post 2.
Understood.

307
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:38,711
General...

308
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:42,711
Not you.

309
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,723
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

310
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:12,223
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

311
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:17,223
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

312
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:20,723
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

313
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:25,723
My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.

314
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,723
Continue.

315
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:32,223
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

316
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,723
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

317
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:41,223
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

318
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:59,954
You can't pass, Oberst.
-Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:

319
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:02,954
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

320
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,954
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

321
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,954
And the wounded?
-How should I know?

322
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,454
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

323
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:15,641
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

324
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:20,938
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

325
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,800
May I?

326
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:44,283
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

327
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:46,566
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

328
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:50,066
Drink.
-Führer's orders.

329
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:53,545
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

330
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:56,045
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

331
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:59,045
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

332
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,045
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

333
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:06,045
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

334
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,331
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

335
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:21,831
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

336
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:27,331
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

337
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,416
Let them get closer.

338
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,274
Tank alert.

339
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,965
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

340
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:48,234
Is it German artillery that I hear?
-I'm afraid not.

341
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,734
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

342
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,734
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

343
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:59,234
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

344
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,734
Steiner will make
all the difference.

345
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:05,734
He says it will change
military history.

346
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:09,734
Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.

347
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:15,234
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
-Why would he be playing games?

348
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,234
What does he have to lose?

349
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:19,734
I don't believe a word of it.

350
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,233
The enemy made a breakthrough.

351
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:27,233
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

352
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:31,233
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

353
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:36,733
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

354
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:40,233
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

355
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,233
Mein Führer...

356
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,233
Steiner...

357
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,233
Steiner didn't have enough force.

358
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,233
The attack didn't take place.

359
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:16,366
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

360
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:35,397
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

361
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,897
How dare you
ignore my orders?

362
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:44,397
Is this what it came to?

363
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:50,897
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

364
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:56,397
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

365
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,897
I don't allow that...

366
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:03,897
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
-Führer, this is outrageous.

367
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:07,897
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

368
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,897
No sense of honour.

369
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:15,397
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

370
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,897
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

371
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:23,397
For years, the military
obstructed me.

372
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:27,897
All you ever did is
thwart me.

373
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,631
I should have had...

374
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:36,631
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

375
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,668
I never went to the academy.

376
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:50,168
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

377
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,267
Traitors.

378
00:39:56,767 --> 00:40:01,267
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

379
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:06,266
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

380
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:12,266
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

381
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,193
They will drown
in their own blood.

382
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:19,193
Relax, Gerda.

383
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:29,941
All my orders have
been ignored.

384
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:35,441
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

385
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,144
It's over.

386
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:45,919
The war is lost.

387
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:55,195
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

388
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:59,695
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

389
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,341
Do what you want.

390
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:29,827
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

391
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:32,827
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

392
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,827
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

393
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,261
Everything is lost.

394
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,761
Completely lost.

395
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:53,761
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

396
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:07,577
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

397
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Now what?

398
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,620
Time to end this charade.

399
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

400
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,120
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

401
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,120
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

402
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,619
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

403
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,119
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

404
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,619
Great.
And then what?

405
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,119
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

406
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,619
We owe it to him.
-Hollow phrases.

407
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,119
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

408
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,619
You're only looking after yourself.
-Mind your words.

409
00:43:22,457 --> 00:43:23,957
Damn.

410
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:32,457
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

411
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:33,957
We've got to wait.

412
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:37,957
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

413
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:42,457
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

414
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,957
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

415
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,957
I don't know.
Honestly.

416
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:54,957
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

417
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:36,528
Traudl.

418
00:44:37,028 --> 00:44:38,528
Look here.

419
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:02,515
I'm lighting another one.

420
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:22,212
Let's go down again.

421
00:45:50,994 --> 00:45:54,994
Where do they come from?
-Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

422
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:57,994
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

423
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:05,494
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

424
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,032
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

425
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:14,532
I'll take the responsibility.

426
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,732
I think this is wrong.
-Great.

427
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:31,732
Stop. Lights out.

428
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:34,732
Stop. Stay where you are.

429
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:38,232
Stay where you are.
-Alright, Germans.

430
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:46,096
Help. They want to kill us.
-What is all this?

431
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:50,096
A Greifkommando.
-You're kidding.

432
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:02,588
Stop it.
Let those men go.

433
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:06,088
What's this?
You have no authority here.

434
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:11,088
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

435
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:15,088
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

436
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,239
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

437
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,239
Stop it. That's enough.

438
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:41,094
Dismissed.

439
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:22,565
This man's a doctor.

440
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:32,051
Can you operate?
-Not really.

441
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:39,009
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

442
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,509
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

443
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:46,009
Herr Minister...
-Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

444
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:50,509
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

445
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:52,509
Brigade führer, what can I do for you?

446
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:56,009
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

447
00:49:56,509 --> 00:49:59,009
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

448
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:04,509
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

449
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:09,009
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

450
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:11,009
Their deaths will be pointless.

451
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,009
I don't pity them.

452
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:18,009
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

453
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:21,009
The people called this
upon themselves.

454
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:25,509
This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.

455
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:29,509
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

456
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,009
And now they're paying for it.

457
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:51,868
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

458
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:54,368
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

459
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:56,868
How can you say that?
Where are you?

460
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:00,368
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

461
00:51:00,868 --> 00:51:05,367
Does my sister know where you are?
-Think about it. I'll call you back.

462
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:09,867
Children, your room is to the right.

463
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,367
Wait for me.

464
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:18,367
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
-Good to see you, Frau Junge.

465
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:32,269
Line up, children.

466
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:34,769
Helga, come. Line up.

467
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:40,269
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

468
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,269
Do you remember the song?

469
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:28,289
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

470
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:35,289
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

471
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,789
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

472
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,289
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

473
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:44,289
That's definitely painless.

474
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:49,289
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

475
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:51,289
A matter of seconds.

476
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:56,289
Can I have one too?
-Me too.

477
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:05,789
Himmler provided me well.

478
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,904
Thank you.

479
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:30,404
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

480
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:41,977
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

481
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:50,476
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

482
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:55,476
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

483
00:53:55,976 --> 00:53:58,976
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

484
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:02,976
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

485
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:08,476
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

486
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:12,476
The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

487
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:17,476
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

488
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:22,976
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

489
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:26,976
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

490
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,476
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

491
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,476
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

492
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:37,476
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

493
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:42,976
...and with it, everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.

494
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:47,476
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

495
00:54:48,476 --> 00:54:50,976
That's why I brought
the children too.

496
00:54:51,476 --> 00:54:53,476
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

497
00:54:53,976 --> 00:54:58,476
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

498
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:09,981
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

499
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:15,481
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

500
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:20,481
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

501
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:24,981
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

502
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:27,481
I want you to get it.

503
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:32,481
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

504
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:35,481
A birthday present
from the Führer.

505
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:40,481
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

506
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:46,169
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

507
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:53,669
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

508
00:55:55,669 --> 00:56:01,669
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

509
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:07,669
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

510
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:12,878
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

511
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:17,348
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

512
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:21,264
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

513
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:25,264
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

514
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:27,264
...your sister.

515
00:57:16,815 --> 00:57:18,815
Inge.

516
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:11,348
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

517
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:15,348
Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.

518
00:58:15,848 --> 00:58:18,848
Things have to be
started up again.

519
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:22,348
I don't understand you.

520
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:26,348
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

521
00:58:26,827 --> 00:58:32,327
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

522
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:38,848
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

523
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:46,348
Any questions?
-No, mein Führer.

524
00:58:46,848 --> 00:58:49,348
Good.
Have a good trip.

525
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:22,190
...do you agree that I take charge...

526
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,690
...with complete freedom of action?

527
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,190
If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...

528
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,596
...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

529
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:35,596
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.

530
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:39,096
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

531
01:00:39,596 --> 01:00:42,096
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

532
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:45,596
If our communication
system fails...

533
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:49,096
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

534
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:51,596
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

535
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:54,596
I think Göring wants to
seize the power.

536
01:00:55,596 --> 01:00:58,096
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

537
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:00,596
This looks like a coup.

538
01:01:01,096 --> 01:01:04,596
The loser, the sponger.

539
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:07,596
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

540
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:13,190
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

541
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,190
Hello.
-How did you get into Berlin?

542
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,190
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.

543
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:23,190
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

544
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,690
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

545
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,190
For that alone,
he should be executed.

546
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:36,190
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

547
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,690
And now this.

548
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,190
He's betraying me.

549
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:46,690
Me of all people.

550
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:56,690
I want Göring stripped
of his power, right away.

551
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,190
And, in case I don't
survive the war...

552
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:03,689
...he must be
executed immediately.

553
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:10,189
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

554
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:15,689
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

555
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:20,189
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

556
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,689
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

557
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:30,689
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

558
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,689
But the children...

559
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:47,189
I have always believed...

560
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:51,689
...that there was a way out.

561
01:02:58,189 --> 01:03:00,189
Come in.

562
01:03:02,189 --> 01:03:04,189
Albert. Hello.

563
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:17,189
You have a fever.

564
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,689
Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.

565
01:03:22,689 --> 01:03:25,189
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

566
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:28,189
Leave?
And go where?

567
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:33,189
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

568
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:37,189
You can hide
until everything's over.

569
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,689
It won't be long now anyway.

570
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:42,189
I thought about it.

571
01:03:43,689 --> 01:03:48,689
My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.

572
01:03:51,689 --> 01:03:56,189
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

573
01:04:00,189 --> 01:04:04,689
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

574
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,960
I can't believe
you really want that.

575
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,460
Go now.

576
01:04:57,095 --> 01:04:59,095
Come in.

577
01:05:03,095 --> 01:05:05,095
I knew you'd come.

578
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:08,595
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

579
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:17,966
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

580
01:05:18,466 --> 01:05:20,966
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

581
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:26,466
I took some furniture
you designed.

582
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:28,917
I couldn't leave it behind.

583
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:33,417
Please, you must
not have eaten all day.

584
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,917
That's true.

585
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:45,417
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

586
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:47,917
Did he ever doubt that?

587
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:52,917
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

588
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,917
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

589
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:04,917
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

590
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:07,417
I also think it's best.

591
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,417
And, you know...

592
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,417
...it may sound strange...

593
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:22,417
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

594
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:52,611
You came.
-Mein Führer, I...

595
01:06:52,612 --> 01:06:54,611
It's good.

596
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:57,611
Let's sit down.

597
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:19,813
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

598
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:26,313
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

599
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:36,312
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

600
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:40,681
Too late.

601
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:51,681
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

602
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:57,181
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

603
01:08:01,681 --> 01:08:05,681
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

604
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:15,681
...and then eternal peace.

605
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:22,681
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

606
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:28,181
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

607
01:08:28,182 --> 01:08:31,181
...I won't shed a tear.

608
01:08:31,681 --> 01:08:33,681
They get what they deserve.

609
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:39,681
They called this fate
upon themselves.

610
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:46,681
For months...

611
01:08:48,181 --> 01:08:50,181
...I have to tell you this...

612
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:55,181
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

613
01:08:57,181 --> 01:09:03,681
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

614
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:10,179
I had to tell you.

615
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:23,093
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

616
01:09:35,808 --> 01:09:38,308
So you're leaving.

617
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:41,003
Good.

618
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,003
Goodbye.

619
01:09:54,135 --> 01:09:56,135
I wish you all the best.

620
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:20,738
Eat well, gentlemen.

621
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:15,702
Peter.

622
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:26,896
It's alright, son.

623
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:44,528
He has a fever.

624
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:47,595
Yes, but he's alive.

625
01:12:11,445 --> 01:12:15,445
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

626
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:18,945
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...

627
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:25,945
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

628
01:12:26,945 --> 01:12:27,945
Sit down.

629
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,445
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

630
01:12:32,945 --> 01:12:35,445
From there,
we couldn't continue.

631
01:12:36,445 --> 01:12:40,445
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

632
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,945
...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

633
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:46,945
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

634
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:53,040
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

635
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,540
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

636
01:12:57,598 --> 01:13:00,098
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

637
01:13:00,597 --> 01:13:03,597
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

638
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:06,597
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

639
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:11,097
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

640
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:18,597
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

641
01:13:20,097 --> 01:13:25,097
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

642
01:13:25,597 --> 01:13:27,097
...is a betrayal of nature.

643
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:33,097
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

644
01:13:33,597 --> 01:13:37,210
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

645
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:43,135
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

646
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,670
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

647
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:53,170
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

648
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,170
Apes, for instance,...

649
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:02,625
...kill all the odd ones.

650
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:08,625
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

651
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,640
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

652
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:22,140
...to the allied powers.

653
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,140
Via Count Bernadotte.
