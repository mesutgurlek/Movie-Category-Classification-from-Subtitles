1084
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:16,441
<i>We had to get up
and, uh, move to the ramp.</i>

1085
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:19,486
<i>We immediately got an escort in the night,</i>

1086

<i>and we were escorted to the ramp.</i>

1087

01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:27,444
<i>And lights went on.</i>

1089
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:31,122
<i>There was a ramp.</i>

1090
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:33,871
<i>Around the ramp were lights,</i>

1091
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:38,418
<i>and under those lights
were the cordon of the SS.</i>

1092
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:42,880
<i>There was one e very 10 yards,
with a gun in the hand.</i>

1093
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:47,263
<i>So, we were in the middle,
the prisoners,</i>

1094
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,470
<i>and we were waiting,</i>

1095
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:52,553
<i>waiting for the train,
waiting for the next order.</i>

1096
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:57,269
<i>Now, when all this was done,
everybody was there,</i>

1097
01:38:57,807 --> 01:38:59,935
<i>the transport was rolled in.</i>

1098
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:03,904
<i>This means in a very slow fashion.</i>

1099
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:07,571
<i>The locomotive,
which was always at the front,</i>

1100
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,032
<i>was coming to the ramp,</i>

1101
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,455
<i>and that was the end of the railway line.</i>

1102
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:16,455
<i>That was the end of the line
for everybody who was on the train.</i>

1103
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:23,583
And, now, the train stopped,

1104
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,252
and

1105
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,884
the gangster elite marched on the ramp.

1106
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:33,184
And in front of every second
or every third wagon,

1107
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:35,478
and sometimes in front of every wagon,

1108
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,268
one of those UnterscharfiJhrers

1109
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,102
was standing with a key

1110
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:45,814
and opened the locks,

1111
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,276
because the wagons were locked.

1112
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:54,448
Now, inside,
there were people, of course,

1113
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,908
and you could see the people
looking through the windows,

1114
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,493
because they didn't know what's happening.

1115
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,169
They had many stops on their journey.

1116
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:04,215
Some of them were 10 days on the journey.
Some were two days on the journey.

1117
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:08,010
And they didn't know
what this particular stop means.

1118
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,133
Now, the door was opened.

1119
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:14,009
And the first order they were given was,

1120
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,595
<i>“AIIe heraus!”
“Everybody out!”</i>

1121

In order to make it quite clear,

1122
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,569
they usually started with those walking sticks

1123
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:28,023
to hit the first, the second,
the third, who were...

1124
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,107
They were... They were...

1125
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:32,114
They were like sardines in those cars.

1126
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:38,408
<i>If they expected on that day
four, five, six transports,</i>

1127
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:42,962
<i>the pressure of getting out
from the wagons was high.</i>

1128
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:54,052
<i>Then the y used sticks, clubs, cursing,
e! cetera, e2' cetera.</i>

1129
01:40:57,176 --> 01:41:01,056
But, sometimes, the SS, if it was good weather,
they used to deal with it differently.

1130
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:05,359
I mean, I was not surprised
if they were in a different mood and...

1131
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:08,480
and, uh, exhibited a lot of humor,

1132
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:10,486
like saying, “Good morning, Madam,”

1133
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,818
and, “Will you please walk out?”

1134

- [ Lanzmann, In English] It happened?
- Oh, yes! Oh, yes.

We are so sorry that it wasn't too convenient,

the trainloads of Jews
were left on a station siding.

02:26:44,713 --> 02:26:49,765
At that point I was in shock
as if I'd been hypnotized,

1693
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:56,313
ready to do

1694
02:26:56,391 --> 02:26:58,894
whatever I was told.

1695
02:26:58,977 --> 02:27:05,701
I was so mindless, so horrified

1696
02:27:05,775 --> 02:27:13,876
that I did everything Fischel told me.

1697
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,413
So the ovens were fed,

1698
02:27:18,163 --> 02:27:21,963
but we were so inexperienced

1699
02:27:23,001 --> 02:27:31,477
that we left the fans on too long.

1700
02:27:31,718 --> 02:27:34,767
- The fans?
- Yes.

1701
02:27:34,846 --> 02:27:39,147
There were fans to make the fire hotter.
- Mm-hmm.

1702
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:43,526
They worked too long...

1703
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:48,907
The firebrick suddenly exploded,

1704
02:27:49,903 --> 02:27:55,125
blocking the pipes

1705
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,625
linking the Auschwitz crematorium

1706
02:27:59,412 --> 02:28:02,712
with the smokestack.

1707
02:28:04,626 --> 02:28:08,847
<i>Cremation was interrupted.</i>

1708
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:13,139
<i>The ovens were out of action.</i>

1709
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:20,191
<i>That evening, some trucks came,</i>

1710
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:22,898
<i>and we had to load the rest,</i>

1711
02:28:22,977 --> 02:28:26,072
<i>some 300 bodies,</i>

1712
02:28:26,147 --> 02:28:29,071
<i>into the trucks.</i>

1713
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:34,156
<i>Then we were taken...</i>

1714
02:28:36,157 --> 02:28:39,252
<i>I still don't know where...</i>

1715
02:28:39,327 --> 02:28:44,299
<i>but probably to a field at Birkenau.</i>

1716
02:28:48,586 --> 02:28:55,014
<i>We were ordered
to unload the bodies</i>

1717
02:28:55,343 --> 02:29:01,726
<i>and put them in a pit.</i>

1718
02:29:02,308 --> 02:29:06,279
<i>There was a ditch, an artificial pit.</i>

1719
02:29:06,354 --> 02:29:09,904
<i>Suddenly, water gushed up
from underground</i>

1720
02:29:09,983 --> 02:29:13,203
<i>and swept the bodies down.</i>

1721
02:29:18,658 --> 02:29:23,585
<i>When night came,
we had to stop that horrible work.</i>

1722
02:29:24,539 --> 02:29:27,042
<i>We were loaded into the trucks</i>

1723
02:29:27,125 --> 02:29:31,551
<i>and returned to Auschwitz.</i>

1724
02:29:36,176 --> 02:29:37,849
<i>The next day,</i>

1725
02:29:38,136 --> 02:29:44,769
<i>we were taken to the same place.</i>

1726
02:29:52,567 --> 02:29:55,571
<i>But the water had risen.</i>

1727
02:29:57,238 --> 02:30:01,118
<i>Some SS men came
with a fire truck</i>

1728
02:30:01,201 --> 02:30:04,705
<i>and pumped out the water.</i>

1729
02:30:05,955 --> 02:30:10,005
<i>We had to go down
into that muddy pit</i>

1730
02:30:10,084 --> 02:30:13,805
<i>to stack up the bodies.</i>

1731
02:30:17,091 --> 02:30:18,843
But they were slimy.

1732
02:30:18,927 --> 02:30:23,353
For example, I grasped a woman,

1733
02:30:23,431 --> 02:30:25,775
but her hands...

1734
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,194
Her hand was slippery, slimy.

1735
02:30:28,269 --> 02:30:30,863
I tried to pull her,

1736
02:30:30,939 --> 02:30:37,618
but I fell over backward,
into the water, the mud.

1737
02:30:39,197 --> 02:30:41,700
It was the same for all of us.

1738
02:30:41,783 --> 02:30:47,881
Up above, at the edge of the pit,
Aumeyer and Grabner yelled,

1739
02:30:47,956 --> 02:30:51,961
“Get cracking, you filth, you bastards!

1740
02:30:52,043 --> 02:30:56,719
We'll show you, you bunch of shits!”

1741
02:30:56,798 --> 02:30:59,972
These were the names they were calling us.

1742
02:31:00,301 --> 02:31:02,144

in the mud.

1751
02:31:37,839 --> 02:31:41,764
Aumeyer called one of his SS men.

1752
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:45,689
“Go on, finish off those swine!”

1753
02:31:48,641 --> 02:31:53,192
They were exhausted.
And they were shot in the pit.
