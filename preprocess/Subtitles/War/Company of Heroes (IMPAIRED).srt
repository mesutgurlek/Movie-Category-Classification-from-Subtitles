Come on, you Nazi bastards!

968
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:39,130
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

969
01:27:58,524 --> 01:27:59,692
Great job, boys!

970
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:02,904
Smoked them.
We'll see you on the flip side.

971
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:05,198
PILOT 2:
Roger that. Just doing our job.

972
01:28:05,907 --> 01:28:07,825
(LAUGHS)

973
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,370
Ransom?

974
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:12,956
I'm fine.

975
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:16,167
(♪♪♪)

976
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,379

977
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,842
(♪♪♪)

978
01:29:26,738 --> 01:29:29,907
CONTI:
Nathaniel Burrows, welcome back.

979
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:39,751
There you go.

980
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,881
My name is Lieutenant Conti,

981
01:29:45,048 --> 01:29:50,636
and I have with me a letter
from our division commander.

982
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:52,805
(PAPER RUSTLING)

983
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:55,058
It's of highest importance.

984
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:59,312
"No words could express
how grateful we are

985
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,858
for what you and your squad were able
to accomplish, given the circumstances.

986
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:08,237
Today, we are truly
in the company of heroes."

987
01:30:12,784 --> 01:30:15,036
Now, the device
that you brought back,

988
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:17,914
that was the very definition
of priceless.

989
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:20,708
And I promise you this:

990
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:25,421
History will prove that it was worth
every life lost in its pursuit.

991
01:30:32,095 --> 01:30:33,930
Now, that being said,

992
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:39,102
none of what you did, or saw,
or learned

993
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:43,189
from the morning of the German
bombardment to your return to this CP

994
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:45,274
ever happened.

995
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:50,696
There'll be no medals,
no commendations, no promotions.

996
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:53,074
You can't tell your family.

997
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:55,952
Hell, you can't even tell
your preacher.

998
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:58,204
None of this happened.

999
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:00,581
Do you understand?

1000
01:31:03,126 --> 01:31:06,420
Yes, sir.
Good.

1001
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:09,549
Now on a personal note,

1002
01:31:10,216 --> 01:31:12,593
I had the distinct honor

1003
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:16,055
to serve with your father in France
under General Pershing.

1004
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:18,266
(♪♪♪)

1005
01:31:18,724 --> 01:31:20,393
He was a hell of a man.

1006
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:25,398
So I've heard.

1007
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:31,445
Can I go home, sir?

1008
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:34,031
I'll make sure
you're on the next truck out.

1009
01:31:39,287 --> 01:31:41,330
Thanks for your service, son.

1010
01:31:47,128 --> 01:31:49,255
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1011
01:32:19,994 --> 01:32:21,996
(♪♪♪)

1012
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:47,313
So tell me about these two girls
back home.

1013
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:49,232
(CHUCKLES)

1014
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:58,491
Keep it going, bro.

1015
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,701
(♪♪♪)

1016
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:13,214
Well, my old Yankee Doodle,

1017
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:15,591
as a great man once said,

1018
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,802
all good things come to an end.

1019
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:42,702
I knew that kid
would make Valentine's Day.

1020
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:00,761
