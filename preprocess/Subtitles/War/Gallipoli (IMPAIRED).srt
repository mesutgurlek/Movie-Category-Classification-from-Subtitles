00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,741
Whoo!

318
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:19,407
- Nearly lost me, mate.
- You sure it's headed for Perth?

319
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:23,553
Course it bloody is.
Nowhere else for it to go.

(WHISTLE)

321
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,602
Hey! Come on, mate, we're here.

322
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:05,099
ARCHY: Perth?

323
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:08,440
Er... No, mate, not quite.

324
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:14,399
Morning.

325
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,264
We seem to have... lost our train.

326
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,518
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks! Bugger it!

327
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:31,016
Unless you're game enough
to cross the lake.

328
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:38,730
Hey, Arch, two weeks,
that's not too long...

329
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,618
- Hey, Arch, hang on!
- Better take this.

330
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:47,515
Hey, Archy, will ya... Arch!

331
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:53,119
Archy, we'll fry like eggs out there.
Let's give this a little thought, eh?

332
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,393
You'll never make it!

333
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:59,285
- Archy, wait!
- There's fifty mile o' that!

334
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,943
Oi!

335
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,189
If the snakes don't get you,
the black fellas will!

336
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,983
Wait!

337
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,785
You're mad. We should have waited.

338
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:16,910
It's quicker this way.

339
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,025
That's what Burke and Wills thought!

340
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:24,745
How do you know
we're not going in circles?

341
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:27,019
The sun.

342
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:31,161
- What if we run out of water?
- We find it.

343
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,995
- How do you find it?
- Cockatoos.

344
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,861
Sunset, they lead you straight to it.

345
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,357
Oh, that's lovely! We put our lives
in the hands of a mob of parrots.

(WIND WHISTLES)

347
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,664
What's all this watch business?

348
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,498
When you point twelve o'clock
to the sun,

349
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:04,063
north is halfway
between the hour hand and twelve.

350
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:09,039
- Can you ride, Frank?
- Yeah, why?

351
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:12,581
Just wondered why
you didn't try for the Light Horse.

352
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,164
Didn't want to.

353
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:17,248
- What then, infantry?
- I'm not joining anything.

354
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:21,373
- But you gotta be in it!
- Not if you don't want to.

355
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,647
You gotta be.

356
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:28,312
No, I don't. It's a free country,
or haven't you heard?

357
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,999
I'd be ashamed if I didn't fight.

358
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:35,499
That only proves one thing...
that you and I are different.

359
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,985
Let's drop it, eh?

360
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:43,040
You of all people should be going.

361
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,165
Why me of all people?

362
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,249
Cos you're an athlete.

363
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,832
(LAUGHS) What's that got to do with it?

364
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,124
I've mates who'd be lucky
to run the hundred in twelve

365
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:56,082
and they're going,
so why shouldn't you?

366
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,415
Because it's not our bloody war!

367
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,708
What do you mean, not our war?

368
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,916
It's an English war,
it's nothing to do with us.

369
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:08,027
You know what you are,
you're a bloody coward.

370
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:13,708
There's only one reason
I haven't knocked you down, mate.

371
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:14,938
What?

372
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,083
Cos I don't feel like carrying you.

373
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:24,526
Now shut up and don't open
your yap about the war again!

374
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:19,859
Where's your sun now?

375

Stop!

CAMEL DRIVER:
This would have to be your lucky day.

381
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,756
We were told there's a property
due south.

382
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:27,756
Old Dan's place.
You got about ten more miles.

383
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:29,881
He'd give you a ride to Wallaby.

384
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,214
- Where you headed?
- Perth.

385
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:37,006
I nearly went there once. Thought I should
see one big city before I die.

386
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,589
You looking for work?

387
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,715
- No, I'm off to the war.
- What war?

388
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,989
The war against Germany.

389
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:46,994
I knew a German once.

390
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,340
- How did it start?
- Don't start him.

391
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,715
Don't know exactly,
but it was the Germans' fault.

392
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:57,965
- The Australians fighting already?
- Yeah, in Turkey.

393
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:00,757
Turkey?! Why's that?

394
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:04,090
- Ask him.
- Cos Turkey's a German ally.

395
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,407
Ah, well, you learn something every day.

396
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,549
Still, can't see
what it's got to do with us.

397
00:37:11,649 --> 00:37:14,913
We don't stop them there,
they could end up here.

398

to set off without a compass.

00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:45,834
Not really. With a watch and the sun
you can find your way anywhere.

Why are you boys going to Perth?

- I'm going to join the Light Horse.
- Good.

You too, Frank?

Ah... no, business interests
to attend to.

414

on church doors in Belgium.

- WOMAN: I love their uniforms.

If I'd had a son, he'd have joined too.

about business interests?

Business interests, you know, finance.

- You told me you were broke.
- Hell, I am, thanks to you.

424
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:51,096
What would you have done
with the money if you'd won?

425
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:53,582
I was gonna start a bike shop.

426

They only take toffs
and farmers' sons in the Light Horse?

Well, there's no way
you'd get me near the infantry.

- Hang on.
- No, Frank.

It looks good.

- Oh, no... look...
- Hang on.

- A little glue, some hair.
- Oh, no.

- I've done it before, pal.
- Bugger off, Frank.

- Whisky doesn't make you look old.
- Doesn't it? Have you seen my dad?

but he's really only 35.

I should hope so!

918

What you're telling me, sir,
correct me if I'm wrong,

919
01:24:43,823 --> 01:24:47,806
is the infantry attack and our attack
on the Nek are just diversions.

920
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:52,331
Not just diversions, Major,
vitally important diversions.

921
01:24:53,698 --> 01:24:57,743
Tonight, 25,000 British troops
will land here at Suvla Bay.

922
01:24:58,823 --> 01:25:02,963
Our attacks are to draw the Turks
on us so the British can get ashore.

Sorry I didn't tell you
this before, secrecy is vital.

924
01:25:07,574 --> 01:25:09,515
But, sir, the Nek is a fortress,

925
01:25:09,615 --> 01:25:12,557
with five machine guns
at point blank range.

926
01:25:12,657 --> 01:25:14,057
We've considered that.

927
01:25:14,157 --> 01:25:17,432
We'll hit them with the heaviest barrage
of the campaign

928
01:25:17,532 --> 01:25:20,749
just before your men go over the top.

929
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,724
By the time we've finished,
there won't be a Turk within miles.

930
01:25:24,824 --> 01:25:28,599
The Turks can keep us pinned down
at Anzac forever.

931
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:31,807
This new British landing
is our only hope.

932
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:35,349
We must do what we can
to make it succeed.

933
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:40,141
Because if it does succeed,
we'll have Constantinople in a week...

934
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:43,266
and knock Turkey out of the war.

935
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:47,308
- So, everything's ready?
- All the guns are in position.

936
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:51,100
We start the bombardment at dawn
and stop at 0430, sharp.

937
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,459
That's... just over
twelve hours from now.

the measurements at random, too.

942

944
01:26:22,992 --> 01:26:25,476
The old ducks have sent
half a chemists'.

945
01:26:25,576 --> 01:26:28,684
A cook book?!
What do they think it is, a picnic?

946
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:32,726
- It's the thought that counts.
- It'd count more if they'd think.

947
01:26:32,826 --> 01:26:34,726
Oh! That does it.

948
01:26:34,826 --> 01:26:40,128
The bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago

SOLDIER: Sir, the British are at Suvla.

1109
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:05,716
- Are they meeting heavy opposition?
- None, sir.

1110
01:43:05,816 --> 01:43:10,216
Apparently the officers are sitting
on the beach drinking cups of tea.

1111
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:13,331
Tell Major Barton the attack is...

1112
01:43:14,066 --> 01:43:17,117
Just tell him I'm reconsidering
the situation.

1113
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,284
Yes, sir.

They're not going to make us go,
are they?

01:44:28,651 --> 01:44:30,825
No, there's no point.

1119
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:42,594
They should have gone, Barton.
Flags have been seen.

1120
01:44:42,694 --> 01:44:46,302
Not by me, sir. I've asked for
confirmation from General Gardner.

1121
01:44:46,402 --> 01:44:48,636
Your orders are to attack.

1122
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:51,844
The British must be allowed ashore.
Is that clear?

1123
01:44:51,944 --> 01:44:54,677
- You are to push on.
- It's cold-blooded murder.

1124
01:44:54,777 --> 01:44:56,702
I said push on.

1125
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:01,333
Right, sir.
