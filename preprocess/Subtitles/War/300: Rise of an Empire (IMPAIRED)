And Persian fire will
reduce Athens to cinder.

8
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:30,714
For Athens is a pile of stone
and wood and cloth and dust.

9
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,418
And as dust, will
vanish into the wind.

Only the Athenians
themselves exist.

The free men and women of Greece

are not bound by a
beautiful spartan death.

22
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,671
War is not their love.

when youth still
burned in our eyes,

before this bitter war forced
our children to become men.

Ten years ago,

32
00:02:55,301 --> 00:03:00,070
this war began as all wars begin:

33
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:03,207

00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:08,078
Marathon.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,548
The Persian king, Darius,

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,584
annoyed by the notion
of Greek freedom,

37
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,620
has come to Greece
to bring us to heel.

38
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:21,025
He makes landfall at
the field of marathon

which outnumbers the Greek
defenders three to one.

41
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:26,931
And so at dawn,

42
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:29,733
the hopeless Athenians
do the unthinkable.

43
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,802
They attack.

44
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,539
They attack the weary Persians
as they disembark their ships

45
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,876
on shaky legs after a month at sea.

46
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,345
They attack before they can
establish their war camp

47
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,380
and supply their soldiers.

48
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:48,152
And who is the architect
of this mad strategy?

49
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:51,288
A little-known Athenian soldier.

50
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,192
His men call him Themistokles.

51
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:59,930
He gives the Persians a taste
of Athenian shock combat.

Themistokles knew in his
heart he had made a mistake.

whose eyes had the stink
of destiny about them.

have killed that boy.

That glorious mistake
would forever haunt him.

And so it was Themistokles himself

who sent a ripple across
the Persian empire

88

only by her beauty.

For seven days, Xerxes mourned...

Paralyzed by grief.

00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,334
On the eighth day,

113
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:12,436
Artemisia whispered
the seed of madness

114
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,937
that would consume him.

115
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:18,308
Your father's words
were not a warning...

116

from every corner of the empire.

121

dipped in ancient potions...

123

00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:15,766
he surrendered himself completely

133

no part of a human man
that was Xerxes survived.

136

His eyes blazed like Scarlet coals.

137
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:44,761
He was stripped, cleansed,

negotiate a truce.

Yes, yes, we must negotiate.

has ever profited a nation.

for Greece or not?

We must persevere as one nation.

onto our own self-interests.

need to defend Greece.

than our cities' ships.

there would be no

For every one Greek killed,

667

you must kill a thousand Persians.

was coursing through your veins.

that compels you to...
battle with such passion?

698
00:52:56,698 --> 00:53:00,501
Truth is, I've had
no time for family.

Leonidas was betrayed
by a hunchback.

for the fall of the hot gates.

You take this message

happened to Leonidas,

not be forgotten.

Without Spartans,
we're just farmhands.

Very well.

991
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:20,146
Then let us put our

and free those ships from
