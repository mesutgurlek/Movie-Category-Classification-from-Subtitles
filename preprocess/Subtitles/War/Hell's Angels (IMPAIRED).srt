How do you do, sir?

306
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:40,069
There's she is.
Don't point. It's rude.

Hello.
Hello, old thing.

310
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,455
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.

311
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:56,153
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?

312
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:59,095
How do you do?

313
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:02,600
Well, that's done at last.

314
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:05,000
You know, you two have been
avoiding each other for weeks.

315
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:09,272
Helen, may I have
this next dance?

What? Oh, of course.

317

Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.

318
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:18,643
I must say, you take your duties
on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:21,413
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged
my program.

320
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,080
There are no end of things
to be done. Helen dear,
you don't mind, do you?

321
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,181
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.

322
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,955
Uh, Monte, would you take
this next dance with Helen?

323
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,519
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.

But, I mean,
Roy will be quite upset
to find you gone.

That's what he gets
for being on committee.

Yes, are you?

Oh, yes.

420
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:09,645
You know, it seems strange
being here like this after hearing
Roy rave about you for months.

421
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,410
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.

Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.

423

I can understand
his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.

You're not a bit
like Roy, are you?

I should say not.

426

Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.

427

He wouldn't approve of me either
if he knew what I'm really like.

Doesn't he know?
No.

When I'm with Roy,
I'm the way Roy wants me to be.

That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.

431
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,675
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.

432
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:51,178
May I ask you
a very personal question?

433
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:54,487
Yes.
Do you love Roy?

434
00:36:56,561 --> 00:37:00,019
No, not really.
Not the way Roy
wants me to love him.

435
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:03,590
I can't. Roy's love means
marriage and children...

436
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,898
and never anyone but Roy.

437
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,666
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.

438
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,674
I wanna be gay
and have fun.

439

Life's short,
and I wanna live
while I'm alive.

I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.

I think I'd better go.

Well, then you're rotten too.

You!
Well?

Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.

God, that's funny.
Get out of here!

We started to climb, but it was too late.

Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.

720
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:11,228
you all know
the central munition dump at Spraug.

721
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:14,174
You've tried three times
to bomb that depot without success.

722
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:17,269
<i>No fault of yours, of course, </i>
<i>they've guarded it too closely. </i>

723
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:22,774
That munition depot at Spraug
must be destroyed tomorrow morning.

724
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:28,246
Now, then, today a German bombing plane
was forced down within our lines.

725
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:31,851
<i>We were lucky enough to capture it</i>
<i>before they had a chance to destroy it. </i>

726
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:34,589
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.

727
01:17:34,663 --> 01:17:38,656
We want to use this plane
to bomb the Spraug depot.

728
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:41,726
There's no question that
the venture will succeed this time.

729
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:45,797
The enemy won't suspect
one of their own planes
until after the depot is bombed.

730
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,671
Then when they discover the trick,

731
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:51,577
<i>well, you</i>... <i>you may have</i>
<i>a little difficulty in getting back. </i>

I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?

734
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:03,583
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.

735
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,786
I'll go with him, sir.

736
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:09,456
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte
and Roy Rutledge, sir.

737
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:13,365
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.

738
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:17,498
Now, young men,

739
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:23,005
I want you to realize
how important this is.

740
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:28,072
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered
to go over the top in a surprise attack
tomorrow evening at dusk.

741
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:32,918
The brigade doesn't know it,
but l- I'm afraid they're
going to be slaughtered.

742
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:35,320
There's too much artillery
in front of us.

743
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:37,859
If you destroy that munition depot
early tomorrow morning,

744
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:41,259
it will weaken the enemy artillery,
and we may be able to get through.

745
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:44,993
Hundreds of lives
depend on you.

746
01:18:45,067 --> 01:18:47,058
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

747
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:50,128
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly...

748
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:53,868
is far too dangerous
a piece of armament
to let the enemy recapture it.

749
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:56,934
It must return
or be destroyed.

750
01:18:57,012 --> 01:19:00,175
If you were captured,
you'd be shot as spies anyway.

<i>You might possibly help them</i>

<i>By all means. </i>

754
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:10,851
Yes, sir.

01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:14,089

and final instructions
just before taking off.

Until then, let them do as they please.

- Yes, sir.

758
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:22,329
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

- Do you think they'll
let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course. We're "it" tonight.

763
01:19:41,523 --> 01:19:44,117
Yeah. We're "it" all right.

764
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:49,224
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.

765
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:52,631
I'm not even gonna
think about it until 3:00.

01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:58,262
Oh, perhaps I'll do without
the song tonight.

across the street.

770
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:22,088
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me
to see Helen?

Oh, I better not.

Where's Helen?

01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:35,733
She's gone out.
Oh.

774
01:20:35,811 --> 01:20:39,303
Was she expecting you?
No.

775
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,214
Would you care
to leave a note?

776
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:44,275
Yes, I think I will.

You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.

Hello. What's up?
She isn't in.

782
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:32,854
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
