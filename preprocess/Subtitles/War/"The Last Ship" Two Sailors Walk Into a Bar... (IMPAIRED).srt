back in less than five.

165
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,677
I have the vaccine!

166
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,580
[Breathing heavily]

167
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:17,881
The monkey survived.

168
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,251
The last damn monkey.

169
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:23,554
Are you saying you have the vaccine?

170
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,592
- A vaccine that works?
- Well, in an ideal world, I'd...

171
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,595
Do more testing, but... Yes.

172
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,698
Which means Ruskov doesn't need me anymore.

173
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,200
You can send him a dose in exchange

174
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,601
for Tex and the captain.

175
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,436
Ruskov won't just take your word for it.

176
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,105
He'll want to make sure.

177
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:44,775
Well then I'll show him myself.

178
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,144
I'm no longer essential on this ship.

179
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:50,047
From here on in, it's merely a case of

180
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:52,115
mass-producing the vaccine
from my original formula.

181
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,707
But, Doctor...

182
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,451
I can show doc Rios
everything he needs to know.

183
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,154
And if extra help is
required, I'm sure you can

184
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:58,822
strike a bargain with Quincy.

185
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,224
I can't let you go.

186
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,559
Ruskov asked for me.

187
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,027
And I won't do a thing for him

188
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,963
until he releases Tex and the captain.

189
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,965
Danny: Ma'am, you don't realize
what you're signing up for.

190
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,833
You would be Ruskov's slave for life,

191
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,235
or until he decides to kill you.

192
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,837
Look, we all know

193
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,440
he'll chase us to the ends of the Earth.

194
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,444
This is the only way to stop him

195
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,246

You've looked better. [Sighs]

00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,465
Oh, you should have seen the other guy.

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
There was only one?

209
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,002
He was a big unit.

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,338
No sense of humor.

You want to know the kicker?

212
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,375
He didn't even ask me any questions.

213
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,878
Hey! No talk,

- or I kiss your ass!

Just shut up your head, okay?

217
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,556
[Lowered voice] I spoke
to our friend from Chicago.

218
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,591
If I know Mike,

219
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:44,161
he's planning on paying us a visit.

220
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,562
[Lowered voice] We'd better find a way

221
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,030
to make him feel welcome.

222
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:53,537

run on a C.O.N.A.S. system.

That's combined nuclear
and steam propulsion.

There's a soft spot
you're gonna have to find.

00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,687
But you're gonna have to be careful, sir.

231
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:12,322
There could be a meltdown if
you use too many explosives.

232

Yeah, and we're all
dead and we lose the C.O.

- Right.

00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,744
This is a .45 caliber pistol.

239
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,579
Excellent knock-down
power, but the trade-off

240
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,147
is that it's large and heavy.

241
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,950
It's a got an 8-round magazine, loaded.

242
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,085
And I'm gonna give you an extra.

243
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Let's hope you won't need it.

244
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,555
And lastly, the suppressor.
It's highly effective.

245
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,457
Without it, you'll wake up the entire ship.

You gave your word that you'd let them go.

that you've delivered what I've requested.
