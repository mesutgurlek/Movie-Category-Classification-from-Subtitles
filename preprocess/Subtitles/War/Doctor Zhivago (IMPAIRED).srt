- Some of them.

In reformatories since being picked up.
Jobs like this. It's degrading.

7

You shouldn't use

- How did you come to be lost?

- Was Komarovsky your father's name?

It's a common name.

I should want to know.

your father was a poet?

I told myself it was beneath my dignity...

...to arrest a man
for pilfering firewood.

851

But nothing ordered by the Party
is beneath dignity...

01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:36,851
...and the Party was right.

853

One man desperate
for a bit of fuel is pathetic.

854
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:44,233
Five million people desperate for fuel
will destroy a city.

855
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:49,739
That was the first time I ever saw
my brother. But I knew him.

856
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:52,993
And I knew that I would
disobey the Party.

857
01:39:53,203 --> 01:39:56,705
Perhaps it was the tie of blood
between us, but I doubt it.

"Get hold of a man's brother,
and you're halfway home."

Nor was it admiration
for a better man than me.

I did admire him, but I didn't
think he was a better man.

I told them who I was.

01:42:10,839 --> 01:42:15,468
The old man was hostile.
The girl, cautious.

877

My brother...

878
01:42:18,807 --> 01:42:20,933
...seemed very pleased.

879
01:42:24,145 --> 01:42:28,232
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at their position.

880
01:42:29,567 --> 01:42:32,903
You're just as I imagined you:
you're my political conscience.

881
01:42:33,112 --> 01:42:37,616
I asked him, hadn't he one of his own?
And so he talked about the Revolution.

882
01:42:37,826 --> 01:42:42,329
You lay life on a table, and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

883
01:42:42,539 --> 01:42:46,000
I told him if he felt like that,
he should join the Party.

884
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:49,711
But cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

885
01:42:49,921 --> 01:42:55,092
Someone must keep life alive while you
do it, by living. Isn’t that right?

886
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:57,553
I thought, then, it was wrong.

887
01:42:58,054 --> 01:43:01,889
He told me what he thought
about the Party and I trembled for him.

888
01:43:02,099 --> 01:43:06,853
He approved of us, but for reasons
which were subtle, like his verse.

889
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:10,815
Approval such as his could
vanish overnight. I told him so.

890
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:14,402
Well, I can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

891
01:43:14,612 --> 01:43:18,574
He was walking about with a noose
round his neck and didn't know.

892
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:22,661
So I told him what
I had heard about his poems.

893
01:43:24,914 --> 01:43:26,832
Not liked?

894
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,333
Not liked by whom?

895
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:31,460
Why not liked?

896
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:34,130
So I told him that.

897
01:43:42,723 --> 01:43:46,602
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self-indulgent"?

898
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:48,854
I lied.

899
01:43:49,981 --> 01:43:51,648
But he believed me.

900
01:43:52,108 --> 01:43:55,819
It struck me through
to see that my opinion mattered.

901
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,781
The girl knew what it meant,
what it was going to mean.

902
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:03,118
They couldn't survive
what was coming in the city.

903
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:06,413
I urged them to leave and live
obscurely in the country...

904
01:44:06,623 --> 01:44:08,623
...where they could
keep themselves alive.

at Varykino near Yuryatin.

907
01:44:17,175 --> 01:44:21,929
He didn't resist. I offered
to obtain permits, passes, warrants.

908
01:44:22,138 --> 01:44:25,057
Told them what to take
and what to leave behind.

909
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:32,940
I had the impertinence to ask him
for a volume of his poems.

910
01:44:33,566 --> 01:44:35,275
And so we parted.

911
01:44:35,485 --> 01:44:39,029
I think I even told him that we would
meet again in better times.

You can imagine how I wanted parents.

1572
03:16:50,762 --> 03:16:53,722
I wanted to die when I was a child.

1573
03:16:54,099 --> 03:16:55,182
You know?

1574
03:16:58,186 --> 03:17:00,604
Now I don't know.

1575
03:17:01,856 --> 03:17:04,816
I can't be of any use to them now,
can I?

1576
03:17:05,442 --> 03:17:08,320
I was hoping I might be
of some use to you.

1577
03:17:10,365 --> 03:17:12,616
- Will you think about it?
- Yes.

1578
03:17:18,958 --> 03:17:20,834
It's all right, David.

1579
03:17:24,130 --> 03:17:25,213
You work here?

1580
03:17:25,423 --> 03:17:26,881
Yes, I'm an operator.

1581
03:17:27,133 --> 03:17:30,468
- And what do you operate?
- That.

1582
03:17:46,988 --> 03:17:49,072
You've promised to think about it.

1583
03:18:01,961 --> 03:18:03,212
Tonya!

1584
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:06,507
Can you play the balalaika?

1585
03:18:06,717 --> 03:18:09,719
Can she play? She's an artist!

1586
03:18:09,970 --> 03:18:12,638
YEVGRAF:
An artist? Who taught you?

1587
03:18:12,848 --> 03:18:14,098
No one taught her.

1588
03:18:14,558 --> 03:18:15,642
Ah.

1589
03:18:16,728 --> 03:18:18,604
Then it's a gift.

1590
03:19:55,733 --> 03:19:57,734
