if you make me into a thief again?

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
It isn't thieving when you're hungry, Davi.
First thing any soldier learns.

11

Now go on, get on with you.

(STAMMERING) Yes, yes, you fellow.

it's customary to report to the officer of the day.

Reporting from Srirangapattam.
Orders for Major Crosby, sir.

20

You're here for the cartridges we recovered.

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,800
Yes, sir. 80,000, sir.
For the armoury at Srirangapattam.

do you expect to transport 80,000 cartridges?

-On your back?
-Bullock, sir.

32

I brought an interpreter, sir.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,880
Every inch the Crown soldier.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,480
Go and find your damn carts, Sergeant Sharpe.

to feed the King's troops here.

-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

-Yes, sir. From Norfolk, sir.
-Good.

69

Too many damn Scots in the Company these days.

Too many Scots and Irish.

A Maratha princeling with a heart for rebellion
and a taste for English blood.

Who is he?

Khande Rao, the Rajah of Ferraghur.

127
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
I should hardly call him common, Rawlinson.

128
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,880
Since he came to power, attacks on our forts
and hill stations have increased tenfold.

129
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,480
And with each success,
more Pindari bandits come to his side.

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,880
How come this man has succeeded
where many others have failed?

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,480
Though Khande Rao
ascended his father's throne last summer,

132
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
he's not yet in his majority.

133
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
It seems the late rajah's favourite concubine
is ruling as regent.

-Just so.

135
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Albeit one acting under advice and guidance
of a renegade East India Company officer.

136
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,200
Our intelligence officer in Agra
recruited a horse master

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,880
supplying the Company with mounts
to discover the renegade's identity.

138
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,200
Alas, nothing's been seen or heard of the fellow
this past six months.

139
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,680
We need someone who knows the country
to determine what's become of him.

140
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,080
And, if the worst has befallen,
to see his mission through.

141
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,480
You want me to go back to India?

142
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
This uprising must be stopped, Sharpe,
by whatever means.

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
One resourceful man may achieve
what an army cannot.

144
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Your Grace, my soldiering days came to an end
on the ridge of Mont St John.

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I am grateful of the opinion
in which you hold me

146
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,880
but a man's luck only holds so long.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,280
Damn it, Sharpe. The rat is in the bottle.
No one else will do.

148
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,280
India is a very tinderbox
that waits upon the merest spark.

149
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,280
Should Khande Rao's resistance prove successful,

150
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,080
our days as the dominant power
in that country would be numbered.

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,880
That may be so, my lord.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,880
But what happens in India is the business
of men of influence and great import

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,480
and not of a farmer.

154
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,200
I regret I must respectfully decline.

155
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
That is your last word?

156
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm sorry I cannot prevail upon you
to change your mind, Colonel.

for having kept you waiting.

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,280
hoping to gain the answer
to a question that greatly troubles me.

318
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
Perhaps you can confirm
whether my augurs read the signs right.

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,880
Will your army lay siege to us here
at Ferraghur before the rains come?

320
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,600
In the army of His Britannic Majesty, sir,

321
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,280
the plans of great generals
are not confided to mere captains.

322
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
A pity.

323
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,080
You will convey for me then a message.

324
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,080
A message to your army
camped upon the Northern Plains.

325
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,480
You should know that England
does not parley with brigands, sir.

326
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,280
Oh, but you mistake me, Captain,

327
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,280
for I make no offer of parley.

328
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,680
(CELIA SCREAMING)

329
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Is the prisoner fit for punishment,
Sergeant Bickerstaff?

330
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Prisoner fit for punishment, sir.

331
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,600
Very well, do your duty.

332
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
One!

333
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Two!

334
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,800
No, no, no!

335
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
By God, sir, but this won't do!

336
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Lay it on hard, man. Don't tickle him!

337
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,680
You heard General Simmerson, lay it on!

338
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,280
And keep those strokes high, above his trousers.

339
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,880
Three!

340
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Four!

341
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,880
-What's this poor sod done, then, Simmerson?
-Five! Six!

342
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,080
-Farted upwind of your nobility?
-Eight!

343
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
Wait!

344
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,480
Sharpe!

345
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,600
I see time has done nothing
to improve a want of etiquette in you.

346
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Still the same
whore-mongering gutter trash of memory.

347
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
Aye.

348
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,880
And you're still the same cruel, flogging bastard.

349
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,080
Cruel, sir? I calls it discipline.

350
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,400
This fellow was caught wearing paint and earrings
on parade, if you please.

351
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,680
Joys, he names 'em.

352
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
Joys.

353
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,200
The marks and trinkets of his idolatry.

354
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,200
Well, I won't have it, sir.

355
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,400
Sepoys they may be,

356
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,480
but this is a Christian army
and I will see things done the Christian way.

357
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,000
There's no doubting that.

358
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
What's your business here, Sharpe?

359
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,680
My business is with General Burroughs.

360
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,280
Indeed.

361
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,200
-How long?
-About a month or so.

362
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,080
The fever ebbs and flows but, alas,

363
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,480
never leaves him in sufficient health to command.

364
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
So who's in charge?

365
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,880
Back so soon, General. I thought you to be
at your pleasure some time yet.

366
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,800
Bad tidings, McRae, bad tidings.

367
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,400
And no worse a messenger
to bring 'em than Richard Sharpe.

368
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,280
That would be, uh, Colonel Sharpe, sir.

369
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,400
I do not remember Mr Sharpe
as holding a commission in this army.

370
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm here at the express wish
of Horse Guard, General.

371
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
See if you can remember that.

372
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,400
London wants this uprising
put down hard and fast, before it spreads.

373
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
My orders are
to lend what aid I can in that regard.

374
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,480
Then you are indeed welcome
to our company, Colonel.

375
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,880
Hector McRae,
special advisor to General Burroughs.

376
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
John Stokes, Major of Engineers.

377
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Glad of the acquaintance, Colonel.

378
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,800
-This is my fellow traveller...
-Mr Harper, isn't it?

379
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,600
-I'd a fine bay mare of you some months back.
-That you did.

380
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,080
I hope she's giving you good service, sir.

381
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,480
You should be wary of this one, McRae.

382
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,480
He thinks
'cause Wellington raised him up from the sewer

383
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
that it somehow makes him a gentleman.

384
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,480
-But he don't know his place. Do you, Sharpe?
-Maybe not.

385
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,080
But I know I had to stand before a French column.

386
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,080
I know how to face fire without
soiling my breeches and turning tail.

387
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,080
You spoke of bad news, General.

388
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,680
I regret to report that the escort transporting
General Burroughs' daughter

389
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,200
was overcome by a force of Khande Rao's men.

390
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,280
Miss Burroughs and Captain Lawrence
have been taken captive.

391
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,880
You see, McRae, what did I tell you?
Bad tidings indeed.

392
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,080
First General Burroughs indisposed, now this.

393
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,480
I shall send to Agra for reinforcements
and further orders.

394
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,280
Further orders? What further orders do you need?

395
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The second rule of war, Sharpe,

396
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,880
which you'd know if you'd ever learned anything
beyond insolence towards your superiors,

397
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,600
is never reinforce failure.

398
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,800
Oh, I know that rule.
Though by that bird shit on your shoulder,

399
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,000
it seems this army's resolved
to prove you its living exception.

400
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Sir, if Major Stokes' artillery
is to breach the walls of Ferraghur,

401
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,400
we must move against the fortress
before the rains come.

402
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,880
I shall consider your advice, of course, McRae.

403
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
And what does that mean?

404
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,600
-We wait?
-We wait, sir.

405
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
What of General Burroughs' daughter?

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
Well, what do you want?

410
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,080
To gloat on my misfortune?

411
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,080
I thought perhaps...

412
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
Do you imagine I would accept anything
from you after all you've done?

413
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,480
My father will not stand idly by, madame.

414
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,680
Even now, he will be marshalling his army.

despite his being a Frenchman,
Gudin is making progress.

421

And when will they be ready?

422
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,800
Soon, Madhuvanthi.

423
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Soon.

424
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,880
And after you've made the Plains
run red with English blood,

425
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,880
once you have ground them into the dirt,

426
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
what then, my love?

427
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
Patience, Madhuvanthi.

428
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,880
Patience?

429
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,680
Have I not been patient?

430
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,280
And more.

431
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
You know it.

432
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,880
Did I put Khande Rao on his father's throne
for your ambition to fail you now?

433
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,680
Have we not come far already?

434
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,400
Or do you forget?

435
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,880
A Company lieutenant with no prospect
of advancement and a favoured courtesan.

436
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
Now I am a general

437
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,680
and you a regent.

438
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,800
I shall not be Regent forever.

439
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,680
Soon Khande Rao will attain his majority
and I shall be put aside.

440
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,200
But perhaps you weary of me, my love.

441
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,280
Is that it?

442
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,480
You want someone younger to rule beside you.

443
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,480
Lalima, perhaps.

444
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,480
I've seen how you watch after where she walks.

445
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,080
I'd keep a close eye on her
because I do not think she's entirely to be trusted.

446
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,480
She's of no consequence.

447
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,280
She'll do as her brother orders
and if she does not, she'll suffer for it.

448
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,800
All I ask, my love,

449
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,080
is that you do not make me wait too long
for what is rightfully ours.

450
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
When I tells you to shine my boots, Private,

451
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,400
I means I wants them gleaming!

452
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,280
But, Sergeant Bickerstaff, you know full well
that as a Hindu to work with...

453
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
Oh!

454
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,680
A Hindu says he. A Hindu.

455
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,480
What's a Hindu then, eh?

456
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,280
Know what I bloody hates the livelong day?

457
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,880
There's no Hindus here!

458
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,280
<i>Neither the Hindu nor Musulman</i>

459
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,280
nor gabardine Joe!

460
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,680
You signed on as a soldier, Private,

461
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
and a soldier I'll make of you yet.

462
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,680
I signed on to fight for your army,
not to clean your boot for you.

463
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,480
Do you tell me, boy?

464
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,080
I can see Shadrach Bickerstaff

465
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,880
has to teach you better to mind your manners.

466
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,480
-All right, stand off, Sergeant.
-Mind your damn business!

467
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,200
Don't make me tell you again.

468
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,200
Who the bloody hell are you to give me orders?

469
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,680
You're no Company officer.

470
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,280
No, Sergeant Bickerstaff, I'm not.
I'm from a proper army

471
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,080
that knows how to deal
with bullying bastards like you!

472
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
Now, you raise your arm to this man
one more time for no reason,

473
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,600
and you'll have me to deal with. Now stand off.

474
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,480
-Oh, what's it to you?
-What's it to me?

475
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,080
Nowt, beyond I know what it's like
to be on the end of a sergeant's beating.

476
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,080
-Now stand off!
-Easier to be brave

477
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,400
with rank and noon sunlight behind.

478
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,080
I hope you sleep light, Colonel.

479
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,080
Lest you find some morning
you wake up to find your throat slit.

480
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
-Is that a threat, Sergeant?
-Take it as you please.

481
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,000
Oh, I do. So come on,
let's sort it out here and now. Just you and me.

482
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
(LAUGHING)

483
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I weren't born yesterday neither, Colonel.

484
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,000
'Tis a hanging offence to strike at an officer.

485
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,800
-But like you said, I'm no Company officer.
-All the same.

486
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,800
I'll not hit a man wearing the King's uniform.

487
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,480
No? No? Well, that's easily remedied.

488
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Officers!

489
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I've shat 'em.

490
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
Shadrach.

491
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,080
All right, all right! Clear off.

492
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,280
Next time I give an order,
you bloody jump to, understood?

493
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Aye, sir.

494
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,280
Richard!

495
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,480
Come on to me with a knife, will you?
You little gutless bastard!

496
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
Had enough, Shadrach?

497
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,000
(BELLS JINGLING)

498
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,680
The French heavy cavalry came on in good order,

499
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,400
the morning sun glinting on their sword tips.

500
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,680
But my heart was not dismayed.

501
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,680
What do you say, Stokes, which suits better?
Glinting or glimmering?

502
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Stokes!

503
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
-Sir?
-Glinting or glimmering?

504
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,680
Um...

505
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,680
-As you have it, sir. As you have it.
-Yes, yes, I think so, too.

506
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,680
Glinting. Set it down, set it down.

507
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,480
My troops as one, look to their leader for, for...

508
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
What? What is this?

509
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,000
I have said that when I am about
my literary business, I am not to be disturbed.

510
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,080
What is it?

511
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,880
A message from Khande Rao.

512
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,800
Poor Captain Lawrence.

513
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,480
They killed him with a nail, McRae.

514
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,880
A nail driven into his skull!

515
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,680
It was, General, but not by any hammer.

516
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,400
<i>This is the work of jetties,
professional strong men.</i>

517
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,880
Killing people in interesting ways
is part of their remit.

518
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,680
There's a note along with the thing.

519
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,280
Written in their heathen script.
Perhaps you'd oblige me, McRae.

520
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,000
It is a short message and to the purpose, General.

521
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,600
If we attack Ferraghur, Khande Rao
will kill General Burroughs' daughter.

522
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,800
You see, gentlemen? As I thought.

523
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,880
Our best course lies in caution.

524
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,280
The longer we leave him unchallenged,
the stronger he gets.

525
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
Khande Rao has got
over 3,000 troops at Ferraghur.

526
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,480
Another month, it could be double that.

527
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
No matter their strength,

528
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,600
a bandit rabble in want of discipline will never
stand against a well-trained European army.

529
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,480
That must be why they have a bunch
of Frenchmen teaching them tactics, then,

530
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
under the command of a Colonel Gudin.

531
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,080
For a horse dealer, Mr Harper,
you seem remarkable well-informed.

532
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Well, sir, you see,
a horse dealer picks up more round and about

533
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,800
than just shit on his boots, sir.

534
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,080
Khande Rao is not just marshalling
his troops up there to look good.

535
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
-You must move now.
-I have said!

536
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,480
Damn it, sir, don't push me.

537
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,280
We will wait

538
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,680
until reinforcements and new orders
are arrived from Agra.

539
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
There is no more to say.

540
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,080
Get that damn thing out of here.

541
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
What do you reckon then, Pat?

542
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,480
-This Khande Rao, can we take him?
-Well, he has a reputation of being a real monster.

543
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,000
If he is a monster, Mr Harper,
then he's one of British making.

544
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,000
How is that, Captain?

545
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,280
The Company have only maintained the peace here
by keeping the princes at each other's throats.

546
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,280
Khande Rao's father...

547
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,880
(SCOFFS)

548
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,880
...he feared his neighbours
more than he hated the British.

549
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,480
And so it was your country
that kept him supplied with arms.

550
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,000
That sounds just like the English,
getting someone else to do its dirty work.

551
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,880
The son is not the father, however.

552
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,200
Khande Rao wants you out of our country
once and for all.

553
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,680
It is a view with which I cannot say
I do not have some sympathy.

554
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
So why are you fighting with us?

555
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,280
Khande Rao is a Maratha, Colonel,
a sworn enemy of my blood.

556
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,880
And that makes you my enemy's enemy.
And, therefore, a necessary evil.

557
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,880
Good day to you, both.

558
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,280
I don't think I like the sound of that,
a necessary evil.

559
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,480
-Have we ever been else?
-Hmm.

560
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,080
And there was me thinking
we were always on the side of the angels.

561
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,480
What keeps my brother from sleep?

562
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
I dreamt of our father.

563
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,680
He was angry with me.
I don't know why that should be so.

564
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,200
I shall ask the Brahmin what it means.

565
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
I try to be like him in all things.

566
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,680
To find his courage within me, that I may see
my people safely through these days.

567
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,400
No one doubts your courage, my lord,
nor your wisdom.

568
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,080
But surely a great prince is also merciful.

569
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
I speak of the white general's daughter.

570
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,880
My brother, what harm has she done?

571
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,800
Can it be right
to keep her locked alone in the darkness?

572
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,080
You think the British would treat you any better?

573
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,280
Then surely it becomes us to prove that
it is they who are the barbarians in this land.

574
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Release her to the guest quarters
here in the palace. I will stand surety.

575
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,680
Do this kindness for a sister who loves you.

576
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,880
-I will ask Madhuvanthi.
-Ask Madhuvanthi? That witch!

577
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,880
-You are the Rajah of Ferraghur.
-And she is Regent!

578
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Tell me, when the time comes
to surrender such power,

579
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,200
do you imagine she will do so gracefully
and rest content?

580
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,080
-She and Dodd...
-Do not task me, Lalima.

581
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,200
General Dodd has served us faithfully well
these past years.

582
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,280
It was our father's wish
that he remain in our service

583
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,880
and I will not go against that wish.

584
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,800
As my brother pleases.

585
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,880
You know what they are calling him?
In the town and in the fort.

586
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,800
The white Rajah. The white Rajah.

587
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,480
Take care, my little brother.

588
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Take care.

589
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,080
Christ, God, Sharpe! You heard his message.

590
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,600
Attack Ferraghur
and he kills General Burroughs' daughter.

591
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,280
Not if I can get her out.

592
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,600
Get her out? What fresh madness is this?

593
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,280
You want to lead a forlorn hope against Ferraghur,
is that it?

594
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,880
Have half my men killed on the walls,
then watch Celia Burroughs have her head nailed?

595
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,480
If Captain Singh and his lancers help me,

596
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,200
Mr Harper and I should prove sufficient to the job.

597
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,800
You and Harper, eh?

598
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,600
Oh, God knows...

599
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,800
I don't mind if you do die, Sharpe.
It's long past your time, ain't it?

600
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,680
If that's permission...

601
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,480
Oh, by all means. Go and die, Sharpe.

602
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,880
Go and die.

603
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,880
Mademoiselle, it is His Highness' wish

604
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,400
that you should be brought
to the guest quarters at the palace.

605
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,880
There you may bathe
and will be provided with fresh clothing.

606
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,400
I am well enough, sir.

607
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,400
It is not a request.

608
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,880
I have been a very poor father.

609
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,280
The effort of bringing Celia into the world

610
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,680
took my dear wife from me, do you see?

611
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,600
I may not always...

612
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,280
have concealed my resentment.

613
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,680
I'm sure that's not the case, sir.

614
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,400
A son could have followed me into the army...

615
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,880
but a daughter...

616
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,680
I placed career

617
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,880
before the duty a father owes to his child.

618
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,280
It's only now as...

619
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,280
the shadows lengthen and I realise,
like the base Indian,

620
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,400
the value of that which I squandered.

621
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,680
Bring her back for me, Colonel.

622
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,080
-Are we ready, Pat?
-As we'll ever be.

623
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,280
Godspeed, then, to you both.

624
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,080
-I trust your new quarters are more to your liking.
-General Dodd!

625
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,880
I hardly think it proper for you to be alone
in a woman's quarters.

626
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,000
Fortunately, madam,
there lies a region in which I am well-travelled.

627
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,280
-What is it you want?
-Merely to ask after your comfort.

628
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,080
To the best of my knowledge, sir,
you were once an officer in the British Army.

629
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,800
It was the East India Company in which I served.

630
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,480
But let's not split hairs over such trifling matters.

631
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,480
Your point?

632
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,000
My point, sir, is that if any vestige
of gentlemanly conduct

633
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,080
you must have absorbed
while in British Company remains,

634
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,400
I would urge you to act upon it.

635
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,880
Alas, madam, these past years,
I find I'm moved by impulses far more...

636
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,600
sub-equatorial.

637
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,000
If I understood you aright
the other evening, General,

638
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
you made a gift of me to the Rajah.

639
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,480
-What of it?
-Nothing.

640
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,480
I am merely imagining his disappointment

641
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,600
if he were to find that his gift
had already been unwrapped.

642
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Then you better wish a health unto His Highness

643
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,880
for he'll take more care in its opening than I will.

644
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,880
All right, I reckon this is about far enough, Pat.

645
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,680
Turn your coat round.

646
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,880
If Khande Rao's men see red coats,
they'll shoot before they ask questions.

647
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,880
<i>Wouldn't want that to happen now, would we?
Not with these jetti fellows to look forward to.</i>

648
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,480
She must be some looker, that's all I can say.

649
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,480
-All the trouble we're going to.
-Who must?

650
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,600
-The general's daughter.
-Saving Celia Burroughs ain't a mission, Pat.

651
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,000
We're going to Ferraghur to stop a rebellion.

652
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
You know as well as me
once the monsoon comes, that's it.

653
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,600
Khande Rao can afford
to sit tight in his fort and watch

654
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,400
while Simmerson's men starve for lack of supplies.

655
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,280
Then, when he's got them on the run,
when they're retreating,

656
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,280
he'll get his Pindari to carry them
all across the Plains, you know that.

657
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,680
So wait a minute. You and me,
we're gonna stop a rebellion, just the two of us?

658
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,680
Well, I don't see no bugger else.

659
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,080
Yeah... That...

660
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,080
That sounds just about right,
just as long as you let me know.

661
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,680
Shh!

662
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,680
What do you want?

663
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,080
I came to tell you I am sorry
you have been dealt with this way.

664
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,880
Keep your apology, madame. It's nothing to me.

665
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,400
We did not ask you British to our country.
And still you came.

666
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,600
But not as guests, nor in friendship.

667
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,680
-You came to plunder, nothing more.
-I came to be with my father.

668
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,800
We are not savages, madam,
whatever you might think of us.

669
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,000
All we want is to be left to run our own affairs.

670
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,600
I would be grateful if you would leave me.

671
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Promise me one thing, madam.
I have stood surety for your present surroundings.

672
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,000
Were you to attempt escape, I should suffer for it.

673
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,880
His Highness would not approve of you
being abroad at such an hour, Princess.

674
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,880
What my brother might or might not approve of
is hardly any business of yours, General.

675
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,280
Indeed not, madam.

676
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,200
However, the well-being
of his prisoner certainly is.

677
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,080
What did you want with her?

678
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,280
You are aware, madam, that as
Commander-in-Chief of His Highness' forces,

679
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,400
I am duty-bound to report this behaviour.

680
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,280
Nevertheless, I am willing to be persuaded

681
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,600
that your conduct was other than it first appeared.

682
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,800
Persuaded? And what about Madhuvanthi?

683
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,680
Or do you tire of a courtesan's tricks at last?

684
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,480
You should return to the palace, madam.

685
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,080
The streets of the fortress can be dangerous
after dark, even to one as highborn as yourself.

686
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,880
Should a common soldier mistake you
for something else...

687
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,200
who knows what accident might befall?

688
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,480
Don't look, I think we're being followed.

-No, sir, we're volunteers.

-Colonel Gudin.

If not, you will die.

702

I'm afraid General Dodd will insist upon it.

So, you wish to enlist in the army
of His Highness Khande Rao?

Aye, sir, that's why we're here.

And tell me, Sergeant Sharpe,
just why should I believe you?

706

I'm never sure deserters are to be trusted.

707

We were to be flogged, sir,
and lose us rank and all.

-Why?
-Accused of thieving, sir.

We didn't do it
but it was our word against an officer.

We had nowhere else to run, sir.

711
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,800
It were either offer ourselves here
or take our chances in the wild.

Why should I accept you
into His Highness' service?

-Fever seems to have him.

Intelligence from our scout says
that the British broke camp early this morning.

752
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,480

of the enterprise and are falling back to Agra.

-The door of opportunity is closing, madame.

the campaign until the autumn.

to avoid the confrontation.

779
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,600
<i>Mon dieu.</i>

780
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,200
Yet, here we are. Such is God's humour.

781
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,880
For all that, it's not so bad.
Good food, fair pay, when it comes.

782
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,200
<i>And beaucoup de bbs...</i>

783
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,680
Come on, Jacques, come on. Who was that
white lass that we see with the Rajah? Eh?

784
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,680
-That one's far beyond your purse, my friend.
-Oh?

785
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,000
The daughter of a British general.

786
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,800
-Dodd made a gift of her to the Rajah.
-A gift?

787
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,680
Much as another man might hang
a beautiful picture upon the wall,

788
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,400
His Highness likes to have her about him

789
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,080
while he makes his plans for war.

790
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,200
So amongst my other duties,

791
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,880
I am appointed her chaperone.

792
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,280
And escort her from the guest quarters

793
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,480
to wherever His Highness pleases.

794
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,080
Such is my misfortune.

795
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,280
Sounds like a funny misfortune to me.

796
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,280
She is very beautiful, yes.

797
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,600
<i>Mon dieu, quelle ptasse! Un shrew sans pareille.</i>

798
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,280
More arrack, Jacques. More arrack.

799
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,200
(LAUGHING)

800
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,280
-Whoa!
-Oh!

801
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,480
We shall all have sore heads tomorrow.

802
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,200
Well, you will, anyhow, Jacques.

803
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,600
(KEYS RATTLING)

804
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,480
I'll put him to bed.

805
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Come on.

806
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,600
(GASPING)

807
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,880
-If you please.
-Colonel Sharpe?

808
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,400
Sergeant Sharpe. At least for now. If you would.

809
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,080
-Forgive me...
-That's all right.

810
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,200
That's all right. Don't fret your self, you did right.

811
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,880
Sergeant Sharpe, might I assume this subterfuge,

812
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,800
indeed your very presence at Ferraghur,
is at my father's request?

813
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,680
-It is, ma'am.
-Then you've seen him. How is he?

814
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,280
I regret to say General Burroughs is
taken with the ague, ma'am.

815
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,880
He's taken pretty bad.

816
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,080
-And like to die?
-He looks a strong man, ma'am.

817
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,880
And he's in the best of care.
I don't doubt he'll mend given time.

818
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,200
Who, then, controls his army?

819
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,880
The army is at present
under the control of Sir Henry Simmerson.

820
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,800
Then it is indeed worse than I'd feared.
Papa holds Sir Henry to be of little account.

821
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Then your father's a good judge, ma'am.

822
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,080
I know Sir Henry of old, which is why we must
get you out of Ferraghur at first opportunity.

823
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,600
Have you a proposal
whereby our prospects might be improved?

824
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,200
I'm working upon it, ma'am.

825
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,000
But I'm also here to reconnoitre
the fort's defences against our attack.

826
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,800
Sergeant, if there is a choice
between getting me out

827
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,880
and taking what intelligence
you have to my father...

828
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,800
Whatever we do,
wherever we go, we'll go together.

829
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,880
Now, I must back to my building
before I am missed.

830
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,680
Don't you worry.

831
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,000
-Good night, ma'am.
-Thanks.

832
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,680
Barrel caked in powder.

833
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Come on.

834
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,000
Missing frisson spring.

835
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,000
SHARPE: Rusted dog screw. Would you say
this was good enough, Corporal Harper?

836
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,280
HARPER: That I wouldn't, Sergeant.
No, that I wouldn't.

837
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,280
What would happen if any of our men

838
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,480
kept their pieces in such a condition,
Corporal Harper?

839
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,280
Well, they'd have cause to curse their mothers

840
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,280
for ever bringing them
into this sorry world, Sergeant.

841
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,400
What the hell are two English soldiers
doing on my parade ground?

842
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,880
They are deserters, sir.
Eager to serve His Highness.

843
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,480
So you just thought you'd just let
two Englishmen walk into Ferraghur?

844
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,080
-My orders were to build an army.
-Colonel.

845
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,080
I think General Dodd's point is
how do we know they're not spies?

846
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,400
How can one tell, Highness? But I think not.

847
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,000
-I have questioned them.
-Oh, I think we can tell.

848
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,680
I think we can discover
what sort of soldiers they are, too.

849
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,880
How many rounds can you fire a minute?

850
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,280
One, maybe?

851
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,400
A good soldier, he can fire maybe three,
four rounds a minute.

852
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,480
DODD: Perhaps you should demonstrate, Sergeant.

853
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,480
Oh, aye.

854
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,880
Who might you be?

855
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,880
I'd be General Dodd, Sergeant...?

856
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,680
Sharpe.

857
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,800
Corporal Harper, sir.

858
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Load them.

859
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,800
Getting slow, Pat.

860
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,400
So, you can load.

861
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,800
-Can you shoot?
-Oh, aye, I can shoot.

862
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,680
-I can kill and all.
-Good. Good.

863
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,800
Then kill him.

864
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,680
What?

865
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

866
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,880
What's this?

867
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,680
Proof of your new-found loyalty to His Highness.

868
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,080
Kill him or I'll have you both shot as spies.

869
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,600
Sir, I've...served with this man for six years, sir.

870
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,280
Well, you must be bored of his conversation.

871
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,680
Don't try His Highness' patience, kill him.

872
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,400
-Pat.
-God love you, Richard.

873
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,280
Aim true for Christ's sake.

874
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,480
Hail Mary full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,

875
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,480
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

876
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,000
I know who the traitors are in here! I know!

877
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,200
Your army is gonna be utterly destroyed.

878
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,080
Charge! Enter!
