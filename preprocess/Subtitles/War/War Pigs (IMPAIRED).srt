00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:35,236
(Helicopters in distance)

2
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,042
(Men yelling)

3
00:00:54,088 --> 00:01:01,995
*

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,265
What do you have for me?

5
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,636
Orders from
battalion, sir.

6
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:12,540
You confirmed this?

7
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,408
Yes sir,
verified it twice.

8
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:16,910
Thank you.

9
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,750
Problem?

10
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,225
Hope that means
good news.

11
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,693
Not really.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,362
Orders to push.

13
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,563
Make a push?

14
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,030
They know where
we are, right?

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,567
They should.

16
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,770
Jack, this is wrong.

17
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,739
Yeah, I know.

18
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,876
Damn orders, right?

19
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,045
Yes sir.

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,548
Let's get it done,
Sergeant.

21
00:01:54,615 --> 00:02:06,794
*

22
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:43,997
*

23
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:54,141
*

24
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,345
Sir, it's a great
spot to be ambushed.

25
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,282
How much further?

26
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,283
Right here.

27
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,452
25 kilometers ahead.

28
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,187
Griff, take point.

29
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,526
We gotta get
out of here.

30
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:17,030
(Gunshots and yelling)

31
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:51,999
(Explosions and gunshots)

32
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,001
Dying won't save them.

33
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,669
We gotta take out
those MG's.

34
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,707
We've got to find
the flank.

35
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,842
You got it.

36
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,144
Stay low, stay low.

37
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:15,255
(Gunshots and yelling)

38
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,529
Six Jerrys,
what do you think?

39
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,196
One, two maybe.

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,032
They'd be on us before
we got the rest.

41
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,701
Guess their only hope is to
wait for a battle change.

42
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,702
I gotta get close.

43
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,137
Jack...

44
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,108
Keep your head
down, Sergeant.

45
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:45,986
(Gunfire)

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,909
It's about time.

47
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,911
You know what
they say...

48
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,614
You don't get tired of
saving my ass, Sergeant?

49
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,750
Never.

50
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,152
Damn you!

51
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,591
What'd you do?

52
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,992
What'd you do, huh?

53
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,094
I'm sorry, Jack.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,295
You're not going anywhere,
you're not going anywhere,

55
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,164
You hang in there,
you hang in there, ok?

56
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,604
Come on, soldier!

57
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,609
You better get
rolling, Jack.

58
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,011
Come on,
hang in there!

59
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:50,283
I'm sick of this fucking war.

60
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,786
*

61
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,789
You were a good man, Sergeant.

62
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:03,196
*

63
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:16,944
*

64
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:24,384
*

65
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:45,338
I'm sorry to hear
about your men.

66
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,207
Brass gave you the wrong orders,

67
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,912
And now you're taking the hit
for their fuck up.

68
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,849
You know what your problem was?

69
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,185
Not a god damn thing.

70
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,755
You followed orders.

71
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,356
I'm Colonel A.J. Redding.

72
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
Lieutenant Jack Wosick, sir.

73
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:15,202
Listen soldier, sorry about this
but you're gonna have to...

74
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,539
You're gonna have
to slap these on.

75
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes sir.

76
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,610
I've actually heard about
you before, Lieutenant.

77
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,579
How so, sir?

78
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,548
Everybody knows your name.

79
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:30,784
D-Day you attacked and held
a vital German position

80
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:36,724
At a crossroads for,
what, six hours?

81
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,259
Earned yourself a bronze star.

82
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,229
That night, sir, we were
dropped all over the place,

83
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,564
Gathered the troopers
I could find,

84
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,567
Just did what was necessary,
nothing more, sir.

85
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,737
A lot of men couldn't
have done that.

86
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,439
Soldier, you know
how to lead men.

87
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:57,244
You know how to lead men
when the shit hits the fan.

88
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,413
I'm putting together
a group of handpicked men

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,819
For a very special mission.

90
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:11,592
And I need you to lead them.

91
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,928
Respectfully, I think you
have the wrong man, sir.

92
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,098
No soldier,
I got the right man.

93
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,102
And I ain't got nobody else.

94
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,271
Lieutenant Wosick,
this is Captain Picault

95
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,440
Of the French
Foreign Legion.

96
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,444
The Colonel has
told me all about you.

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,115
I look forward to
fighting together.

98
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:40,854
Can I ask why me, sir?

99
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,591
Why not you, soldier?

100
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,362
I need you, I need
you back in the fight.

101
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,700
And not everybody deserves
a second chance.

102
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,209
What's on your mind, soldier?

103
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:10,050
If I do this, will I be
cleared of all the charges?

104
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:16,323
You got my word,
you bet your ass you will.

105
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,492
Then I guess that's a yes, sir.

106
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,295
I thought that might
be your answer.

107
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,169
Here are the folders on our men.

108
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:37,177
The um... War Pigs.

109
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:44,551
War Pigs... What's that about?

110
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,186
(Sighing)

111
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,588
Bless America.

112
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,863
Go, go, go!

113
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,798
This was a really terrible idea.

114
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,872
We gotta go, kid!

115
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,874
(Yelling in French)

116
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,876
I'm too young
to die.

117
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,212
(Gunshots)

118
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,949
(Yelling in French)

119
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,652
Stupid American!

120
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:27,961
(Men chatting)

121
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,562
Oh, what the hell is this?

122
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,965
It's good is what
it is, eat it!

123
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,238
It looks like bird shit
on a shingle.

124
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,940
Who put you in charge
of breakfast anyways?

125
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,641
You're welcome.

126
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,812
You should have seen
the kid earlier.

127
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,247
He had one hand full of eggs,
the other one full of balls.

128
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,749
(Laughter)

129
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,150
I wasn't scared.

130
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,252
Come on, you shit
your trousers, kid.

131
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,754
A few small prayers,
son, you're good to go.

132
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,588
Speaking of prayers,
preacher, you know,

133
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,624
I could use a little
heavenly help over here

134
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,326
With this hand, maybe
you could put in a word with

135
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,763
The big guy for me upstairs
regarding this hand?

136
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,666
You know what, I don't think
the Lord works that way.

137
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:14,607
Well, oh, he surely does
work in mysterious ways.

138
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,810
Stop distracting us from
your lousy hand, Sarg.

139
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,781
Alright, I got a...
whole lot of nothing.

140
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,015
I'm out.

141
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,851
Nobody's got any luck?
Come on!

142
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,319
Are you praying against us?

143
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,122
No, just against
you... I'm out.

144
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:29,990
I'll raise.

145
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,793
Now we're talking!

146
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,995
I'll see you, kid,
and I'll raise you two.

147
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:39,299
Oh, now we've got a game.

148
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,801
A lot of you guys seen combat?

149
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,869
Oh, ho, ho!

150
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,871
Kid wants to
see some action.

151
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,975
Moffatte over here, he captured
a whole kraut patrol...

152
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,142
Where was that?

153
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,010
Sicily.

154
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,144
Italy.

155
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,145
I'm still waiting for the medal.

156
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,146
It's coming in the mail, right?

157
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,614
Yes, the mail.

158
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,018
Preacher here, don't let this
clean cut routine fool ya.

159
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,654
No, he is one stone-cold
natural born killer, this one...

160
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
And Frenchy, he got
shot twice already,

161
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,826
He got shot in the leg,
and he got shot in...

162
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,660
Ahhh!

163
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,163
Ok, ok, thank you,
thank you.

164
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,665
We've stormed two beaches
together, seen three countries.

165
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,167
Been together
since basic.

166
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,169
Lucky bastard, you.

167
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,871
What about you?

168
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,173
Oh me?

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,675
Me, I just want to see the end
of this war and get on home.

170
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,212
Don't be too eager
to see combat, kid.

171
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,446
We've got it
pretty good here.

172
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,917
We got booze, we got cards,
we got grub...

173
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,185
We even got some dirty magazines
somewhere around here.

174
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,087
Hey, I'm still
using those.

175
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,388
(Laughter)

176
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,691
You go ahead and hang
on to those, Preach.

177
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,727
All I'm saying is there's
kids younger than you dying

178
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:45,698
In foxholes, dreaming
of half of what we got.

179
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,200
You think they're gonna send us
up to the front soon?

180
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,701
You can bet on it.

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,371
Scuttle is that we have a new
officer arriving presently.

182
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
where'd you hear that?

183
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,876
Same sorry sap in supply.

184
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,212
I'll tell ya, in a war, there's
really only two things that are

185
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,548
Gonna ruin your day and you
know what those are boys...

186
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,616
ALL:
Officers and orders.

187
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,452
Correct.

188
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,226
This might ruin your day, too.

189
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,627
Look at that.

190
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,397
You know what I'm betting,
we get some slob,

191
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,967
Gets us all killed.

192
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,201
You think?

193
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,071
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you're scaring him.

194
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,807
I'm not scared...
I'm not scared!

195
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,741
It's ok, it's ok.

196
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,478
Hey, we've got officers coming.

197
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,419
You're not German,
right, you're French?

198
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:46,426
Yes, my home was occupied
by the Nazis in '39.

199
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,328
I was conscripted
into the German Army.

200
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:52,432
So how'd you
end up here?

201
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,268
I grew up in
this region.

202
00:13:55,335 --> 00:14:00,773
I'm very good at getting men
in and out of enemy territory.

203
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,675
Is that right?

204
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:06,947
So what, the German army,
they just let you go?

205
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,617
I never believed
in Hitler's Germany.

206
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,320
Let's just leave
it at that, ok?

207
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,288
You got it.

208
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,958
Private...

209
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:24,464
Looking for August,
Sergeant, third squad.

210
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,866
What, you lost
your tongue, son?

211
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,335
No, sir.

212
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,369
You're talking about
the War Pigs?

213
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,870
That's right, yeah.

214
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,341
Respectfully, I don't envy you
if you're the new commander.

215
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,542
Why is that, private?

216
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,645
It's just that um,
officers don't really

217
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,814
Last that long
with them, sir.

218
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,984
Is that right?

219
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,553
That's right, sir.

220
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,221
You can find them
just down that way.

221
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,157
Just pass the
mess hall, sir.

222
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,324
Ok, good.

223
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,060
Thank you, private.

224
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,499
So everyone calls
them the War Pigs.

225
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,501
Must be a good story.

226
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,836
I guess we're gonna
find out, right?

227
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,604
Here we go.

228
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:09,676
Attention! Attention!

229
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,678
Able Company Third Squad,
I assume?

230
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,912
Yep.

231
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,382
I'm Lieutenant Wosick,
this is Captain Picault

232
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,017
From the French Foreign Legion.

233
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,352
And I heard you go by
the name War Pigs?

234
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,820
Why is that?

235
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:25,025
Well, we have a reputation for
rolling around in the mud.

236
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,693
(Snickering)

237
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,195
Well, good for you,
Sergeant.

238
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,863
Now you're the lucky volunteers
for a new mission.

239
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,201
And why would we
want to do that?

240
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,205
I assume you mean, why would
we want to do that, sir?

241
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,773
In the U.S. Army, we address
officers as "sir," Sergeant.

242
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,710
Or is that going to be
a problem for you?

243
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,879
No, sir.

244
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,383
We just want to know our
uh, orders, guidelines.

245
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,618
It's a long way to
the Rhine and it's my job

246
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,553
To make sure these boys
get home safe.

247
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,888
That's really sweet
of you, Sergeant.

248
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,226
Your orders are simple,
you just follow mine.

249
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,129
We clear?

250
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,563
Crystal.

251
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,399
Tomorrow we prepare for
that mission, soldiers.

252
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,236
So you can get
us all killed?

253
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:15,775
Lieutenant, Lieutenant...

254
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,910
I guess tomorrow you
formally join the U.S. Army

255
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,415
For the first time,
Sergeant.

256
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,584
Soldiers, 0500 hours
tomorrow, be ready.

257
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,618
That includes you,
Sergeant.

258
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,155
You're dismissed.

259
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:33,826
*

260
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,601
These men are rough.

261
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,470
They are rough.

262
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,440
Definitely an edge.

263
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,811
What do you think of them?

264
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,482
I think these are the men
we have to work with.

265
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,118
Do you think they'll
be able to follow orders?

266
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:02,622
Yes, sir, but I think you will
have to earn their respect

267
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,624
And gain their trust,
like everyone else

268
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:10,763
Who wants to make it
through this war alive.

269
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah.

270
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:29,982
A lot of men died following
me... following my orders.

271
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,822
It's not an easy thing
to send a man into battle.

272
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:41,894
Armies are run from
orders, Lieutenant.

273
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,332
I'm just not sure I'm
ready for it this time.

274
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:51,538
Yes you are, you just need
to leave the past behind

275
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,841
And focus on the task at hand.

276
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,410
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

277
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,718
I read your after action report.

278
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,687
It was pretty interesting.

279
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,857
Said you got your
orders mixed up.

280
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:16,696
You attacked the wrong
position at the wrong time.

281
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:23,370
No... Orders were FUBAR.

282
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,871
I knew it.

283
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,840
Followed them anyway.

284
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,714
So someone on top wanted you
to take the fall for their uh,

285
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,618
Their uh, screw-up?

286
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,820
Something like that.

287
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,294
Well look, uh, men died
because of your orders,

288
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,366
But more men lived
because of your orders.

289
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,910
This uh, Colonel Redding...

290
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,978
How well do you know him?

291
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,881
The mission, what do
you know about it?

292
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,291
Ever hear of Hitler's
wonder weapons?

293
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:22,161
I think the Colonel will
send us across enemy lines

294
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,331
For one of those.

295
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:38,345
We're counting on you to
lead... be there for them.

296
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,161
Ladies, what is this?

297
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,128
Get up!

298
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,733
(Metal clanking)

299
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,738
You got two minutes!
Grab your gear!

300
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,245
Yeah... yeah.

301
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,663
Would have been nice to see you
first assembled, Sergeant.

302
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,566
I expect my NCO
to lead by example.

303
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,336
Yeah, just like
you do, Captain?

304
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,005
Sorry, "Lieutenant."

305
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,673
You did your homework.

306
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,174
Good, shows initiative.

307
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,344
The captain and I will
make sure you are

308
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,514
The best damn squad
in the whole army.

309
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,584
Gentlemen, to forge
proper squad camaraderie,

310
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,186
You will need many tools.

311
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,256
Your first tool... endurance.

312
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,191
You know, were not taking
orders from no frog.

313
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,860
You listen to me, you're going
to accept orders from me,

314
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,595
From him, and any god damn
orders we throw at you,

315
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,196
Is that clear, Sergeant?

316
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,198
Orders like you gave your unit
before you got them all killed?

317
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,601
Ok good, let's start as
need to continue, shall we?

318
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,939
Courtesy of Sergeant August...
three miles double time.

319
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,614
Captain?

320
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,391
I've got a surprise for you
at the end of the line.

321
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,726
Soldiers, left face.

322
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,261
March.

323
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:46,473
*

324
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,074
Beautiful morning, ladies.

325
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,276
Pick it up, pick it up!

326
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:57,917
*

327
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,086
Come on, Motty, come on.

328
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,989
*

329
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,024
It's like basic, only worse.

330
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,595
Kill me now.

331
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,762
Sergeant, move it.

332
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,932
Pick it up.

333
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,301
Excellent.

334
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,636
The end of the line.

335
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:21,441
And now for the
surprise... voila!

336
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,175
What's that for?

337
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,317
Like an old lady, York.

338
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,621
Moffatte, you should be carrying
two of those things.

339
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,623
Nice one, Frenchy.

340
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,791
Move it, come on.

341
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,995
Sergeant, come on,
it's not play time.

342
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,298
Communication, gentlemen,

343
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,636
Is the soldier's
number one resource.

344
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:55,307
Modern technology allows for
mobile or direct contact.

345
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,813
In war, if you're
not communicating,

346
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,314
You're already dead.

347
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,650
(Snickering)

348
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:08,821
You think dying
is funny, kid?

349
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,726
Anyone here have
radio training?

350
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:16,328
I do, sir.

351
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:22,401
You wind it up, talk to someone
on the other end, piece of cake.

352
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,336
Easy, huh?

353
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,673
Talking is another
very valuable skill

354
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,040
We're gonna
learn from you.

355
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,376
No, no, no,
this is real good.

356
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:34,013
I'm sure you're very qualified
to teach our English lesson...

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,583
"Monsieur."

358
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,424
We may not have the luxury
of communicating so easily.

359
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:49,028
Understanding enemy movement
we may encounter in the field

360
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:54,567
Is crucial to staying alive.

361
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,068
Today we are going to learn
how to communicate about that

362
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,105
Using these... hand 'em out.

363
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,310
I guess we can
skip the basics,

364
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,213
I'm hoping you can all
read and write.

365
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:16,889
*

366
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:27,066
*

367
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,737
Everyone must have
basic drawing skills.

368
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,906
The ability to describe
and record what you observe

369
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,743
Is vital behind enemy lines.

370
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,580
Everybody... draw what you see.

371
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,148
You've got two minutes.

372
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,255
Ok, come on.

373
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,091
You're wasting your time.

374
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,126
Listen, I like fruit as much
as the next guy, Captain,

375
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:58,831
But what the hell
am I drawing it for?

376
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,266
Is that right, August?

377
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,770
You know, we thought
you might feel that way.

378
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,738
Plan B.

379
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:23,623
*

380
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,860
Gentlemen, please say hello
to Mademoiselle Collette.

381
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,298
Enchanté.

382
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:41,708
*

383
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:51,350
*

384
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:57,824
Hi, my name is August,
I'll be drawing you.

385
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,158
Doing great.

386
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,494
Two minutes?

387
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,997
Two minutes.

388
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,500
Take as long as you need, guys.

389
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:18,645
*

390
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:26,418
*

391
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:31,423
Land mines, gentlemen,
are not your friends.

392
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,361
The German land mines
come in many forms.

393
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,399
The worst ones are
the ones made from wood.

394
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,168
They really make
them out of wood?

395
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,871
Oh shit.

396
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,274
Captain, I think I got one.

397
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,279
It's a bottle, you idiot.

398
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,720
I don't get this.

399
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,388
What don't you understand
about land mines?

400
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,557
I just don't get what
we're doing this all for?

401
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,728
Sergeant, do you want to
keep your arms and legs?

402
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,963
Well, just my third leg.

403
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,500
Captain.

404
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:24,811
Right... the next exercise
everyone will enjoy.

405
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,914
*

406
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,751
(Speaking French)

407
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,754
Good job, York.

408
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:38,657
Be strong, Sergeant.

409
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,626
Good, Shank, better.

410
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,428
I don't know, Lieutenant,
I was enjoying learning

411
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,396
About those land mines.

412
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,467
The German K-98.

413
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,771
Now we all know you know
how to shoot it...

414
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:55,842
Now I want you to understand it
inside and out.

415
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,844
Go!

416
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,849
York, good job.

417
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,288
Again, faster!

418
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,590
Concentrate.

419
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,865
Go.

420
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,572
Again, faster.

421
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,382
You got anymore
brain busters for us?

422
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:42,288
Now let's see how well you do.

423
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,659
Yeah, it'll be
a piece of cake.

424
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,061
Ok...

425
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:56,668
So why don't we try it
blindfolded, courtesy of August?

426
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,570
Let's go.

427
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:15,221
So the training,
how do you think it's going?

428
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,090
They catch on quick.

429
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,192
Think they'll manage?

430
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,594
Yes, I believe so.

431
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,765
God, I hope you're right.

432
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,607
Why do you keep those?

433
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,777
They belonged to a
sergeant I served with.

434
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:47,954
Guess they remind me
what happens when I fail.

435
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,122
What happens?

436
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:59,899
He was killed...
following me.

437
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:07,439
He was a good leader...
and a great friend.

438
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:11,143
I don't think you
keep those tags

439
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,644
To remind you of
your failures.

440
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:17,884
I think you keep them 'cause you
can't get away from your past.

441
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,654
The squad, the men...

442
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,424
They will do the job
when the time comes.

443
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:29,161
Trust them.

444
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:37,436
I do... I just don't want
to get them killed.

445
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,271
Then don't.

446
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,441
Lead, they will follow.

447
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,044
I know it.

448
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,119
Today's lesson... rope climbing.

449
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,287
Soldiers, this is
gonna be fun.

450
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,323
Let's go!

451
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,058
You heard the
Captain... move!

452
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,136
Alright, kid,
you're up!

453
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,038
(Laughter)

454
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:22,748
(Men yelling and cheering)

455
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:36,195
(Men yelling)

456
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:48,174
*

457
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:57,083
(Laughter and yelling)

458
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,058
The art of the knife.

459
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:13,032
It's a deadly art that
none of you know anything about,

460
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,566
But with some practice,
can master.

461
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,003
We don't need lessons
from a frog.

462
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,674
(Snickering)

463
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,077
Are you ready?

464
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,113
Get the knife.

465
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,216
Ok sweetheart,
go get it.

466
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:34,386
Come on, Preacher!

467
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:40,392
Bet you wish you'd kept your
mouth shut, right Preacher?

468
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,727
(Laughing)

469
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,129
Come on!

470
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,797
There you go!

471
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,804
Let's go.

472
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,146
Proceed, proceed.

473
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,252
He's really good.

474
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,854
Your whole body is a weapon.

475
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,825
Preach...

476
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:28,107
There's more to knife fighting,
than fighting with knives.

477
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,110
A legionnaire is shown how
to use all his tools

478
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,480
As a potential weapon...
Knife, club...

479
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,282
Chin up, Preach.

480
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,785
Hands, feet, anything
that can kill a man.

481
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,788
Foreign Legion have a unique
way of using the knife,

482
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,957
As you can see, Captain Picault
here is going to show you a few.

483
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,296
Sergeant, you're
with the Lieutenant.

484
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,030
With pleasure.

485
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,132
You ready?

486
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,468
Yep.

487
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,470
Been waiting
for this.

488
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,207
I got, Preach,
he wasn't very good.

489
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,611
That leaves you
and me, kid.

490
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,020
I don't like you.

491
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,288
I know.

492
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,165
You are gonna get
us all killed.

493
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:26,898
Is that right?

494
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,400
Yeah, that's right.

495
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,239
(Choking)

496
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,147
(Grunting)

497
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,590
I'm not gonna stop.

498
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:55,427
I don't want you to stop,
I want you to fight.

499
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,528
You hear me?

500
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,063
I need you to
be a soldier.

501
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,265
It's the only way you're
gonna stay alive,

502
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,599
You understand me, huh?

503
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,268
Yes, sir.

504
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,778
Aug.

505
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,451
Hey, good job.

506
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,723
These legit, sir?

507
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,124
Yes, they are.

508
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,226
I had 'em made.

509
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,561
Great, patches of death.

510
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,232
They're not patches of death,
Preach, it's our new insignia.

511
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,100
Listen up.

512
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,403
Division finally sent
through our orders...

513
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,070
Any idea what those are, sir?

514
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,773
All I can say is we're
going behind enemy lines.

515
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,745
You think we're
ready, sir?

516
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,147
I know you're ready.

517
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:52,784
Are you ready?

518
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,920
Sergeant, if something
should happen to me

519
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,089
Or any of us while we are over
there, some of these men might

520
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,927
Look to you for leadership...
don't let them down.

521
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,429
Get some rest, all.

522
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,163
Bright and early
tomorrow morning.

523
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:13,605
No matter what FUBAR plan
he and Redding got cooked up,

524
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,842
Remember boys, I got
your six, copy me?

525
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,148
Remember, officers and
orders, right, huh?

526
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,352
Let's go.

527
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:33,259
*

528
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,134
So, we see the
Colonel tomorrow

529
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,203
Yeah.

530
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,845
Coffee?

531
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:58,817
Never liked coffee,
strong and black.

532
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,321
It can never beat
a nice Armagnac.

533
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,956
Yeah, yeah, I heard
something about that.

534
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,708
Better?

535
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:28,013
Mmm...

536
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,353
I haven't been this close
to home for five years.

537
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,224
Ten miles, down the main road,
make a right at the sawmill,

538
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:43,028
Keep the little stream
on your left...

539
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,264
Beyond the hedges, there's home.

540
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:52,871
You miss it?

541
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:58,043
You gonna go back?

542
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,278
After all this?

543
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:20,399
The Germans conscripted
me against my will.

544
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:28,574
My mother, she begged me not to
go, but what choice did I have?

545
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,146
A few months passed by
and my family went missing,

546
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,584
Gestapo were the last
people seen at the house.

547
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,586
What happened?

548
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:45,256
They were found in a shallow
grave outside of town.

549
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,426
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:53,932
So, I ran from the German
army, joined the legion,

551
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:58,637
Killed as many of those
Nazi bastards as I could.

552
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:05,677
So, you think
they're ready?

553
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:09,948
The men, yes.

554
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,018
I think so.

555
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,122
Well, we could always take them
on another little run

556
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,458
Through the forest.

557
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:21,326
That's a good idea.

558
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,463
We might end up with
a mutiny on our hands.

559
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,265
I think you're right.

560
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:36,875
Keep it, please,
keep it.

561
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,044
Merci.

562
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,980
Merci, Captain.

563
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,081
Salut.

564
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,901
Gentlemen, any of you heard
of a German millipede gun?

565
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,369
No sir.

566
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:08,073
I believe it's one of Hitler's
crazy new wonder weapons.

567
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,009
Basically, it's a 300 foot
barrel with 34 pairs

568
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:14,345
Of booster tubes
sticking out the sides.

569
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,915
It makes it look like
it has stubby legs,

570
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:20,919
That's why we call it
the millipede.

571
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,221
What does it do, sir?

572
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:26,024
Well, it's a high
pressurized canon,

573
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,526
It can shoot a five foot
artillery round

574
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,094
Hundreds of miles.

575
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,530
Division thinks they had one
fired on our boys

576
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,364
In Monte Casino.

577
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,033
How can they be sure, there's
been a lot of artillery

578
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,435
Dropped on Casino, sir?

579
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:42,207
Yeah well, they found a
round that didn't detonate.

580
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,076
Now this gun was tucked away
on the outskirts of Rome,

581
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,279
Hundreds of miles away.

582
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:52,951
A weapon this size
can take a steep hill.

583
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,053
Alsace is full of them.

584
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,222
Hill 314 suites
that purpose.

585
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:01,059
Now these pictures were captured
by intelligence in Italy.

586
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,061
We believe it to be
components of the gun

587
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,263
Before its construction.

588
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,899
A weapon that size
can cause a lot of problems,

589
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,300
Kill a lot of people, sir.

590
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,570
Yeah, I want you boys
to find out if they're

591
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,404
Building this fucking gun.

592
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,474
Yes sir.

593
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:20,712
Intelligence believes it's
being constructed right here.

594
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,919
Well, that's deep into
enemy territory, sir.

595
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:34,425
I trust that won't
be a problem.

596
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,595
We can manage.

597
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:42,433
Listen, I know it won't be
easy to get in, or get out.

598
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,770
Never is, sir.

599
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:49,941
Just get us the information and
get your asses out of there.

600
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,843
Yes, sir.

601
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,952
Looks like Hitler is
going to build himself

602
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,321
A new super weapon.

603
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,691
Division wants us to
go in and find it.

604
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,326
What does it do, sir?

605
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,495
It's called a
millipede gun, soldier,

606
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:15,133
Pressurized canon that can
fire artillery over 100 miles.

607
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,304
Division believes
they've located one.

608
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,039
Where is it exactly?

609
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:23,141
A place called
Alsace-Lorraine.

610
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,678
Sir, that's quite a ways
behind enemy lines.

611
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:27,545
Yes, it is.

612
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:31,149
17.6 kilometers to be exact.

613
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,819
And we're going in on a hunch?

614
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,655
That is a
possibility, yes,

615
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:39,390
But we follow orders,
don't we, Sergeant?

616
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:43,829
We're gonna get in, go find it,
we're gonna go home.

617
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,563
Go home, yes sir.

618
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,033
Good.

619
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,168
Are we gonna disguise
ourselves as Germans?

620
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,503
That's too dangerous.

621
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,905
You get captured wearing
a German uniform,

622
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,374
They shoot you on sight.

623
00:42:56,441 --> 00:43:01,346
Listen, I'm not
gonna lie to you...

624
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,584
It's not gonna be easy...
but I know you can do it.

625
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:13,424
You men are ready...

626
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:19,530
There's just one more thing
I need you to do.

627
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,368
Oh shit.

628
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,536
Decide who
gets to drive.

629
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,439
(Laughter)

630
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:38,049
It's funny... my wife always
wanted to see Germany.

631
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,887
Hey Moffatte,
you'll see her again.

632
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,955
I promise you that.

633
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,235
You think this
cannon is real?

634
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,470
Sounds like something
Hitler would dream up.

635
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,439
We wouldn't be out here
if it wasn't important.

636
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,908
The Sarg, you think
he's right?

637
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,142
About what?

638
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,911
About the Lieutenant
getting us all killed.

639
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,913
Wosick is tough,
but he's fair.

640
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,247
I think he knows
what he's doing.

641
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,581
Shank's right.

642
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,252
Augie's got a big mouth,
I trust the Lieutenant.

643
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,321
I guess we'll find out.

644
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,933
It's about that time!

645
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,501
Keep your eyes
peeled, soldiers.

646
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,611
(Planes buzzing)

647
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,313
We're in plain
sight here.

648
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,115
Look for cover,
soldier.

649
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,683
Copy.

650
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,795
Do you think they
spotted us?

651
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,163
Probably.

652
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:01,299
The real question is,
are they gonna shoot at us?

653
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,633
Those are our planes.

654
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,002
Yeah.

655
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,671
Problem is, we are on
the wrong side of the line.

656
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,707
I don't want to become
target practice.

657
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:13,311
What a way to go... ambushed
by our own air corps.

658
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,146
Change of plans, Captain,
we're going in on foot.

659
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,882
Everybody get
their weapons.

660
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,351
If these points are
right, we should...

661
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:23,054
Lieutenant, any
idea where we are?

662
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,655
Yeah sure, behind enemy lines

663
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,558
About to find a real
big gun, Sergeant.

664
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,560
Really?

665
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:38,236
Gun should be just over the
ridge, west of here, Hill 314.

666
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,571
We need two volunteers
for scouting patrol.

667
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:43,541
And who are the lucky/unlucky
bastards for that one?

668
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:46,011
Thank you, Sergeant,
you just volunteered.

669
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:50,015
These woods must be crawling
with German patrols.

670
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,683
I'd like to set up a defensive
perimeter around this road...

671
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,518
Just in case.

672
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,186
You got it, Captain.

673
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,254
Just don't engage
unless you need to.

674
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,689
Don't let all of Germany
know we're here.

675
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,858
Understood.

676
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,860
I need one more volunteer
for this patrol.

677
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,862
I'll go.

678
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,931
You sure
this is wise?

679
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,771
You coming?

680
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,942
Yeah, kid.

681
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,709
I guess I am.

682
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:30,055
*

683
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:41,566
*

684
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:52,844
*

685
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,314
Any orders, sir?

686
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,149
We need to get somebody up
on the bend of that road.

687
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,617
Yes sir.

688
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:02,420
Preach...

689
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,989
Captain needs somebody
on the road, you good?

690
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,590
Yeah.

691
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,093
See the bend
in the road?

692
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,429
Get up there, find a low
position, look for movement.

693
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,964
If you see anything,
come back here right away.

694
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,499
Yeah, count on it.

695
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,936
Moffatte,
bring any mines?

696
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:20,371
Absolutely sir.

697
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:31,950
(Birds chirping)

698
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:35,921
(Leaves crunching)

699
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:51,202
There she is.

700
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,872
How tall do you
think it is?

701
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,879
Could be 600 feet,
maybe more.

702
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:03,714
Sure is ugly.

703
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:07,552
That thing could put a round
on Paris, maybe even London.

704
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,221
You know, it looks like
it could be operational.

705
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,824
Does division know?

706
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,826
That's why we're
here, Sergeant.

707
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,463
What are we gonna
do about it?

708
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,169
We're gonna get
out of here.

709
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,570
Really, that's it?

710
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,905
We're just gonna
report it?

711
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:30,575
What if it starts
firing on London?

712
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,681
We've seen what we need
to see here, Sergeant.

713
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,616
So we're not gonna do anything?

714
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:44,589
We're done here, let's go.

715
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,626
You get what you need?

716
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,876
Hey Moffatte, good work.

717
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,945
Wait 'til a Jerry gets
a load of these, huh?

718
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,115
We're all dug in, sir.

719
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,382
Good.

720
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,884
Oh shit, this
can't be good.

721
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:18,056
There's German armor
coming down the road.

722
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,624
Take cover.

723
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,062
Moffatte,
the shovel!

724
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:35,140

725

(Voices speaking German)

726
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,995
We've got to get
the fuck out of here...

727
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,767
(Men speaking German)

728
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,270
C'mon kid, let's go.

729
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,304
Stay down.

730
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,672
You're gonna
get us all killed.

731
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,107
I don't want to get you killed,
I want you to go home,

732
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:11,442
You hear me,
but shut up.

733

*

736
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,911
Grenade!

737
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:52,950

(Man yelling in German)

741
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:30,415
Sir, why are
they stopping?

742
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,484
Maintenance check.

743
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:12,457
*

744
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,024

Captain, you ok?

750
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:28,533
Get 'em!

751
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:41,379
*

752
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:54,191

(Gunshots)

757
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,955
Lieutenant?

758
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:03,027
York, August...
Germans have 'em.

759
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,697
Let's get back
to the squad.

760
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,610
Bit harder,
harder.

761
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:23,548
Captain?

762
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:26,150
Hey, hey,
are you ok here?

763
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,253
Yes, it's nothing,
I will be fine.

764
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,157
Where's York
and August?

765
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,392
German Patrol
got 'em both.

766
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,994
Still alive?

767
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,830
Think so,
at least for now.

768
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,666
Find the gun?

769
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,869
They run patrol not far
from here, set up a depot,

770
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:47,071
Millipede gun
looks operational.

771
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,474
Division's gonna want to
know about this, Captain.

772
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:56,013
So, what do you
want to do?

773
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,083
I can't leave my men
behind, Captain.

774
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,855
How are we gonna
do that, sir?

775
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:08,626
We're going in and
getting them out.

776
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:16,867
Ok... I'm in.

777
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,202
What about
our orders?

778
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,572
Looks like we just
changed 'em, soldier.

779
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:25,710
I'm in, sir.

780
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,112
Me too.

781
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,414
We're all in, sir.

782
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:33,784
Thank you, soldiers.

783
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,186
How are we getting
into that depot?

784
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,963
Caught wearing a German uniform,
you're going to be executed.

785
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,433
That's right,
Monsieur.

786
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,401
If you want to back out,
I understand.

787
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,738
Now is the time
to speak up.

788
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,439
We're not backing
out now, sir.

789
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:56,674
Good.

790
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:00,077
Do either of you know
how to drive a tank?

791
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:01,746
I know how to drive
a tractor, sir.

792
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,814
That'll work,
soldier.

793
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:17,427
Ok... ok, it's just
like a tractor.

794
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,129
Sir, let me get this straight...
we're just gonna drive into

795
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,966
The German depot and
find August and York?

796
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:25,936
I know it's not great,
but at least it's a plan.

797
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,672
So what are our chances?

798
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,640
50/50.

799
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:34,612
Either we succeed
or we die.

800
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,115
Sir, what's the German
word for starter?

801
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,685
(Engine sputtering)

802
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:00,871
Can this get worse?

803
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,473
This is pretty
bad, kid.

804
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,143
What do you think
they're gonna do?

805
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,212
I don't know...

806
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,657
(Speaking German)

807
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:20,524
You speak some German?

808
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:26,163
Yeah, you like that, Fritz?

809
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,668
My name is not Fritz.

810
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:36,674
But what I want is to know
what you're doing here.

811
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,910
It was a routine patrol.

812
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:43,380
I'd say you're
a little bit lost.

813
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:47,517
Your patches...
I like them.

814
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,188
It would look good on my
bomber jacket, wouldn't you say?

815
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:55,525
Tell me, what does
the insignia mean?

816
00:59:55,592 --> 01:00:00,865
It means we're the War Pigs.

817
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,700
(Speaking German)

818
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:05,035
Why?

819
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,706
We like to roll around
in the mud.

820
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:11,776
Is that so?

821
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,211
Hey...

822
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:15,445
Where ya going, Fritz?

823
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:18,783
I'm not done talking
to you, come here.

824
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,284
Hey, come here,
hey don't!

825
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:57,988
(Speaking German)

826
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,941
Hey...

827
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,745
(Speaking German)

828
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:21,671
So that's the,
uh, super weapon.

829
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:27,011
Yeah, that's it, just as
the Colonel described it...

830
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,513
But bigger.

831
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,916
I think you're up, sir.

832
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:33,984
Yeah.

833
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,189
Remember your
training, soldiers.

834
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,757
Stay alert.

835
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,426
Yes sir.

836
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,548
Hang in there, kid!

837
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,951
You're doing great,
you look fine!

838
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:11,088
I'm ok.

839
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:13,790
He punches
like a girl.

840
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:22,232
It seems you're quite
the little artist.

841
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,470
Tell me, why are
you drawing this?

842
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:34,845
The real important stuff
is on the next page.

843
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,102
What is your objective here?

844
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:01,271
Why have they sent you?

845
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:06,176
I'd love to help but...
my hands are tied.

846
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:09,013
(Laughing)

847
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,089
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

848
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,296
Who sent you to spy on us, huh?

849
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,699
What did they send you to find?

850
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:46,550
Danke schoen.

851
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:03,500
Grosser fehler.

852
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,937
Believe me,
the mistake is yours.

853
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:27,824
Hey... hey Fritzie,
come over here.

854
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,870
Tough little army boy...

855
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,773
I'll be proud to
wear your patch.

Just sit tight, yeah?

Oh you're a gentlemen.

I don't know.

872
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,632
He's probably still looking
for August and York I guess.

Holy scheissen.

874

That doesn't
sound good.

it is not.

Hang in there, kid.

I didn't think
you'd come for us.

You ok?

I do now.

Thank you, sir.

Sir?

957
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,255
What the fuck went
wrong out there?

958
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:42,759
I don't understand, sir.

959
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:45,261
Well, your orders, soldier,
were for a recon mission.

960
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,630
You weren't supposed to
destroy the fucking gun.

961
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,933
Sir, the millipede gun was
operational, I made a judgment

962
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:55,471
Call and I was not about to
leave my men behind, sir.

963
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,942
You just thought to ignore
your orders, your mission,

964
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,109
Disrespect me?

965

(Chuckling)

966
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:06,515
I thought that might be
your answer, Captain.

967
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,656
You might need those to
go with your new rank.

968
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:15,691
Thank you, sir.

969
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:19,128
It also seems that somehow
your court marshal papers

970
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,464
Mysteriously disappeared.

971
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,300
Is that right, sir?

972
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,371
You bet your ass, soldier.

973
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:32,809
Division is very impressed
with you and your War Pigs.

974
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:35,311
They deserve that, sir.

975
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:40,483
They want to keep you
on as their commander.

976
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,185
It would be an honor.

977
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:44,453
Go celebrate, Captain.

978
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,996
Thank you, sir.

979
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,665
Hey soldier...

980
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,735
You were the right man
for the job.

981
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:07,844
Now don't sew those on
too tight there, Corporal,

982
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:09,745
People are gonna think
you just got 'em.

983
01:19:09,813 --> 01:19:13,516
Alright, leave him be, Sarg,
the kid's earned his promotion.

984
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,751
Hey, I lost a tooth to
those kraut bastards.

985
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:18,021
You know, I got captured
too, where's my promotion?

986
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,356
You think you might be
officer material, Sergeant?

987
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:22,758
Nah, I ain't

988
01:19:22,826 --> 01:19:25,728
We'll see.

989
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,530
It's a good day...

990
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,699
We didn't lose anyone.

991
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,535
And that's because
you're the best squad

992
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,370
In the whole damn army.

993
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,606
I mean it.

994
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:41,744
Even with the two things that
can really screw up your day...

995
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:45,048
Officers and orders.

997
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,221
Cheers.

998
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,656
Salut.

999
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:02,398
Captain, huh?

1000
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:03,466
To the War Pigs.

1001
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:06,235
ALL:
War Pigs!
