OK. Send them in.

You two men get in your planes

Yes, sir. May I ask what our orders are
when we get there, sir?

334
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,940
Just sit tight.
Listen for the phone.

Yes, sir.

Haleiwa's one of several subsidiary fields.

We send those 2 up there,
2 more here.

Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

If I thought I could get away with it,

I'd send them all

Nomura has offered his resignation
several times,

00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,505
but Tokyo won't let him quit.

351
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,510
Instead, they're sending
a second ambassador...

Well, I doubt it, Frank.

He's hardly the most tactful choice.
