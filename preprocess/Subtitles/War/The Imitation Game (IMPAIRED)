00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,462
My God, you're serious.

170
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,032
Would you prefer I made a joke?

171
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,135
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

172
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,793
Hardly seems fair that
that's a requirement

173
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,133
for employment here, Mr...

174
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,240
Commander Denniston,
Royal Navy.

175
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,877
All right,
Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

176
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,206
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's government?

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,211
Oh, I don't, really.

178
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,180
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

179
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,649
I'm... agnostic about violence.

180
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,016
Well, you do realize

181
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,917
that 600 miles away from London

182
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,024
there's this nasty little chap
called Hitler

183
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,251
who wants to engulf Europe
in tyranny?

184
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,192
Politics isn't really
my area of expertise.

185
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,694
Really?

186
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,094
Well, I believe
you've just set the record

187
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,257
for the shortest job interview

188
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,869
in British military history.

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,435
Oh, uh... [chuckles]

190
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,538
Mother says I can be off-putting
sometimes on account

191
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,606
of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

192
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,436
In the world?

193
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,203
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,711
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this program?

195
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,009
- No.
- Well, that's right,

196
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,618
because we're
a top-secret program.

197
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,879
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

198
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,453
that only last week,

199
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,455
I rejected one of our
great nation's top linguists.

200
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,821
Knows German better
than Bertolt Brecht.

201
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,984
I don't speak German.

202
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,755
What?

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,524
I don't...

204
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,064
speak German.

205
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,895
Well, how the hell
were you supposed to decrypt

206
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,559
German communications
if you don't...

207
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,603
[chuckles]
I don't know, speak German?

208
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,174
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

209
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,936
- Margaret!
- The German codes are a puzzle.

210
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,773
A game, just like
any other game.

211
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,574
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games.

212
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,216
Uh, puzzles.

213
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,784
And this is the most difficult
puzzle in the world.

214
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,580
Margaret!

215
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,085
For the love of God.

216
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,485
This is a joke, obviously.

217
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,217
I'm afraid I don't know
what those are,

218
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,259
Commander Denniston.

219
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,864
Have a pleasant trip
back to Cambridge, Professor.

220
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,123
Enigma.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,233
You called for me?

222
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,403
[door closes]

223
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,675
That's what you're doing here.

224
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,506
The top-secret program
at Bletchley.

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,843
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

226
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,349
What makes you think that?

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,852
It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

228
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,117
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

229
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,818
If the Allies broke Enigma,

230
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,929
well, [chuckles]

231
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,826
This would turn
into a very short war, indeed.

232
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,832
Of course that's what
you're working on.

233
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,596
But you also haven't got
anywhere with it.

234
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,136
If you had, you wouldn't
be hiring cryptographers

235
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,138
out of university.

236
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,299
Y- You need me a lot
more than I need you.

237
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,377
L-I like solving problems,

238
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,139
Commander.

239
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,046
And Enigma is the most
difficult problem in the world.

240
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,516
No, Enigma isn't difficult;
it's impossible.

241
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,985
The Americans, the Russians,
the French,

242
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,181
the Germans,
everyone thinks Enigma

243
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,416
is unbreakable.

244
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,855
Good.

245
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,894
Let me try,
and we'll know for sure,

246
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,326
<i>We n.</i> t <i>M?</i>

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,124
[Denniston]
Welcome to Enigma.

248
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,969
The details of every
surprise attack,

249
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,667
every secret convoy

250
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,005
and every U-boat in
the bloody Atlantic

251
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,908
go into that thing.

252
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,312
And out comes gibberish.

253
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,044
It's beautiful.

254
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,054
[Denniston] It's the crooked
hand of death itself.

255
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,354
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day,

256
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,519
and to the lovely young ladies

257
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,597
of the Women's Royal Navy,
they're nonsense.

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,700
It's only when you feed
them back into Enigma

259
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,064
that they make any sense.

260
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,228
But we have an Enigma machine.

261
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,600
Yes, Polish Intelligence

262
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,865
smuggled it out of Berlin.

263
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,031
[man] So what's the problem?

264
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,438
Just put
the intercepted messages

265
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,601
back into the Enigma
and you'll...

266
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,440
Look, it's not
that simple, is it?

267
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,777
Just having an Enigma machine

268
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,509
doesn't help you to decode
the messages.

269
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,518
[Denniston]
Very good, Mr. Turing.

270
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,350
To decode a message, you need to
know the machine's settings.

271
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,016
Now, the Germans
switch settings

272
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,322
every day promptly at midnight.

273
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,724
We usually intercept

274
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,695
our first message
around 6:00 a.m.,

275
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,459
which gives you exactly

276
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:52,572
18 hours every day
to crack the code

277
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,935
before it changes,
and you start again.

278
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,473
Five rotors.

279
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,634
Ten plugboard cables.

280
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,210
- One million...
- A thousand million...

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,973
No, no, it's,
uh, I've got it.

282
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,446
[man] It's million, million. It's
in the millions, obviously.

283
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,484
It's over 150 million million
million possible settings.

284
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,780
Very good.

285
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,481
159.

286
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,820
If you want to be
exact about it. 1-5-9

287
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,223
with 18 zeroes behind it.

288
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,886
Possibilities.

289
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,793
Every single day.

290
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,458
[Denniston]
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

291
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,330
I personally selected him

292
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,768
- to run this unit.
- Didn't you...

293
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,907
Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

294
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,474
Twice.

295
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,974
[Denniston]
You're not the only one

296
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,340
who's good at games
around here, Turing.

297
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,005
Are-are we
to work together, then?

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,344
I prefer to have my own office.

299
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,350
You're a team,
and you will work as one.

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,852
I-I-I don't have time
to explain myself as I go along,

301
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,615
and I'm afraid these men

302
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,021
- would only slow me down.
- [chuckles] If you can't

303
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,163
play together, then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

304
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,025
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

305
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,189
There are only five divisions
of military intelligence.

306
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,267
There is no MI6.

307
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,801
Exactly.

308
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,337
That's the spirit.

309
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,304
Mr. Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen

310
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,465
have died because of Enigma?

311
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,543
Uh, no, I don't.

312
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,476
Three...

313
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,637
while we've been having

314
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,783
this conversation.

315
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,548
Oh, look, there's another.

316
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,849
I rather hope he
didn't have a family.

317
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,323
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

318
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,222
we're not winning it.

319
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,022
Break the code,

320
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,132
at least we have a chance.

321
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,860
Shall we leave
the children alone

322
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,561
with their new toy?

323
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,830
<i>Hm.</i>

324
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,040
All right, gentlemen...

325
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,875
- [door closes]
- let's play.

326
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,185
[Turing]
The game was quite a simple one.

327
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,694
Every single German message,
every surprise attack,

328
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,488
every bombing run,

The trick was
that they were encrypted.

338
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,375
There were 159 million

All we had to do
was try each one.

But if we had ten men checking
one setting a minute

it would take to, uh, to check

Well, it's not days, it's years.

if you wanted to come
to lunch with us.

Um, no, you didn't.

You said you were going

Would you like to come to lunch

- What time's lunchtime?
- Christ, Alan,

it's a bleeding sandwich.

- What is?
- Lunch.

00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,532
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

378
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,898
Never mind.

00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,732
You know,

to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

381

one actually has to be
a genius, Alan.

And yet we're the ones

making progress here,
aren't we?

Yes, we are.

386
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,617
We have decrypted a number

that's just blind luck.

No, no, Hugh Alexander

build the machine I've designed.

Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you,

425
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,701
and they filed
a formal complaint.

426
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,396
It's is inspired
by an old Polish code machine.

Only this one
is infinitely more advanced.

If you don't respond
to the complaint,

I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

they're all idiots.

Would you deliver

Look, I'm sorry,

- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

472
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,752
So I can give these

00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,855
I hate to say it, but yes.

Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

Well, he just said I could.

No, I did no such thing.

like violence?

It is because it feels...

Thank you... so much for
your visit, Mr. Turing.

such a position

You earned a double first
in mathematics.

Now, you won't have proper

694
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,024
of course, so, uh, we'll have
to improvise things a bit.

695
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,630
Why are you helping me?

696
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,698
Because there is only
one thing that matters

697
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,926
in this entire world right
now... do you understand?...

698
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,467
and that is
breaking Enigma.

699
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,607
But-but, Mr. Turing...

700
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,833
why are you helping me?

701
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,172
Oh. Um...

702
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,611
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

703

What's this?

707
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,735
Alan Turing's

708
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,881
- It's bloody empty.
- Exactly.

00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,176
- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

710
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,115
Well, you've cracked the case
wide open, then, haven't you?

711
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,516
Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

712
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,350
they're nonexistent.

713
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,424
That means someone's
got rid of them.

714
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,186
Erased them.
Burned them.

715
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,558
And that same person broke into
his house and stole nothing?

What, the spies

718
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,201
The Soviet spies.

But first they were

Radicalized at Cambridge,

721
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,241
then they joined
the Communist Party,

722
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,107
then Foreign Office,
then leaked information

723
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,112
to Stalin during
the war... now,

724
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,683
can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

725
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,753
then took up something murky and
top secret when war broke out?

726
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,788
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

727
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,119

728
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,283
something very serious
is happening

with the Germans... incorrect.

We were at war with the clock.

Britain was literally
starving to death.

739

100,000 tons of food every week,
and, uh, every week

00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,144
the Germans would send

to the bottom of the ocean.

Commander, at least
give us some more time.

1073

Six months, and if the

One month.

Denniston gave me
the Beale cipher,

Sir, I think I've got Turing.

Itailed him

They exchanged an envelope.

The man admitted it.
Arnold Murray.

00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,289
Turing's one of
the men that paid.

Only Mr. Murray here

1115

of robbing Turing's house
after, with a friend.

1117
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,125
That's what Turing's hiding.

1118

Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

- No.
- What's the matter?

We can charge a

- with indecency.
- No, this is...

it's bloody rubbish.

Turing's up
to something important...

1124

He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.

1125

And with a bloke.
Jesus Christ,

1126

00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,455
Please. Give me
half an hour alone,

1132
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,461

I'll spend the next month

rubbish cases as you like.

Fine. Now,

Christopher's simply
not moving fast enough.

1139

- And even with the diagonal board,

1140

says the two of you
are positively inseparable.

We're the best students
in the class.

The class is too simple.

is too dull?
