1
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:11,954
<i>[Houlihan] Slight temperature, Doctor.</i>
<i>He's responding to antibiotics.</i>

2
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,965
Okay, continue treatment.

3
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:18,026
Try to get better by 6:00. I'm going to
the movies and I wanna have a free mind.

4
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,965
- How come you're not responding to <i>me?</i>
- Pardon?

5
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,738
I put on something I thought
would drive you wild.

6
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:27,836
- What?
- Clean socks.

7
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,680
<i>Sir, a helicopter crashed.</i>

8
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,846
There's a broken arm in O.R.

9
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,413
Let's hope there's a patient attached.

10
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:41,051
Major, give me a hand.
Later I'll give you one of mine.

11
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:47,966
- Much pain?
- Not bad.

12
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,968
- Clean up the abrasions.
- Yes, Doctor.

13
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,970
Colonel Flagg's X ray, sir.

14
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:53,972
What happened to the chopper pilot?

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,974
He walked away without a scratch.

16
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,909
Probably asleep at the wheel.
That makes you nice and relaxed.

17
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:02,345
Colonel, you got a fractured radius.
Congratulations.

18
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,848
Congratulations?

19
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,783
Yeah, you might have landed on your head
and screwed yourself into the ground.

20
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:08,786
Just get on with it, huh?

21
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,914
- Major, expose the arm, please.
- Yes, Doctor.

22
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,925
Oh.

23
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,826
Ever thought of going
into burlesque, Colonel?

24
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,330
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Then try to look it.

25
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,923
- What kind of a place is this?
- What do you care?

26
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,970
We're open 24 hours a day
and the second cup of coffee is free.

27
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,971
- Morphine.
- No morphine for me.

28
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,237
- Well, it's certainly not for me.
- Colonel, this will be very painful.

29
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,040
- Forget it.
- Perhaps you'd care to bite on a bullet.

30
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,308
Just do it.

31
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,316
Stockinette, please.

32
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,318
[Whistling]

33
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:43,116
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

34
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,248
Well, right after we set this,
we x-ray it.

35
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,258
And if it's not right,
we do it again.

36
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,260
Then you can see
my commanding officer,

37
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,728
who's not right,
but he won't let us do him again.

38
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,096
- What's your name, fella?
- Dr. Wasserman.

39
00:02:55,167 --> 00:03:00,605
I'm looking for a cure for V.D.
And I thought I'd start here. Ready?

40
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:03,107
- Uh, sir?
- Yo.

41
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,042
Colonel Flagg is right outside...
inside here, sir.

42
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,808
Oh, Colonel Flagg.

43
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,748
Colonel, I want to talk to you
in private, without the corporal.

44
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,047
Oh, you can say
anything you want in front of him.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,418
Okay, I will.
Get out.

46
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,691
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,251
- I see they got the wing patched up.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,425
- Care for a belt?
- No, thank you.

49
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,735
Hot enough for ya?

50
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,438
- Colonel.
- Colonel?

51
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,567
What's your... clearance?

52
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:40,840
Oh, I go through the door
with about an inch to spare.

53
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,882
I mean, security-wise.

54
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,883
Oh, well, we're a hospital.

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,815
Colonel,

56
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,982
I'm gonna have to trust you.

57
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,652
Well, believe me,
you can, Colonel Flagg.

58
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:59,697
Major Brooks.

59
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,868
Lieutenant Carter.

60
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:06,769
Ensign Troy.

61
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,773
Captain Louise Klein?

62
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm C.I.A.

63
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,110
C.I.A.? Wow!

64
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:23,416
That damn chopper crash may have ruined
a very sensitive mission.

65
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:26,856
Colonel Flagg was never here.
Tell your people.

66
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,861
You can fill out a file on me
using any one of these.

67
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,898
Right. Uh, just let me
get your names down here.

68
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:38,870
Don't write.

69
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:40,872
Memorize. One.

70
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,841
And don't use "Louise."
I'll need that next week in Tokyo.

71
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,844
Right.

72
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,916
I don't know how long I'll be here.
That all depends on H.Q.

73
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,824
- H.Q.
- H.Q.? Whoever told you about H.Q.?

74
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:05,352
- Well, you told me, Colonel Flagg.
- Who's Colonel Flagg?

75
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,697
I mean, I, uh... Gee, could...
could I just look at the cards again?

76
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,032
I forgot who all of you are.

77
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,265
Step outside, Colonel.
I wanna make a call.

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,673
All right.
Can I get the number for you?

79
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:20,439
I don't know the number.

80
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,572
Then how do you make the call?

81
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:25,583
I have to throw up.

82
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,017
The number's in a capsule.

83
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,921
Well, I'll just run along then.

84
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,927
- <i>Colonel.</i>
- Hmm?

85
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,190
- Not a word.
- Oh, don't worry, Colonel.

86
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,198
I don't wanna get in Dutch.

87
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,700
Dutch?

88
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:46,761
Colonel, I'm authorized to kill...

89
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,831
without requesting permission
from my superiors.

90
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:54,778
Oh. Well, I imagine that
cuts down on the old paperwork.

91
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,611
You'll never know what hit you.

92
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,413
Your toothbrush
could go off in your mouth.

93
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,944
You could find a tarantula
in your shorts.

94
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,617
We could booby-trap a nurse.

95
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:09,991
- Hey, sirs.
- And ma'am.

96
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,223
And ma'am.

97
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:16,826
Boy, did I ever just hear something
by accident in the office.

98
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:19,871
You've been giving the wall
a physical again, Radar?

99
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,873
Sit down and tell us.

100
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:25,172
Uh, Corporal O'Reilly's
high chair, please.

101
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:28,702
You know that Colonel Flagg?
You fixed his arm?

102
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,722
He's a C.P.A.

103
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,555
No, really. I heard him
tell Colonel Blake to keep it quiet,

104
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,257
that he's on a secret mission.

105
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:51,062
Radar, you mean C.I.A.

106
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,069
Wow!

107
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:57,403
- To think I took his shirt off.
- Well, why would you do that?

108
00:06:57,474 --> 00:07:00,170
I had to break his arm, Frank.
He was lusting after Margaret.

109
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:03,077
Those guys are doped up
most of the time, you know.

110
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,206
Doped up on patriotism, fella.

111
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:08,809
- Something in short supply here.
- Amen.

112
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,845
Radar, we're running low.
Get another order of Yankee Doodle.

113
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,857
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,326
Gee, what a screwy bunch.

115
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,432
- Can you believe that Frank?
- They might make him the 49th state.

116
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,439
Don't move.
You're under arrest.

117
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,941
Vinny Pratt!
What a small war.

118
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,003
TrapperJohn Mclntyre,
the old dirty doctor.

119
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,283
Vinny Pratt, Hawkeye Pierce.

120
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:43,718
Vinny and I go way back.
I introduced him to his wife.

121
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,017
Now you're here to kill him, right?

122
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,854
- Care for a belt?
- No, thanks. I'm here on business.

123
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,860
You?

124
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,862
Trap.

125
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,592
Can I talk in front of him?

126
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,101
Go ahead.
I had his tongue cut out.

127
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,468
- Makes it very hard to lick stamps.
- <i>I'm with Intelligence.</i>

128
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,473
G2.

129
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,305
Our people monitored a call from here.

130
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:10,541
You have a Colonel Flagg
on some kind of a mission.

131
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,548
His chopper crashed.
He broke his arm.

132
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,084
Oh. That old trick.

133
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,814
What trick? I set the arm.
I saw the X rays.

134
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,822
Well, believe me, if I know Flagg,

135
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,257
he ordered the chopper to crash,
got out and hit himself with a hammer.

136
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,056
Come on.

137
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,156
It's a switch on the way
he infiltrated the C.I.D. Last year.

138
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:33,465
He drove his jeep into a wall,
set himself on fire.

139
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:36,165
Is this guy available
for kids' parties?

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,800
Why would this character
wanna infiltrate a hospital?

141
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,845
Well, that's what
I'm here to find out...

142
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:45,575
what they're up to and stop them.

143
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,447
I don't get it.
What do you mean "they," "them"?

144
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,453
Aren't "them" all part of"we"?
Isn't "them" "us"?

145
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,783
Steady, pal.

146
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:56,451
They always try to make a big score
around appropriation time.

147
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,688
<i>A little showboat for the Senate.</i>

148
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,289
Now, last year they beat us
out of $20 million.

149
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,994
Oh, you could make that up
out of petty cash.

150
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:10,507
There must be something pretty big
cooking here for them to send Flagg.

151
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,145
My orders are to find out what that is.

152
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:19,740
From now on, I'm Captain Perkins.
Priest.

153
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,308
We already got a priest.

154
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:29,459
Well, then I'm Captain Stone.
Engineer.

155
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,494
- Colonel Blake?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

156
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,793
There's a Captain Stone out there
that's in here too, sir.

157
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,595
Colonel Blake.

158
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,102
- Captain Stone.
- That's not my real name.

159
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,799
- Oh, boy.
- I'm Major Strauss. G2.

160
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,104
- Hey, what's going on with you guys?
- "Guys"?

161
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,110
I never heard of Colonel Flagg.

162
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:50,544
Let me level with you, Colonel.

163
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:53,481
My people wanna know
what Flagg's people are up to.

164
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,112
Why do we have to be in the middle?
Can't you let my people go?

165
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,918
I expect your full cooperation,
Colonel.

166
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,789
- Look, give me a break, Strauss.
- Call me Pratt.

167
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,352
- But Stone is definitely out?
- Out.

168
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,830
Man alive,
I'm trying to run a hospital,

169
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,833
be an administrator, give orders.

170
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,530
I've got no time for Intelligence.
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

171
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:17,005
Full cooperation, Colonel.

172
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,043
What's this?

173
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,412
Paid bill from the Happy Hour Motel,
Elkhart, Indiana.

174
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:27,814
June 1948.

175
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,548
That is your signature, isn't it,
"Mr. Carl Williams and daughter"?

176
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:34,250
Beside the blurred
license plate number?

177
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:36,758
- So?
- So,

178
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:40,160
the electric blanket control
in Room 312 was a microphone.

179
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,165
Holy cow!

180
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,224
The doorknob was a camera.

181
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,040
Linda Collins.

182
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,941
That rent-a-car girl
in Houston. Remember?

183
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,878
The A.M.A. Convention in '49.

184
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,508
They were folding the chairs
by the time you finally got there.

185
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,711
Hey, where did you get this stuff?

186
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:05,152
We've got files on people
who haven't been born yet.

187
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,680
Well, I'd deny it. Anybody
that says I don't is a dirty liar.

188
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,284
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, who's gonna believe this?

189
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,591
Nobody except your immediate family.

190
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,598
<i>I'll leave you a copy.</i>

191
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,863
Hey, this is nothing but
a pack of filthy, lying lies,

192
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,870
which is beneath
my contempt about it,

193
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:24,772
and you can count on my full
and fearful cooperation.

194
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,642
Hey, how about a little golf?
I need the money.

195
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:34,411
Don't be so smart, or I'll x-ray that
and show you what you're eating.

196
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:37,317
- Who you doing?
- Flagg. I wanna check his arm.

197
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:41,346
Can you believe those guys? We're
a hospital, and they're playing spy.

198
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,950
I have a good mind
to write my congressman.

199
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,961
With invisible ink, of course.

200
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,363
- Chasing their own tails.
- Shall we make it more interesting?

201
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:54,063
- Uh-huh.
- Tell Captain Stone I'll see him next.

202
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,765
- Mm-hmm. You got it.
- Okay.

203
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,776
- Captain Stone?
- Sit right there at the table, please.

204
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:04,610
- Engineer?
- I hear he moonlights as a priest.

205
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,811
His name is not Stone.
It's really Martinez.

206
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:11,286
How do you know, Colonel Flagg?

207
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,916
My name is not Flagg.
Ask your C.O. It's Carter.

208
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:16,857
Uh-huh.

209
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:19,760
Can I trust you, Pierce?

210
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,855
If that's who I am.

211
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:26,335
I'm with the C.I.D., although
I told your boss I was with the C.I.A.

212
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,702
It throws people off
who think I'm with the C.I.C.

213
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,604
I'll go along with you there.

214
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:36,203
If his people sent Martinez,
then there's something big brewing here.

215
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,738
- Hmm. Probably.
- I'm not leaving till I find out what.

216
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,750
Well, I can't give you
a medical excuse.

217
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:45,219
I did too good a job on your arm.

218
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,655
- You did, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,658
[Yells]

220
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:57,062
Well, now I can give you
a medical excuse.

221
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,405
All right, Corporal,
read back what you've got.

222
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,345
Uh, yes, sir.

223
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,578
"To the Far East Export-Import Company,

224
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:18,951
27 Zapata Circle, 'Ti-joo-ana', Mexico."

225
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:22,549
- Right. Go on.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:27,063
"Mary had a little lamb. Stop.

227
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,396
My dog has fleas. Stop."

228
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,402
Good. There's a bit more.

229
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:38,469
Mairzy doats and dozey doats,

230
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,238
and I'll be home for Christmas.

231
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,245
You got that?

232
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,747
Uh... Uh, just a moment, sir.

233
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,685
Uh, okay.

234
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:52,620
Sign it:

235
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,385
Your loving son,

236
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,573
Queen Victoria.

237
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,504
Really?

238
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:03,043
You told me to keep you up
on what he's doing.

239
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:07,013
- "Mary had a little lamb."
- He knows I'm here.

240
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:10,017
- How?
- I'm Mary.

241
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,578
I hate to tell you this, Mary,
but your dog has fleas.

242
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:20,124
Mm-hmm. We're both
on the same trail.

243
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:22,891
But he's waiting
for me to bird-dog.

244
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:26,161
You do, and you'll clean it up.

245
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:29,863
- Can this man be trusted?
- He's true-blue.

246
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:34,068
- I wanna use him for messages.
- He's perfect. Fits into any envelope.

247
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,201
Aw, come on.

248
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:41,415
I can't surface.
He's got me tagged.

249
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,417
I'm G2.

250
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,979
- You're to keep him under surveillance.
- Colonel Flagg?

251
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:51,025
- Queen Victoria.
- Major Carter.

252
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,858
- They're all him.
- Or her, as the case may be.

253
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,920
I think I understand.

254
00:14:56,998 --> 00:15:00,900
- Then you're the only one.
- Go, son.

255
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:07,236
<i>Radar. If you're captured,</i>
<i>you'll have to eat those binoculars.</i>

256
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,740
What's Flagg's target?

257
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,909
What's his caper?

258
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:19,783
Could it be a patient?
A nurse?

259
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,788
A doctor?

260
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,324
- Hello, Frank.
- <i>Hi, Frank.</i>

261
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:26,792
A lot you care.

262
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,921
Oh. I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

263
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:31,932
Oh. Old buddy of mine.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Captain Stone, engineer.

265
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:39,065
- Major Burns, doctor, surgeon.
- Staff paranoid.

266
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,405
Uh, what brings you
to the 4077 th, Captain?

267
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,411
- Survey mission, Major.
- Oh.

268
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:48,245
Corps of Engineers believes that
army hospitals can not only be mobile...

269
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,250
but amphibious.

270
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,515
I've had that idea for a long time.

271
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:57,149
Put the hospital, the O.R., the lab,
the whole shebang up on pontoons...

272
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,625
and head for the high seas.

273
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,424
We could call ourselves
the <i>Titanic.</i>

274
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:05,364
Captain, I'm afraid your friend here
and his friend here...

275
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:09,767
derive perverted pleasure from playing
down American ingenuity and know-how.

276
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:15,105
That's true. I was among those
who said this hospital would never fly.

277
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:17,440
I love this country more
than both of you put together.

278
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:21,972
I'll tell ya, when that flag goes up
the pole every morning, I go with it.

279
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,247
We have a hell of a time at night
folding him and putting him away.

280
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,687
Oh, hooey balooey.

281
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:32,692
Well, good luck on your project,
Captain, and... anchors aweigh.

282
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:39,596
- Pretty gung ho.
- #And I don't care #

283
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:44,331
You know, I sometimes wonder about Frank
and his wall-to-wall patriotism.

284
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:48,205
<i>They say Benedict Arnold</i>
<i>used to be the first one to stand...</i>

285
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,210
whenever Washington came into the room.

286
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,007
But the minute Washington left,

287
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,015
he started throwing erasers
and tried to take over the country.

288
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,449
There is the type
who protest too much.

289
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,350
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,220
I think I'll have
a little look-see into his file.

291
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,486
- <i>[Mclntyre] Right now?</i>
- No.

292
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,528
If I ask the colonel
to see the major's file...

293
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,496
and they're co-subversives
in sub-security profile,

294
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:14,399
they'll do the old dossier switcheroo,
and I'll chalk up a zilch.

295
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,960
Boy, I wish you came
with English subtitles.

296
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,565
He means he'll sneak into
the files tonight. Right?

297
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:23,008
It's called breaking and entering.

298
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:27,980
Good thing you're a cop.
Otherwise, that's illegal. You know?

299
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,587
<i>[Flagg] I've asked you to</i>
<i>have a drink because I need help.</i>

300
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:37,091
<i>Now, from the complaints I've heard,</i>
<i>you're my kind of people.</i>

301
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:39,490
<i>Military, dedicated...</i>

302
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,655
and a little bit fanatic
about good sense.

303
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,664
That's us.

304
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,724
I think I can trust you. I'm...

305
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,066
I'm with the C.I.C.

306
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,075
- Not the C.I.A.?
- No.

307
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:58,408
I just tell people that
so they'll think I'm with the C.I.D.

308
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,413
I think I understand.

309
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:05,976
Now, you people got yourself a snootful
of security problems around here.

310
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:08,545
Either of you know a G2 man named Stone?

311
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:12,719
He's an engineer. You're crazy, buddy.
[Chuckling]

312
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:16,730
Call me that again, I'll reach into
your throat and pull your heart out.

313
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,859
Please, Frank.
I've seen him with his shirt off.

314
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,904
I've got to know who
or what this Stone's after.

315
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,372
Then you should see my file.

316
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,841
He's kept a complete list
of everybody in this camp...

317
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,971
who's ever been subversive or promoted
ahead of certain other doctors...

318
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,845
just because they showed off
by saving more lives.

319
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:39,011
- I'd like to have a glimmer at that.
- Radar!

320
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,055
- I'm not, sir.
- You're not what?

321
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,113
You're eavesdropping.

322
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,696
Corporal.

323
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,597
Sir?

324
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,568
How'd you like a nose full of nickels?

325
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:59,637
Not a whole lot, sir.

326
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,738
- Do you like the jukebox, son?
- Oh, yes, sir.

327
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,508
Well, if you don't get lost, I'm gonna
put your head through the glass...

328
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,743
and pull it out through the coin return.

329
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,411
Anything else, sir,
before I go to the latrine?

330
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,924
- Disappear.
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:27,530
I heard him.
He's going into Major Burns' file.

332
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,631
Well, looks like we're gonna
have a doubleheader tonight.

333
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,609
We should let Flagg go first.
He's the senior crazy.

334
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,611
- Do you know what he said to me?
- Wait a minute.

335
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,911
Hawk, shall we make Frank's files
a little more colorful?

336
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,851
Good idea, Raleigh.
What'd he say to you, Radar?

337
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,115
He said he was gonna
shove nickels up my nose.

338
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:47,453
No kidding.
What song was he gonna play?

339
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:51,227
[Snoring]

340
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,856
Is that the signal?

341
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:03,121
Either that
or Marlene Dietrich's back in town.

342
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:05,492
Go, tiger.

343
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,758
[Flagg]
Burns, get up! Let's go, mister!

344
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,425
- What is it?
- You're under arrest as a subversive.

345
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,992
Whatever game you're playing,
I've got enough pictures of your file...

346
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,004
to have you executed
for the rest of your life.

347
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,006
- Subversive?
- Can't be.

348
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:19,872
He's got every record
Kate Smith ever made.

349
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:23,641
- Get dressed. You're coming with me.
- Hold it, Flagg. He's mine.

350
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:27,150
- You'll have to take a number and wait.
- Or call ahead.

351
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:29,482
Everybody wants to arrest Frank Burns
this time of year.

352
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:31,953
Arrest me?
What for, for heaven's sake?

353
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,990
- You're a communist.
- He's a fascist.

354
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,549
I'm not either.
I'm nothing.

355
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:38,686
We'll vouch for that.

356
00:22:38,762 --> 00:22:43,165
I got a list of 17 left-wing charities
and organizations you've contributed to.

357
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,202
I never gave a dime to charity.

358
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,965
I believe every man
has the right to be poor.

359
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:50,563
That doesn't explain
these communist front groups.

360
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:52,802
Those were just a front for these.

361
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,140
Aha.
There's a new front moving in.

362
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,339
This shows your
radical right-wing activities,

363
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:00,110
from being an usher
at a Bund meeting in 1939...

364
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:04,484
to pledging $25 to
a Martin Bormann telethon in Argentina.

365
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:07,524
<i>There's more here, Comrade Burns.</i>

366
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,422
What?

367
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,723
Frank, you're entitled
to one phone call to the Kremlin.

368
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:16,357
Do you deny that last month in Tokyo
you attended the Russian Ballet?

369
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,334
What's wrong with going to the ballet,
for Pete's sake?

370
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:21,337
That's how you people operate.

371
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:25,102
Today you're dancing in Tokyo,
tomorrow all over Washington.

372
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:28,372
You gotta keep on your toes
with the Russian Ballet.

373
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:33,382
Now about this little item? Running
a linen laundry for the Ku Klux Klan?

374
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,511
I never! It's a lie!
They're all lies!

375
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,579
- Well, somebody's lying.
- <i>[Mclntyre] That's right.</i>

376
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:42,125
And we know who it is.

377
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,228
It's us.

378
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:50,256
<i>You two were so intent on finding</i>
<i>some breach of security, some leak.</i>

379
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:53,770
You don't need the real thing.
You guys are self-leaking.

380
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:57,068
Trying to protect your jobs
until you get to the old spies home.

381
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:01,339
- You could do ten years for this.
- For doctor file doctoring?

382
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,779
You can't arrest us.
We got a run-of-the-war contract.

383
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:07,715
<i>Choppers! Choppers, sirs.</i>
<i>Incoming wounded.</i>

384
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:11,016
Fellas, it's been both a privilege
and a nightmare meeting you.

385
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:17,153
Trap, I owe you one.
You really hit me below the belt.

386
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,661
Come see me.
I do hernias.

387
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,664
Let's get to work, Frank.

388
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:24,667
Say <i>"sieg heil"</i> or <i>"or-chi-chornya"</i>
to the nice gentlemen.

389
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:30,539
You've slandered one of
the finest Americans since my father.

390
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,746
Buy you a cup of coffee, Sam?

391
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:39,749
Why not?

392
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:55,056
