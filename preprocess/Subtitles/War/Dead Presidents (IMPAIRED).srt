a splinter in his finger
since I cut this head off.

586
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,995
This head is our
good-luck charm.

587
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,716
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

588
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,469
If you don't mind, Sergeant, l...
My vote is to get rid of it.

589
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,673
Man, Cleon, you need to get the
fuck on with that bullshit, man.
That head smell like shit.

590
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,870
Bottom line,
Staff Sergeant:

591
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,878
You either get rid of that
fuckin' head A.S.A. fuckin' P.,

592
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,073
or I'm gonna have your ass
court-martialled when we get
back to the rear.

593
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,634
We clear?

594
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,678
- Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

X-G Charlie, Michael...
- We're in a world of shit now.

596
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,111
I just buried our luck.

597
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,994
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25...

598
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,237
has found a shitload of weapons
in a vill about a klik
and a half to our whisky.

599
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,954
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

600
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,833
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

601
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,078
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

602
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,159
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

603
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,511
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

604
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,710
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

605
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,673
- He don't like nobody around
when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

606
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,955
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

607
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,277
Aww.

608
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,197
Fuck! Doc.

609
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,192
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

610
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,199
- You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?
- Yeah.

611
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,872
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

612
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,112
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

613
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,152
Are you crazy? Another one
of those would kill him right now.

614
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,915
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

615
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,788
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home."

616
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,792
"This isn't your war."

617
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,117
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

618
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,636
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

619
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,513
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man
back to the rally point.

620
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,437
Oh, shit.

621
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,197
Save me, Curtis.

622
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,311
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

623
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,476
We're a team,
okay, brother?

624
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,353
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

625
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,438
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

626
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,477
Kill me.

627
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,551
Kill me!

628
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,549
I would do it for you.

629
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,835
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

I can't go home like this.

00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,548
Man, some shit got

730
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,517
What?

731
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,996
All I know is
my blood cells all fucked up.

732
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,829
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

733
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,309
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

734
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,750
Heroin ain't never did nothin' to me.
Lot of vets comin' down with this shit.

735
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,633
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

736
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,790
Damn.

737
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,992
Look, man, you wanna come on
in the crib or somethin', man?

738
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,076
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

739
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,873
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time do our thing.

740
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,877
You know what I'm sayin'?

741
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,397
- Brother.
- Brother.

742
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,034
- Go see your mama.
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.

743
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,516
With her fine ass. I been takin'
care of your mama while you been gone.

744
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,433
Boy, I kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

745
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,356
[Smacking Lips]

746
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,954
Mm.

747
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,031
[Smacking Lips]

748
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,597
You all right?

749
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,917
Yeah.

750
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,591
Well, can't you look me
in my eyes?

751
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,473
I ain't seen you
in four years.

752
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,670
What'd you do over there?
What was it like?

753
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,151
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

754
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,515
Well, Anthony, you're gonna
have to tell us something.

755
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,990
You know, a lot of them boys went over
there and got hooked on drugs and stuff.

756
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,908
Look. I was in
a special unit out there,

757
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,275
and bad habits could have
cost us our lives.

758
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,237
That's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits.

759
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,390
Now, if you picked up
some of them things,

760
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,750
there's a lot of places
you can go and get help.

761
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,190
No bad habits, Ma,
'cept a little killin'.

762
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,431
For my country,
of course.

763
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,789
Hey, let me give you some more of
these collards. Baby, this sure is good.

764
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,151
[Mr Curtis Chuckles,

765
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,035

Hey there. What's goin' on, blood?
Ain't seen you in a long time, man.

771
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,195

00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,475
All right.

Hey, what's goin' on? Hey, I got
next game, and you know that's my table.

774
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,595
[Man]
You call that a break?

775
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,511
Hold up there, now.
It's my shot.

776
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,433
Say, chump. Don't I know you
from somewhere?

777
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,634
Ha-ha! My man!
Joe, what's happenin'?

778
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,955
- Oh, man!
- Ahh! Ha-ha! Look at you!

779
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,196
- How you doin', man?
- Good, man.

780
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,556
- Jesus Christ, man!
I can't believe it's you.
- What's goin' on, man?

781
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,116
- You cool, man!
- I heard you got wounded out there.

782
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,310
Yeah, man.
I was in demolitions,

783
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,550
and my fuckin' hand
gets blown off, man.

784
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,757
- Oh, man. Shit!
- Yeah, man.

785
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,152
Hey, motherfuckers taught me everything
there is to know about explosives, man.

786
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,157
That right?
Check you out, papi.

787
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,516
- You got all those kids now.
- Oh, man. Hey.
You gotta check out Kirby, man.

788
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,398
- He's over in the back room.
- Yeah, let's go on back.
He's still back here, huh?

Doin' all right. You know, Kirby just

791
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,511

792
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,676
Blood!

793
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,752
- Hey, Nicky. What's happenin', man?
- Skin! Kirby back there, man.

794
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,075
That boy looked at me.
He said, "Kirby,

795
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,118
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' hair!"

796
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,636

Youngblood!

Man, I been everywhere

805
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,034
Motherfuckers forget about you gettin'
your ass almost blowed off...

806
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,957
or whatever the fuck.

00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,196
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

808

809
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,793
What? Work for me?

810
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,668
Yeah. You know, runnin' numbers,
like we used to do.

811
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,833
Shh! Fuckin' pigs
run me outta business.

812
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,674
How the pigs run you outta business,
man? You had 'em on the payroll.

813
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,194
Pigs are greedy.

814
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,396
And you gotta remember,
I'm dealin' with the N.Y.P.D.,

815
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,954

some cop kids to college. Shit.

819
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,037
I dig it.

820
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,357
This place ain't never
made much money.

821
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,955
So... I'm just hustlin'
here and there.

822
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,275
Tryin' to get over
just like everybody else.

for the past three years.

"Anthony Curtis."
You related to Tony?

828

The actor?

829
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,110
N-No. Not... Oh!

830
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,031
No. The act...
No, no, no, no.

831
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,953
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah, he's a white cat. Yeah.

832
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,316
Yeah, and his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

833
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,312
- [Laughs] Okay.
- You know anything about butchering?

834
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,231
Uh... I'm a fast learner.
