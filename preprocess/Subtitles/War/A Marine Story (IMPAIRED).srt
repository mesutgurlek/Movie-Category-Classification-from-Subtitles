00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,772
Use your legs.

164
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,608
I live like
five miles from here!

165
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,637
Shouldn't take you
too long then.

166
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,843
You know I didn't
steal anything!

167
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,250
You saw me, you know I didn't!
I was just there!

168
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:59,850
March back here
tomorrow morning, early,

169
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,987
without that stud
in your nose, and we'll talk.

170
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:05,022
Fuck you!

171
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,035
[Various radio announcers]

172
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,067
Our message to the
commanders in the field

173
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,635
and to our leadership is that,

174
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,840
based on our current
deployment model,

175
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,873
the troop levels
associated with the surge

176
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,647
cannot be sustained indefinitely.

177
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:28,314
That said, i have heard...

178
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,751
Here's your
Pentagon Channel Report...

179
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,554
Diplomatic commitments
from Iran

180
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,118
to help stabilize and improve
the security situation

181
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:37,097
in Iraq remain unfulfilled.

182
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:39,099
That's according
to Major General...

183
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,262
Everybody offered me
a lift but you.

184
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,867
Looks like you
need the exercise.

185
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,759
Hey, girl.

186
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,672
Get him another one,
would you?

187
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,903
I'll have the same.

188
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,976
Will we be startin' a tab then?

189
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,840
Yeah, why not.

190
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,342
So what else is going on?

191
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,378
You seen Holly?

192
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,113
I think she's livin'
up in Fresno now,

193
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,718
but I haven't spoken to her
since she went off to college

194
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,728
and you went off
to get the tattoo.

195
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,787
Wow...

196
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,856
That's been a while then.

197
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,928
Strange how you just
lose track of people.

198
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:53,135
At least I see the flag up
once in a while.

199
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,801
That's a reminder.

200
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:01,813
I should have stopped by
to say hello a lot sooner.

201
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,077
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,114
Ah...

203
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,678
You got married.

204
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,284
I did too.

205
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,427
You didn't miss much.

206
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,167
So...

207
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,931
When do you go back?

208
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,131
I am planning my next move...

209
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,904
I got my honorable discharge.

210
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,311
I thought they weren't
lettin' anyone out.

211
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,073
They are.

212
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,145
Yeah, but I thought
you were in for life -

213
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,778
family tradition and all.

214
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,455
Listen, if it has anything
to do with your marriage

215
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,460
to what's- his-name...

216
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,759
If he comes around here,
I'm gonna knock him down for ya.

217
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,963
He's a Navy SEAL, Leo.

218
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,302
Be a friggin' walrus,
I'll still knock him down.

219
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,471
He's not comin' around.

220
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,780
So you're out...

221
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,953
What next?

222
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,477
Exactly.

223
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:18,384
We'll have to find something
fun for you to do then.

224
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:26,926
Leo, l...

225
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,229
Hold that thought.

226
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,099
- Boys!
- Leo!

227
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:32,132
Get down here.
Somebody I want you to meet.

228
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,502
All right, guys, let's go.
To the troops!

229
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:35,868
To the troops!

230
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,412
- Ah!
- Yeah!

231
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,313
How would you even
know there's a war on?

232
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,874
They ain't raised taxes,
they lowered 'em.

233
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,283
Don't you read
the bumper stickers?

234
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,015
Yeah, and those yellow ribbons.
Those help.

235
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:52,017
So you lady Marines
all really Semper Fi and shit?

236
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,390
We're just called Marines.

237
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,759
But you still do all that
secretarial work, right?

238
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,855
They fly jets, idiot,
helicopters.

239
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,525
The only thing they
don't do is ground combat,

240
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,529
but that's gonna change.

241
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:03,134
Combat? No fuckin' way.

242
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,398
No offense, honey.

243
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:05,871
Try not to be a prick.

244
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:08,170
What Turk is saying,
in his graceful manner...

245
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,335
Very graceful.

246
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:12,210
...the difference between
men and women...

247
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,146
A gun is a great equalizer.

248
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,274
Yeah, yeah, but some jobs
men are just better at,

249
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,545
because of the muscle mass.

250
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:19,150
Muscle mass, Stenny!

251
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,416
It's not that women
aren't part of the team,

252
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,889
there's just the strength issue.

253
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:24,549
He's right.

254
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,022
There's that saying that
the strongest woman

255
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:28,289
is equal to the weakest man.

256
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,296
What?

257
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,127
It's true, so if we're
talking about combat...

258
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,894
What did you just say?

259
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,032
I didn't saying anything,
I'm just...

260
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,469
You just said that

261
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,372
the strongest woman
is equal to the weakest man?

262
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,137
Yeah.

263
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:44,303
I'd take that bet.

264
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,405
Dale, arm-wrestle her.

265
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,178
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

266
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,309
I'm not the weakest.

267
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:53,115
You want to go
round robin on this?

268
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,382
Cut to the chase.
You're it.

269
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,049
Woo!!!

270
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,990
Come on!

271
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,186
Lt'll be like
a little science experiment.

272
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:02,195
You got her, buddy.

273
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,925
Come on, baby,
make me proud.

274
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,590
A good clean fight...

275
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:10,599
No kicking, no biting, Dale.

276
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:11,930
I got 20 on Alex.

277
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,098
I got that bet.

278
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,607
Good. Put your money
on the table.

279
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,366
- Here we go.
- Ready?

280
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,379
One, two, wrestle.

281
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,210
Come on!

282
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,579
Put her down!

283
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,217
What the hell?!

284
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,485
What happened?

285
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:35,222
Well, we put that
theory to rest, boys.

286
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,025
Yeah, wait, wait!

287
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:39,897
I get shot, she can't
carry me off the field.

288
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,232
I can't carry you off the field.

289
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,328
All right, let's test this with a real man.

290
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,497
A lefty!

291
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,305
All right, hold on, hold on.
You know what, guys?

292
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,040
I think we proved the point.

293
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,509
- Alex, my compliments.
- Thank you.

294
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:00,216
- I'm buying.
- That's my money.

295
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:02,085
Cool!

296
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:13,160
The front line is just about
anywhere you drive a HumVee,

297
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,397
so women are
in combat every day.

298
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,234
But you can relax.

299
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:20,570
It's not gonna be
official policy any time soon.

300
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,043
I had a buddy who was a Marine,
and the women Marines...

301
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,677
well, all the other grunts
called them W. M.'s.

302
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,409
Waste of money.

303
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,615
- That's what he said.
- Jesus, Turk.

304
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,283
He's really not our friend.

305
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,189
- That's what he said.
- It's all right.

306
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:41,126
We have an all-volunteer military

307
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,526
that's stretched pretty thin

308
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,054
and they'll take pretty much
anyone they can get,

309
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,500
so I'd say if you're
not gonna join up,

310
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,060
you can shut the fuck up.

311
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:53,035
Well, she's got you there, bud.

312
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,702
What'd I miss?

313
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,578
Where are you going?

314
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,307
There's your difference
right there, boys...

315
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,110
Bladder the size of an acorn.

316
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,514
How's that?

317
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,989
He just decked her!

318
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,514
She shoved me!

319
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,158
What's goin' on?

320
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,495
All right, darlin', that's enough.

321
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,236
They hand out balls
to the lady Marines, too?

322
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,299
Everybody calm the hell down!

323
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,334
- Turk, stay away from her!
- Screw that,

324
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,073
I'm tired of this
toy soldier bullshit!

325
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,273
I said back off!

326
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,008
Jesus! Just chill out!

327
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,041
Go sit down.

328
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,583
Now you can hit me.

329
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,249
I said, sit down!

330
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,991
I'm callin' the police!

331
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,190
Turk!

332
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,663
Hey, Turk!

333
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,308
God!

334
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,743
(News plays on radio)

335
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,125
Sorry, Mom.

336
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,731
What I'm about to say is
extremely confusing to me,

337
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,330
and I'm sure will
come as a shock.

338
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,871
You're being investigated for
conduct unbecoming an officer.

339
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:47,245
What?

340
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,249
Specifically, homosexual conduct.

341
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,842
That's absurd.

342
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:57,351
Emails describing the nature of
a relationship have been discovered.

343
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:59,325
Sir, I have sent no emails.

344
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,487
You received them -
on a military email account.

345
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:04,759
Junk mail, immediately deleted.

346
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,528
- Apparently there's other evidence.
- What evidence?

347
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:09,866
That'll come out in the hearing.

348
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:12,770
I'm just informing you that
the process is in motion.

349
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,637
But who put the
process in motion?

350
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,573
It doesn't matter.

351
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,635
Sir, I have the right
to know my accuser.

352
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,512
Doesn't work that way, Alex.

353
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,709
Look, hopefully we can
clear this up

354
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,912
when the board of inquiry
is convened.

355
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,620
But you should know,

356
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:29,918
if they do find against you,
you might end up

357
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,920
with something worse than
an honorable discharge,

358
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,558
which you'd still get
if you decide

359
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:35,528
to separate before the hearing.

360
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:38,258
So, just keep that in mind.

361
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,732
Sir, with respect,
this whole thing is ridiculous.

362
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:41,860
I'm married.

363
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,665
Yes, I know.

364
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,194
It doesn't matter.

365
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:11,192
What am i doing?!

366
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,692
Dammit.

367
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:26,304
God dammit.

368
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,755
Anybody in there?

369
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,724
Hello?

370
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,257
Hey, Marine lady!

371
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,764
You better be home after
making me walk all this way.

372
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:57,406
Did you walk?

373
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,912
Or am I gonna find your car
at the bottom of the hill?

374
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,608
I walked!

375
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:02,945
OK...

376
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,876
Let's see if you're lying.

377
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:10,319
OK, so I drove.

378
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,917
I was gonna be late.

379
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,361
All right, now you get
to clean all the crap

380
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,830
off the driveway from here
to wherever your car is.

381
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,766
Yeah, right.

382
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,029
Listen, I'm here, OK?

383
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,032
So just give me
some talk or whatever.

384
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:26,296
Talk is cheap,
but it ain't free.

385
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:30,266
Oh, my God...
You're insane.

386
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,369
No, I just know that talk
ain't gonna work

387
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:33,879
on a meth head
with an attitude problem.

388
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,040
I am not a meth head.

389
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:37,443
Look, you're gonna wash out
of bootcamp your very first day

390
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:39,679
and end up in
a prison cell, or worse.

391
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,017
I can get you ready,

392
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,522
but I told you I'm not
gonna waste my time.

393
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:46,390
So either give me
total submission or get gone.

394
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,597
There's a rake and
garbage bags in the garage.

395
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,484
What a major bitch.

396
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,513
Punk.

397
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,624
I got you water.

398
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:33,101
Saffron?

399
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,402
[Chuckles]

400
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:18,084
And breathe, ladies.

401
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,484
Extend through the fingertips,

402
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,613
lift the back thigh up,

403
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:25,489
opening the hips and breathe.

404
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,789
Strong pose, fire pose.

405
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:31,826
Find some water in the pose,

406
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:34,561
find some flexibility
in the pose...

407
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:38,628
Somebody smile, somebody smile...

408
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:43,132
Extend and...
reverse crescent

409
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:47,169
and up over,
reversing the palm...

410
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,814
and looking up...

411
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,813
Breathe.

412
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,793
Hold the position.
[Both laugh]

413
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:04,657
The crazy thing is,

414
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:07,189
I didn't realize
until after I enlisted.

415
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,527
At that point you kinda
keep it to yourself

416
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,127
if you like your job...

417
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,934
I loved my job.

418
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,946
God, I feel like we should go
get a drink or something...

419
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,713
I've got to go teach.

420
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:27,982
I gotta head back anyway.

421
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,548
I just thought
I was gonna lose it

422
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,821
if I didn't tell
somebody the truth.

423
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:37,229
You can keep it a secret, right?

424
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,897
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,468
What about your family?

426
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,697
No, they don't need to know.

427
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,172
Not while my brother's deployed.

428
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,141
Not while my father's
still alive.

429
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,769
Leo?

430
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,609
This needs to stay
between us, OK?

431
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:58,811
Of course.

432
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,250
You know, I always
thought you had

433
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:10,224
a little crush
on me in high school.

434
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:12,928
Uh uh...

435
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,131
Oh!

436
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,099
Your crush on Leo didn't
do you much good, either.

437
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,699
No thanks to you.

438
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,207
What a confused and frustrated
little triangle that was.

439
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,908
Yeah.

440
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:38,149
Hey...

441
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,250
You've got your ring
on the wrong hand.

442
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:44,792
Is that some kind of code?

443
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,025
No...

444
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,933
I just broke this finger.
It won't fit anymore.

445
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:52,766
Does your husband know?

446
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,545
I'm just here to
pay for the damages.

447
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,848
It's been taken care of.

448
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:08,846
Leo?

449
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,257
What's he drinkin'?

450
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,933
You rack.

451
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:30,076
I get a little dizzy bending over.

452
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:38,081
Garbage!

453
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:42,020
Garbage... is gold!

454
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:45,216
You ain't got a shot now.

455
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,031
Hey!

456
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,363
You forfeit the game that way.

457
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:58,896
Shooting willy nilly is silly.

458
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:02,702
Fine.

459
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,232
Forfeit then.

460
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:07,269
We don't train
to shoot half-cocked.

461
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,248
Half-crocked, you mean.

462
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,116
You're fully crocked.

463
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:18,119
I can't do it. I won't.
So, I'm going home.

464
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:19,989
And I'm not even gonna drive,

465
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,153
because that's just
a bigger bullet.

466
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,925
I salute that wise decision.

467
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:26,227
As you were.

468
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:30,333
Hang a right out the door

469
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,032
and keep walking
until you see your mailbox.

470
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,233
Night, Turk!

471
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:37,175
W. M...

472
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,203
stands for Walkin' Marine!

473
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,875
Ooo-rah!

474
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:49,888
I used to drive a Chevrolet...

475
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:55,259
Now I'm walkin' everyday...

476
00:31:55,295 --> 00:32:01,029
I used to drive a Cadillac...

477
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:06,164
Now I'm humpin' with my pack...

478
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:09,232
(female Marines)
If i die in a combat zone...

479
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:12,302
(Drill Instructor)
Box me up and ship me home!

480
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:33,389
Close Combat Instructor,
Drill Sergeant,

481
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,869
Amphibious Warfare
School graduate...

482
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,928
Top marks all around.

483
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,997
And a Mustang to boot.

484
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,767
Just so we're clear,

485
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,745
I don't see how
you being a lesbian

486
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,839
makes a damn bit of difference.

487
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,281
I am not a lesbian.

488
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,808
And I didn't just
ask you if you were.

489
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:55,184
I'm just following the assumption.

490
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:00,092
We fight side by side with the
British and they let the gays in

491
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:02,094
so, believe me,
I know how stupid this is.

492
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:03,254
Yes, sir.

493
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:06,388
Certainly you've had to deal
with this issue in your command,

494
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,094
haven't you?

495
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,329
I had two men tell me they
were in love with each other

496
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,235
right after September 11th.

497
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:13,739
How did you handle it?

498
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:15,832
I told them to kiss.
They couldn't.

499
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,844
And you left it there?

500
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,507
They were just afraid
of what was coming.

501
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:24,376
They got over it.

502
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,385
So they stayed in the fight.

503
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,521
See, that's the issue,
right there.

504
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:34,192
If a homosexual is allowed
to stay in the fight,

505
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,751
maybe die in the fight,

506
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,093
there's no way in hell
some politician can tell 'em

507
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:40,531
who they can or can't marry.
You see what I mean?

508
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:45,932
It's not a matter of unit cohesion
or troop morale.

509
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:47,462
It's about the damn
marriage issue...

510
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,476
Respectfully,
I appreciate your insight,

511
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,411
but I really, really
don't care about this crap.

512
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,384
At ease, Major.

513
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:04,483
I just want to be
free to do my job, sir.

514
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,792
Now is not the time
to be losing any Marine,

515
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:11,296
that's certain.

516
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,390
Is there a way to
at least push this off

517
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,901
until I'm eligible for
my pension next year?

518
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:19,931
I'll see if I can
slow the wheels.

519
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:23,033
I'd appreciate whatever
you can do on my behalf, sir.

520
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,407
Got your back.

521
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,577
Dismissed.

522
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:21,060
[Giggling]

523
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:28,372
Corpsman up!

524
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,898
Corpsman!

525
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,638
You got a man down
over here...

526
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:35,244
Bone check.

527
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,873
All good.

528
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,578
Hotel, Echo, Lima, Papa!

529
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:42,213
This is Devilfish 1-2
calling medevac.

530
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:43,950
I'm hit!

531
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,420
Anybody copy?
I said I'm hit!

532
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:01,239
Where is everybody?

533
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:09,279
Where is everybody?

534
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,365
What a bender you're on.

535
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:06,503
Well, come on in.

536
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,142
The first thing you're gonna
see when you get off the bus

537
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,516
is a line of yellow footmarks.

538
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,316
You put your feet on them.

539
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:24,455
Stand at attention, like this.

540
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,151
Eyes and head
straight to the front.

541
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:28,422
Don't look in my eyes.
Look straight front.

542
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,224
Do not ever make eye contact.

543
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,234
It will be late in the evening.

544
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:39,067
You will be tired and hungry
and disoriented.

545
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:40,766
And that's exactly
the way they want you,

546
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,497
because for the next few hours

547
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:45,477
every manifestation of what you
consider to be your identity

548
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:47,035
will be stripped away.

549
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,208
Your clothing, your hairstyle,
your mannerisms,

550
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,444
speech patterns,
bad habits, everything.

551
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:55,477
They get in your face and call
you maggot even if you're a girl?

552
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,783
Yes.

553
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,786
- Show me.
- No.

554
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:03,659
Sheriff said you were
a drill instructor once.

555
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:05,129
Let's see it.

556
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,222
No.

557
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:09,795
Do it.
Call me a maggot.

558
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:11,799
You know you want to.

559
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:14,029
Ever since you saw me
you've had it out for me.

560
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,097
So just do it.

561
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:17,473
It's not like you haven't already
been a major bitch anyway.

562
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,408
I'm curious to see...

563
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:20,571
Curious will get you killed, recruit!

564
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:24,276
From now on, everything you
need to know I will tell you!

565
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:27,081
Everything you think
you know, you will forget!

566
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,486
Did I not just explain to you
how to stand at attention?

567
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:30,716
Shoulders back!

568
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,247
How old are you, Snow?

569
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,384
- Uh, 20.
- Uh? Uh?

570
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:36,258
We do not say 'uh'
in the Marine Corps.

571
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:38,525
Uh is something you hear
from little lady meth- heads

572
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,054
who sell their twats for a fix.

573
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,090
You sell your twat
for a fix, Snowblind?

574
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,432
Uh, no...
I mean no!

575
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,300
You will answer me
ma'am, yes ma'am.

576
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,430
Do you understand me?

577
00:38:46,472 --> 00:38:48,303
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

578
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,310
Did it take you 20 years to
get this stupid, Snowflake?

579
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,436
- OK.
- Hey!

580
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:54,446
Did I tell you
to step off your marks?

581
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,505
Why are you not
standing on your marks?

582
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,414
Do you need
your fix, Snowblind,

583
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,316
or are you just ready to
run home to grandma?

584
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:03,345
All right, I get it, OK!
Stop it, stop it!

585
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:04,515
Holy shit!

586
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,258
I am not a meth- head!
I've never even tried it!

587
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:18,467
I'm just being hard on you

588
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:21,473
so you're not completely
unprepared for boot camp.

589
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:23,407
What I've been describing here

590
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,843
is day one
with the Marine Corps.

591
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,847
The Marine Corps is
the toughest, the elite.

592
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:31,875
With you I think we try Air Force.

593
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,882
Where you goin'?

594
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,180
Aspirin.

595
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,331
What's next, Major Bitch?

596
00:39:58,177 --> 00:39:59,371
That's not bad.

597
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,347
Don't stop!

598
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,370
You said a mile.

599
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,179
Yeah, but we gotta
time you for three.

600
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:06,913
Keep goin'!
Go, go, go!

601
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,212
Move! Go!

602
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:10,882
Come on, love it, do it...

603
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,621
Just go until your body stops.

604
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,183
Don't listen to your mind.

605
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:16,217
Good.

606
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,389
Come on, stay up there, stay.
Come on, come on!

607
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,530
Well, you didn't pass the
minimum physical requirements,

608
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:25,594
but you did better
than I thought you would.

609
00:40:25,638 --> 00:40:26,900
Really?

610
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:27,928
Rule number one...

611
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:29,698
Never smile within sight
of your drill Instructor.

612
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,801
You have no right looking
happy in boot camp.

613
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:34,404
And if you do look happy,
they'll remedy the situation.

614
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:39,881
Used to be a beauty queen...

615
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:42,251
Now I got my M-16...

616
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,952
They're gonna hound you all day,
make you make mistakes.

617
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:52,528
You're gonna feel
worthless sometimes,

618
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,260
but that's the
enemy you fight.

619
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,858
You're not worthless,
you're just learning.

620
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:57,830
You OK?

621
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,571
Get some rest,
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

622
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:09,847
- Leo.
- Saff.

623
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:15,982
What happened to your face?

624
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:18,486
Managed to get hit
with a razor this time.

625
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:22,427
What are you doing with her?

626
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,326
Little project.

627
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,996
Well, I came over
to offer another apology

628
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,863
over the idiocy
that happened the other night.

629
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,735
This is the idiot maker.

630
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:35,604
How 'bout some coffee?

631
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,734
- If you say so.
- C'mon.

632
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:43,548
What?

633
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:47,383
Just... memories.

634
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,446
I got a shoebox full of those.
C'mon.

635
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:09,504
Hey, you wanna ride?

636
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,533
No, thanks.
Just go on.

637
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,324
Don't slam the door.

638
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,998
Food's on the counter.

639
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:47,872
I spoke to your mother.

640
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:54,342
She said don't worry,
everyone is just fine.

641
00:42:57,323 --> 00:43:00,520
Said to make sure
I told you that.

642
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,801
Do you hear me?

643
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,033
Yes.

644
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,863
Saffron...

645
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,956
Don't worry.

646
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:43,127
Everyone is gonna be just fine.

647
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:48,500
Help is comin'...

648
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,510
Help is...

649
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,682
There's no bikes in boot camp!

650
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:38,020
Come on!
My legs are toast!

651
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:40,184
You will fall down,

00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:31,302
Hi.

818
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:57,389
Whoaaa!

819
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:02,565
That is way overdosin'
on the Kool-Aid, yo.

820
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:04,159
Don't say yo.

821
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,400
Ma'am, yes, ma'am,
but jiminy.

822
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:10,605
What happened to you?

823
00:57:12,711 --> 00:57:14,269
Nothin'.

824
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:17,815
What did this?

825
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,413
Tree branch.

826
00:57:20,452 --> 00:57:22,352
Tree branch with fingers?

827
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:30,417
Think you can teach me
some karate moves?

828
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:33,220
Yeah.

829
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,895
Wait. You leavin'?

830
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:39,597
I don't know what I was doing.
Pick that up.

831
00:57:46,478 --> 00:57:48,673
Put your hands on my shoulders.

832
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:50,442
If someone's gonna
grab your shoulders,

833
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:52,973
first thing is you smack
and grab here on the wrist...

834
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,313
Put your arm
on top of my arm.

835
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:58,845
Yeah, that's it.

836
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:05,329
If you're choking,
the first thing is to

837
00:58:05,363 --> 00:58:07,422
turn your head
so you can breathe...

838
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:13,997
Put your hand down along
this seam and fold it over...

839
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,469
E- 5, Sergeant, :
E- 6, Staff Sergeant, :

840
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:18,305
E-7, Master Sergeant...

841
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:19,537
No.

842
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:21,546
E-7 is Gunnery Sergeant.

843
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:23,414
Right.

844
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:25,416
E-8, Master Sergeant
and First Sergeant;

845
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,385
E-9, Master Gunnery Sergeant
and Sergeant Major...

846
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,682
Give me 20 pushups.

847
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:31,814
Oh, come on,
all the way down.

848
00:58:31,857 --> 00:58:35,987
57, 58, 59, 60...

849
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:37,619
Yeah!

850
00:58:37,662 --> 00:58:39,493
Call me maggot now, bitch!

851
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,499
Turn it, twist it, pop...

852
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,333
I'll see you bright and early.

853
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:49,306
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

854
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:57,410
So what's the deal
with this house?

855
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:00,441
Your dad doesn't seem
to wanna live here...

856
00:59:00,485 --> 00:59:01,975
You don't wanna hang around.

857
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:06,057
The General is happier
in Florida with his cronies.

858
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,589
And I'm not ready
to settle down yet.

859
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:11,662
Why don't you just sell it?

860
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:13,323
My mom's ashes are here.

861
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:31,677
- How many times have you gone?
- Three.

862
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:33,650
How many are you gonna do?

863
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:35,949
One more than my body
tells me I can.

864
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:38,912
That was in the mailbox.

865
00:59:42,694 --> 00:59:44,559
Hey, don't wear your legs out!

866
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:45,824
We're goin' to a party!

867
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,698
It's a good idea you had.

868
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:52,567
Thanks for goin' along with it.

869
00:59:52,604 --> 00:59:55,835
She's on my team.
No arguments, birthday boy.

870
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,702
I tried to invite Dale.

871
00:59:58,743 --> 01:00:01,473
I was hopin' we could make up
and all be friends,

872
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:02,707
but no one's seen him.

873
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,706
Well, how about this
for a replacement?

874
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:09,578
Leo?

875
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:10,883
Holly?

876
01:00:12,657 --> 01:00:13,919
Hey, you.

877
01:00:18,063 --> 01:00:19,997
Am I the only one
gettin' older around here?

878
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:22,363
- No.
- You haven't changed a bit.

879
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,367
Yes, she has.

880
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:25,369
She never would have done
something like this

881
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:27,963
back in the day -
our little granola girl.

882
01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:30,133
- What's up, Marine?
- Hey!

883
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,672
Ready to play?

884
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,877
Green team get ready!

885
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:37,842
Red team get ready!

886
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:40,140
OK, everybody, don't bunch up,

887
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,444
but always keep a teammate
within eyesight.

888
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:44,148
Let's paint these losers!

889
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:45,151
[Whistle blows]

890
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,755
Here we go...

891
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,622
You might want to
tuck your head down.

892
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:51,760
Hey, beanpole.

893
01:00:57,102 --> 01:00:59,161
That came outta nowhere.

894
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:00,769
Usually does.

895
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:03,871
Get your hand up.

896
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:19,122
That wasn't nice.

897
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,753
Happy birthday, Leo.

898
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:24,784
Hey, Stenny.

899
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:27,796
Fuck!

900
01:01:27,832 --> 01:01:30,130
Stenny!
I'm on your team!

901
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:31,692
Oops!
[Whistle blows]

902
01:01:31,736 --> 01:01:32,794
You're outta there!

903
01:01:32,837 --> 01:01:34,702
- Sorry, OK?
- Fuck.

904
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:37,941
That was quick.

905
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:39,170
Friendly fire.

906
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:41,935
Yellow...

907
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,971
Looks like alien blood.

908
01:01:44,015 --> 01:01:45,676
Better than the red stuff.

909
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,446
I don't know, you know...

910
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:52,081
I mean, workin' out,
makin' beds, gettin' yelled at -

911
01:01:52,123 --> 01:01:53,215
that's one thing.

912
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,619
But killin' people,
that's something else.

913
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:59,226
I can't even get
a spider out of the tub.

914
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:02,490
The military is gonna
train you to do lots of things.

915
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:04,661
Non-killer stuff.

916
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:07,671
I think there's only a week of
rifle training in the Air Force.

917
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,935
Still...

918
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:13,535
I just don't think
I have it in me.

919
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:17,708
That impulse, or instinct,
or whatever it is.

920
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:24,019
Yeah, baby, eat paint!

921
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:30,694
The green team is drunk drivers.

922
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:37,527
The red team is your family...
Alive.

923
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:47,104
Damn!

924
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:49,274
Bastard!

925
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,012
I'm out!

926
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,987
[Whistle blows]
New game!

927
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:00,286
Stenny, you head up
the left flank.

928
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:02,652
Everyone, if you stick
in one spot too long

929
01:03:02,694 --> 01:03:04,286
you just broadcast
your position.

930
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:07,126
Turk? Turk?!

931
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:09,065
Keep movin'... I got it.

932
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:13,661
[Whistle blows]

933
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:16,970
Let's go.

934
01:03:23,948 --> 01:03:26,178
Keep your head down
and check your colors before you shoot.

935
01:03:26,217 --> 01:03:28,208
Don't shoot your teammate.
Go, go!

936
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:00,206
Yes.

937
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,240
That's my girl.

938
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,193
Saffron, keep moving!

939
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:11,855
Move up! I'll cover you!

940
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:32,707
Ow!!!

941
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:49,757
Holly?

942
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:53,137
That's for your
next birthday, sunshine.

943
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:56,698
Leo, you son of a bitch!

944
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:58,641
Holly, we're on the same team!

945
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:01,407
[laughing]

946
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:02,704
Get him!

947
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,287
Try not to get paint everywhere!

948
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,152
It's more like colored
egg whites or something.

949
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,158
Try not to get eggs everywhere.

950
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:16,786
Stenny, which one is red?

951
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,762
He can't tell you that.

952
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:20,388
He's color blind,
ain't you, Stenny?

953
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:23,832
You shot me twice
in the back!

954
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:26,098
My aim just really sucks.

955
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:27,229
Here you go.

956
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:29,832
Wait, hold on.
She's got a big day tomorrow.

957
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:32,900
I'm taking her down
to the recruiting station.

958
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:34,775
- Excuse me?
- It's time.

959
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:36,040
You sure about that?

960
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,048
Yep, you're strong enough now.

961
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:40,778
Not quite as much of a punk
as she used to be either.

962
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:42,750
I don't know about that.

963
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,755
Seriously, though...

964
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:46,757
After everything you've
been through,

965
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:50,227
after all you've survived,
that is saying a hell of a lot.

966
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:52,821
To Saffron...

967
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:56,231
I think you've already made
a lot of people very proud.

968
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:58,326
(all)
To Saffron!

969
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:02,740
Hey, she's gotta
have a beer now!

970
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:05,936
Her eyeballs are sweating.

971
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:07,376
Awwww...

972
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:11,076
Girls are awesome.

973
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:13,845
I'm gonna drop her at home.
Save my chair for me.

974
01:06:13,885 --> 01:06:14,977
Gentlemen...

975
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,043
Attention!

976
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:18,113
Aw...

977
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:21,389
At ease.

978
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:23,018
I'll go with you, hold on.

979
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,926
And leave Holly alone
with this wolf pack?

980
01:06:24,962 --> 01:06:26,088
Mmmm...

981
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:35,501
That girl was a train-wreck
three weeks ago.

982
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,264
Alex really shaped her up,
didn't she?

983
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,003
You shoulda married her, boss.

984
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:41,011
It should be clear
to all by now, Stenny,

985
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:42,512
that I'm nowhere near worthy.

986
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:43,509
Screw that.

987
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:45,147
She never really
liked you anyway.

988
01:06:45,183 --> 01:06:46,844
- True.
- Thanks, Bill.

989
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:48,943
Has anyone ever
met her husband?

990
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:53,023
Should i come in
and talk to your grandma?

991
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:55,925
No, she'll be way in
her cups by now.

992
01:06:56,828 --> 01:06:58,853
I'll pick you up around ten then?

993
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:00,796
I think I'll march
up to your place.

994
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:02,800
It'll help take the edge off.

995
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:05,462
Just don't wear those clothes
and everything will be fine.

996
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,530
What if I'm not ready?

997
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,902
They'll make you ready.
That's their job.

998
01:07:13,945 --> 01:07:15,435
What if I don't make it?

999
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,539
Well, as my mom used to say,

1000
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:21,775
"Failure ain't the falling down,
it's the staying down."

1001
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:26,518
She died when I
was around your age.

1002
01:07:27,825 --> 01:07:29,417
I don't know if you knew that.

1003
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:31,353
I did.

1004
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,388
Heard she was a real beauty.

1005
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,166
She was.

1006
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:44,804
- Get some sleep.
- I'll try.

1007
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:10,197
What the hell is this?

1008
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:15,099
I was waitin' around
hoping you'd tell me.

1009
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:22,876
So...

1010
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,275
Tell me.

1011
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:28,079
Is all that true?

1012
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:31,511
What the fuck have you done?

1013
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:33,557
[laughter]

1014
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,492
Come on.

1015
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:39,325
Flag's flyin'!

1016
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:40,921
We're home!

1017
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,559
Whoa!

1018
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,534
What's with all the carpeting?

1019
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:45,866
We'll take a tour tomorrow.

1020
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:47,962
Come on, you can
sleep in Nicky's room.

1021
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:51,065
Nicky... How's he doing?

1022
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:52,405
He's giving 'em hell.

1023
01:08:52,443 --> 01:08:55,003
I want to ask you abut Saffron.

1024
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:56,138
What?

1025
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,547
Why are you
sending her away to them,

1026
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:02,075
after what they did to you?

1027
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:03,950
When somebody falls,

1028
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:06,013
somebody's gotta take their place.

1029
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:09,416
You didn't fall.

1030
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:13,454
I left them one short.

1031
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:15,523
Which one?

1032
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:17,534
[laughing]

1033
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:19,664
C'mon, take those clothes off.
They're filthy.

1034
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:21,396
I gotta pee.

1035
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:28,604
OK, c'mon, it's this way.

1036
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:36,245
Ahhh!!!

1037
01:09:38,256 --> 01:09:39,348
What is it!

1038
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,187
You got shot.

1039
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:44,160
Oh, I thought I had measles...

1040
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:45,423
You're OK.

1041
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:50,330
Oooh, your neck...

1042
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:51,995
Yeah, I know.

1043
01:09:52,036 --> 01:09:53,162
Let me see what you got.

1044
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:56,105
Damn, you're a leopard!

1045
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,631
Stenny fragged you good.

1046
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:14,055
He kissed my hand
after you left.

1047
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:15,456
Leo?

1048
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:17,120
Yes.

1049
01:10:17,161 --> 01:10:18,992
And now I kiss you.

1050
01:10:21,966 --> 01:10:23,331
OK...

1051
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,562
Now everybody's happy...

1052
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:32,237
Everybody gets what they wanted.

1053
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:34,141
That's nice.

1054
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:36,578
- Come on.
- Where you going?

1055
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:38,172
To bed.

1056
01:10:38,215 --> 01:10:39,739
Oh, no.

1057
01:10:39,984 --> 01:10:41,076
OK.

1058
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,583
Go to sleep.

1059
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:12,414
She late?

1060
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,542
Yeah.

1061
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:17,049
Why don't you go get her?

1062
01:11:17,688 --> 01:11:19,246
No.

1063
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:23,392
Horse to water kind of thing?

1064
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:24,519
Basically.

1065
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:31,534
I think I drunk-dialed Leo
last night.

1066
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:33,594
Uh, oh.

1067
01:11:36,173 --> 01:11:38,539
And I offer a blanket mea culpa

1068
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:41,409
for any other stupidity
that may have transpired.

1069
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:43,140
You didn't break anything.

1070
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:46,815
So, what's next for you?

1071
01:11:47,818 --> 01:11:50,719
I gotta get a job.

1072
01:11:50,755 --> 01:11:53,053
I was just short of my pension.

1073
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:56,283
God, those idiots.

1074
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:59,693
I wish ignorance was painful.

1075
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,700
[Phone ringing]

1076
01:12:10,574 --> 01:12:12,166
Where are you?

1077
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:16,637
OK...

1078
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:20,173
Give me the address.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1079
01:12:22,086 --> 01:12:23,178
By the airport?

1080
01:12:44,108 --> 01:12:45,439
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

1081
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:54,516
You wanna sit down?

1082
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,381
I, uh, pulled a few favors to
get a flight routed through here.

1083
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:03,188
They actually gave me leave.
Can you believe that?

1084
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:05,718
Just to come home
and file for divorce.

1085
01:13:05,763 --> 01:13:07,424
I could have done it.

1086
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,727
No...

1087
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:10,734
Something's up.

1088
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:12,633
I need to play this right.

1089
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,231
Go back to the base,
raise a stink, file the papers.

1090
01:13:16,273 --> 01:13:18,741
Let everybody see...

1091
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,506
I'm gonna have to
put on a show,

1092
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:23,410
say some crappy things about you.

1093
01:13:28,185 --> 01:13:29,379
I'm sorry.

1094
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:36,393
So...
Tell me what happened.

1095
01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:42,792
They had pictures.

1096
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,295
They were taken four years ago.

1097
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:48,396
The pictures were
four years old?

1098
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,337
Yes.

1099
01:13:49,373 --> 01:13:52,865
And they finally just got around
to showing it to a review board?

1100
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:57,678
There were some
harmless emails, too,

1101
01:13:57,715 --> 01:13:59,740
recent ones -
None that I sent.

1102
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:01,752
- Harmless?
- Yes.

1103
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:05,580
You must have
done somethin' else.

1104
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,386
Were you drinkin' again?

1105
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:09,590
No.

1106
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:12,562
Did you piss anybody off?
Hit on the wrong girl?

1107
01:14:12,596 --> 01:14:13,290
No.

1108
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,390
Maybe they were scrutinizing me
because they caught wind of you.

1109
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:30,407
I wasn't with anyone
the entire four years

1110
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:32,540
since those photos were taken.

1111
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:35,983
I knew it was getting risky,

1112
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,780
so I transferred to a new base,
I severed all ties,

1113
01:14:38,823 --> 01:14:42,725
and I have been
immaculate, pristine, since.

1114
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,387
When you transferred,
did you sleep around

1115
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:46,259
with any of the guys
on the base?

1116
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,959
No. I thought marrying
you covered that.

1117
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:51,832
Come on, that's no fail safe.

1118
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:53,894
You know you've got to
feed the rumor mill.

1119
01:14:53,938 --> 01:14:55,997
What about Pollard?
He's not married.

1120
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,333
You could have broken
a sweat on his back.

1121
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:02,538
I did.

1122
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:08,617
It didn't matter.
He was just playing me.

1123
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,885
I'm sorry.

1124
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:20,463
It might not be worth it, Joe.

1125
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,892
It's got to be.

1126
01:15:37,281 --> 01:15:38,873
Call me when you
file the papers.

1127
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:39,905
I will.

1128
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,508
Be careful.

1129
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:16,679
Tequila, Shel.

1130
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:32,795
What?

1131
01:16:33,737 --> 01:16:36,467
I'd like to say it's
none of my business,

1132
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:39,442
except it was taped to
the door of my business.

1133
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:42,368
And I have no idea
who put it there.

1134
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:52,015
I run a business
where judging people

1135
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:54,081
don't make a whole lot of sense.

1136
01:16:57,728 --> 01:16:58,717
And?

1137
01:17:00,597 --> 01:17:02,656
I don't think this is right.

1138
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,362
That girl is really screwed up
enough as it is.

1139
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,907
OK, Shelly,
thanks for everything.

1140
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:14,877
Say goodbye to the fellas for me.

1141
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,574
Calm down.
No one's runnin' you out of town.

1142
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:19,582
- That should cover my tab.
- Hey!

1143
01:17:22,519 --> 01:17:24,783
Mind if we talk

Go ahead.

1145
01:17:29,393 --> 01:17:31,156
Somebody papered
the town last night.

1146
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:33,727
I was able rip most
of them down, I think.

01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:38,631
I know this is complete crap.

1150
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:40,569
I was here when this
picture was taken,

1151
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:42,162
and nothing was going on.

1152

But who would bother?

1155
01:18:02,926 --> 01:18:05,656
This part is complete crap.

1156
01:18:05,696 --> 01:18:06,890
Of course.

1157
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:12,093
This part is true.

1158

Since when?

1159
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,514
Since long after.

1160
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:31,682
Oh, man...

1161
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:35,688
That's funny.

1162
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:41,987

I couldn't.

1164
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:58,011
So the million dollar question,
of course, is...

1165
01:18:58,048 --> 01:18:59,811
did I ruin things for you?

1166
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:03,952
No!

1167
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:10,118
Just a preference then?

1168

No.

1169
01:19:28,712 --> 01:19:31,112
All right, let's just
focus on who did this.
