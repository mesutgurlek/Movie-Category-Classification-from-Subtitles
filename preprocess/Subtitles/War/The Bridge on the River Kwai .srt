1
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:42,133
Finish work!

2
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,531
Go to hut.

3
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,210
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:49,046
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

5
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,209
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,331
Dig, dig.

7
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:57,006
How about putting us
on sick list?

8
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,211
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

9
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,614
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:06,206
Why you always play sick, Shears?

11
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,215
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

12
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:11,651
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,451
...how about a butt?

14
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,257
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

15
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:20,569
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.

16
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:23,450
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,406
...like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

18
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,415
That's why...

19
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,407
...l want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,015
Think I stole it?

21
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,811
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

22
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:44,651
He gave it to me
for a favour I'd done him.

23
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,730
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

24
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:50,411
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:56,008
You go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,814
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

27
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:02,615
...then where'll we be?

28
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:07,414
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,615
Far away.

30
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,208
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,810
Here lies....

32
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,255
I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,691
Thomson.

34
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,211
Ah, yes.

35
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,329
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:28,206
...serial number zero-one-two-
three-four-five-six-seven.

37
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:33,207
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:37,810
...who died of beri-beri
in the year of our Lord, 1 943...

39
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:40,407
...for the greater glory of....

40
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,648
-What did he die for?
-Come off it.

41
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,013
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:49,212
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:52,208
May he rest in peace.

44
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,531
He found little of it
while he was alive.

45
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,887
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:08,055
Mark time!

47
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:20,371
Halt.

48
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:26,336
Into line, left turn.

49
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:30,415
Stand easy.

50
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:40,211
We're going to be
busy gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,610
Well done, well done.

52
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,252
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

53
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,408
You going to tell him the truth?

54
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:57,851
Of course not.

55
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,809
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

56
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,530
My name is Nicholson.

57
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,606
I am Colonel Saito.

58
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:52,613
In the name of His lmperial Majesty...

59
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,614
...l welcome you.

60
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:58,606
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

61
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:01,730
...which is Camp 1 6...

62
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,207
...along the great railroad...

63
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:09,412
...which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

64
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:14,645
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

65
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,934
...to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

66
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:22,936
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

67
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:27,807
And officers will work as well as men.

68
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:33,172
The Japanese Army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

69
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:38,170
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

70
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:41,816
But if you do not work hard...

71
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:44,485
...you will be punished.

72
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:49,212
A word to you about escape.

73
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,417
There is no barbed wire.

74
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,615
No stockade.

75
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,530
No watchtower.

76
00:16:57,377 --> 00:17:00,050
They are not necessary.

77
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:02,817
We are an island in the jungle.

78
00:17:03,017 --> 00:17:05,895
Escape is impossible.

79
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,811
You would die.

80
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:14,212
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

81
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:20,296
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

82
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,250
" Be happy in your work."

83
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:24,806
Be happy in your work.

84
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:28,651
Dismissed.

85
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,533
Battalion, stand at ease.

86
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:38,130
Fall out, Major Hughes.

87
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,413
Battalion, stand easy.

88
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,612
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

89
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,087
I'm going to have a word
with this fellow.

90
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,006
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

91
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:57,807
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

92
00:17:58,017 --> 00:18:01,248
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

93
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,410
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labour...

94
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,972
...is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

95
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:09,371
Is that so?

96
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:11,215
I have a copy of the convention...

97
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,295
...and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

98
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:16,807
That will not be necessary.

99
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,209
Sit down, please.

100
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:10,851
Yes, sir.

101
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:54,406
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

102
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,851
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

103
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,815
-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.

104
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:03,367
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

105
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,771
How do you do, sir?

106
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,615
We found him and an Australian.

107
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,808
All that's left of the
prisoners who built the camp.

108
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,649
U.S. Navy? Out here?

109
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:12,808
I am sort of landlocked.

110
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:15,127
-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.

111
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:18,653
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

112
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,250
And your group here?

113
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,613
Mostly Aussies. Some lime--

114
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,012
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

115
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,809
And what happened to them?

116
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,416
They died...

117
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:33,608
...of malaria, dysentery,
beri-beri, gangrene.

118
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,051
Other causes of death:

119
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:39,210
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

120
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,090
...Saito.

121
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,496
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

122
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:45,931
Has Clipton seen you?

123
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:49,169
Just about to. Come over here,
you can shave later.

124
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,496
All right.

125
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:55,814
You'll stay with the officers.

126
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,649
We'll find some decent clothing.

127
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,256
Don't bother about me.

128
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,613
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

129
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:04,576
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.

130
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,847
The officers in your party
did manual labour?

131
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,695
I think you could call it that.

132
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:12,010
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

133
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,411
Saito.

134
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,415
-I think he understands now.
-Is that so?

135
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,809
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

136
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,854
Well, I must be pushing on.

137
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,815
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

138
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,810
-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.

139
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,731
Anything we can do.

140
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,569
Thank you, sir.

141
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:35,047
-What is it?
-Never mind.

142
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:36,616
Go on, say it.

143
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:39,856
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

144
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:43,407
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

145
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,615
Perhaps Col. Nicholson
defines the word differently.

146
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,451
Any other points?

147
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:58,096
-By your leave, sir?
-Jennings?

148
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:01,249
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd. Shears--

149
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,249
There won't be any escape committee.

150
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:05,931
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.

151
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:08,850
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

152
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:13,329
Where? lnto this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

153
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:17,411
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.

154
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:21,613
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

155
00:22:21,897 --> 00:22:25,446
I'd say that the odds against a
successful escape are 1 00 to one.

156
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,405
But may I add another word?

157
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:28,851
Please.

158
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,094
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

159
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:35,215
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

160
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,611
To give up hope of escape...

161
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:40,054
...to stop thinking about it
means accepting a death sentence.

162
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:42,857
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

163
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:46,806
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

164
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,008
I understand how you feel.

165
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:53,929
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

166
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:56,930
But my men and I are
involved in a curious legal point...

167
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,247
...of which you are unaware.

168
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:03,012
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

169
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,855
Ordered, mind you.

170
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,415
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

171
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:10,851
Interesting point, sir.

172
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,531
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

173
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:17,207
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

174
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:20,017
Without law, commander,
there is no civilization.

175
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:23,495
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.

176
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:26,416
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

177
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:29,611
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

178
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:33,208
Is there anything else?

179
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,808
I think we're
clear on the program.

180
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:41,527
I want everything to go off smoothly
starting tomorrow morning.

181
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,250
And remember this:

182
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,409
Our men must always feel they are
still commanded by us...

183
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,534
...and not by the Japanese.

184
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:52,850
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

185
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,088
Are you with me there, commander?

186
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:02,414
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:04,687
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:06,933
A living slave.

189
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:21,814
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri--

190
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,931
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

191
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:29,090
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,806
English prisoners!

193
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:51,409
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:57,253
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:03,012
You will finish the bridge
by the twelfth day of May.

196
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:08,293
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,447
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,611
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:20,529
This is only just...

200
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:24,607
...for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:27,285
Your shame is their dishonour.

202
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:29,928
It is they who told you...

203
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:34,568
...better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

204
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:37,934
It is they who brought you here,
not l.

205
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:43,412
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labour.

206
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:45,610
That is all.

207
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,731
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:52,411
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,017
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

210
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:03,811
...to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:07,051
" Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

212
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,253
...who are fit,
other than officers--"

213
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:10,691
Give me the book.

214
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,371
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

215
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,647
-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.

216
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:19,014
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,128
You see, the Code states that--

218
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:25,217
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,167
You speak to me of Code?

220
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,810
What " Code"?

221
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:33,133
The coward's code!

222
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,732
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

223
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:40,014
Of bushido? Nothing!

224
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:42,612
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:57,934
If you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized world...

226
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:01,647
...we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:05,014
My officers will not do manual labour.

228
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,890
We shall see.

229
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:13,611
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:26,809
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

231
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:30,611
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:37,415
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

233
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:42,209
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

234
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:45,730
Eyes right.

235
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,607
Eyes right.

236
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:57,808
Eyes front.

237
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:09,406
Quick march, eyes right.

238
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:22,813
" C" Company, by the right.

239
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:24,775
What's he up to?

240
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:30,016
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

241
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:48,130
Now, you will be reasonable.

242
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:51,452
You will order your officers to work.

243
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,891
No.

244
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:24,808
I will count three.

245
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,928
If by the third count...

246
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:31,409
...you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

247
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:34,211
...l will give the order to fire.

248
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,410
He's going to do it.

249
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:48,327
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

250
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,451
One.

251
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,176
I warn you, Colonel....

252
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:02,810
Two.

253
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:07,050
Stop!

254
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,617
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

255
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:16,648
So has every man in the hospital.

256
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,216
They're too many witnesses.

257
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:22,291
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

258
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,372
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

259
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:41,416
You see, Jennings, there are
advantages to being on the sick list.

260
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:44,455
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

261
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,847
" Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

262
00:31:47,097 --> 00:31:48,416
How's that, sir?

263
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,536
That kind of guts.

264
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:52,449
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4...

265
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:55,257
...when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

266
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,614
-I see what you mean.
-You don't see what I mean at all.

267
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:01,616
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

268
00:32:40,497 --> 00:32:44,206
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

269
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,215
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

270
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:50,410
What about him?

271
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,930
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

272
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:58,807
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

273
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,376
Here we go again.

274
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:14,412
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

275
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:16,410
Tell them to go.

276
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,735
Not you.

277
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,291
Come.

278
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:02,169
Leave him alone!

279
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:05,535
Leave him alone!

280
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:58,212
They're going to put him in the oven.

281
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:23,212
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

282
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:27,772
For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:30,167
And so say all of us

284
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:35,007
And so say all of us
And so say all of us

285
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:40,132
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

286
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,648
For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:46,172
And so say all of us

288
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:51,293
Timber!

289
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:59,134
One, two, three, four.

290
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:04,172
One, two, three, four.

291
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,615
No, no, no!

292
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,485
Let go!

293
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,251
Let go!

294
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,936
You wish to see me?

295
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,293
I've tried to see you for three days.

296
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:06,495
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut--

297
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:11,453
I could have you shot.

298
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:16,135
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

299
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:18,130
I knew nothing about the escape.

300
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:20,848
It does not matter.

301
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,855
One must respect those who tried.

302
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,692
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

303
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,575
...they were soldiers again.

304
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,495
But it is insane to try and escape.

305
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:38,855
Two soldiers shot
and the third drowned.

306
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,496
To what end?

307
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,450
It was an escape from reality.

308
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:53,055
There is your reality.

309
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:57,853
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

310
00:39:58,457 --> 00:40:01,767
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

311
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:08,373
Because of your colonel's stubbornness,
we are far behind schedule.

312
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,572
That is not all.

313
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:13,011
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

314
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:17,005
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

315
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,766
Then who would build your bridge?

316
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,894
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

317
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:25,049
The men don't work well
without their own officers.

318
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:29,893
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

319
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:31,929
That's for Nicholson to decide.

320
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:33,849
As he said,
it's against the rules.

321
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,093
Do not speak to me of rules.

322
00:40:36,337 --> 00:40:38,055
This is war!

323
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:40,254
This is not a game of cricket.

324
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:46,653
He's mad, your colonel...

325
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:49,855
...quite mad.

326
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,645
Sit down, please.

327
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:02,727
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

328
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,371
Thank you.

329
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:08,891
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

330
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,970
...l'll be forced
to close the hospital...

331
00:41:12,217 --> 00:41:15,448
...and your patients will
work in their place.

332
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:19,849
Many will die,
and he will be responsible.

333
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:24,376
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

334
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:54,732
Doc's going to see the old man.

335
00:41:58,457 --> 00:41:59,651
Sir....

336
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,256
It's Clipton, sir.

337
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:09,049
I brought you a few things.

338
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:16,611
-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.

339
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:20,850
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

340
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:25,330
And the officers?

341
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,091
Not so good.
They're still in detention.

342
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:32,455
And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.

343
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:35,093
-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.

344
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:38,647
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

345
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:43,173
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

346
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,487
I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?

347
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:48,456
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

348
00:42:52,457 --> 00:42:54,971
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

349
00:42:55,217 --> 00:42:57,253
I've got something to tell you.

350
00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:59,852
I've just had a word with Saito.

351
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,613
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

352
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:06,775
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.

353
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:24,485
Blackmail!

354
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:29,174
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

355
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:32,887
It's a question of face, pure and
simple. And he can't give in.

356
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:35,367
It's still blackmail.

357
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:41,849
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

358
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:47,052
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

359
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:52,091
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

360
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,255
But Saito's cut their food rations...

361
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:57,488
...and if he makes
the sick men work....

362
00:43:57,737 --> 00:44:01,366
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

363
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,296
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

364
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,971
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

365
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:10,846
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

366
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:18,050
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

367
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:22,773
We're under a man who'll stop at
nothing to get his way. Principle!

368
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:26,966
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

369
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:29,615
Give in, sir. Please!

370
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:31,256
I'm adamant.

371
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:35,046
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

372
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,889
-Time.
-All right.

373
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:42,456
Please thank those concerned.

374
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:45,456
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

375
00:44:45,697 --> 00:44:47,255
Reynolds stole the coconut.

376
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:51,451
We'll be able to get you
food sometimes.

377
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:54,052
We've bribed one of your guards.

378
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:03,534
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

379
00:45:04,097 --> 00:45:05,576
Many thanks.

380
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:15,173
Did you say that American
was killed?

381
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:17,453
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

382
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:21,850
It's insane to plan escapes.

383
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,769
Three men killed, and to what end?

384
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,211
Time!

385
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:30,372
Here is where we must win through.

386
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:53,650
Doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

387
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:57,293
Means only one thing,
the colonel won't give in.

388
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:10,811
Well?

389
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:12,650
It's like this.

390
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:15,457
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

391
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:17,733
It's a question of principle.

392
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:21,294
As medical officer, I protest
the way he's being treated.

393
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:23,414
It's a wonder he's still alive.

394
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:27,451
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

395
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:31,613
He is responsible.

396
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,210
Not l.

397
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:45,610
You sick?

398
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:51,207
Are they both mad?

399
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:54,608
Or am I going mad?

400
00:46:56,537 --> 00:46:57,856
Or is it the sun?

401
00:49:52,977 --> 00:49:54,410
Attention!

402
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,211
Battalion, attention.

403
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,013
English prisoners.

404
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,612
Let us ask the question...

405
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:08,894
...why does the bridge not progress?

406
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:14,332
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

407
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:18,810
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

408
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:21,256
This is not just.

409
00:50:21,497 --> 00:50:24,534
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

410
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:28,567
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

411
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:31,253
But there is another cause.

412
00:50:31,497 --> 00:50:34,409
I do not hide the truth.

413
00:50:35,017 --> 00:50:37,406
With deep shame and regret...

414
00:50:37,657 --> 00:50:39,852
...l admit to you the failure...

415
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:42,816
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

416
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:45,167
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

417
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:47,728
He is a bad engineer.

418
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:50,127
He is unworthy of command.

419
00:50:50,577 --> 00:50:54,889
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

420
00:50:56,697 --> 00:51:00,406
Tomorrow we begin again.

421
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,008
I shall be in personal command.

422
00:51:04,497 --> 00:51:06,488
Today we rest.

423
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:12,814
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy!

424
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:16,607
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

425
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:19,291
...l give presents to you all.

426
00:51:31,017 --> 00:51:33,406
Let us be happy in our work.

427
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:36,936
Company, dismissed.

428
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:41,613
Battalion, dismissed.

429
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,726
Hey, take a look at this.

430
00:51:57,977 --> 00:52:00,537
Red Cross! He's given us our--

431
00:52:00,777 --> 00:52:03,610
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

432
00:52:03,817 --> 00:52:07,014
"Tomorrow we begin again."

433
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:10,770
Hey, Harry, look!

434
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:13,688
They're letting the old man out.

435
00:53:35,217 --> 00:53:38,209
Most likely going to give him
another pasting.

436
00:54:20,697 --> 00:54:22,130
Good evening, colonel.

437
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,808
Do you mind sitting over here?

438
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:34,415
I am having rather a late supper.

439
00:54:56,577 --> 00:54:58,807
English corned beef.

440
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:01,210
No, thank you.

441
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:08,734
Produce of Scotland.

442
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,527
I prefer it to sake.

443
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:13,057
I spent three years in London,
you know.

444
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:15,571
I spent three years in London,
you know.

445
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:19,327
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

446
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,170
Cheers!

447
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:23,930
Sorry.

448
00:55:24,177 --> 00:55:25,929
Later, perhaps?

449
00:55:26,177 --> 00:55:27,735
Perhaps.

450
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,327
I was not a good artist.

451
00:55:35,537 --> 00:55:37,767
My father disapproved.

452
00:55:38,017 --> 00:55:40,326
He felt I belonged in the army.

453
00:55:41,377 --> 00:55:44,926
So I changed from art to engineering.

454
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:49,528
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

455
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:53,366
I intend to make a full report
of your activities.

456
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:02,132
I do not think you
quite realize my position.

457
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:05,768
-I must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.

458
00:56:06,017 --> 00:56:09,771
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 1 2th day of May.

459
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:12,577
-I have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.

460
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:17,368
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

461
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:20,336
No officers, except
for administration.

462
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:24,530
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

463
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:26,335
You know it. I know it.

464
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:29,335
I'm not responsible
for other officers.

465
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:30,970
Personally, I'm appalled.

466
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:33,486
Let's not get excited.

467
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,336
Will you have a cigar?

468
00:56:40,537 --> 00:56:42,448
No. Thank you.

469
00:56:44,297 --> 00:56:47,733
When I said all officers must work...

470
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:51,247
...naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

471
00:56:51,497 --> 00:56:55,536
My orders were only intended
for officers below--

472
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:57,728
No officers will do manual labour.

473
00:56:57,977 --> 00:57:01,128
Please! I was about to say:

474
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:04,534
I've thought the matter over
and have decided...

475
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:09,055
...to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

476
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:11,936
...leaving only junior officers
to work.

477
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,573
No. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

478
00:57:28,617 --> 00:57:33,168
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

479
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,975
I haven't the foggiest.

480
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:37,731
I'd have to kill myself.

481
00:57:38,177 --> 00:57:40,737
What would you do if you were me?

482
00:57:41,217 --> 00:57:43,731
I suppose if I were you...

483
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:46,527
...l'd have to kill myself.

484
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:49,805
Cheers.

485
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,451
I warn you, colonel...

486
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:57,975
...if I am to die,
others will die before me.

487
00:57:58,217 --> 00:57:59,411
Do you understand?

488
00:57:59,657 --> 00:58:02,171
Clipton did mention that.

489
00:58:02,377 --> 00:58:04,766
That won't solve your problem.

490
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:07,326
I'm sure we can
arrive at a solution.

491
00:58:07,577 --> 00:58:09,135
Please sit down.

492
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:15,527
Now. Tell me, colonel...

493
00:58:15,977 --> 00:58:19,367
...do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

494
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,414
-Of course.
-Good.

495
00:58:23,817 --> 00:58:25,011
Now.

496
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:29,328
Take this bridge of yours.

497
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:32,133
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

498
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:36,330
Frankly, I doubt whether
your Lieutenant what's-his-name...

499
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:38,329
Miura.

500
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:42,932
...is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

501
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:48,329
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

502
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:52,127
...who have built bridges
all over lndia.

503
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:54,730
The men respect them.

504
00:58:54,977 --> 00:58:58,492
It's essential for an officer
to have that respect.

505
00:58:58,697 --> 00:59:00,767
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

506
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:03,326
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.

507
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:06,933
A poor commander I would be if
I allowed that to happen.

508
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:12,092
Perhaps you are not aware that
the bridge is now under my command.

509
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:15,932
Really? And may I ask, are you
satisfied with the work?

510
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:18,367
-I am not!
-You've proved my point.

511
00:59:18,617 --> 00:59:20,733
I hate the British!

512
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:23,974
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

513
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:26,526
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

514
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:29,655
You endure
but you have no courage.

515
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:31,569
I hate the British!

516
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:34,448
Pointless, going on like this.

517
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:35,891
Stay there!

518
01:03:04,017 --> 01:03:06,133
Stand down. Stand down!

519
01:03:15,257 --> 01:03:17,646
Battalion, attention!

520
01:03:56,017 --> 01:03:58,656
Battalion, stand at ease.

521
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,530
Please....

522
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:06,530
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

523
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:08,410
I've lost count.

524
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:11,330
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

525
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:14,176
...over Russia in 1 905.

526
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,376
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

527
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:20,369
In honour of this occasion...

528
01:04:20,617 --> 01:04:23,211
...l have given your troops
a day of rest.

529
01:04:23,457 --> 01:04:24,651
Many thanks.

530
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:27,775
I am declaring a general amnesty.

531
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:31,373
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

532
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,767
As part of this amnesty...

533
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:39,052
...it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labour.

534
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,251
He's done it!

535
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,567
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

536
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:41,609
How many men in your party?

537
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,734
I don't really know, sir.

538
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,013
-You don't know?
-Twelve, usually.

539
01:07:46,257 --> 01:07:49,408
One of the men took sick
this morning, sir.

540
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:52,848
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

541
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:57,967
And-- He took terrible sick, sir.

542
01:07:58,257 --> 01:08:01,772
A corporal should know
how many men he has under him.

543
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:04,168
Oh, yes, sir.

544
01:08:05,057 --> 01:08:08,572
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.

545
01:08:10,137 --> 01:08:14,210
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behaviour.

546
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,572
No, sir.

547
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:21,777
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

548
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:33,566
-I say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?

549
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,167
Ever built a bridge
over a stream like the Kwai?

550
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:40,813
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them
in Madras, Bengal....

551
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:42,968
If this were your bridge...

552
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:45,773
...how would you get it under way?

553
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:49,409
Get it under way, sir?

554
01:08:49,657 --> 01:08:52,171
First of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

555
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,487
Oh, why not?

556
01:08:54,737 --> 01:08:56,216
I was trying to tell you...

557
01:08:56,457 --> 01:09:00,166
...the Japanese couldn't have
picked a worse location.

558
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:02,768
You see those piles?

559
01:09:03,017 --> 01:09:04,575
They're sinking.

560
01:09:06,857 --> 01:09:10,566
We could drive those logs
forever and they wouldn't hold.

561
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:12,768
Where would you build it?

562
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:16,815
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

563
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:19,776
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

564
01:09:20,337 --> 01:09:24,569
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

565
01:09:24,977 --> 01:09:28,890
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.

566
01:09:30,737 --> 01:09:32,773
Uncoordinated activity.

567
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:34,575
No teamwork.

568
01:09:36,057 --> 01:09:39,174
Some parties are working
against each other.

569
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,571
Yes.

570
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:48,974
I say, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

571
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:51,811
Thanks to the Japanese,
we command a rabble.

572
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:54,366
There's no order, no discipline.

573
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:58,615
-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.

574
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:00,609
Which isn't going to be easy.

575
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:04,213
Fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

576
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:06,766
-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.

577
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:13,573
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that'll put them to shame.

578
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:16,371
Show what a British
soldier is capable of.

579
01:10:16,617 --> 01:10:19,177
Yes. I see your point, sir.

580
01:10:19,377 --> 01:10:22,016
I know how difficult
it's going to be here...

581
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:24,612
...where you can't find what you need.

582
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:27,769
-There's the challenge.
-I beg your pardon, sir.

583
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:30,406
You really want them
to build the bridge?

584
01:10:30,657 --> 01:10:33,171
You're not usually
so slow in the uptake.

585
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:36,210
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

586
01:10:36,457 --> 01:10:39,369
If there weren't any work,
we'd invent some.

587
01:10:39,617 --> 01:10:42,370
-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.

588
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:45,006
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

589
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:47,293
Here again I know the men.

590
01:10:47,537 --> 01:10:50,415
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

591
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:52,170
-Right, men?
-Yes, sir.

592
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:55,175
Reeves, you're
the key man here as engineer.

593
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:59,171
Tell me what you want and we'll
get it. Can we make a go of it?

594
01:10:59,377 --> 01:11:01,572
-We'll do out best, sir.
-Fine.

595
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:04,966
We must draw up our plans...

596
01:11:05,577 --> 01:11:08,171
...then arrange a conference
with Saito...

597
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:10,768
...and set him straight.

598
01:11:16,017 --> 01:11:19,168
That takes care of all
the procedural matters.

599
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:21,570
Oh, yes.

600
01:11:22,017 --> 01:11:25,697
The next point is unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

601
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:29,572
Sorry to say, the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

602
01:11:29,777 --> 01:11:31,972
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

603
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:35,686
Incorrectly?

604
01:11:35,937 --> 01:11:37,370
Unfortunately, yes.

605
01:11:37,617 --> 01:11:40,211
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

606
01:11:40,457 --> 01:11:43,654
...and decided that the river bottom
there is too soft.

607
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:45,651
Too soft?

608
01:11:45,897 --> 01:11:48,252
Mud! All the work
has been useless.

609
01:11:48,497 --> 01:11:49,857
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.

610
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:51,370
-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.

611
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:56,572
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

612
01:11:56,857 --> 01:11:59,496
It would collapse
under the first train.

613
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:03,810
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

614
01:12:04,017 --> 01:12:08,932
Reeves, before you get too involved....
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

615
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:25,405
I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

616
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:30,572
...we build a new bridge, at the site
picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

617
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,777
Let's proceed to the next point.

618
01:12:35,777 --> 01:12:36,175
Let's proceed to the next point.

619
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,571
I decided to alter
the work quota of our men.

620
01:12:39,777 --> 01:12:41,415
-Alter?
-I've increased it.

621
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,091
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved
to two.

622
01:12:44,337 --> 01:12:46,976
I'm sure it will
meet with your approval.

623
01:12:47,177 --> 01:12:50,374
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?

624
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:53,490
I've done a time study
of the entire project.

625
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:57,412
You see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

626
01:12:57,657 --> 01:13:01,206
I'd urge we revise the
organization of the working parties.

627
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:06,372
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

628
01:13:06,617 --> 01:13:08,972
Would it be possible
to have dinner?

629
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:10,366
Of course.

630
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:15,176
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

631
01:13:15,377 --> 01:13:19,086
If we increase the squads
and specialize their functions...

632
01:13:19,337 --> 01:13:23,489
...l'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30º/0 .

633
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:26,774
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point....

634
01:13:27,577 --> 01:13:32,367
Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.

635
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,767
As the British
will work on the bridge...

636
01:13:35,017 --> 01:13:37,815
...only a few will be available
for railway work.

637
01:13:38,057 --> 01:13:42,767
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

638
01:13:42,977 --> 01:13:47,368
...so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

639
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:50,772
I have already given the order.

640
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:53,975
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

641
01:13:54,177 --> 01:13:57,965
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards
so as not to overtire them...

642
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:00,811
...but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

643
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:04,174
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

644
01:14:06,017 --> 01:14:09,134
I have already given the order.

645
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:11,811
We'll try to surpass that,
won't we, Hughes?

646
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:14,890
I think that completes
the agenda for tonight.

647
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:18,413
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

648
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:21,410
Are there any other questions?

649
01:14:22,817 --> 01:14:24,375
One question.

650
01:14:25,057 --> 01:14:27,412
Can you finish the bridge in time?

651
01:14:27,657 --> 01:14:31,013
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

652
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:33,566
But we'll certainly give it a go.

653
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:38,895
Don't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

654
01:14:39,137 --> 01:14:40,889
...for which I was not to blame.

655
01:14:42,457 --> 01:14:44,175
Is there anything else?

656
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:45,972
No.

657
01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:50,365
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

658
01:14:51,457 --> 01:14:53,971
-Good night.
-Good night.

659
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:21,369
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

660
01:15:22,057 --> 01:15:25,174
For now I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

661
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:28,576
-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.

662
01:15:30,617 --> 01:15:32,608
By the way, I meant to tell you...

663
01:15:32,857 --> 01:15:35,576
...there are trees here
similar to elm.

664
01:15:35,777 --> 01:15:39,565
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

665
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:42,775
-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.

666
01:15:43,817 --> 01:15:45,967
Six hundred years.

667
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:48,573
That would be quite something.

668
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:39,206
I'm looking for an American
named Commander Shears.

669
01:16:39,457 --> 01:16:42,574
-Yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.

670
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,171
Kiss!

671
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:53,057
Too many eyes.

672
01:16:53,057 --> 01:16:53,773
Too many eyes.

673
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:57,970
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas....

674
01:16:58,257 --> 01:16:59,610
All I need is love.

675
01:16:59,857 --> 01:17:02,576
It's true.
All you really need is love.

676
01:17:07,177 --> 01:17:10,169
Why are you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

677
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,612
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

678
01:17:12,857 --> 01:17:14,893
And I always follow my heart.

679
01:17:15,137 --> 01:17:16,365
Kiss.

680
01:17:24,577 --> 01:17:26,568
How's that, commander?

681
01:17:27,577 --> 01:17:29,169
Don't call me commander.

682
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,696
It's unromantic.

683
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,575
You're an officer yourself.

684
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:35,610
How'd you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

685
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:38,212
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

686
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,486
Yes, sir.

687
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:42,690
Brass ahoy.

688
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:45,169
He wants you. He's all yours.

689
01:17:45,377 --> 01:17:47,766
-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me!

690
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:50,810
-Commander Shears?
-Yes.

691
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,775
My name's Warden.

692
01:17:53,137 --> 01:17:54,695
-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--

693
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,292
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.

694
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:58,486
Like a martini?

695
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:00,409
That's very kind.
I think not.

696
01:18:00,657 --> 01:18:01,772
Mind if I have one?

697
01:18:02,017 --> 01:18:03,291
How did you get that?

698
01:18:03,537 --> 01:18:06,768
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

699
01:18:07,017 --> 01:18:09,372
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

700
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:12,166
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

701
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:15,807
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 31 6.

702
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:18,412
Our headquarters is in
the Botanical Gardens.

703
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:21,774
-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.

704
01:18:22,457 --> 01:18:24,766
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.

705
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:28,765
We have an interest
in that railway you worked on.

706
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:32,168
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

707
01:18:32,377 --> 01:18:35,767
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

708
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,969
...and I told your people
everything I know.

709
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:42,414
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

710
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:47,572
I know it's a terrible imposition, but
could you possibly come out and see us?

711
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:51,815
If you want to go over
the whole thing again.

712
01:18:52,057 --> 01:18:54,617
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.

713
01:18:54,857 --> 01:18:56,006
-Who?
-Mountbatten.

714
01:18:56,257 --> 01:18:58,771
We're one of his special pigeons.

715
01:18:58,977 --> 01:19:02,572
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car.

716
01:19:02,777 --> 01:19:04,768
This evening? Out of the question.

717
01:19:05,017 --> 01:19:07,167
Tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?

718
01:19:07,457 --> 01:19:09,812
-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.

719
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,173
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.

720
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:13,571
Good luck.

721
01:19:14,457 --> 01:19:15,572
Thanks.

722
01:19:23,257 --> 01:19:26,966
You're sorry, but
you're going to stand me up tonight.

723
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:29,168
You couldn't be more wrong.

724
01:19:34,057 --> 01:19:35,097
General salute!

725
01:19:35,097 --> 01:19:35,893
General salute!

726
01:19:36,137 --> 01:19:37,809
Present arms!

727
01:19:51,057 --> 01:19:53,776
-May I see your pass, please?
-Oh, yes.

728
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:08,975
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

729
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:23,568
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

730
01:20:23,977 --> 01:20:27,174
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.

731
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:30,977
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.

732
01:20:30,977 --> 01:20:32,376
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.

733
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,966
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!

734
01:20:37,817 --> 01:20:41,366
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

735
01:20:42,577 --> 01:20:45,410
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

736
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:48,171
You see, he's gained the initiative.

737
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,006
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

738
01:20:52,257 --> 01:20:54,373
-You're sorry?
-So am l.

739
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:57,768
-I thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.

740
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:01,771
-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

741
01:21:02,777 --> 01:21:05,974
-What can I do for you?
-I'm going to see Major Warden.

742
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:09,697
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

743
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:10,368
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

744
01:21:16,257 --> 01:21:19,374
-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.

745
01:21:19,577 --> 01:21:19,777
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

746
01:21:19,777 --> 01:21:23,565
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

747
01:21:25,737 --> 01:21:27,967
-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?

748
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:29,576
Good of you to come.

749
01:21:29,817 --> 01:21:32,411
-They took care of you?
-They certainly have.

750
01:21:32,657 --> 01:21:35,615
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

751
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:38,576
Col. Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

752
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:44,852
-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Didn't know it was a commando school.

753
01:21:45,177 --> 01:21:49,773
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

754
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,371
What do you do here?

755
01:21:51,577 --> 01:21:53,886
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

756
01:21:54,137 --> 01:21:57,015
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.

757
01:21:57,257 --> 01:21:59,771
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

758
01:22:00,017 --> 01:22:03,327
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
at half the weight.

759
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:07,370
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

760
01:22:07,737 --> 01:22:09,170
Thanks for telling me.

761
01:22:09,377 --> 01:22:12,687
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

762
01:22:12,897 --> 01:22:15,172
You can do what you like with it.

763
01:22:16,017 --> 01:22:17,575
This is my place.

764
01:22:22,817 --> 01:22:24,170
Go ahead.
