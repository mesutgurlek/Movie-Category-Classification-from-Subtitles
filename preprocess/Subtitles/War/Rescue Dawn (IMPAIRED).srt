At ease, gentlemen.
Be seated, please.

4
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,033
As you've all probably noticed,
we're currently headed north.

5
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:26,443
Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, we will
be taking a position at Yankee Station.

6
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,708
That means we're back in business.

7
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,618

in the jungle environment,

15
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,747
the smart soldier must understand
that nature is not a force against him.

16
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:05,342
He has to make nature work for him

17

by utilizing the ample natural
provisions at his disposal.

it's right above your head!

Jeez. Shake it, Pops.

36
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,984
He's got a nice ass for a sailor,
I'll tell you that.

37

NARRATOR:
Are you a smart soldier?

40
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,859
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting
some South Vietnamese generals

41
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,935
against a few infiltrators. Whole thing
would be done in three, four weeks.

42
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,003
You picked the wrong time

43
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,071
- to enlist, Dengler.
- I know.

44
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,968
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly,

45
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:36,476
and everybody, they were telling me
all about the fantastic massage parlors

46
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,637
and the go-go girls, everything, and...

47
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:41,181
And what did I get?
Goddamn one night?

48
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:44,080
- One night in Saigon. That's me.
- Yeah, and that didn't go so well.

49
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,016
Gentlemen, next please.

50
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,981
Okay.

51
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,458
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?

52
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,026
What you see is what you get.

53
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,995
- Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,691
I see plastic there and how about...

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,099
Are you able to give me two slices
of that plastic, please?

56
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,296
- Sir?
- And maybe six foot by three foot,

57
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,531
you put a zipper in the middle,

58
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,664
- and I crawl inside...
- What you're describing

59
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:07,764
is a sauna, not a mosquito net.

60
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,400
Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

61
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,843
And you put some netting on it
so I can breathe through at night time.

62
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:13,072
- You got it, sir.
- Yes?

63
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:14,671
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

64
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,082
Now, look here. Look at this.
I have my boot on your table.

65
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:20,882
- Why do I have my boot on your table?
- I don't know, sir.

66
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,321
Okay, this is why. Look at this.

67
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:27,684
Can you create a flap for me
in the tongue here

68
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:31,129
so I could hide my American passport
inside of here should I need it?

69
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:34,793
You know what, sir? Since you're my only
customer today, it would be my pleasure.

70
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,234
Thank you.

71
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,904
So, Charlie got his shit together.

72
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,911
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire
around Mugia Pass.

73
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:48,676
Change direction and altitude
every seven seconds

74
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,344
so the radar of the enemy gun
cannot lock onto you.

75
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:57,322
Your secondary target will be
the intersection of 121 and 90.

76
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,449
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

77
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
That's right, Spook, inside Laos.

78
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,529
Now, one more thing.

79
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,465
They've been using your radios
to lure our rescue teams into ambush.

80
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,436
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

81
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,303
But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

82
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,572
You scrap anything
that they can use against you.

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,680
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant Dengler's
first mission.

wingman. You think you can handle that?

87
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,952
I could not ask for a better man, sir.
But, please,

88
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,186
- could I ask you a question, sir?
- ADMIRAL: Go ahead.

89
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,455
You know, Spook is such
a goddamn daredevil,

90
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:40,125
could you please order him not to
try too hard to die for his country,

91
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:44,638
but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch
on the other side die for his instead?

92
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,338
Okay. All right, boys.

- You all set?
- TROOPS: Yes, sir.

95
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,306
- TROOPS: No, sir.
- Okay. Let's go, go, go!

- Come on, Diet.

99
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,925
Come here.
This is what we would do as kids

100
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,328
when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.

101
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:13,627
But we would usually pee right now.

102
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,566
- Can we pee?
- I don't really have to.

103
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,001
I'm not gonna.

104
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:20,136
But this will keep us safe. Okay, fellas?

105
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,370
Stay out of trouble.
Come back in one piece. Good luck.

00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:36,079
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

315
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:40,249
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

316
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,726
This hut, it ain't no prison.

317
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:49,757
Scram. I like that. I like that.

318
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,805
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

319
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:57,307
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

320
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,972
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

321
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:07,314
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

322
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,220
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

323
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:15,318
The jungle is the prison. Don't you get it?

324
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:22,262
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

325
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,233
Five months, maybe six.

326
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,272
I can't wait that long.

327
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:32,538
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

328
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:36,547
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

329
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:38,514
you won't make it out of camp.

330
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:41,348
There's six guards posted during the day.

331
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,814
Yeah.

332
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:47,390
That is during the day.

333
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:51,057
I'm going at night.

334
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,600
Why, what happens at night?

335
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,876
No.

336
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:05,811
No.

337
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:07,312
No.

338
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:13,213
I'm shitting my intestines out.

339
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,319
Again.

340
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:19,516
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

341
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:24,895
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

342
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:29,957
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

343
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:31,798
Leave the guy alone, okay?

344
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,099
There ain't no alone, brother.

345
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,667
Does anybody have a nail?

346
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:38,539
What are you gonna do with a nail?

347
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,477
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

348
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:43,947
What kind of plane you fly off of?

349
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:47,676
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.

350
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:48,981
I have porcupine needle.

351
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:50,316
No.

352
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,782
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

353
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,654
There's no nails.

354
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,995
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

355
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,295
Damn it.

356
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,333
I know where there's a nail.

357
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,114
Okay.

358
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,289
I'm gonna make my move.

359
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:31,256
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

360
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,558
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

361
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:37,432
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

362
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,936
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

363
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:43,371
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.

364
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:44,773
Please.

365

You trust me? Please.

366
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,143
Duane, head to the outhouse.

367
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,650

Gene, please come on. No, no, no.

369
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,924
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

Let me get some of that. That's good.

374
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:32,816
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

375
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,120
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.

376
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:38,323
Okay.

377
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:48,195
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.

378
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,002

Oh, God. Oh, God, that was an easy one.

388
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:18,519
You see, I apprenticed as a tool
and die maker in Germany.

389
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,133
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

390
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:28,001
that would help me repair planes.

391
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:32,908
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

392
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:35,412
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

393
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:36,981
that is Smith and Wesson.

(EXCLAIMS)

395
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:47,048
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

396
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:56,494
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

397
00:44:57,536 --> 00:45:01,438
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

398
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,805
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

399
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,810
They think it's impossible.

400
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:09,014
Show me how you did that.

401
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:13,117
It's so simple. Okay.

402
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:17,050
All you do, insert the nail.

403
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:20,716
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

404
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:25,286
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

405
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,594
You see? This is what happens inside.

406
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,768
- And the cuffs release.
- GENE: Wow.

407

No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

411
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,370
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

418
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:27,116
No. But my guess
is that this here's still Laos.

419
00:46:27,793 --> 00:46:29,761
And the guards, they're...

420
00:46:29,862 --> 00:46:30,920
- Laotian.
- ... Laotian?

421
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

422
00:46:32,865 --> 00:46:34,457
there's no question.

423

Look, I know what you're thinking,

Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

- No, but if we can get to Thailand...
- Yeah.

00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,585
No clear reason,
just these senseless attacks.

475
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:21,925
But I remember I was in the attic
with my brother.

476
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:25,424
We were looking out,

477
00:50:26,198 --> 00:50:29,429
and we see this fighter plane,

478
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:33,527
beautiful, coming right at us.

479
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,405
And it's firing from its wings,

480
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:40,638
and I see the machine gun,
it's flashing and it

(IMITATES WHOOSHING)

goes flying past the house.

483
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,778
It's so close. I mean,
it's feet away from the house.

484
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:54,592
And the canopy was open.

485
00:50:56,295 --> 00:51:01,733
And this pilot,
he had his goggles up on his helmet.

486
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,036
And I could see his eyes.

487
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:08,064
And he was looking at me.

488
00:51:08,974 --> 00:51:10,271
Right at me.

489
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,070
He's looking right at me.

490
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:15,635
And as he turns to go, he's starting back,
he's looking right at me still.

491
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:17,442
And the thing is,

492
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,777
from that moment on, little Dieter,

493
00:51:22,988 --> 00:51:24,853
he needed to fly.

We need the rain to come quicker.

See, here's what I can see,
you still need to understand.

500
00:52:24,783 --> 00:52:28,310
- No, I understand.
- You wanna talk about the rain again, we...

Listen, now. Listen.

502
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:35,291
We will be released
by the time the rain comes

503
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:37,021
like I have told you before...

504
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:40,496
- Stop telling me.
- I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

505
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,534
- Then stop telling me.
- They will release us.

You understand?

507
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,633
And here's what I'm starting to think,

508
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:49,764
that maybe you're trying
not to understand.

509

510
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,649
we will be killed,
we who you leave behind.

511

- It's not just me, we all try to escape.
- Taking off. We who have been here

We escape together.

Why would the guards spend all this time

to be here for a while?

- Exactly.
- Two years.

519
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:18,027
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they...
- Listen. Listen to me.

520
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:21,105
- ... didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

I am not, I'm not gonna let you do that.

to the kitchen hut for chow time,

they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

before they return for their rifles.

we grab their guns,

- we surprise them.
- No.

...and we surround them, okay?

Then we take the guards as prisoners.

617

We take over the camp.

01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,397
(COUGHING)

796
01:13:51,773 --> 01:13:54,640
I think they believe we call in aircraft.

797
01:13:58,213 --> 01:14:01,182
- DUANE: (CRYING) I can't take this.
- Duane. Duane.

798
01:14:02,117 --> 01:14:03,516
- You hang in.
- I can't take it anymore.

799
01:14:03,618 --> 01:14:04,949
You hang in.

800
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:08,219
I'm your true friend.

801
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,250
I'm your true friend. I would not lie to you.

802
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:12,520
I will never let you down, okay?

803
01:14:12,627 --> 01:14:14,060
- Okay.
- Never.

804
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:18,692
- Okay.
- Never.

805
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,960
Okay.

806
01:14:46,795 --> 01:14:47,762
(WHISPERING) Hey.

807
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,561
So, listen.

808
01:14:50,265 --> 01:14:52,790
Once we have got the guards,

809
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:56,170
we are gonna set up a perimeter.

810
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:59,164
If reinforcements come along
this jungle path...

811
01:14:59,274 --> 01:15:00,241
(SHUSHING)

812
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,639
They're having some kind of discussion
in the kitchen.

813
01:15:02,744 --> 01:15:06,180
I understand what they are saying.
I just need to hear.

814
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:08,613
(MUTTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

815
01:15:19,694 --> 01:15:21,855
Hey, what's going on?

816
01:15:21,963 --> 01:15:23,157
Silence.

817
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:28,831
So what are they saying?

818
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:30,564
What they're discussing is this.

819
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:33,402
They sent some villagers out
to forage for some rice.

820
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:35,476
- Yeah?
- They came back with nothing.

821
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:39,240
Ever since the bombings,
the entire province cannot grow rice.

822
01:15:39,347 --> 01:15:41,008
I didn't think it could get any worse.

823
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:43,277
No, it's much worse than that.

824
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:47,355
They plan to march us out
in the jungle and kill us,

825
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:50,516
and make it look
as if we were trying to escape.

826
01:15:51,827 --> 01:15:56,287
They wanna all go back to their villages
and somehow try to get some food.

827
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,767
The ringleaders are Little Hitler
and Crazy Horse.

828
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:02,359
- I knew it.
- Okay, so

829
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:05,831
it has to be tomorrow.

830
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,505
Come here.

831
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,170
Procet.

832
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,977
We are still a day short
of Independence Day, but so what.

833
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:20,349
Hey, there's no rain.

834
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,113
Tomorrow,

835
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:25,651
chow time.

836
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:31,985
DIETER: So then, Duane and I

837
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:36,722
will go this way outside of the fence.

838
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:41,760
The four of you will go this
way outside of the fence.

839
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:45,931
And we must all
arrive at the kitchen

840
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,943
at the same moment
to encircle them.

841
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:53,845
This is the most important thing, okay?

842
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:58,283
And then you two,
you will interrogate the guards.

843
01:18:09,297 --> 01:18:12,562
Okay. Where the hell is the tower?

844
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:15,028
Where's the tower?

845
01:18:17,205 --> 01:18:20,902
Okay. Yes. Those three are in the
kitchen. I think that is it.

846
01:18:21,009 --> 01:18:23,102
I think they're all in the kitchen, I think.

847
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:25,475
This is it. I'm going.

848
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:31,513
Dieter, good luck.

849
01:18:46,968 --> 01:18:48,458
Quiet, quiet.

850
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:03,672
Quickly. Kitchen. Kitchen.
Meet us at the kitchen. Yes? Okay.

851
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:30,564
Duane, come on.
Come on. Oh, God.

852
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:41,640
Oh, God, there are six or seven
or something.

853
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:49,323
(SHOUTS)

854
01:20:49,824 --> 01:20:51,985
Gene! Procet! Come on!

855
01:21:02,902 --> 01:21:05,598
DIETER: Procet! Gene!
Where the hell are you?

856
01:21:05,705 --> 01:21:08,697
Gene! Damn you, where are...
Duane, come on!

857
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:12,574
Duane, where the hell are you!

858
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:14,306
Jumbo, don't try anything.

859
01:21:14,414 --> 01:21:16,609
Go on! Go on, run!

860
01:21:16,716 --> 01:21:17,876
Run!

861
01:21:17,984 --> 01:21:19,713
God damn you!

862
01:21:20,286 --> 01:21:21,844
Where are the shoes?

863
01:21:21,955 --> 01:21:26,255
The shoes are always hanging here.
Look for them! Go on, look for them.

864
01:21:27,127 --> 01:21:29,891
This is terrible. This is terrible.

865
01:21:29,996 --> 01:21:31,554
Come on. Get something.
Get this bag.

866
01:21:31,664 --> 01:21:33,529
- There's no shoes.
- Get this bag.

867
01:21:34,067 --> 01:21:36,092
Get as much as you can.

868
01:21:36,403 --> 01:21:38,337
God damn you, Gene!

869
01:21:38,438 --> 01:21:40,133
God damn you!

870
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:45,303
We have to leave. We have to leave.
The guards will be coming back.

871
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:46,640
Come on.

872
01:22:19,579 --> 01:22:21,604
Duane. Duane. Not in the open.
Not in the open. Come on. Come on.

873
01:22:42,135 --> 01:22:43,295
Dieter.

874
01:22:45,605 --> 01:22:50,201
Y. C., what the hell happened?
Why didn't you show up at the kitchen?

875
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:53,108
Gene? Gene, where the hell were you?

876
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:56,046
Gene, where the hell have you been?

877
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:58,879
Did you hear the shooting? Did you?

878
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:01,017
I couldn't get a shot.

879
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:05,615
Oh, you couldn't get a shot at them.
You weren't there to get a shot at them.

880
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:08,460
Look at these.
What nice shoes you have.

881
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:11,257
Where are our shoes?
Where are our shoes?

882
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:14,293
Phisit.

883
01:23:15,435 --> 01:23:18,097
You're telling me that he took
three pairs of shoes?

884
01:23:18,204 --> 01:23:21,332
He took his, he took Duane's
and he took mine?

885
01:23:21,441 --> 01:23:22,738
- That's right.
- DIETER: Yeah.

886
01:23:22,842 --> 01:23:23,831
- Yeah.
- DIETER: That's right.

887
01:23:23,943 --> 01:23:26,309
So, you were busy getting your machetes

888
01:23:26,412 --> 01:23:29,006
and your nice shoes
while we were being shot at.

889
01:23:29,115 --> 01:23:32,642
Okay. Where was this rifle?
Where did you find this rifle?

890
01:23:33,419 --> 01:23:34,750
Where'd you get that?

891
01:23:34,854 --> 01:23:36,048
Where am I gonna go?

892
01:23:36,156 --> 01:23:38,750
I don't know where you're gonna go.
Where'd you get the rifle?

893
01:23:38,858 --> 01:23:42,487
Or did you just find that?
You just found it lying around?

894
01:23:43,463 --> 01:23:44,555
We found it.

895
01:23:44,664 --> 01:23:46,097
Okay, listen, that's it.

896
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:49,327
Listen, I have an ammo clip for you.

897
01:23:49,435 --> 01:23:52,029
My ammo clip for your machete.

898
01:23:52,405 --> 01:23:53,633
Oh, yeah.

899
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:57,601
DIETER: Oh, that's funny?

900
01:23:57,977 --> 01:24:01,105
- Why is that funny?
- 'Cause I was just thinking,

901
01:24:01,548 --> 01:24:06,008
maybe you'll go back
and get one yourself.

902
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:08,087
Maybe I'll go back
and get one myself? Okay.

903
01:24:08,188 --> 01:24:10,122
GENE: Happy now
you got to do your big plan?

904
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:11,212
Yes.

905
01:24:11,324 --> 01:24:12,655
Yes.

906
01:24:12,959 --> 01:24:14,927
Yeah, I bet you're happy.

907
01:24:23,102 --> 01:24:24,797
You hand me that machete.

908
01:24:24,904 --> 01:24:26,496
You hand me that machete.

909
01:24:26,606 --> 01:24:28,540
You tell me where to go.

910
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:33,178
You tell me where to go.

911
01:24:35,548 --> 01:24:37,743
I don't know where you can go.

912
01:24:39,352 --> 01:24:40,979
I didn't think so.

913
01:24:41,521 --> 01:24:43,045
Didn't think so.

914
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,853
Gene. Gene.

915
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:51,487
What's that? What's that?

916
01:24:51,598 --> 01:24:53,031
Yeah, Dieter.

917
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,261
Is that where you're going?

918
01:24:56,369 --> 01:25:00,703
See you, Duane. Duane, love you, brother.
You go that way, I'll go this way.

919
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:04,943
But where am I gonna go?

920
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,511
I'm gonna go over there.

921
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:12,748
Where am I gonna go?

922
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,953
Where am I gonna go?

923
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:39,869
Dieter.

924
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:43,370
It's gonna rain.

925
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,273
I know it.

926
01:25:45,382 --> 01:25:47,543
This is how it always starts.

927
01:26:26,957 --> 01:26:28,584
(SCREAMING)

928
01:27:16,473 --> 01:27:17,599
DIETER: Duane.

929
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,044
Look at this.

930
01:27:22,146 --> 01:27:24,637
You see over there?

931
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,147
See?

932
01:27:29,153 --> 01:27:31,212
Down there must be a river.

933
01:27:31,322 --> 01:27:33,517
It must lead to the Big Muddy.

934
01:27:34,258 --> 01:27:36,453
And then we'll be out of here.

935
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:40,258
DIETER: We'll build a raft, and we
can float all the way down to it.

936
01:27:40,364 --> 01:27:41,763
No one will see us.

937
01:27:41,865 --> 01:27:44,425
Then we can cross
over into Thailand.

938
01:27:46,237 --> 01:27:48,296
(CUTTING)

939
01:29:40,784 --> 01:29:42,251
Listen.

940
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:44,578
Do you hear that?

941
01:29:47,024 --> 01:29:48,753
Is that a waterfall?

942
01:29:58,635 --> 01:30:01,263
Waterfall! Waterfall, bail out!

943
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,736
Dieter!

944
01:30:05,409 --> 01:30:07,536
(SHOUTING)

945
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:16,946
Dieter!

946
01:30:28,866 --> 01:30:30,834
- Careful!
- The shore!

947
01:30:31,335 --> 01:30:32,825
Grab the shore!

948
01:33:47,898 --> 01:33:50,833
Hey, pick a hand.

949
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:55,160
No.

950
01:34:01,411 --> 01:34:03,902
Which one of your feet is worse off?

951
01:34:04,414 --> 01:34:06,678
That's a trick question, right?

952
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:17,051
We can trade off with this thing.

953
01:34:18,729 --> 01:34:22,290
DIETER: There's no way
that we shoot it out with the Vietcong

954
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:24,128
if we run into them, so...

955
01:34:25,302 --> 01:34:28,829
And we can't use these for hunting
because of the noise.

956
01:34:31,842 --> 01:34:33,605

01:55:37,972 --> 01:55:40,065
It's good to see you, Spook.

1123
01:55:41,275 --> 01:55:42,401
Dieter.

1124
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:45,070
Norman. Oh, my God.

1125
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:47,374
Gentlemen, can you give us
a couple of minutes alone, please?

1126
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:48,915
It should be all right.

1127
01:55:49,016 --> 01:55:51,780
I got a little letter from his fiance.

1128
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:53,820
It's kind of personal.
You know what I mean?

1129
01:55:53,921 --> 01:55:55,752
Keep it personal, Lieutenant.

1130
01:55:55,857 --> 01:55:58,849
We're in the middle of
a highly classified debriefing.

1131
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,484
Will do. It's from his old lady.

1132
01:56:00,595 --> 01:56:02,153
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

1133
01:56:02,263 --> 01:56:03,787
Thank you, gentlemen.

1134
01:56:03,898 --> 01:56:04,956
Thank you.

1135
01:56:05,066 --> 01:56:09,799
Hey, Spook, what's with the birthday...
It's not my birthday.

1136
01:56:09,904 --> 01:56:14,773
Dieter, those two CIA dudes wanna take
you back to Guam for debriefing.

1137
01:56:15,543 --> 01:56:17,841
You don't wanna do that, do you?

1138
01:56:18,813 --> 01:56:20,440
I didn't think so.

1139
01:56:41,702 --> 01:56:43,135
Hey, hold on, guys.

1140
01:56:43,704 --> 01:56:47,606
Hey, guys, he's a bit choked up in there.

1141
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:52,870
You mind giving him just a couple of
minutes to sort of pull himself together?

1142
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:55,505
Yeah, it should be fine.
We'll give it a few minutes.

1143
01:56:55,616 --> 01:56:57,709
- He's a good kid, huh?
- Yeah.

1144
01:56:57,818 --> 01:56:59,479
- Thanks, guys.
- Yup.

1145
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:14,229
MAN:... Right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.

1146
01:57:19,173 --> 01:57:20,606
Come on, now.

1147
01:57:22,543 --> 01:57:24,670
Hurry up. Come on, get him in.

1148
01:57:25,846 --> 01:57:27,814
Get him in now, fast!

1149
01:57:27,915 --> 01:57:29,246
Get inside.

1150
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:44,157
(WHOOPING) It's my day!

1151
01:57:54,742 --> 01:57:56,334
What are we doing?

1152
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:16,858
DIETER: Hey.
SPOOK: What?

1153
01:58:16,964 --> 01:58:18,659
DIETER: Where is everybody?

1154
01:58:18,766 --> 01:58:19,755
- Where?
- Right here.

1155
01:58:19,867 --> 01:58:22,199
Why the decks... They're empty.
Have they gone home?

1156
01:58:22,303 --> 01:58:24,737
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1157
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:26,398
They're on vacation.

1158
01:58:26,507 --> 01:58:28,099
Is the war over?

1159
01:58:29,543 --> 01:58:30,635
No.

1160
01:58:36,584 --> 01:58:38,984
DIETER: You know I'm in a lot of trouble.

1161
01:58:45,926 --> 01:58:47,621
Boys, here he is.

1162
01:58:47,728 --> 01:58:50,094
They kidnapped him,
they brought him here to us.

1163
01:58:50,197 --> 01:58:53,257
The CIA held him for four days
but they can't hang onto him forever!

1164
01:58:53,367 --> 01:58:55,892
Dieter Dengler!

1165
01:59:02,043 --> 01:59:05,410
All right, all right. Hold on.
Hold on a second.

1166
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:06,946
Boys, listen up for a second.

1167
01:59:07,048 --> 01:59:09,539
Admiral Willoughby's
got something to say.

1168
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:11,345
Lieutenant Dengler.

1169
01:59:14,322 --> 01:59:16,153
Good to have you back.

1170
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,894
- Thank you.
- All right. That's not all.

1171
01:59:21,996 --> 01:59:25,454
There's more! Hold on, fellows.
Hold on, hold on!

1172
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:27,933
So, let's start with the man himself.

1173
01:59:28,035 --> 01:59:29,935
Dieter, it is just incredible
you made it home.

1174
01:59:30,037 --> 01:59:33,200
Now, tell us, was it your faith
in God and country?

1175
01:59:34,575 --> 01:59:37,169
Come on, Dieter,
you got to believe in something.

1176
01:59:37,278 --> 01:59:38,870
I believe I need a steak.

1177
01:59:38,979 --> 01:59:41,709
A steak! This guy needs a steak!

1178
01:59:41,816 --> 01:59:43,909
We're grilling up a big old cow for you.

1179
01:59:44,018 --> 01:59:47,112
All right. Hey, listen up. Hang on.

1180
01:59:47,221 --> 01:59:49,587
Can you pass something on to the boys?

1181
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:51,248
You know, something you learned
during your ordeal,

1182
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:55,318
something to keep them going
no matter how bad it gets?

1183
01:59:56,063 --> 01:59:57,428
Sure I can.

1184
02:00:00,134 --> 02:00:03,365
Empty what is full.

1185
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:07,333
Fill what is empty.

1186
02:00:11,278 --> 02:00:14,111
Scratch where it itches. That's it.

1187
02:00:14,215 --> 02:00:15,876
Now look at these boys ' faces!

1188
02:00:15,983 --> 02:00:17,917
Do they love you, man!

1189
02:00:18,018 --> 02:00:21,647
Do they love you!
