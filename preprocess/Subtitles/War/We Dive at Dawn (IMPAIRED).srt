1
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:45,324
- Nearly at the boom, sir.
- Yes, we'll be in by tea if you don't hit it.

2
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,809
- Keep her on the same course.
- Aye aye, sir.

3
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,733
- What's the weather like, Coxswain?
- Oh, so-so, sir.

4
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:08,444
- Well, another pleasure cruise over.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,894
Can I give you a hand, sir?

6
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:13,484
- What are you doing this leave, sir?
- Depends on the bank balance.

7
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,287
Are you due for leave, Coxswain?

8
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,214
Yes, sir. We've got a wedding in our family.
The TI's getting spliced to my sister.

9
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,691
Really? Oh, that's fine.
Don't forget my piece of cake.

10
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,134
OK, sir.

11
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,968
- Flunkey, try and get the salt out of these.
- Leave it to me.

12
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,087
It's got to be faced.
One of us has got to miss his leave.

13
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,966
What's that?

14
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:38,690
Oh, hello, Dicky. We were just talking
about Arnold going sick.

15
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:43,763
- It was his turn to stay behind this time.
- Thinking of taking his place, were you?

16
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,603
Who, me? Not at all.
But somebody's got to stay behind.

17
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:52,251
I know that. Tonsils at your age! Why didn't
you have them out when you were a kid?

18
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,365
My mother didn't believe in it, sir.

19
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,531
Well, we've got to fix this. Let's see.

20
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,725
You're already staying, aren't you, Nobby?

21
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:02,404
Yes. How about Tiggy?
He doesn't mind missing his leave.

22
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:05,970
Oh. And what about the TI here?
And yourself, Coxswain?

23
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:09,690
Mike's getting married this leave.
As he happens to be marrying my sister...

24
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:13,171
You two and this wedding!
This is the third time it's cropped up.

25
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:16,446
It's not my fault
that something always happens to interfere.

26
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,372
Nothing's going to interfere this time.

27
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,883
That's right, Coxswain, get him all tied up.

28
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,767
Shut the hatch, flood the boat.

29
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:28,091
- You're done for this time, TI.
- Who asked you to butt in, Hobson?

30
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:32,811
I like to take a look at the petty officers
now and again. It's good for discipline.

31
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:38,133
I wish he was one himself. I'd have put him
down for this. Don't take any notice of him.

32
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,450
Just because he's mucked up his own life.

33
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:43,646
I'll put Williams down for this job,
and he can lump it.

34
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,651
We ain't all got your sex appeal, Canada.

35
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,574
Aw, it's easy. Anybody can pick up a dame
outside a factory.

36
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,287
Sit still, jellyfish.

37
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:54,327
I found a nice piece of homework last leave.
Works in a fag shop.

38
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,331
Ought to be good for a packet of 20, then.

39
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,252
- I suppose you'll be seeing the wife.
- What?

40
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:00,331
I was talking to Dowsley.

41
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,843
She'll be parked outside the dock gates now.

42
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,932
- Can't get a female under 40 in my village.
- Why not, Oxford?

43
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,966
- The Poles are billeted there.
- (Laughter)

44
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,846
You almost make me sick.

45
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:13,171
Nothing else to think about on leave
but females, dames, homework.

46
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,524
With all the ugly fizzogs here,
what can you expect?

47
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:19,250
You're safe enough, Spud.
The women won't worry you.

48
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:22,048
- And why not?
- You've got no brass.

49
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:26,008
By the time you settle your bets,
you won't have any left.

50
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,046
I don't need money to enjoy my leave.

51
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,848
You wouldnae need much.
I doubt it'll be more than 48 hours.

52
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,851
- Like to bet on that?
- I'm not betting.

53
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,171
- But dinnae bargain on more than 48 hours.
- Ah, go boil yourself!

54
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,126
Go and jump in yer oil tank.

55
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,646
- Sound off, Coxswain.
- (Shrill whistle)

56
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,686
Stand to attention on the casing.

57
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:10,451
- Slow astern, starboard.
- Slow astern, starboard, sir.

58
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,485
Hello, Freddie. A nice quiet trip?

59
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:33,528
Yes, worse luck. I see you've sunk
another couple of fishing smacks.

60
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,014
Yes, just a 10,000-tonner and a 4,000.

61
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:41,172
What the hell do you work with?
Old Moore's Almanack?

62
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:02,526
(Horn blasts)

63
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,285
- Hello, Taylor. No luck again?
- Afraid not, sir.

64
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,529
- Any to fix?
- No, sir.

65
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,213
- Crew all right?
- One case of tonsils.

66
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:20,292
Very well. The usual notice for sea.
Give leave to one watch.

67
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:21,529
Yes. Excuse me, sir.

68
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,568
Gordon? Are you going to the wardroom?
Get me Grosvenor 2777, will you?

69
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,334
- Yes, sir.
- Who are you seeing this leave?

70
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,493
- Your Aunt Margaret again?
- I can't risk it, sir. Her husband's on leave.

71
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,326
Here, one for you.

72
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,006
And three for the skipper.

73
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,608
Wild violets, jasmine.

74
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:50,686
Fish and chips?

75
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,930
- Fish and chips.
- Hello, Freddie.

76
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:55,613
- Have a drink?
- Pink gin, please.

77
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:57,134
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

78
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,972
- Nice trip?
- Very boring.

79
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,687
- (Buzzer)
- Close shave.

80
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:02,407
Yes, I'm using a cutthroat.

81
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,934
- Your call's through, sir.
- Thanks.

82
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:05,966
- Two pink gins, please.
- I'll bring them right away, sir.

83
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,048
That you, Drake? How's the gout?

84
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,889
Good. How's the old man?

85
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,324
Good. And how's the bank balance?

86
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,447
Oh. Oh, well, I'll have to manage on my pay.

87
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:24,044
Now, listen carefully.
I want you to ring Miss Seymour

88
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,086
and make a date for lunch tomorrow.

89
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:30,492
- Yeah. Get a four-pound box of chocolates.
- Four-pound box of...

90
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:33,925
- There is a war on, sir.
- Is there? I haven't seen much of it lately.

91
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,170
Well, use your influence, Drake.

92
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:40,288
Book two seats at the Hippodrome in the
evening and a table at the Grill afterwards.

93
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,849
Now, Tuesday. Miss, erm... Carter.

94
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,490
No, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Erm... Miss Davis, I think.

95
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:49,527
- No, no, hang on, Drake.
- Make your mind up, Freddie!

96
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:56,090
That'll be all for the present, Drake.
I'll fix the rest with you tomorrow. Goodbye.

97
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:00,453
If you two baboons had
the elementary instincts of gentlemen...

98
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:03,214
- (Coughs)
- That's a nasty cough you've got, TI.

99
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:06,213
- Yes, sir. Erm... No, sir.
- Something you want to see me about?

100
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:10,965
- I wanted to see Lieutenant Brace, sir.
- I'm afraid he's not here. Anything I can do?

101
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,006
Erm... Well...

102
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,888
- Well, what is it?
- It's about Petty Officer Arnold's leave, sir.

103
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:20,971
Somebody's got to stay and take his place.

104
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,803
- Yes, I think it's arranged Williams stays.
- Yes, sir. Well, that's just it.

105
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:29,804
You see, it's very hard on poor Williams, sir,
with his domestic troubles, sir,

106
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:32,323
and his two youngest in hospital, sir.

107
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,412
- Williams isn't married, is he?
- Oh, yes, sir.

108
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:37,650
How else would he have two youngest, sir?

109
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,135
You're not offering to forgo
your own leave, are you?

110
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:46,570
- Erm... Yes, sir.
- But I thought you were getting married.

111
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,325
What's the matter, TI? Cold feet?

112
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,526
Oh, no, sir.
There isn't a nicer girl in London, sir.

113
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:59,286
It's just that... I think a man shouldn't
rush at matrimony, like.

114
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,688
I quite agree.

115
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:05,251
I think I'd like just to think it over
a bit longer, sir, if you know what I mean.

116
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:09,172
- Very well, TI. I'll fix it.
- Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:14,174
Oh, TI, tell Hobson
I want to see him in my cabin, will you?

118
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,610
- (Knock at door)
- Come in.

119
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,606
Oh, it's you, Hobson. Come in.

120
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:32,406
I wanted to have a little talk
with you unofficially. Cigarette?

121
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,446
No, thanks, sir.

122
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:40,492
You know, I've often wondered
about you, Hobson,

123
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:43,286
why you haven't gone higher in the Service.

124
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:48,932
I mean, you've knocked about the world a bit
and you speak a couple of languages.

125
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:52,251
It seems a pity, really, that a man like you
should mess up his life,

126
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,286
just because...

127
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,329
Hobson, I've had a letter
from your brother-in-law.

128
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,650
I think the best thing I can do
is to hand it to you.

129
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,050
I don't have to read that to know what's in it.

130
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:10,246
It's about your wife. She wants a separation.

131
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:14,526
Why can't he stick to his fish and chips
and keep out of my business?

132
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:19,285
Yes, I'm inclined to agree with you.
I don't like the sound of your brother-in-law.

133
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,283
On the other hand,
you can hardly blame him if your wife...

134
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:28,453
He's always trying to separate us. Never out
of the house the whole time I'm at sea.

135
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,486
Why do you give him so much leeway?

136
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,652
It appears you went home tight again
on your last leave.

137
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,686
He made the most of that, I'm sure.

138
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,726
I see he calls it "the deadly sin".

139
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:40,413
Anyway, If I were you,

140
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:45,051
I'd try and get home sober this time.
Your wife will probably...

141
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:48,644
I'm not going to join the Band of Hope
to please any hymn-singing fish-fryer.

142
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,289
If my wife wants a separation,
she can have it.

143
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,605
Is that what you really want me to say?

144
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,850
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,683
- Anything else, sir?
- No. That's all, Hobson.

146
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:21,489
- # Speak to me, Thora!
- That's Mike, isn't it?

147
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:26,051
# Speak to me, Thora!

148
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,565
# Speak from your heaven...

149
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,412
Oh, well, it only goes to show.

150
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,971
Yes, they always say the happiest day of a
man's life is the day before he gets married.

151
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,767
Yeah, that's right.

152
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,294
What do you mean, the day before?

153
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:42,327
Marriage is the finest thing in the world
for a steady fellow like Mike.

154
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,969
Especially when he's going to marry
a steady girl like our Ethel.

155
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,210
Then why haven't you tried it yourself?

156
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:49,166
Well, that's different.

157
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:52,207
Here... Here, Mike. Mike!

158
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,891
Mike, your name's down on this duty list
to stay behind.

159
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,732
- No!
- It is, I tell you.

160
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:02,484
Here, Williams. You were fixed
to do this duty. Well, you're going to do it.

161
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,526
- My name is not on that list, is it?
- That's beside the point.

162
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,213
Well, that's good enough for me.

163
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,691
- There must be a mistake.
- See for yourself. It's there all right.

164
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:14,013
But I can't believe it. Everybody knows
I was going to get married tomorrow.

165
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:17,411
- I've got enemies in this ship.
- Something's got to be done about it.

166
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:20,447
Ah, what's the use? An order's an order.

167
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:25,686
Every time we try to fix something up,
something happens to spoil it.

168
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,805
We're powerless, Dicky.

169
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:31,165
Playthings in the hands of an unseen fate,
that's what we are.

170
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:35,094
Yeah, well, playthings, my foot!
Don't you worry, I'll fix it. I'll see to that.

171
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,006
But, Dicky, I...

172
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,328
(Coughing)

173
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,811
That's pretty wicked tobacco, Sid.
What is it, carpet slippers?

174
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,289
Well, Jock, you were right about the leave.
48 hours.

175
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:58,851
- Aye, it's not worth going ashore for.
- I knew you wouldn't mind staying behind.

176
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,807
- No, but... Staying behind?
- I put you down in Arnold's place.

177
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:06,133
- I knew you wouldn't mind.
- Nothing of the sort. I'm entitled to my leave.

178
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,690
Now, Jock, Jock, I wouldn't ask you
to do something for nothing.

179
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,924
Mike, I've fixed it.
Jock's volunteered to take your place.

180
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:24,810
- Come on, there's a boat just leaving.
- I can't go like this. I... I haven't got my kit.

181
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:28,131
That's all right. Tug's looking after it.
Come on, hurry.

182
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:38,330
Have a good time, Mr Coxswain.
But keep off the beer!

183
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,005
Lucky for you he didn't take that bet, Spud.

184
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,523
- What bet?
- About the leave being 48 hours.

185
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,170
Lucky? It's the only bet I'd have won
on the whole trip. Don't be barmy.

186
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,807
Barmy?

187
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:54,051
- Hey, Tug, how long is this leave?
- Seven days.

188
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,211
Seven? Seven...

189
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,126
That'll be enough for that boat.

190
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:06,215
(Silent)

191
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,850
- Well, I'll be...
- Wotcher, me old Gladys!

192
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,487
Oh...

193
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:36,765
Excuse me, have you any ciga...

194
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,527
Oh. No, thank you.

195
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:45,966
- Hello, Ethel.
- Dicky!

196
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,523
Look what I've brought you.

197
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,850
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello, Ethel.

198
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,446
(Man) Put that light out!

199
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,685
- Good morning, Mrs Metcalfe.
- Good morning.

200
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,807
- Fish and chips for dinner?
- That's right, Mr Hobson.

201
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,204
It's no use knocking. She's gone.

202
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,929
- Gone?
- Aye.

203
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,614
- To the shop?
- Aye, over a week ago.

204
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,169
- Here's a present for you.
- For me?

205
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:37,165
- Hello, Mr Hobson.
- Here you are, son. A football for you.

206
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:49,528
Well, sir, Sunday morning
is the only time we have free now.

207
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,964
Except for a slight gap after tea
on Wednesday.

208
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,085
Well, we must remedy that,
mustn't we, Drake?

209
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,444
(Gasps) Are you trying to pick a fight, Rudolph?

210
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,133
Listen, Drake, this is important.

211
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:01,087
When Miss Lake calls... Yeah, Miss Lake...

212
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:04,332
...have her put through here right away,
will you? Right.

213
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:09,125
I wish I could get the same kick out of life
that some of you fellows get.

214
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:11,689
- Seven days' leave, sir.
- Just started, eh?

215
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,293
- I have.
- Army?

216
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:15,326
- Navy.
- Ah.

217
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:21,046
(Telephone rings)

218
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,926
Hello, my darling. How are you?
Wonderful to hear from you again.

219
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:28,285
Is it, Freddie? Oh, that's very sweet of you.

220
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,895
This is Browning, depot ship, here.

221
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:34,689
Bad news, I'm afraid, old man.
Order from Captain S, report back at once.

222
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,771
Of course I'm not joking.

223
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,375
There's a recall list, the Sea Tiger.
Get busy on it.

224
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,484
Yes, sir.

225
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:44,050
How do I know, old man? Probably
wants you to make up a four at bridge.

226
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:48,850
Now, listen. There's a train leaving London
at 2:15 that makes the connection at...

227
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,773
All right, all right,
you can look it up yourself, then.

228
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:54,375
You've got to be back here
by nine o'clock at the latest.

229
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,566
Right.

230
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,008
- Finished, sir?
- Yes, I'm finished.

231
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:10,206
Very first day of my leave.

232
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:14,613
- First I've had for months.
- What's the trouble?

233
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,850
Leave cancelled, just like that.

234
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:21,128
After all the trouble I've gone to,
all those dates I've fixed.

235
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,609
Everything blown sky-high!

236
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:26,852
Trouble's at the top.
Silly old dossers who couldn't run a regatta,

237
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:29,773
giving orders one day
for the sake of cancelling them the next.

238
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,525
Quite right, my boy. I've had to fight
against that sort of thing all my life. Goodbye.

239
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,570
Look here, Dusty, my boy,
this slate ain't elastic, you know.

240
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,413
Ah, but it will stretch till next Saturday,
won't it, guv?

241
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:52,447
I've got a treble coming up then,
and it's a stone certainty.

242
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:54,486
You're telling me.

243
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:58,687
Here comes old Slim. He's always good
for a dollar. You watch me tap him.

244
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:02,728
Hello, me old Slim. You're just in time. I'm in
the chair and here's a pint of the very best.

245
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,573
Oh, thanks, Dusty.
I'm glad I found you here. Flunkey.

246
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,606
Well, all the best.

247
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:19,850
- Er... Slim, old man, we was just saying...
- I've got some bad news for you.

248
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:22,455
- Report to the ship immediately.
- (Laughs)

249
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:25,692
- And you. Both of you.
- (Laughs)

250
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:30,087
- What is this? A joke?
- It's no joke, it's an order.

251
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:33,252
- You're sailing tonight, so get a move on.
- But, Slim...

252
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,570
Always good for a dollar, eh?

253
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:41,484
Hello, customers.
Hello, you old grease spot.

254
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,810
- Still frying the same old dogfish?
- (Laughter)

255
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,686
What have you come for?

256
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,647
- I've come for my wife.
- She doesn't want to see you.

257
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,811
- That's for her to say.
- She's out.

258
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,085
All right, all right, I can wait.

259
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:56,491
In the meantime,
I have a few chosen words for you, my lad.

260
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,368
Look here, Hobson, don't make a scene.
Can't you see I'm busy?

261
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,407
- OK, Sid, OK, I'll give you a hand.
- Don't bother.

262
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,411
It's no bother at all. What's yours?

263
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:07,174
A sixpenny and two penn'orth.
I brought my paper.

264
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:10,651
That's the stuff.
Service, that's what I like. Service.

265
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,173
- Here!
- Fish is good for the brain.

266
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:15,683
- Aye.
- Looks as if you could do with an extra bit.

267
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,804
(Laughter)

268
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,768
- Here you are, tuppence the lot.
- Eee!

269
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:24,694
Service and civility, that's my motto.
Service and civility.

270
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:28,648
- Now look here, Hobson...
- There you are, love. A penny back for you.

271
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:31,209
Now, who's next?
What about you, young lady?

272
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,009
- Have you got all you want?
- (Woman) Here, come on, sailor. Serve me.

273
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,046
Hello, Daddy.

274
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,086
Hello, son.

275
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,007
I've come to take you home, Pete.
What do you think of that?

276
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:46,730
- Have you been in your submarine?
- Have I been in my submarine?

277
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:51,371
- (Man) Hey, three sixpennies, mister!
- Better than that. I brought it home for you.

278
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:56,853
- Here. What do you think of that?
- Ooh, Daddy!

279
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,693
Go back in the kitchen, Peter,
there's a good lad.

280
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,975
Alice, just a minute.

281
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,688
I'm on my seven days.
I thought perhaps we might...

282
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:09,614
Oh, Jim, couldn't you have
come home sober just for once?

283
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,249
It was the same last time, you know.

284
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,207
- Why weren't you at our house?
- Look here, why don't you go?

285
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,768
You keep out of this.

286
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,852
- You're coming home.
- Don't you know when you're not wanted?

287
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,967
Greasy old hypocrite!
You've always tried to separate us.

288
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,245
It's been the same
since the day we were married.

289
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:28,207
You've always tried, haven't you?
From the first day.

290
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,246
(All shout at once)

291
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,444
- Here, get off him.
- Leave me alone, do you hear?

292
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,725
Leave me alone!

293
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,766
Now, then! Now, then!

294
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:42,212
What's going on here?
What's going on here?

295
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:45,486
- Break it up! Break it up!
- He started it.

296
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,289
- Quite right. He did, Mr Briggs.
- You don't waste much time, do you?

297
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,370
Are you Leading Seaman James Hobson?

298
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,168
- I am.
- You'll come back to the station with me.

299
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,814
Can't a chap see his wife and kid
without being run in?

300
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:02,404
It's the railway station I'm talking about.
You've got to get back to your ship.

301
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:06,368
So if there's anybody you want to
say goodbye to, you'd better be sharp.

302
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,255
There's nobody here wants anything of me.

303
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:28,206
Come on.

304
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:53,409
- (# Piano playing)
- (Men) # Here's the last rose of summer

305
00:21:53,455 --> 00:22:01,009
- # Left blooming alone
- (Car horn toots)

306
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,649
He's early with the taxi.

307
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,253
Come in, Ernie, and have a drink.

308
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:08,173
Here, it's time you and Tug
got along to the church.

309
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,366
- We've half an hour yet. There's no hurry.
- Sure, there's no hurry.

310
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:15,203
What do you mean, no hurry? Plenty of blokes
would change places with you, Mike.

311
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:19,168
Now, look here, Charlie,
he won her fair and square, so that's that.

312
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:22,605
Sure.
Just pipped me on the post, didn't you?

313
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:25,965
Well, there's still hope.
Old Tug here might lose the ring.

314
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,290
- Never catch me losing nothing.
- No?

315
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:31,213
What about that little lady you brought here,
from the fag shop?

316
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,404
What about her?

317
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:35,367
You didn't see the coxswain
going in the scullery, did you?

318
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:37,406
No, I...

319
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:40,174
Mind you don't burn them pretty fingers.

320
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:43,525
- You're getting in my way, Mr Dabbs.
- Oh, come off it.

321
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:47,250
You've got me, hook, line and sinker.
Now then, ducky, what do they call you?

322
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,412
I've told you. Miss Harcourt.

323
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:54,130
Blimey, I can't keep on calling you
Miss Harcourt. It sounds barmy.

324
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:59,647
Of course it does. Think of having "Love
to Miss Harcourt" tattooed across his chest.

325
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:02,004
- Sissy.
- Has the beer gone already?

326
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:04,728
- I'm only trying to be helpful.
- You square-headed...

327
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,085
So that's what he does, does he?
He has girls' names tattooed all over him.

328
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:11,491
Well, I wouldn't say all over him,
but he's got a few. Eh, Dicky?

329
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:12,968
Show her that one on your wrist.

330
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:15,688
I'll show you something
at the end of my wrist.

331
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:19,728
- Now, I'm only trying to be helpful.
- Miss Harcourt, he's the biggest...

332
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,245
- (Piano: # Here Comes The Bride)
- That'll be her coming down.

333
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:31,809
Lovely, darling.

334
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,607
- It's beautiful, Ethel.
- Thank you.

335
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:36,965
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Looks dandy, doesn't she?

336
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:44,295
- Well, Mike?
- Well, Ethel, you look fine in that... hat.

337
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,405
I never felt so nervous in all my life.

338
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:49,891
- Have a glass of port, ducks. Buck you up.
- Thanks.

339
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:54,645
Oh, Ethel, I do believe in this light...
How awful, it's green.

340
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,050
Come, we ain't superstitious here.

341
00:23:57,095 --> 00:24:00,610
I was just reading your congratulations
when you came down.

342
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:02,805
Ethel, one here for you.

343
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:06,653
"A long and happy married life to both,

344
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,971
"and don't forget to name
the first one after me."

345
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,846
"Auntie May."

346
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,363
She's decided what it's going to be.

347
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:19,409
"Best wishes, and don't forget to name
the first one after your Uncle Fred."

348
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:22,208
Looks as though
you've got to have twins, Mike.

349
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:26,328
"Torpedo Gunner's Mate M Carrington."

350
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:32,325
- "Return to ship at once. Sailing tonight."
- It's a recall!

351
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:35,205
At least, it sounds like it.

352
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:37,246
Let me have a look.

353
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:40,846
There's one here for you, Dicky.

354
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:46,566
Yes, it's a recall, all right.

355
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,090
Oh, isn't that just my luck?

356
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:53,207
Oh, there must be some mistake.

357
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:56,804
No, there's no mistake. There nearly was.

358
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:59,130
What do you mean, Ethel?

359
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,291
Gave yourself away, didn't you, Mike?

360
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:13,610
What are you getting at?
It's not Mike's fault we've been recalled.

361
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,646
Mike knows.

362
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:18,446
Don't you, Mike?

363
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:21,214
- But, Ethel...
- She can't...

364
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,644
What's the matter with her?

365
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:26,971
- I don't understand.
- What did she mean, gave yourself away?

366
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:30,769
- I don't know.
- You didn't get somebody to send these?

367
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:34,603
- What, me do a thing like that?
- No, no, they're genuine, all right.

368
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,328
Well, boys, you'd better be going.
England expects, you know.

369
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,809
You're in a terrible hurry to get rid of us,
aren't you?

370
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,971
No, no. No offence, Mike.

371
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:46,644
We've all got to do our bit. You in your sub
and me in my reserved occupation.

372
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:48,492
It's "submarine", twerp.

373
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,173
Get your kit, Mike.

374
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,649
- And you, Wilson.
- There's no recall for me, Dicky.

375
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:55,448
You don't expect it to come here, do you?
Get a move on.

376
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:59,170
And not so much of the Dicky!
You're under the coxswain's orders now.

377
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:01,683
- Oh, all right, all right.
- Hop it.

378
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,850
Well, I'll be seeing you.

379
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:14,253
Come on, Mike.
We can't hang about here all night.

380
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:34,165
(Hooter)

381
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,206
(Seagull crying)

382
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,091
Now lower away handsomely.

383
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:43,764
Check lines. Slack off, aft.

384
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,726
Now let her come.

385
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:47,889
All right.

386
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,485
- Engine room all present, Chief?
- Aye.

387
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:04,730
Have you had a bonny leave, Mr Coxswain?

388
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:07,812
For myself, I wouldn't have thought
it was worth going ashore for.

389
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:10,972
Leave? I nearly ran into myself coming back.

390
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:13,290
- Are you satisfied now?
- What do you mean?

391
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,326
You accused me
of sending those telegrams.

392
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,127
I said there was something fishy about it.

393
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:19,086
How do you think I feel about it?

394
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:21,091
I'll fix it up with her on my next leave,
you see if I don't.

395
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:24,332
Do you expect to find her
waiting for you when you get back?

396
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,048
Huh! A lot you know about us Dabbs.

397
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,973
- OK for grub, old Panfry?
- OK, 'Swain.

398
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:35,530
- Engine room all right, Coxswain?
- We filled up with three from Spare Crew.

399
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:37,566
You couldn't tell us where we going?

400
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:42,131
No, I could not. Secret orders to be confided
to nobody below the rank of Coxswain.

401
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:46,168
They'll expect somebody below the rank
of Coxswain to carry them out, sir.

402
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,132
- All hands on board, sir.
- Very good.

403
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:56,326
Excuse me, sir. I suppose you haven't
got any idea where we're going?

404
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,570
- Afraid not. Something hush-hush.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:02,765
You'll have a more interesting time
this trip, Taylor. Good luck.

406
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,533
- Thank you, sir.
- Cheerio.

407
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:07,726
- If you bring it off I'll stand you a Scotch.
- Make it a double and it's guaranteed.

408
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,208
All right.

409
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:27,172
- I hope I do have to buy that double, sir.
- I hope so.

410
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,927
- Take this down.
- Aye aye, sir.

411
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:36,966
- All set?
- Ready for sea, sir.

412
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,928
- Let go, forward.
- Let go of your forward spring.

413
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:47,806
Let go, aft.

414
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:52,654
- Slow astern, starboard.
- Slow astern, starboard, sir.

415
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,686
Slow ahead, port.

416
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:55,324
- May we dive to trim, sir?
- Just a minute. I want to talk to the crew.

417
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,732
Do you hear there? Do you hear there?

418
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:03,335
<i>Stand by for the captain.</i>

419
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,932
This is the captain speaking.

420
00:30:05,975 --> 00:30:09,888
Well, as you've probably guessed,
it's a special job this time.

421
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,165
<i>And what's more, it's not a long one.</i>

422
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:16,611
<i>In fact, we're due to be back</i>
<i>in four or five days. We hope.</i>

423
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:22,529
The Admiralty has learnt that the new
German battleship, the Brandenburg,

424
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:25,931
is about to leave Bremerhaven
for her trials in the Baltic.

425
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:31,526
<i>To get to the Baltic, the Brandenburg</i>
<i>will have to pass through the Kiel Canal,</i>

426
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,566
and to get to the canal

427
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:37,369
she'll have to hug the coast past Cuxhaven,
and into the Elbe.

428
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,524
<i>We are expected to intercept and sink her.</i>

429
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:46,089
Now, there's only one thing more,
and I hope you're listening in the engine room.

430
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:50,526
<i>We must be in the Heligoland Bight</i>
<i>within 48 hours at the most.</i>

431
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,411
<i>We shall need</i>
<i>every ounce of steam we can get.</i>

432
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:55,605
Do you hear that, you lazy beggars?

433
00:30:55,655 --> 00:31:00,410
This also means we must risk
sticking on the surface as much as we can,

434
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:02,650
even in daylight.

435
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:09,373
So every one of us must be right on his toes
every moment he's on duty. That's all.

436
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:32,286
(Taylor) Continued but surfaced...

437
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,166
13:30 hours.

438
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,246
Spotted plane approaching.

439
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,566
Looked like one of ours...

440
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:53,126
so dived at once.

441
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:06,493
No wonder they're cutting dog racing.

442
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:10,244
Sparker says enemy transmission getting
louder. We're in the danger zone now.

443
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,286
Oh, blimey, and us on the surface!

444
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:15,088
That's to keep up speed,
like he said when we started.

445
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,932
I'd sooner we were underwater.

446
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:19,045
That's what a submarine's for.

447
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,689
"Sub" for under, "marine" for water.

448
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:24,932
Marine for water?
Not any of the marines I've ever known.

449
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:28,130
- Grub up!
- Come on, Tug, what kept you?

450
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,166
- Oh, ta.
- I'm starved.

451
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,854
- I'd like a word with you, TI.
- Uh-huh?

452
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:34,772
Remember that girl in the fag shop, Gladys?

453
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:37,090
- Well, what about her?
- Well, I was thinking.

454
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:40,047
As you won't be needing this ring,
we might be able to do a deal.

455
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:44,691
- Who says I won't be needing that ring?
- Of course you won't be needing it if...

456
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,852
Now, look here, Mike, you never kidded me.

457
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:51,490
I always knew you never liked the idea
of marriage, and neither did the bride.

458
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,765
You didn't have to look far to see the reason.

459
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:56,329
What do you mean,
you didn't have to look far?

460
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,048
- Why, that bloke at the piano.
- What about him?

461
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:02,007
Mike... Why, didn't you see the way that he...

462
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,171
Oh, hello, Coxswain.

463
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,654
What did he want?

464
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:13,812
He was trying to do a deal
on my wedding ring for his girl.

465
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:16,688
The less you say about weddings,
the better.

466
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:19,488
- His girl...
- His girl?

467
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:22,174
Did he mean the girl at the tobacconist?

468
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:26,049
The conceited son of a... You ought
to have seen the look she gave me.

469
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,211
What are you trying to do? Pinch her?

470
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:32,294
Pinch her? Don't have to pinch her.
She knew who the best man was, all right.

471
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:36,010
If he gives you any trouble, you can
easily buy him off with a box of cigars.

472
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,285
Can't you, Mr Dabbs?

473
00:33:56,695 --> 00:34:00,165
- (Klaxon blares)
- Diving stations! Diving stations!

474
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:02,206
(All) Diving stations.

475
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:04,166
(All shouting)

476
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:07,805
German rescue buoy, sir, at Green 3-0.

477
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:13,374
Control room. Gun action. Machine-gun up.

478
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:22,127
I don't think we need worry, sir.
They seem to think we're a U-boat.

479
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:25,485
They're bound to report us
and the German Admiralty will soon check.

480
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:30,967
Sie haben uns gesehen.

481
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,573
- Haben sie uns gesichtet?
- Jawohl.

482
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:37,011
Verflucht, ein Engländer.

483
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:39,933
They've rumbled us, sir.
They'll be wirelessing.

484
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:42,328
- Sheff.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:45,492
As soon as you're ready,
help yourself to that aerial.

486
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,366
- Du bleib oben...
- Zu Befehl!

487
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,045
Stop! Stop! Halt!

488
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:08,086
Stop! Wir kommen, wir kommen!

489
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,211
- Take those two below, Sheff.
- Aye aye, sir.

490
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:46,966
Is this your international law? To shoot
helpless airmen from their rescue float?

491
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:49,768
You weren't, of course,
using your radio to give us away?

492
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,808
I'm sorry we shot down the aerial
before you could get anything through.

493
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:56,449
- You were very quick, Herr Kapitän.
- Sir, listen.

494
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:58,884
(Engines droning)

495
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:01,130
- Very quick, Herr Kapitän!
- Down, everybody.

496
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:04,167
- Come on, down you go. Come on.
- (Klaxon blares)

497
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:11,606
Hey, out of the way.

498
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:18,645
- Take the prisoners forward.
- Come on, you two.

499
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:19,969
Come on, you.

500
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,054
Up periscope.

501
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:28,614
Whoa.

502
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:36,486
Down periscope.

503
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,814
- Was it Jerry, sir?
- Didn't have time to see.

504
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,527
Probably one of our Brylcreem Boys.

505
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,054
(Depth charge explodes)

506
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:46,883
- We're well below now. Keep her at 90.
- 90 feet, sir.

507
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:50,132
This'll do for you. Sheffield Wednesday.

508
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:53,770
And these'll keep them quiet.
Use this, Hobson, if they give any trouble.

509
00:36:55,655 --> 00:37:00,729
Now, what have you got for him?
Have you got something natty for this little lad?

510
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:03,005
What about this?

511
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,287
I bet this grub's cold.

512
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:09,805
- Yeah, thought so. Wilson?
- What do you want, 'Swain?

513
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,210
I want to have a word with you.

514
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:16,646
About that girl. "Love to Miss Harcourt"
wouldn't look right across a man's chest.

515
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,731
Remember you suggested I show her this?

516
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:21,812
That's just what I'm going to do,
but it's not going to read the same.

517
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:24,494
Suppose you get your tattooing outfit
and change it?

518
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,969
- Oh, is that what you want?
- I'll pay you for it.

519
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:30,530
Yeah, but you can't expect anybody
to alter Nelly into G... Arabella.

520
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,964
Arabella? So that's her name!

521
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:39,612
- What, the girl in the fag shop? I thought...
- Yes, that's the one, Mike. Arabella.

522
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:43,364
It's going to cost you. Two bob a letter.
Arabella's a long name. A-R-A...

523
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:46,134
The missionaries taught me to spell!
You can use these.

524
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:49,645
Change the Y to an A, the N to a B
and put ARA in front.

525
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:51,765
Ah, yeah, but you'll want some twiddly bits.

526
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,125
- I'll give you a quid for it.
- A quid? Done.

527
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:58,167
That's just about how much
your love for her was worth.

528
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,412
You can start to work on it
as soon as the changeover comes.

529
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:04,572
And get some more sausages,
and make 'em hot this time.

530
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:11,009
Why to be so secret when I know?
It is a battleship which you go after.

531
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,047
All right, all right, I'll take your word for it.

532
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:16,370
Get this inside of you.

533
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:20,488
I'll tell you also which it is.
It is the Brandenburg.

534
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:23,686
Brandenburg?
That's a kind of cheese, isn't it?

535
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:27,214
- Was sagt er?
- Dass Brandenburg 'ne Sorte Käse ist.

536
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,530
- Käse...
- Der ist selber ein Käse...

537
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:33,773
Das ist doch für den englischen Magen
nicht so leicht zu verdauen.

538
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,045
(Faint rumbling)

539
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:39,813
Slow port. Stop starboard.

540
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:42,289
Slow port, stop starboard, sir.

541
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:44,849
- (Bell strikes)
- Well, we're up to time, anyway.

542
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,567
There's a nasty patch coming, sir.

543
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:52,647
- (Rumbling)
- Group down. Watch your depth.

544
00:38:58,695 --> 00:39:00,492
(Rumbling)

545
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,093
Was war das?

546
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:04,695
- What was that scraping?
- We're under a minefield.

547
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:07,169
- That'll be a cable.
- Was sagt er?

548
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,365
- Die Kabel von Minen.
- Minen?

549
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:12,213
The real fun'll start
when we meet the underwater barrage.

550
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:15,053
- Was sagt er schon wieder?
- Ach, halt's Maul, der macht nur Spaß.

551
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:17,131
Glaub ich nicht.
Wir müssen dem Kapitän sagen,

552
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,369
dass wir die Brandenburg gesichtet haben.

553
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:19,689
Nichts wird gesagt!

554
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,965
- Warum denn nicht?
- Natürlich, damit umgekehrt...

555
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,892
Wollt ihr endlich das Maul halten?

556
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,254
Wir haben nur zu sagen,
dass wir die Brandenburg gestern

557
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:26,489
bei Cuxhaven gesichtet
haben und dann wird...

558
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:29,288
(Grinding)

559
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:39,171
Schon wieder. Ich geh zum Kapitän...
Lass mich los, ich geh zum Kapitän

560
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,365
Bitte holen Sie den Kapitän,
bitte rufen Sie den Kapitän.

561
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:44,168
- What's the matter with him?
- Oh, he's only nervous.

562
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,410
I'll get you some more grub.

563
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,686
- Mike, look after these birds, will you?
- I'd be delighted to.

564
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,726
I'll get you some too.

565
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:56,649
Ah, sure, what are you worrying about?

566
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,925
They're your own minefields, aren't they?

567
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,052
- Captain, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

568
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:03,733
Report on the prisoners, sir.

569
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:06,448
They say they saw the Brandenburg
before they were shot down.

570
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:08,645
It was then passing Cuxhaven, sir.

571
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,370
- How do you know that?
- One of them got scared.

572
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:14,371
He wanted to tell you so we'd turn back.

573
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:16,451
I see. They want us to turn back, do they?

574
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:20,568
If she was passing Cuxhaven,
she'll be in the Kiel Canal by now.

575
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:23,652
By the time we get anywhere near it,
she'll be into the Baltic.

576
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:26,163
That's what they want us to believe.
That's why they told Hobson.

577
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,287
They didn't tell me, sir.
I didn't let on I knew German.

578
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:31,565
(Grinding)

579
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,533
Herr Kapitän! Herr Kapitän!

580
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:42,009
Herr Kapitän!

581
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,569
(All shouting)

582
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,886
Hey!

583
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,009
Just about done him in, sir.

584
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:08,127
- Steward, get the coxswain to fix him up.
- Aye aye, sir.

585
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:18,290
Was, er... war es, erm...

586
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:20,573
(Clicks fingers) Erm...

587
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:24,608
- Ask what the other bloke was trying to say.
- Was wollte er sagen?

588
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:27,215
- Ich werde es ihm sagen, Herr Kapitän, dass...
- Halt's Maul.

589
00:41:27,255 --> 00:41:31,453
...die Brandenburg heute früh bei Cuxhaven...
Sie muss schon dicht bei Kiel sein.

590
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:33,213
It's what I told you, sir.

591
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:35,974
They saw the Brandenburg
near Cuxhaven this morning.

592
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,131
He said she should be near Kiel by now.

593
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:50,291
Du feiger Hund.

594
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:06,407
Well, we've missed the Brandenburg.

595
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:11,687
She's probably well inside
the Kiel Canal by now.

596
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:15,648
- Looks like the end of the trip, sir.
- Hmm? Yep.

597
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:27,408
No, it isn't. We're going after her.
We're going into the Baltic.

598
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,404
It's a hell of a trip. Smack through the nets.

599
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:39,971
For speed, we'll have to chance
every hour we can on the surface.

600
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:43,044
- What do you say? Can do?
- (Both) Yes, sir.

601
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:44,813
Right.

602
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:59,086
Five.

603
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:03,206
Four. Back you go again, my boy.

604
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:10,208
Control Room, what are you steering?

605
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,844
Make it 015.

606
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:25,411
- Can't you be more careful?
- It's the rolling. You can't blame me.

607
00:43:25,455 --> 00:43:29,653
- You haven't finished one letter yet.
- Blotting the old ones takes the time.

608
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:32,368
The daft things men do for women.

609
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:34,246
Oh! Steady, you twerp.

610
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:37,253
- I'll get cross with him one of these days.
- Up spirits!

611
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,047
I can do with a tot after this torture.

612
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:43,373
I didn't know it was as late as that.
Must be the pleasure of doing you, 'Swain.

613
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,206
(Wind howling)

614
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:03,043
Ta.

615
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,370
- What's that you're making, Oxford?
- A brooch.

616
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,645
I thought I might use it as bait
on my next leave.

617
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:10,163
A nice piece of work
for a nice piece of work, eh?

618
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:12,012
All right, lads, sit down.

619
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:14,523
Did your boy like that model
you made for him, Hobson?

620
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:17,248
- I didn't give it to him, sir. I lost it.
- Oh, hard luck.

621
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:19,684
- That's the lot, sir.
- Oh, right.

622
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:22,852
I've got plenty more of this stuff,
if you want to make another.

623
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:25,284
I've something better to do
than make gewgaws.

624
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:27,326
Blue watch, patrol routine.

625
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:30,166
Wish I was in the army.

626
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:33,046
Bet it's raining like stink.

627
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:46,012
- How is it, sir, apart from lousy?
- Low visibility.

628
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:48,649
Getting in the big stuff soon,
keep your eyes skinned.

629
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:53,212
Bridge, permission to ditch gas?

630
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,769
- Everything's all right.
- OK.

631
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:01,129
- How is he, Stew?
- Pretty bad. Poor little bastard.

632
00:45:01,175 --> 00:45:03,370
That one caught you a bit of a oncer,
didn't he?

633
00:45:09,015 --> 00:45:13,452
All right, Steward. How is he?

634
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:16,965
- I'm afraid he's worse, sir.
- Poor little bastard.

635
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:21,486
- I'm afraid he's for it.
- Yes, looks like it.

636
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,368
Tell me, Tug, how's the tattooing going?

637
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:26,406
- Oh, all right.
- Uh-huh.

638
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:28,605
Arabella's a long name, isn't it?

639
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,004
- A bit longer than Gladys.
- Uh-huh.

640
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,011
Erm... Tug...

641
00:45:35,055 --> 00:45:41,528
you know you were saying something about
Ethel being interested in that piano fellow?

642
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:45,932
Oh, yes. I expect she just wanted
a bit of music, Mike, that's all.

643
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:49,809
- Do you think so?
- Yes, of course, that's all it is.

644
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:52,730
Uh-huh. Mm.

645
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:37,848
Stop boat.

646
00:46:38,775 --> 00:46:41,767
- Full astern together.
- Stop boat, full astern together, sir.

647
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:44,926
Full astern together!

648
00:46:53,935 --> 00:46:56,165
- How is it now?
- Still fouled, sir.

649
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:05,086
Group down. Slow ahead.

650
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:11,925
Group down. Slow ahead.

651
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:15,445
- Well, what next?
- Wait and see, my boy.

652
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:30,806
Full astern together.

653
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:40,249
- Full astern.
- Full astern.

654
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,332
- Group up. Full ahead together.
- Full ahead together, sir.

655
00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:20,767
What's the betting
we get through next time?

656
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,124
You know me.
I don't even bet on certainties.

657
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:25,166
Full ahead together there!

658
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,449
Full power to go full ahead.

659
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,612
- I'll bet you five bob we don't.
- You're on.

660
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:56,085
She was going to do it
when that telegraph flashed.

661
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:58,410
Him and the skipper's got
a working agreement.

662
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:01,527
- Anyway, Spud, five bob.
- Chalk it up.

663
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:06,012
- Group up. Full ahead together.
- Full ahead together, sir.

664
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,807
- She's made it. Group down, slow boat.
- Slow boat, sir.

665
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:41,734
- We're among the rough stuff now.
- We'll be fine till we get into the Baltic.

666
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,494
We're going to need all our luck
for the next couple of hours.

667
00:49:44,535 --> 00:49:46,810
- Keep your fingers crossed.
- Aye aye, sir.

668
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,446
No sign of a ship, sir.

669
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:28,209
- What kind of a gewgaw is that, Hobson?
- Another Sea Tiger?

670
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:33,527
No, it's the Brandenburg.
Probably all we shall ever see of her.

671
00:51:40,775 --> 00:51:42,766
(Birds squawking)

672
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:50,369
- (Klaxon blares)
- Diving stations!

673
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:52,292
Diving stations! Get a move on!

674
00:51:53,095 --> 00:51:56,167
- Morse flashing, sir, some distance away.
- Up periscope.

675
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:01,774
- Prepare to dive, 'Swain
- Prepare to dive, sir.

676
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:10,048
I left your pot with a low heat on but I ain't
done nothing about your perishing plates.

677
00:52:16,095 --> 00:52:18,609
No sign of it now.

678
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:20,646
There it is.

679
00:52:31,975 --> 00:52:35,570
Wish we had more light.
Can't see a thing of the ship herself.

680
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,049
- Soon be full daylight now, sir.
- Mmm.

681
00:52:39,815 --> 00:52:41,806
Still see a light flashing.

682
00:52:43,255 --> 00:52:45,815
Seems to be moving. Ship's head?

683
00:52:45,855 --> 00:52:47,846
080, sir.

684
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:51,410
- Starboard, 15.
- Starboard, 15, sir.

685
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,926
15 astarboard on, sir.

686
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:02,088
No more Morse. If she holds her course,
we ought to be closing on her.

687
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:04,566
Down periscope.

688
00:53:06,495 --> 00:53:08,451
Stop starboard. Full ahead port.

689
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:10,563
Stop starboard.

690
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:12,606
Full ahead port.

691
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,689
- Port motor going full ahead.
- Full ahead, eh?

692
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:23,453
I bet it's the real thing this time.

693
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:27,249
Just because the captain sees a wee flash,
you think it's the Brandenburg.

694
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:30,048
And I'm not betting with you, Spud,
so don't ask me.

695
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,094
(Clicks fingers)

696
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:53,524
Stop starboard, slow port. Destroyer,
maybe a screen. Are you getting anything?

697
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:55,930
No, sir. Wait a minute.

698
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:59,209
Picking her up now. Two of them.

699
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:01,450
- Up periscope.
- Bearing Green 5-0.

700
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,926
Plates. Plates!

701
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,486
It's her, the Brandenburg.

702
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:48,405
- Blow up all tubes.
- Four ends, blow up all tubes.

703
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,094
Blow up all tubes, sir, blow up all tubes.

704
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,923
All tubes? Blind O'Reilly,
it must be the old Brandyballs herself!

705
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:59,613
Not too much rise, Coxswain,
for the love of Mike!

706
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:03,006
Cut down the light.

707
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,335
Right, start the attack.

708
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,446
Start the plot.

709
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:21,606
Keep the confounded boat level,
Number One.

710
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,215
She's bouncing about
like a pea in a blasted drum.

711
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:29,209
Enemy bearing.

712
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:31,644
- Read it, somebody!
- Green 4-0, sir.

713
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,686
Enemy bearing, Green 4-0.

714
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:39,094
I am seven degrees on her port bow.
No, eight.

715
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,365
No... 12.

716
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:47,170
No. Why can't these ruddy Huns
steer straight when I'm looking at 'em?

717
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:50,605
Make it... eight degrees on the bow.

718
00:55:51,655 --> 00:55:53,646
Range...

719
00:55:55,695 --> 00:56:00,007
Number One, can't you keep the basket level
for five seconds? Down periscope.

720
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,924
Let me know when you have
some sort of a trim, Mr Brace.

721
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:08,046
That's better, Coxswain.

722
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:13,574
Call the range 7,000 yards. Can't see
much more than mast and funnels yet.

723
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:15,606
Keep her up now.

724
00:56:16,775 --> 00:56:18,766
Bit of a rise, Coxswain.

725
00:56:18,815 --> 00:56:20,806
Don't wring her neck off!

726
00:56:22,535 --> 00:56:25,174
- Pump on A.
- (Pump whirring)

727
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,206
Take 'em up, Coxswain.

728
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:30,685
- Stop the pump.
- (Whirring continues)

729
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:33,124
I said stop the bloody pump!
Will you keep awake?

730
00:56:33,175 --> 00:56:35,166
(Whirring stops)

731
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:39,326
Steady at 35 feet, sir.

732
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:41,886
(Clicks fingers)

733
00:56:53,295 --> 00:56:55,604
Now, let's see.

734
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,691
Ah.

735
00:56:57,735 --> 00:56:59,726
- Bearing?
- Green 6-0, sir.

736
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:04,047
11 degrees on her port bow.

737
00:57:04,095 --> 00:57:07,246
- 11 degrees on port bow.
- Enemy's course, 260, sir.

738
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:10,810
Range now...

739
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:14,006
...17 minutes in high power.

740
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:17,806
- Hard aport.
- Hard aport, sir.

741
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:22,407
- Full speed starboard.
- Full speed starboard, sir.

742
00:57:24,135 --> 00:57:26,603
I hope the destroyers stick to their course.

743
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:29,533
- Are you getting anything, Hobson?
- Not now, sir.

744
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:33,693
Looks as if we've got it on a plate.

745
00:57:33,735 --> 00:57:37,853
- Stand by, all tubes. Depth settings.
- Swinging to port.

746
00:57:37,895 --> 00:57:40,204
Stand by, all tubes. Depth setting.

747
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:42,132
Don't forget what I told you, Number Two.

748
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:45,008
Go through the drill,
same as if we were in Blackhouse Creek.

749
00:57:45,055 --> 00:57:47,728
And keep your eyes on
that reservoir pressure.

750
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,085
OK, Chief. Blinking DSM for him
if we make a hit, and well he knows it.

751
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,012
Perhaps they'll make him mayor!

752
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:55,569
- Stand by, all tubes.
- Now we're off.

753
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:59,374
What's happening?

754
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:01,690
Keep your face out of this.
Leave it to me and the captain.

755
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:04,488
He gives the orders and I get 'em there, see?

756
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:07,288
- Slow boat. Steer 010.
- 010, sir.

757
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,413
Bearing Green 6-0,
doing 270 revolutions.

758
00:58:14,455 --> 00:58:16,889
Steady on 010, sir.

759
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:19,130
There she is.

760
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:21,052
One lovely battleship.

761
00:58:21,095 --> 00:58:23,086
- Bearing?
- Green 6-0, sir.

762
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:26,410
Range... 23 minutes...

763
00:58:28,775 --> 00:58:30,766
...15 degrees on the port bow.

764
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,013
- 50 feet, Number One.
- 50 feet, sir.

765
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:37,047
Last range 3,000, sir.
Gives you a speed of roughly 30 knots.

766
00:58:37,095 --> 00:58:40,326
30? Bit much. Make it, er, 25.

767
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:44,368
Right, bring the boat up.
Clear away attack periscope.

768
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:46,406
- Group down.
- Group down, sir.

769
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:49,128
- Hydrophone bearing?
- Bearing Green 5-9, sir.

770
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:56,086
- Bearing on.
- Green 6-5, sir.

771
00:58:58,295 --> 00:58:59,694
30 degrees on the bow.

772
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:06,214
Destroyer, port wing of screen, 1500 yards.

773
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:10,210
Next time's going to be troublesome.

774
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:14,451
Stand by to take her down low, Number One.
We shall be bloody close.

775
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:16,770
800 yards off track, sir. On the same course.

776
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:18,806
Right.

777
00:59:23,735 --> 00:59:25,726
Well...

778
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:35,525
- Looks faster than 25. Give her 28 for luck.
- 28, sir.

779
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:39,409
- Control Room. All tubes ready.
- Captain, sir. All tubes ready.

780
00:59:39,455 --> 00:59:41,446
Good.

781
00:59:43,215 --> 00:59:45,445
Watch your steering and keep her down.

782
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:48,168
Dive helm, Coxswain. Open bow buoyancy.

783
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:54,333
- Well?
- Victor angle, 17 degrees, sir.

784
00:59:56,615 --> 00:59:58,412
17 degrees.

785
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:05,012
- Stand by...
- Stand by.

786
01:00:05,055 --> 01:00:06,852
Stand by.

787
01:00:12,095 --> 01:00:14,051
- Fire.
- Fire.

788
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:15,847
(Muffled thuds)

789
01:00:15,895 --> 01:00:20,047
Two gone.

790
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,086
- (Thud)
- Three gone.

791
01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:25,244
- (Thud)
- Four.

792
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:27,968
- (Thud)
- Five gone.

793
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:31,325
- (Thud)
- Six gone. All torpedoes fired, sir.

794
01:00:32,415 --> 01:00:34,406
All six running, sir.

795
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:38,806
Take her down, Number One.

796
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,404
Pass the word, stand by for depth charges.

797
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:44,446
(Klaxon blares)

798
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:58,327
Torpedos! Steuerbord voraus.

799
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:01,253
Should have our first strike
in a few seconds, sir.

800
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:16,004
Keep her right down, Number One.
Stop boat.

801
01:01:16,055 --> 01:01:18,046
- Stop boat, sir.
- Steering planes in hand.

802
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:21,326
- Steering planes in hand, sir.
- Pass the word, all hands keep quiet.

803
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,889
- Keep quiet in the boat!
- Damned if I know if we hit her.

804
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:25,926
- Hobson?
- I wouldn't swear to it, sir.

805
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:29,490
- It's hard to tell with these depth charges.
- (Loud blast)

806
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:41,772
What's all the fuss about?
Don't half shake us up, those bangs.

807
01:01:41,815 --> 01:01:43,806
Shut your mouth
and mind your ruddy pump.

808
01:01:43,855 --> 01:01:47,894
All right, chum. Only if I've got to die,
I want to know how it happened.

809
01:01:47,935 --> 01:01:49,846
Matter of interest.

810
01:01:49,895 --> 01:01:51,886
Listen all round carefully.

811
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,806
Something on Red 3-0, sir.

812
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,133
Coming this way.

813
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:02,166
Increasing speed.

814
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:05,886
Coming in to attack.

815
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:11,924
- Steady bearing.
- Damn.

816
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:15,490
- Stand by for a burst of speed.
- Passing very close, sir.

817
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:22,966
Passing overhead now.

818
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:31,972
(Explosion)

819
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:36,646
(Explosion)

820
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:42,653
Pump on engine room bilges.
Secondary lighting.

821
01:02:44,815 --> 01:02:46,806
Hold her up, Coxswain.

822
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:50,290
Can I use speed, sir?
We're dropping down astern.

823
01:02:50,335 --> 01:02:53,213
- Half ahead together.
- Half ahead together, sir.

824
01:02:55,255 --> 01:02:58,531
Captain, sir, we've got a nasty leak
and we can't get suction on the pump.

825
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,406
- Get a bucket team going.
- Aye aye, sir.

826
01:03:00,455 --> 01:03:03,925
Get all the buckets you can find
and bring them along.

827
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,290
You need more plugs. Fetch some more plugs!

828
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:13,326
(Explosion)

829
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:17,645
Come on, boys! Bail out with these.

830
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:23,091
- Don't forget the divers!
- Here you are. More coming along.

831
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,571
- Aye, just in time.
- Here you are. Come on, chain up!

832
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:32,487
TI, the main line's gone off. We've got
to dump this stuff in the fore-end bilges.

833
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:36,323
All right, we'll make a chain.
Tom, Ted, come along.

834
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:45,289
- There you are.
- Du, Hans. Ich glaube der Fritz stirbt.

835
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:47,929
- Na und wenn schon.
- Du brutaler Kerl, sag's dem mal.

836
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:50,535
- Here.
- What's the matter with you now?

837
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:53,487
It may not interest you, mister,
but I think the patient is dying.

838
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:56,652
Oh. You take my place, then.
Go on, come in there.

839
01:04:00,095 --> 01:04:02,086
(Explosion)

840
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:09,574
Right, don't you be worried by them bangs.

841
01:04:09,615 --> 01:04:11,606
There never was anybody...

842
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:17,493
I'm afraid he's finished dying.

843
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,851
- He's dead. I'll report to the captain.
- OK.

844
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:34,971
Still fill the bilges at this rate.

845
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:40,529
Don't worry, chum. We got four teetotallers
drinking 'em at the other end.

846
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,367
Getting near now.

847
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:50,406
Heading faster.

848
01:04:51,295 --> 01:04:53,889
Speed increasing.

849
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:55,926
Right overhead now.

850
01:04:57,375 --> 01:05:00,492
Captain, sir. I have to report
the death of German prisoner Fritz.

851
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:02,526
- Oh.
- (Explosion)

852
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:07,453
- Coming up, Number One.
- Stern's beginning to rise, sir.

853
01:05:07,495 --> 01:05:09,929
- What did you say, TI?
- German prisoner dead, sir.

854
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:11,966
Oh, yeah, I'll pick that up later.

855
01:05:13,055 --> 01:05:15,091
Keep working on that forward pump there.

856
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:19,048
Water dropping, sir. If we keep this up for
another hour, we'll have broke the back of it.

857
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:21,655
- That's the stuff. Keep them at it.
- Aye aye, sir.

858
01:05:21,695 --> 01:05:24,414
Coming in to attack again. Increasing.

859
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:26,525
Hope he makes a muck of it.

860
01:05:26,575 --> 01:05:29,408
What about all our sweets, Coxswain?

861
01:05:29,455 --> 01:05:30,934
- Beg your pardon, sir?
- Sweets.

862
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:33,409
Sweets? I'll send for them, sir. Lofty.

863
01:05:33,455 --> 01:05:35,047
Go forward and open up the magazine.

864
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:37,450
Next to the ammo
you'll find a tin marked White Lead.

865
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:39,247
They're suckers. Bring them here.

866
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,807
If you're after fuel, sir,
that last package done it in.

867
01:05:43,855 --> 01:05:46,733
Barely 500 gallons left
and we're still losing it.

868
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:51,293
Apart from losing oil,
we must be leaving a trail on the surface.

869
01:05:51,335 --> 01:05:53,530
Destroyer coming in to attack, sir.

870
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,566
So it's only a question of time...

871
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:02,173
As I was saying, it's only a question of time
before they hit the bull's-eye.

872
01:06:02,215 --> 01:06:06,003
Until these Jerries think we're a goner,
they're going to keep at it.

873
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:14,686
Talking of Jerries...

874
01:06:16,215 --> 01:06:18,206
I wonder.

875
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,293
Coxswain.

876
01:06:21,335 --> 01:06:22,654
Come on, hurry up, we haven't got all day.

877
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:26,328
- Talk about Bundles for Britain.
- That's not funny.

878
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,650
What are you taking that up for?
That won't float.

879
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,686
I want to wash it.

880
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:37,491
- You put those papers in his pocket?
- Yes, and that old stopwatch too.

881
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,934
OK.

882
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,730
Was machen sie mit dem?

883
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,766
That's all right, cock. Don't worry.

884
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:03,013
- Leave it to me. I'll manage for you, sir.
- Fine.

885
01:07:03,055 --> 01:07:07,446
Warn everybody we're taking a big angle on.
Take over, Number One. I'm going forward.

886
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:10,293
(Explosion)

887
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:25,087
- Everything set?
- Yes, sir. Body's in number-one tube, sir.

888
01:07:25,135 --> 01:07:28,411
In the navigator's coat and cap,
Coxswain's underclothes and my trousers, sir.

889
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:31,253
Fix another tube full of water.
I want a really good splash.

890
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:34,810
- Wait for the order, hang on like grim death.
- Aye aye, sir.

891
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:46,094
Pass the word.
Watch out, we're taking a steep angle.

892
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:47,887
Pay attention there. From the captain.

893
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:50,130
Look out for standing on your ruddy heads.

894
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:53,963
- (Explosion)
- Stand by. Fire, blow out oil.

895
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:56,006
Fire one.

896
01:07:59,215 --> 01:08:00,648
Number-one tube fired, sir.

897
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:04,927
Open valve oil, Ted. Flood A. Flood B.
Flood tubes.

898
01:08:04,975 --> 01:08:07,409
That's what I call a nice quick funeral.

899
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,086
(Man calls out)

900
01:08:22,815 --> 01:08:24,806
- Watch up.
- Half ahead together.

901
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:26,846
Half ahead together, sir.

902
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:31,966
10... 12... 15.

903
01:08:32,935 --> 01:08:34,926
Lovely.

904
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:43,970
- Stern's well out of the water now, sir.
- Stop blowing aft.

905
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,324
Flood after-tanks. Let her go down.

906
01:08:52,255 --> 01:08:55,725
(Cheering)

907
01:09:05,295 --> 01:09:09,174
<i>(Man) The latest example</i>
<i>of the British Admiralty's foolhardiness</i>

908
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:12,844
<i>is witnessed by the fate of the submarine,</i>
<i>Sea Tiger.</i>

909
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:15,170
<i>This unfortunate vessel entered the Baltic</i>

910
01:09:15,215 --> 01:09:18,685
<i>to make a senseless attack</i>
<i>on an unarmed fishing smack.</i>

911
01:09:18,735 --> 01:09:22,330
<i>It may interest the wives of the crew</i>
<i>of the Sea Tiger to know</i>

912
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,889
<i>that she is now lying a total wreck...</i>

913
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,804
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
listening to that pack of lies.

914
01:09:31,855 --> 01:09:34,130
I hope you're right, missus.

915
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,251
No, no news from the Admiralty.

916
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,294
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

917
01:10:04,335 --> 01:10:06,291
- Have a drink, Scratch?
- No, thanks.

918
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,610
Oh, come on, it'll make your beard curly!

919
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:33,686
Hobson?

920
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,448
What's the longest time
you've ever been down?

921
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:42,329
We can last the night if you'll put a sock
in that jaw of yours and save oxygen.

922
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:44,369
Jack?

923
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:55,973
- What's that?
- It's a fly. It's known as the Whirling Dun.

924
01:10:56,975 --> 01:11:00,524
In my part of the world,
the blighters fairly fight for it.

925
01:11:01,135 --> 01:11:04,730
I believe in a cod's head on a big hook.

926
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:08,010
Yank 'em in. No arguments.

927
01:11:09,455 --> 01:11:13,448
<i>Do you hear there? Do you hear there?</i>
<i>Stand by for the captain.</i>

928
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:19,534
This is the captain speaking.

929
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:25,605
Well, there's no need for me to explain
the situation to you. You all know it.

930
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:31,846
<i>I intended searching for a tanker</i>
<i>and hijacking the oil.</i>

931
01:11:33,175 --> 01:11:36,292
<i>But we haven't even got</i>
<i>enough fuel left for that.</i>

932
01:11:37,455 --> 01:11:40,447
<i>We are down to our last gallons,</i>

933
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:45,607
<i>and we've only enough food</i>
<i>to last until tomorrow.</i>

934
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:50,250
In fact, just about one decent meal for the TI.

935
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:57,365
Now, I've gone into the matter very carefully,

936
01:11:58,495 --> 01:12:00,372
and what I propose to do is this.

937
01:12:02,495 --> 01:12:07,933
<i>About 20 miles to the northwest</i>
<i>is the Danish island of Haego.</i>

938
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:11,768
<i>I shall bring the boat close in</i>
<i>during the night,</i>

939
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:17,174
<i>give every man a chance of getting ashore,</i>

940
01:12:17,935 --> 01:12:20,165
<i>and then blow her up.</i>

941
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:25,646
I'm sorry it's come to this,
but I'm afraid there's no alternative.

942
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:32,373
<i>Thank you for your loyalty and help.</i>

943
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:34,966
That's all.

944
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:40,570
Right, come forward, Number One, will you?
Let's figure something out.

945
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:44,051
You know what this means?
Internment for the rest of the ruddy war.

946
01:12:44,095 --> 01:12:46,325
Perhaps...
Perhaps a prison camp in Germany.

947
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,050
Go on, cheer us up. Why don't you
make it a concentration camp?

948
01:12:52,615 --> 01:12:55,687
What's up, Hobson?
Where do you think you're going to?

949
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:57,885
What's biting him, I'd like to know.

950
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:03,167
- It's just a question of these tides.
- (Knock at door)

951
01:13:03,215 --> 01:13:05,206
Come in.

952
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:10,328
- Excuse me, sir, may I have a word?
- What is it, Hobson?

953
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,366
Just a minute.

954
01:13:15,055 --> 01:13:17,933
It's about what you've just been telling us, sir.

955
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:21,763
If I remember rightly, there's a port
called Frihaven on the island of Haego.

956
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,454
I called there once on a Baltic run
just before the war.

957
01:13:24,495 --> 01:13:27,487
- Well?
- Well, what I was thinking, sir...

958
01:13:27,535 --> 01:13:32,006
it's bound to be busy there and there's almost
certain to be oil somewhere about.

959
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:36,412
If I could slip ashore, I could sneak into
Frihaven and find out the lay of the land.

960
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:40,334
And if there's any oil handy,
I would flash you a signal,

961
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,572
you could bring in the boat
and we could hijack the juice.

962
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:48,205
Even if we didn't get away with it
we couldn't be any worse off.

963
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,808
I wonder.

964
01:13:52,855 --> 01:13:57,053
I could use one of those Jerries' uniforms.
I could get by anything in that.

965
01:13:58,135 --> 01:14:00,774
You thought it all out, didn't you, Hobson?

966
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:03,648
Supposing you were stopped,
what sort of story could you tell?

967
01:14:03,695 --> 01:14:06,732
My plane might have crashed in the sea,
both my mates killed,

968
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,164
and I could have got ashore in the dinghy.

969
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:10,443
Why not?

970
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:14,975
If you're caught in a German uniform,

971
01:14:15,015 --> 01:14:18,087
it won't just be a question
of being taken prisoner.

972
01:14:18,135 --> 01:14:22,048
- You know that, don't you, Hobson?
- There's nobody to shed any tears over me.

973
01:14:24,495 --> 01:14:29,888
Hmm, it's not going to be easy,
getting into a strange harbour at night.

974
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:34,328
We'll take a crack at it.

975
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:38,084
All right, Hobson, ask the coxswain
for the prisoners' uniforms.

976
01:14:38,135 --> 01:14:41,366
Pick one out and be ready by dark.
I wish I could come with you.

977
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:43,451
Your German might not stand the strain, sir.

978
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:46,567
No, maybe you're right. All right, Hobson.

979
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:52,489
Oh, er... Thank you, Hobson.

980
01:14:53,415 --> 01:14:55,406
Sir.

981
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:48,006
Good, he's made it.

982
01:15:49,815 --> 01:15:53,125
- Monkey Orange King.
- Monkey Orange King.

983
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:56,850
- James Monkey Yorker.
- James Monkey Yorker.

984
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:18,047
Sugar Charlie.

985
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:20,450
- Sugar Charlie.
- That's the lot.

986
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:25,126
- Keep a sharp lookout, Number One.
- Aye aye, sir.

987
01:16:46,215 --> 01:16:48,775
Halt! Wer da?

988
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:52,248
Hauptmann, ich bin der Luftwaffen-Offizier.

989
01:16:53,095 --> 01:16:54,972
Bitte der Ausweis von Herrn Hauptmann.

990
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:00,608
- Bitte schön.
- Wenn der Herr Hauptmann mitkommt.

991
01:17:10,095 --> 01:17:13,531
Ja was ist denn los...
Immer... Verzeihung, Herr Hauptmann.

992
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:15,531
Guten Abend...

993
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,367
- Zu Befehl, Herr Feldwebel. Ausweis.
- Ich bin abgeschossen worden.

994
01:17:20,415 --> 01:17:22,007
Oh.

995
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,492
That's the lot, sir.

996
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:40,686
"Have located loaded oil tanker,
port end of the pier."

997
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,010
"Depth, eight fathoms everywhere."

998
01:17:43,055 --> 01:17:44,852
Good, he's remembered everything.

999
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:48,205
That means we can go slap in
at periscope depth. Come on.

1000
01:17:49,615 --> 01:17:51,094
Herr Hauptmann, abtreten!

1001
01:17:51,135 --> 01:17:52,966
(Telephone rings)

1002
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:59,571
Wachposten drei... Jawohl, Herr Major. Jawohl.

1003
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:02,766
Ein Signal, Herr Major.
Ein Lichtzeichen?

1004
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:06,091
Nein, das ist ganz ausgeschlossen.
Herr Major, ich...

1005
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:08,808
hab meine Taschenlampe hier auf dem Tisch.

1006
01:18:09,615 --> 01:18:13,051
Nein... Nein, die Wache hat nichts bemerkt.

1007
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:17,088
Nur ein Hauptmann der Luftwaffe...

1008
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:21,811
Ja, er ist... eben angekommen.

1009
01:18:21,855 --> 01:18:24,210
Ja. Jawohl, Herr Major ich...

1010
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,167
werde mich persönlich vergewissern.
Jawohl, sofort!

1011
01:18:40,175 --> 01:18:42,166
(Telephone rings)

1012
01:18:46,815 --> 01:18:48,726
<i>Hallo! Was ist denn da los?</i>

1013
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:51,289
- (Groans)
- <i>Hallo, hören Sie.</i>

1014
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:52,927
<i>Antworten Sie doch.</i>

1015
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:57,810
<i>Was ist denn los mit der verdammten Einheit.</i>
<i>Hört dasjemand?</i>

1016
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:06,092
Danke. Gute Nacht.

1017
01:19:08,855 --> 01:19:10,846
Wache.

1018
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:14,244
Hauptquartier? Wo?

1019
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:16,855
- Sehen der Herr Hauptmann den Schuppen?
- Ja.

1020
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:20,331
Also wenn Sie rechts in die Straße einbiegen...

1021
01:19:28,535 --> 01:19:30,526
(Splash)

1022
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:45,530
Can't see a damn thing.
If you feel a bump, you'll know we've arrived.

1023
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:56,126
(Bells tolling)

1024
01:20:16,095 --> 01:20:18,211
We must be well inside the harbour now.

1025
01:20:23,295 --> 01:20:25,763
- Bring her up, Number One.
- Stand by to surface.

1026
01:20:25,815 --> 01:20:28,534
Stand by, engines. Look out, landing party.

1027
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:31,248
What a game!
Turning us into ruddy commandos!

1028
01:20:36,735 --> 01:20:39,533
- Surface.
- Surface. Blow two, blow G.

1029
01:20:51,655 --> 01:20:54,852
Lord, we left it pretty late.
Starboard 20, easing to 15.

1030
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:08,526
(Man shouts instructions)

1031
01:21:18,135 --> 01:21:20,569
Argh!

1032
01:21:28,215 --> 01:21:32,254
Sounds as if Hobson's in trouble.
Get your party ashore and keep the jetty clear.

1033
01:21:43,975 --> 01:21:46,853
Captain, come on.
The Kapitän, savvy? Come on.

1034
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:50,606
Got a couple here, sir.
What shall I do with them?

1035
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,646
Keep 'em quiet.

1036
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,045
- The captain, sir.
- Do you speak English?

1037
01:21:56,095 --> 01:21:57,847
- I do.
- This is the British Navy.

1038
01:21:57,895 --> 01:22:00,489
We want oil and stores,
and we've no time to argue.

1039
01:22:00,535 --> 01:22:05,484
There will be no argument. The British Navy
is always welcome in Denmark.

1040
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:09,130
- Now you're talking!
- Take what you want. My men will help.

1041
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,451
- Axel! Hans!
- Get these pipelines fixed up.

1042
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:14,372
(Gunfire)

1043
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:18,970
(Gunfire)

1044
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:21,006
That's one of them.

1045
01:22:21,455 --> 01:22:23,605
Wait. He's firing inshore.
It might be Hobson.

1046
01:22:23,655 --> 01:22:25,805
That's Hobson, sir. I helped dress him up.

1047
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,445
- Yes, I believe you're right.
- That's-a-boy!

1048
01:22:29,495 --> 01:22:31,486
Good man!

1049
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:33,526
Wait there.

1050
01:22:35,735 --> 01:22:37,726
(Gunfire continues)

1051
01:22:43,015 --> 01:22:47,213
- Well done, Hobson. Had a good time?
- Fine, sir. About time you blokes turned up.

1052
01:22:49,415 --> 01:22:51,485
There's another ruddy machine-gun.

1053
01:22:55,815 --> 01:22:57,806
(Shouting orders)

1054
01:23:04,255 --> 01:23:07,247
- Dusty, tell the captain it's coming through.
- Right, Chief.

1055
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:19,652
Things are getting hot. Gordon,
take three men and back the other party up.

1056
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:22,687
Hang on till you get one blast on the whistle,
then beat it back here.

1057
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:25,488
If we can't hold them,
I'll give you one green Very light.

1058
01:23:25,535 --> 01:23:27,526
It might help you to get clear, sir.

1059
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:41,406
- (Gunfire)
...hear the whistle.

1060
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:44,527
If you can't,
give them a green one with the Very light.

1061
01:23:56,735 --> 01:23:58,726
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so, sir.

1062
01:23:58,775 --> 01:24:00,174
Good man.

1063
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:25,803
We'll be in trouble soon. That warehouse
is full of oil. Floor's covered with it.

1064
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:27,811
We won't half cop it if that lot goes up.

1065
01:24:38,215 --> 01:24:44,529
- Are you all right? Shall I take over for you?
- No cause for panic.

1066
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:49,209
Control Room?

1067
01:24:49,255 --> 01:24:51,052
Find out how we're going now.

1068
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:56,649
- Captain wants to know...
- We want a lot more yet.

1069
01:24:58,055 --> 01:25:00,250
Never mind that.
Ask what his gauges are showing.

1070
01:25:04,215 --> 01:25:08,367
- Ronnie, we're out of ammo.
- How much have you got?

1071
01:25:08,415 --> 01:25:10,975
There's about enough
for a couple of bursts, sir.

1072
01:25:11,015 --> 01:25:13,006
- Better save them.
- Aye aye, sir.

1073
01:25:18,775 --> 01:25:20,925
Nothing else for it, I suppose.

1074
01:25:20,975 --> 01:25:23,773
1200 gallons. All right, we'll risk it.

1075
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:27,888
That's just his Scot's caution.
Tell him we're going to take a short cut.

1076
01:25:28,615 --> 01:25:30,685
(Whistle blasts)

1077
01:25:30,735 --> 01:25:32,726
Get your party going.

1078
01:25:48,575 --> 01:25:50,964
(Shouts instructions)

1079
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:55,929
They're coming. Get going, TI.

1080
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:57,374
Hobson!

1081
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:53,286
Lend a hand here.

1082
01:27:01,055 --> 01:27:03,888
- Is that the lot?
- I'm afraid the cook won't be coming.

1083
01:27:03,935 --> 01:27:05,687
Let go aft.

1084
01:27:10,735 --> 01:27:12,646
Half astern together.

1085
01:27:12,695 --> 01:27:16,449
- Goodbye, Captain. Good luck!
- Goodbye, sir. Thanks for the oil.

1086
01:27:18,455 --> 01:27:20,446
(Shouts orders)

1087
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:39,890
Please... report...

1088
01:27:41,695 --> 01:27:43,845
Sea... Tiger...

1089
01:27:45,455 --> 01:27:49,687
returning... to... base.

1090
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:56,566
- Get that off to C-in-C.
- Aye aye, skipper.

1091
01:28:16,575 --> 01:28:18,930
Probably surprised at seeing us.
What are they saying?

1092
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:21,330
Congratulations...

1093
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,366
...on...

1094
01:28:23,415 --> 01:28:25,406
...sinking...
- What?

1095
01:28:25,455 --> 01:28:28,413
Well, I'll be b! The Brandenburg, sir.

1096
01:28:28,455 --> 01:28:32,289
- Blimey!
- Blimey! Control Room?

1097
01:28:32,335 --> 01:28:34,724
- Control Room, sir.
- We sank the Brandenburg.

1098
01:28:34,775 --> 01:28:39,166
- We got the Brandenburg!
- Blimey! We got the Brandenburg!

1099
01:28:39,215 --> 01:28:41,888
- We got the Brandenburg, sir.
- What?

1100
01:28:41,935 --> 01:28:46,372
We got the Brandenburg.
What do you know, we got the Brandenburg!

1101
01:28:52,975 --> 01:28:54,886
(Horn blares)

1102
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:56,926
(Horns blaring)

1103
01:29:04,735 --> 01:29:06,726
(Cheering)

1104
01:29:27,535 --> 01:29:30,003
Captain, sir, they're putting out pennants.

1105
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,446
"Well done, P61."

1106
01:29:48,975 --> 01:29:50,966
- Stop boat.
- Stop boat, sir.

1107
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:55,490
(Cheering continues)

1108
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:26,973
- Grand job, Taylor.
- Thank you, sir.

1109
01:30:27,015 --> 01:30:30,610
Better than my fishing smacks. You really
must have used Old Moore's Almanack.

1110
01:30:30,655 --> 01:30:32,611
Well, actually, it's all done by mirrors.

1111
01:30:32,655 --> 01:30:35,567
I'm just pushing off,
so you'll have to wait for that double.

1112
01:30:35,615 --> 01:30:38,083
- Goodbye, sir.
- Good luck, Humphries.

1113
01:30:38,135 --> 01:30:39,693
- Good luck, David.
- Thank you.

1114
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:42,124
- Nice work, Freddie.
- Well done, old man.

1115
01:30:43,535 --> 01:30:45,526
(Lively chatter)

1116
01:30:55,615 --> 01:30:57,685
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello, Gladys.

1117
01:30:58,615 --> 01:31:00,606
Mike!

1118
01:31:01,735 --> 01:31:05,205
Oh, Mike, it's lovely to have you back, safe.

1119
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,251
Ethel! Me darling!

1120
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:13,288
- Hello, Arabella.
- Arabella?

1121
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:15,974
- Arabella?
- Gladys!

1122
01:31:16,015 --> 01:31:20,167
- Tug, isn't this wonderful?
- It's exciting, isn't it?

1123
01:31:20,215 --> 01:31:25,164
Well, so long, Dicky. You must show Gladys
your new tattoo sometime.

1124
01:31:25,215 --> 01:31:27,206
- Gladys?
- You heard.

1125
01:31:35,415 --> 01:31:37,406
Daddy!

1126
01:31:39,095 --> 01:31:41,768
- Hello, Pete.
- I saw your submarine.

1127
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:43,771
- Did you?
- Yes, Daddy.

1128
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:46,204
- Did you see her coming in?
- Yes, Daddy.

1129
01:31:46,255 --> 01:31:48,246
You didn't know she brought a battleship
with her, though, did you?

1130
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,047
No, Daddy.

1131
01:31:50,095 --> 01:31:52,086
Look what I've got for you here.

1132
01:31:57,175 --> 01:31:59,973
- Ooh, Daddy!
- Hello, Jim.

1133
01:32:05,015 --> 01:32:07,404
- Hello, Alice.
- Mummy, Mummy!

1134
01:32:08,535 --> 01:32:11,049
Look what Daddy brought me.
A battleship.

1135
01:32:11,095 --> 01:32:13,086
Yes.

1136
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,852
Better be getting home.

1137
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:17,886
Aye.

1138
01:32:19,695 --> 01:32:22,892
Well, enjoy your leave. This time
I suppose you will be seeing your aunt.

1139
01:32:22,935 --> 01:32:26,291
Yes, all of them, sir. Excuse me.
Gordon, are you going to the wardroom?

1140
01:32:26,335 --> 01:32:28,769
- Get me Grosvenor 2777, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1141
01:32:28,815 --> 01:32:32,091
There's the Sorceress.
Just going through the booms.

1142
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:38,688
One comes in, another goes out.
Just like running a ruddy bus service!
