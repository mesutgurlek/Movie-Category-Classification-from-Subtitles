00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:58,740
BECKETT: Negative, Major.

648
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,909
I counted at least
two other combatants

649
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,878
that lived through your
donnybrook and made it out.

650
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,512
They could be working with Simpson.

651
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:06,481
So you two have to go after them.

652
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,516
I'll go west. I know that terrain.

653
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:10,051
Yeah, I'll go to the east.

654
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:13,296
So if this is more than just
Simpson, who are they working for?

655
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,294
We'll ask whoever we leave alive.

656
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,463
Happy hunting.

Drop your fucking gun.

659

Don't move. Put the weapon down.

660

662
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,955
I'm waiting for evac.

Evac?

664
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,692
There's no evac coming for you.

01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,361

Who's "they"?

What did they promise?

01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:06,748
To know I was fighting for
something that mattered.

673
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,821
I was doing good.

01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,056
Maybe you were.

675
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,723
No.

676
01:03:15,724 --> 01:03:17,728
I wasn't.

(GRUNTING)

678

Your old man was out there with me

679
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:15,791
and it did not do me any good
having him watch my six.

01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:30,832
Ah, ah, ah.

Say hi to your old man
when you see him.

- My father's dead.
- Is he?

- Well, you killed him.
- Well, I thought I did, but he's here.

- Here?
- Yep.

Now, I want you to
do a favor for me.

I can do what the fuck
I like. I'm in Syria.

696
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:56,718
You think my government sent
me here to follow the rules?

697
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,688
They sent me here to take
down creeps like you.

698

They don't ask me how
I do it and I don't tell.

from a third party?

Understood. We got to
get this done, Major.

Listen, Colonel, I know
this thing has gone

a bit sideways and I'm
willing to wear that,

711

but I've got a piece of business
right in front of me now.

712

What kind of business?

Who else?

759
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,195
The last thing Simpson
said to me was

760
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,398
that he was gunning for
you and the Colonel.

761

Sounds like a trap to me.

01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,608
Or a misdirection.

763
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:17,872
Maybe he wants us to lead him there.

You said this shooter uses a

linked in to cell signals.

I could pinpoint

his firing platform.

He's working for someone.

788
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,652
Or he's crazy.

789
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,657
Or both.

from the Fifth Stryker Brigade.

Heavy action, really heavy.

You know, he was a good Marine,

796
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:42,386
but it got to his soul.

797
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:46,527
Messed him up really good.

798
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:53,128
The psychs tagged him with PTSD,
but they didn't discharge him.

799
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,874
They didn't really treat him either.

800
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,812
For three months he wandered
the base with a weapon.

801
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:07,041
January first,
he went into his hooch,

802
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,549
grabbed his weapon and he
shot up a New Year's Party.

803
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:15,957
Then he trekked up to
Yosemite National Forest.

804
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:20,065
No food, no shelter,

below freezing.

806
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,066
When we finally spotted him, he was
up the mountain above the snow line.

807
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:39,745
Just sitting there, staring
into dawn's early light.

808
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,758
And then he ate his gun.

You got a phone call.

985
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:04,971
Hello?

986
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,476
Gunnery Sergeant Beckett.

987
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:09,409
<i>Yes, Colonel.</i>

988
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:12,483
I wanted to thank you
for being a good Marine.

989
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:14,247
Not necessary, sir.

990
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:15,948
<i>We tied this off,</i>

991
01:34:15,949 --> 01:34:17,750
you did most of the heavy lifting.

992
01:34:17,751 --> 01:34:20,386
That kind of work hits my radar.

993
01:34:20,387 --> 01:34:22,989
Thank you, sir. Is that all?

994
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,757
I understand you put in
a request for leave.

995
01:34:24,758 --> 01:34:26,592
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

996
01:34:26,593 --> 01:34:28,327
Just trying to sort some things out.

997
01:34:28,328 --> 01:34:32,732
I get it, take some
time, get some rest.

998
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,906
But when you come up for air,

999
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,541
I'll be that knock at your door.

1000
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:42,911
Forgive me if I don't answer, sir.

1001
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:45,411
You'll answer.

1002
01:34:45,412 --> 01:34:46,746
Are you sure about that?

1003
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:50,389
This work we do, it's in your
DNA. Its who you are.

1004
01:34:50,617 --> 01:34:54,259
So, yeah, I'm sure about that.

1005
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:58,024
<i>There is one more thing though.
There's been no decision yet,</i>

1006
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:00,026
but if things stack up,

1007
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:02,795
there's a chance you might
see a lot more of your dad.

1008
01:35:02,796 --> 01:35:04,530
How so?

1009
01:35:04,531 --> 01:35:06,842
He's gonna be your new CO.

1010
01:35:09,536 --> 01:35:11,537
Take care of that arm, Colonel.

1011
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:13,806
Oh, and find yourself a new island.

1012
01:35:13,807 --> 01:35:15,913
That hide's been compromised.

1013
01:35:16,176 --> 01:35:18,311
Already done.
