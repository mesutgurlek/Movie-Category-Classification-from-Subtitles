that convincing?"

long as possible,

there was no possibility

by the contrast

715

Alfred Hitchcock's--
one of his contributions

716
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,532
to the film is that
he had a particular

717
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,083
conceptualization
of those maps.

718
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:20,002
He also thought they
were very important

719
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,621
because he said not only
should they show the sites

720
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,957
of atrocity
or the concentration camps

721

were close
to population centers,

722
00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:29,845
they should do so
on a map that was very simple,

723
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,214
and it should be like
a school's atlas.

724
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:44,443
We wanted to know whether
the Germans surrounding

the concentration camp
knew about it.

726
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,099
So Hitch did
this drawing, circles,

727
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:54,436
one mile from the camp,
two miles from the camp,

10 miles from the camp,
20 miles from the camp.

His idea was show
the area surrounding each camp

730
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:09,168

led a normal life outside.

MAN: I was born in Bergen-Belsen
in the displaced persons' camp.

762
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,959
Both my parents were
liberated at Belsen.

763
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,578
My mother put together
a team to work

764
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:20,682
alongside the British
medical personnel

765
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,435
to try and save as many
as possible

766
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:28,223
of the thousands
of critically ill survivors.

767
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:32,277
At the same time,
my father emerged

768
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:38,617
as the leader, the political
leader of the survivors.

769
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:41,203
Most of them did not
want to go back

770
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,823
to their country of origin
but wanted to go, settle

771
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,909
in Palestine or elsewhere,

772
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:51,046
the United States,
Canada, and the like.

773
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,299
BERNEY: And apparently
the American answer was

774
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:56,084
definitely no.

775
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,887
"We're not taking
any ex-prisoners in.

776
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,024
We've got problems of our own."

777
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,009
Britain said, "No. There's
no way we're going to take

778
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:10,649
hundreds of thousands
of--of these homeless,
stateless people in."

779
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:13,819
So that was the situation.

01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,988
And so now of course
I am in heaven.

of their activities
over many years.

We are now ready to
hear the presentation

953
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:36,617
by the prosecution.

954
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:41,372
This was the tragic
fulfillment of a program

955
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:45,676
of intolerance
and arrogance.

956
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:49,013
Vengeance is not our goal,

957
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:54,268
nor do we seek merely
a just retribution.

958
01:12:54,303 --> 01:13:00,608
We ask this court to affirm by
international penal action

959
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:05,146
man's right to live
in peace and dignity,

960
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,200
regardless
of his race or creed.

FERENCZ, VOICE-OVER: I was
appointed a chief prosecutor

962
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:16,074
in what was surely the biggest
murder trial in human history,

963
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,628
and it was my first case,
and I was 27 years old.

964
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,964
...will show that
the slaughter committed

965
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,968
by these defendants
was dictated

966
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:31,556
not by military necessity
but by that supreme...

NARRATOR: Even though
Bernstein's 1945 film

968
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,477
had been quietly dropped,

969
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,348
this was not
the end of its story.

970
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:44,152
70 years later,
an Imperial War Museum team

971
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,488
completed the film using
the original shot sheets,

972
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:50,958
script, and rushes
to meticulously reconstruct

973
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,779
Bernstein and Hitchcock's
intended final section.

974
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,331
We knew that it was
a powerful piece of cinema

975
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:01,402
and also had been made by some
of the best film technicians

976
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,955
and writers of the era.

977
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:07,108
What we wanted to do
was ultimately produce

978
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:10,478
and complete the work
of these original filmmakers.

FILM NARRATOR: This was
the end of the journey

981
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,884
they had so confidently
begun in 1933.

In terms of barbarity

they had traveled backwards
