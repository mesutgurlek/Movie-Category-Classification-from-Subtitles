Age 19, and before his
romantic novel <i>Mein Kampf,</i>

167
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,873
he was a failed art student at the
Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

168
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,753
- GARFIELD: Hitler painted that?
- It's not bad.

- Eh, it's not good.
- JEFFRIES: This photograph

00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,801
has been obtained by the OSS.

171
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,258
It's a model of his
planned Fuhrer Museum,

172
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,015
to be built in his hometown
of Linz in Austria.

- It'd be one of the biggest in the world.

Exactly right.

176

We already know he's stealing art from
Amsterdam, Warsaw, and from Paris.

177
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,317
The French are hiding it, the
Germans are finding and taking it.

178
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,027
This is why Hitler
didn't bomb Paris.

179
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,858
He bombed London.

180

JEFFRIES: No. That's the point.

183
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,085
They're stealing the art
and hiding it somewhere.

184
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,214
We think they're hiding it in homes
in this area and towards the east.

Our boys are in Normandy
giving them hell,

- Soon.
- We're gonna start with James.

189

He has a friend in Paris,
director of the National Museum.

190
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,853
- If he's still alive.
- If he's alive, he'll have some idea

191
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,486

We need that information.

the Channel to Deauville.
