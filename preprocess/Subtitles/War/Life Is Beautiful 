1
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,028
This is a simple story...

2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,674
but not an easy one to tell.

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,677
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,429
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,238
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,998
"Here I am," said I to chaos.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,554
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good."

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,716
"For what?" said I.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,998
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,758
this man came to possess?

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,677
Here I am, ready.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,473
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,910
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,952
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,308
I heard you.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,510
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,471
Weren't you reciting a poem?

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,510
It doesn't work!

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,232
Brake!

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,557
We're going to die!
The woods!

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,716
Brake!

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,959
The king is coming!

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,355
There he is!

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,031
It's full of people down there.
Straight.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,673
We have no brakes!

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,360
We have no brakes! Move!

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,948
Go for a walk.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,196
Otherwise,
we'll get there tomorrow.

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,276
I found the screw.

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,998
Now what do you need?

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,953
Nothing.
I need ten minutes alone.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,719
All right,
I'll leave you alone.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,990
Do you want the screw
from before?

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,236
No, I want to be alone.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,191
Do I toss out the screw
if I find it?

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,198
I need ten minutes alone.

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,471
I'm washing my hands.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,951
Pretty girl! How's it going?

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,638
What are you doing?

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,149
Did your mom put this stuff here?

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,998
No, the landlady did.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,759
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,871
How much is it?
How old are you?

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,310
- What's your name?
- Eleonora.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,556
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,514
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

47
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,437
All this is mine.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,710
Here starts the prince's principate.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,070
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,671
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,836
Camels?

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,076
Even a few hippopotamus.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,236
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,828
- When?
- Now!

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,351
Good morning, Princess!

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,756
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,438
I've never been better.

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,118
Do you always leave
the house like this?

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,959
I wanted to burn that wasps nest,
but I got stung.

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,389
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,794
Hold still, Princess.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,276
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,992
You have to get it out.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,351
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,514
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,074
What a place here!
It's beautiful!

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,033
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moing here!

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,914
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,837
Exactly.

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,997
Prince Guido at your serice, Princess.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,838
I'm coming!

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,916
Goodbye, then.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,350
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,471
If you really want
to thank me...

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,831
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelette for my squire.

76
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,951
Take whatever you want.
It's all yours.

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,274
Thank you!

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,279
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelette.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,392
Goodbye, Eleonora!
My regards, Princess.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,350
Farewell.

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,439
Here I am, Nuolari!
Tonight's special: omelette!

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,471
All camels here!

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,548
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,636
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,832
He's lied in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maitre.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,838
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

87
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,154
There. We're here.

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,436
That's Robin Hood,
my uncle's horse.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,551
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,511
And inside is my uncle.

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,194
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,117
Here we are.
The car broke down!

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,596
Uncle!

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,636
- Barbarians.
- Who were they?

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,910
- Barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Silence is
the most powerful cry.

97
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,517
Is he your poet friend?

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,915
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,636
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,116
An old passion...
an odd and end in itself!

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,470
What's all this stuff for?

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,673
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,872
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,911
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,314
Barbarians.

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,910
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

107
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,476
The bathroom, equipped
with the inention of Mr Bidet.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,309
There are a few books here,
among which The Life of Petrarch.

109
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,230
The kitchen is in there. This is
aelocipede, commonly called a bike.

110
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,399
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,273
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

112
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,159
What an uncle!

113
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,751
Look at this!

114
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,154
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.

115
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,953
If you want to do something,
you do it.

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,469
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,917
Stop it!
What are you, crazy?

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,873
You can't act
like you do in the country.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,436
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!

120
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,278
Mary! The key!

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,077
See? You can't yell.

122
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,795
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,629
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,751
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

125
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,996
You have to settle down!

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,714
What a nice hat.
How does it look?

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,354
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,471
When do I start working?

129
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,795
You're already late.
Right away!

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,480
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,639
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,513
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.

133
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,359
Goodbye,
and behave yourselves...

134
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,869
because these are hard times.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,592
Hard, hard times!

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,551
They're hard times?

137
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,592
Why, what are your
politicaliews?

138
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,792
Benito! Adolph!
Be good!

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,717
What did you say?

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,912
I said, how are things going?

141
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,917
Goodbye, then.

142
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,598
Careful!
You'll break the legs!

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,355
Goodbye!

144
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,432
He pulled it off.
He took my hat. I'll find him though.

145
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,755
Benito,
you're going to get a slap!

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,474
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,875
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,797
Then we'd better
open a file now.

149
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,356
First you apply, and
the department head has to sign it.

150
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,716
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

151
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,752
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.

152
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,598
l, the undersigned,
Guido Orefice...

153
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,439
- Am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!

154
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,596
What's going on?

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,109
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

156
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,152
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr Rodolfo, I told him.

157
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,635
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

158
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,149
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,795
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

160
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,876
It's ten to one.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,353
File a complaint.

162
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,478
Boy, is he nasty.

163
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,036
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,118
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.

165
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,595
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "l, the undersigned..."

166
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,717
What a wallop!

167
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,599
Are you hurt?
I'll help you.

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,312
Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,953
Don't touch me!

170
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,118
You can forget
about your bookshop!

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,309
No, the eggs!

172
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,350
You scoundrel!
I'll kill you!

173
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,838
Out of the way!

174
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,835
Good morning, Princess.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,992
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,714
Excuse me,
but I've got to run.

177
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,308
Farewell, Princess!

178
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,669
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

179
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,473
It's sered whole,
bottom down on the plate.

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,352
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."

181
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,916
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,679
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

184
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,789
Piece of cake, Uncle.

185
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,832
I stick the wing under the leg.

186
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,315
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...

187
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,510
Lobster is a crustacean.

188
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,836
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,909
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

190
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,759
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

191
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,313
There's nothing left.

192
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,159
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

193
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,513
- I don't remember how to do lobster.
- You sere it as is.

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,596
There's no need to touch it!

195
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,915
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,712
- Continue.
- Behaiour!

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,831
Stand by.
Still, like this.

198
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,678
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,109
In position.
Stand by behaiour. Waiter!

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,668
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?

201
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,836
Bowing!
Piece of cake.

202
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,593
You bow down, further.

203
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,508
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,518
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

205
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,438
90 degrees.
A right angle. 180.

206
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,791
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?

207
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,753
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

208
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,314
But if you see some
that are too bowed down...

209
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,953
it means they're dead!

210
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,355
You're sering.
You're not a serant.

211
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,550
Sering is a supreme art.

212
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,035
God is the first serant.

213
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,197
God seres men,
but he's not a serant to men.

214
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,233
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

215
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,518
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,511
You'll take it back
in a month or so.

217
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,393
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?

218
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,119
Why?

219
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,150
Ferruccio? Ferruccio?

220
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,757
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

221
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,110
Of course I was.

222
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
You fell asleep
while talking to me!

223
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,310
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

224
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,112
Who?

225
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,676
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

226
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,597
"I am what I want to be."

227
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,712
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

228
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,990
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.

229
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,237
Amazing.
And it's simple too.

230
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,432
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

231
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,434
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

232
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,791
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

233
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,751
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

234
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,557
Amazing, though.

235
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,872
Wake up.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,468
Wake up.

237
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,317
What is it now?
What are you doing?

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,556
- It totally works!
- What works?

239
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,514
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."

240
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,791
Bam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

241
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,275
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

242
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,073
That's why I woke up.

243
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,397
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

244
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,951
It's deep.
You have to think it.

245
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,237
Why are you running?
Slow down!

246
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,719
Hurry up. It's late!

247
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,833
Mary, the key!

248
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,758
Every morning,
she throws the key.

249
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,154
Look!

250
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,953
There's that teacher.
Boy, is she pretty.

251
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,231
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

252
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,272
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

253
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,674
Don't move!

254
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,759
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

255
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,030
He'll kill me if he sees me.
Be good.

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,230
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

257
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,316
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

258
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,796
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.

259
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,230
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!

260
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,079
Don't move.
He'll kill me if he sees me!

261
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,553
Stay still, Ferruccio.

262
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,509
Good morning, Princess!

263
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,237
It's you again.
How do you do this?

264
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,796
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.

265
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,037
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?

266
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,118
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

267
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,391
We could make plans to meet.

268
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,909
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

269
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,553
Let's go, Dora.
You'll be late.

270
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,269
I hope we meet again
suddenly.

271
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,437
Farewell, Princess!

272
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,596
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

273
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,915
She likes it
when I suddenly appear.

274
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,069
I don't believe it.

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,475
"Obscurity."

276
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,158
You're a genius!

277
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,113
"The bigger it is,
the less you see it."

278
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,832
Solution: obscurity.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,520
Marellous.
Did you make that riddle up?

280
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,077
No, but you soled it in fie minutes.
It took me eight days.

281
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,758
Obscurity!

282
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,519
Salmon, salad
and a glass of white wine.

283
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,710
Listen to this one, Guido.

284
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,672
If I may, it's my turn.

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,756
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.

286
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,348
"The dwares and Snow White
sit down for a bite.

287
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,758
How fast can you guess
what she seres her guests next?"

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,190
It sounds refined.

289
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,311
I want to sole it right now.

290
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,637
- Eat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

291
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,796
Salad, salmon, white wine.
It's light.

292
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,717
The dwares...

293
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,678
and Snow White.

294
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,517
- Guido?
- Si?

295
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,913
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?

296
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,998
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the Ministry. He wants to eat.

297
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,633
The kitchen is closed.

298
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,115
Oh, well, he would have
gien you a good tip.

299
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,037
The kitchen is open.

300
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,279
Come right in.

301
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,637
- Prego.
- Grazie.

302
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,235
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

303
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,398
- "The dwares and Snow White..."
- Buona sera.

304
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,790
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

305
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,391
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

306
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,273
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heay steak...

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,597
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded lier.

308
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,029
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

309
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,357
We have...
a nice fatty turbot...

310
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,552
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...

311
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,318
or some lean salmon...

312
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,670
The salmon, thank you.

313
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,234
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

314
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,233
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...

315
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,830
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter
with a flaky sauce...

316
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,556
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

317
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,276
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

318
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,868
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

319
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,355
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.

320
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,630
Perfect.
As soon as possible.

321
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,557
I'll do my best.

322
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,072
Prego.

323
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,714
"How fast can you guess
what she seres her guests next?"

324
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,034
Right.

325
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,994
- "The dwares and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

326
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,156
Good night, genius.

327
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,755
What did he say? The dwares?
What is he, drunk?

328
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,518
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."

329
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,112
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwares and Snow White."

330
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,356
If there are seen dwares dining...

331
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,710
and she seres seconds,
that means "seven seconds."

332
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,391
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

333
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,592
But he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep oer them.

334
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,955
Excuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.

335
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,757
The elementary school? A friend
of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.

336
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,075
It's not far from here. Why?

337
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,509
Good. I can sleep
an extra half hour.

338
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,916
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,678
They're expecting me at 8:30.

340
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,033
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,072
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.

342
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,191
I want to make
a good impression on him.

343
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,790
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.

344
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,992
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country.

345
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,635
The inspector is here, ma'am.

346
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,274
He's already here?
He's early!

347
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,913
Sit down, Roberto!

348
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,669
All rise!

349
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,551
Good morning, Princess.

350
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,916
Good morning, Mr Inspector.
I'm the principal.

351
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,156
These are some of our teachers.

352
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,999
Good.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,519
Therefore...

354
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,836
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

355
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,279
Sixteen.

356
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,193
Are you up to date
with the ongoing...

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,356
school programme approed
by the Ministry this year?

358
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,799
Yes.

359
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,679
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

360
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,597
Of course.

361
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,990
What are you doing on Sunday?

362
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,671
No, I mean, Sunday is St Mary's Day.
What are you doing?

363
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,030
I'm going to the theatre.

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,230
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

365
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,316
Right,
they're playing Offenbach.

366
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,557
Fine. Well...

367
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,313
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...

368
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,839
We know.

369
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,110
As you know, the inspector...

370
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,879
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

371
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,231
signed by the most wellersed
Italian scientists.

372
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,397
He will, and we're very honoured...

373
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,829
demonstrate to us that our race...

374
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,757
is a superior race...

375
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,950
the best of all.

376
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,798
Take your seats.

377
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,068
Go ahead, Inspector.

378
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,760
- Our race...
- Is superior.

379
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,199
Naturally!

380
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,396
Our race is superior.

381
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,910
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

382
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,191
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

383
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,117
that our race
is a superior one.

384
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,992
I was...

385
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,113
chosen, I was,
by racist Italian scientists...

386
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,037
in order to demonstrate...

387
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,674
how superior our race is.

388
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,349
Why did they pick me, children?

389
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,355
Must I tell you?

390
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,797
Where can you find...

391
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,912
someone more handsome than me?

392
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,749
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race"...

393
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,199
pure Aryan.

394
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,992
Children.

395
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,953
Let's start with something that
one says: "What's so big about that?"

396
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,358
The ear. Look at
the perfection of this ear.

397
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,869
Left auricle...

398
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,434
with a pendant
little bell at the end.

399
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,313
Check it out.
Moable cartilage.

400
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,953
Bendable.

401
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,799
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

402
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,595
But you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

403
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,553
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!

404
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,672
But let's continue.
I want to show you something else.

405
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,392
Pay attention.

406
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,631
He said Inspector?

407
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,591
From Rome?

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,913
The belly button!

409
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,077
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!

410
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,350
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

411
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,233
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

412
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,193
This is an Italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

413
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,231
Check out this style!

414
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,956
Look at these muscles:
ceps, biceps, triceps!

415
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,878
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

416
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,913
Just look at the movement!

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,155
Gentlemen!

418
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,397
I must say goodbye now.

419
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,398
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

420
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,080
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

421
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,918
Farewell!
The belly button!

422
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,073
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

423
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,431
I can only hear
out of this ear.

424
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,312
Look at me, Princess.

425
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,237
Go on, I'm down here.

426
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,714
Look at me, Princess.

427
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,640
Turn around, Princess.

428
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,275
Turn around, around...

429
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,197
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

430
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,435
Why?

431
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,553
We have to be at the Prefect's at eight.
We were inited to dinner.

432
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,352
- Where?
- At the Prefect's.

433
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,154
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

434
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,238
- Another dinner at the Prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

435
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,679
Bingo!

436
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,237
Let's us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the Prefect's for coffee.

437
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,316
I'm not coming!

438
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,874
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,116
It'll just be me and you.

440
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,392
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr Prefect.

441
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,068
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

442
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,997
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

443
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,435
Where is she?
Did you see her?

444
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,790
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

445
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,834
On time tomorrow, got it?

446
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,235
Did you take that stuff
out of the car?

447
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,828
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Be very careful.

448
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,955
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!

449
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,073
Is that one of your curtains?

450
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,112
No, it must be
one of my colleague's.

451
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,511
He took my hat again!

452
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,670
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

453
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,360
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

454
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,710
All right, you wait here.

455
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,037
I'll pull up right here and toot.

456
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,236
Gie me the key!

457
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,396
Not the house key!
The car key!

458
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,996
The car key?
Are you crazy?

459
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,634
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.

460
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,115
Keep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

461
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,310
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!

462
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,115
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.

463
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,993
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

464
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,954
Plus, dinner at the Prefect's
gets me so nerous!

465
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,709
I knew it. I've got the hiccups.

466
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,799
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.

467
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,832
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

468
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,554
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Even two!

469
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,990
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens.

470
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,236
Instead you...

471
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,117
Good morning, Princess!

472
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,633
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

473
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,479
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!

474
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,398
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.

475
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,273
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.

476
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,075
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

477
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,350
You even turn up in my dreams.

478
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,076
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

479
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,997
I don't blame you, but...

480
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,430
All right. At this point,
I gie in. You win.

481
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,518
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

482
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,632
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theatre. Take me back.

483
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,954
What's happening?

484
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,675
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?

485
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,631
Step on the brakes!

486
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,954
Have no fear!
Hang on to me!

487
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,877
It's broken!

488
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,911
When did you learn to drie?

489
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,315
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

490
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,318
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

491
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,079
Wait! We're stuck!

492
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,668
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

493
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,836
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.

494
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,951
Coer yourself with this.

495
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,036
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.

496
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,315
I'll take care of everything.

497
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,797
Here we go.

498
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,035
Step right out, Princess.

499
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,911
There!
Step right out!

500
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,990
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

501
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,279
Here!

502
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,677
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

503
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,553
We've already been here.

504
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,150
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

505
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,952
The night it was raining...

506
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,389
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!

507
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,354
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...

508
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,950
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...

509
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,229
you kissed me.

510
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,276
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

511
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,789
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

512
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,718
He had the ability
to make me do anything.

513
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,115
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

514
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,231
I was like putty in his hand.

515
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
I always, always, always said yes.

516
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,913
So, all these treasures
you're hiding...

517
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,591
there is a way to open this treasure
chest and always get you to say yes!

518
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,836
It's easier than you think.

519
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,269
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

520
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,709
Heaven knows.

521
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,512
It's clearing up.

522
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,029
So, you were saying...

523
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,516
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.

524
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,709
Yes.

525
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,956
I'll gie it a try.

526
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,471
If the Virgin Mary tosses
it down to me... You never know.

527
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,511
Mary, the key!

528
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,032
Is this it?

529
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,038
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

530
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,991
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

531
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,395
- Then when?
- I don't know.

532
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,353
Are we going to let heaven
decide that too?

533
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,234
No, leave Mary alone.
Don't bother her oer an ice cream!

534
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,875
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

535
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,468
I have to ask her.

536
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,591
Mary, send someone to find out...

537
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,359
how long before
we can have the ice cream!

538
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,637
Seven seconds!

539
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,553
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

540
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,591
I've always asked myself:
Who lies there?

541
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,995
I wanted to open
my store right out front.

542
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,759
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

543
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,393
Goodbye then.

544
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,796
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

545
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,115
I forgot to tell you.

546
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,839
Go ahead.

547
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,679
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making loe to you.

548
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,952
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

549
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,991
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.

550
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,033
- Say what?
- That I want to make loe to you.

551
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,276
Not just once.
Oer and oer again!

552
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,992
But I'll never tell you that.

553
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,556
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make loe to you now...

554
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,477
right here,
for the rest of my life.

555
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,395
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

556
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,272
Princess.

557
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,078
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

558
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,839
It's that hat that bothers me.

559
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,236
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

560
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,750
How did it go?
Right, it's easy!

561
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,668
Mary, send someone
to gie my friend a dry hat.

562
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,836
Good night, Princess.
Farewell.

563
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,191
- Excuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

564
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,679
If you don't get up
immediately...

565
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,554
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.

566
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,238
For the rest of my life!

567
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,437
I'm going to count
to three now.

568
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,835
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

569
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,318
Uno, due...

570
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,874
tre.

571
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,396
Good girl.

572
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,795
Do you know
who's getting married?

573
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,718
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

574
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,196
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

575
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,356
But she hasn't even
shown up yet.

576
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,550
Everybody's waiting.

577
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,716
I've looked everywhere for you!

578
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,876
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

579
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,877
Something's happened.
Come with me!

580
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,797
Outside! The horse!

581
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,390
What's that?

582
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,511
Is that your horse?

583
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,154
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

584
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,158
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

585
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,353
The usual barbarians, andals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

586
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,754
"Jewish horse"!

587
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,919
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...

588
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,873
They didn't do it "to."
They did it "to."

589
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,150
You'll have to get
used to it, Guido.

590
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,874
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

591
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,195
What could possibly happen to me?

592
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,880
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

593
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,991
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

594
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,157
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.

595
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,589
Let's go. I'll clean him up
in the morning.

596
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,517
Take him back to the stall.

597
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,509
Look, there, in front of you!

598
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,234
Dora.

599
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,917
Wait. I'll surprise her.

600
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,309
Dora. Dora.

601
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,632
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Gioanardi.

602
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,793
- Guido!
- Hey!

603
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,557
Doctor Lessing!
Where are you going?

604
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,593
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Berlin immediately.

605
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,433
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

606
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,118
I'll take just one.

607
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,396
I'll take it to my wife:
Guido's flower.

608
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,519
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

609
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,437
You're the most ingenious...

610
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,074
waiter I've ever come across.

611
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,237
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever sered.

612
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,918
Thank you.

613
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,837
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

614
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,757
By the way.

615
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,473
"If you say my name...

616
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,989
I'm not there any more.
Who am I?"

617
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,833
If you say my name,
I'm not there any more.

618
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,957
What is it?
What did he say?

619
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,438
"Silence!"

620
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,758
Beautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there any more. Silence.

621
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,555
I'm not talking about Berlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

622
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,438
Third grade.
Listen to this problem.

623
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,313
I remember it
because it shocked me.

624
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,432
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.

625
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,710
A cripple,
four and a half marks.

626
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,479
An epileptic,
three marks and a half.

627
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,910
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

628
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,316
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

629
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,079
if these indiiduals
were eliminated?

630
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,475
I can't believe this!

631
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,114
That was my exact reaction.

632
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,198
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...

633
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,151
has to sole
this kind of equation.

634
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,239
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

635
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,510
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.

636
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,437
That's high school material for us.

637
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,473
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

638
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,357
300,000 times four.

639
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,597
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.

640
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,188
- It's easy!
- Exactly!

641
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,552
But you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!

642
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,477
It's truly another race.

643
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,069
"Good morning, Princess."

644
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,798
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

645
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,433
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!

646
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,391
Let's dance.

647
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,632
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

648
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,751
and you've known
for several years.

649
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,872
Dora and I were born
on the same street.

650
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,673
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

651
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,838
Dora is the woman of my life...

652
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,191
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...

653
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,834
we've decided to get married
within the year.

654
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,679
You're all officially inited
on April the 9th...

655
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,314
to the Basilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

656
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,558
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...

657
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,831
Just as happy as we are now.

658
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,469
Kiss her! Kiss her!

659
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,236
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

660
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,237
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

661
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,669
Who put this armchair here?

662
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,194
Are you all right?

663
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,276
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

664
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,391
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...

665
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,636
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

666
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,716
Go back to your table.

667
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,637
Go on. I can do this.

668
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,229
- Guido.
- Si?

669
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,157
Are you all right?

670
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,990
Fine! Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?

671
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,839
No, nothing is wrong.

672
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,838
But...
Go to the kitchen.

673
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,512
- Guido!
- Si?

674
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,389
The kitchen.

675
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,715
They moved everything
around tonight.

676
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,876
Look where they put the kitchen.

677
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,560
Peekaboo!
Guess who?

678
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,870
It's me!
What, have you gone soft?

679
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,269
Miss.

680
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,039
We finally meet, Dora.

681
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,392
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

682
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,069
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel any more!

683
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,351
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

684
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,311
You sly old dog!

685
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,039
What a jolly fellow!

686
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,352
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

687
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,357
I apologize.

688
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,472
Princess!

689
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,397
You're here too?

690
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,677
Take me away.

691
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,635
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

692
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,389
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.

693
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,909
The Ethiopian cake!

694
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,679
Thank you! Music, maestro!

695
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,035
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

696
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,118
Right this way, Princess.

697
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,793
But you're...

698
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,599
Quickly, Princess.

699
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,999
But he's...

700
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,317
He's that jerk with the eggs!

701
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,552
Dora!

702
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,999
Ferruccio!

703
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,192
He's got the keys to the house,
darn it all!

704
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,998
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.

705
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,271
I'm a whiz with wire.
My pop taught me.

706
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,597
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.

707
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,558
I opened it.

708
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,799
Joshua!

709
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,435
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

710
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,996
I lost my tank.

711
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,350
Don't worry.
We'll find it.

712
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,914
Where did you leave the tank?

713
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,235
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

714
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,828
Hold the bicycle.
I'll get it.

715
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,159
Here.

716
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,468
Let's go.

717
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,438
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

718
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,154
You're late for school! Go!

719
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,714
There's a horse! Two horses!

720
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,590
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driing me mad!

721
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,110
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!

722
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,037
Stop it! Let me off!

723
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,393
Here we are.

724
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,033
See you tonight.

725
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,471
Ciao, Dora. Ciao.

726
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,637
Go fast, Pop!

727
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,195
Uno, due, tre!

728
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,317
Can we buy this for Mommy?

729
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,318
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

730
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,671
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

731
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,358
Let's go, Joshua.

732
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,710
"No Jews or dogs...

733
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,559
allowed."

734
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,358
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?

735
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,789
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

736
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,036
Everybody does what they want to.

737
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,116
There's a hardware store there.

738
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,038
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

739
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,957
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

740
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,311
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.

741
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,432
I said, "May we?", "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

742
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,551
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

743
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,194
We let everybody
into our bookshop.

744
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,117
No. From now on,
we'll write it too.

745
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,595
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

746
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,075
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

747
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,953
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

748
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,878
I'm sick and tired
of these Visigoths.

749
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,479
Good morning.

750
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,636
Everything's half price.

751
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,797
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

752
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,310
- You have to come to the Prefect's.
- Again?

753
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,351
- He already went.
- Let's go.

754
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,435
Why?

755
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,954
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

756
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,354
All right.

757
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,118
- I'm coming too.
- No.

758
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,515
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?
