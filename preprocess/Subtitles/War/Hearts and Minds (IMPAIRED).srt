00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,471
It's an international,
criminal conspiracy.

156
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,409
Before we know it, we're gonna
turn our backs around someday,

157
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,538
the whole United States, we're gonna
turn around and see nothing but V.C.--

158
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,617
or not V.C., but communism--we're gonna
turn around and say, ''What happened?''

159
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,243
People just walking in
with riots, drugs, you name it.

160
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,379
They're tearing us down
from the inside out.

161
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,086
In 1917, when the communists
overthrew the Russian government,

162
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:47,325
there was 1 communist
for every 2,277 persons...

163
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,333
in Russia.

164
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,233
In the United States today,
there is one communist...

165
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,298
for every 1 ,81 4 persons
in this country.

166
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,869
If we lose Indochina, Mr.Jenkins,
we will lose the Pacific,

167
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,473
and we'll be an island
in a communist sea.

168
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,951
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.

169
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,724
I swear that I am not now...

170
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,693
or ever have been a member
of the communist party.

171
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,264
Feel better?

172
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,758
Of course, when it gets down
to communism, uh,

173
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,701
I've been fighting communism
since 1 951 , actually.

174
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,706
I was looked at, you know,
the American fighting man,

175
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,708
as being, uh, you know,

176
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,577
like a warrior of sorts,
you know, due to my background,

177
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,581
the way my mother
brought me up.

178
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,175
She always spoke of
the warrior societies of our tribe...

179
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,450
and of the different tribes around us
and how that these men...

180
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,425
always had to work to gain the respect
of the people around them...

181
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,987
and how they had to live, uh,
more or less a life dictated to them...

182
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,727
by the society that they belonged to,
and it was extremely hard.

183
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,138
I-I looked around and from listening
to my uncles and a lot of my relations--

184
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,142
they had been in the Marine Corps--
and they always told me that...

185
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,180
the Marine Corps was the hardest service
to cope with physically and mentally.

186
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,114
And I naturally wanted to be
the best at that time,

187
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,551
and I looked at the Marine Corps
as being the elite of the elite,

188
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,020
the warrior society
in the United States.

189
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,890
Now it might sound cliché-ish
to say that,

190
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,293
''My country,
may it always be right,

191
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,422
but right or wrong,
my country.''

192
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,559
But that's how
I felt back in '67.

193
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,331
And during my senior year,

194
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,739
I said I've got
an obligation to serve.

195
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,209
I've got to fulfill it.

196
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:44,408
There's no reason physically
why I would be exempted,

197
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,952
and therefore,
I'm gonna enlist.

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,212
- What you got there?
- Picture.

199
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,213

How much picture?

200
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:20,115
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.

201
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,552
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1 ,500.

202
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,114
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.

203
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,093
-You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.

<i>From my home</i>

227
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:16,491
We thought of ourselves, I think,
as trying to defeat communists.

228
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:21,301
Defeat--Accepting a view of, uh--
the Walt Rostow kind of view--

229
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,035
of covert aggression
of some kind.

230
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,941
The kind of view that enabled you
to think of the conflict...

231
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,014
<i>in, really, World War II terms.</i>

232
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,014
<i>That was an unquestioned assumption.</i>

233
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,516
It had an idealistic flavor to it,

234
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,453
but it was the underpinning of
an imperial policy, basically.

235
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,423
I shared the assumption,
very easily,

236
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,790
and felt it as an idealistic one really.

237
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,795
We were doing something for them.

238
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,594
I recall that I was in the New York area
at the time,

239
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,100
and I stopped by
to see General MacArthur,

240
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,229
who I had known for several years.

241
00:17:55,874 --> 00:18:00,243
Uh, when he greeted me, he made, uh,
quite a prophetic statement.

242
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,415
He said, ''Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job.''

243
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,945
He said, ''I hope you appreciate
that this new assignment...

244
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,590
is filled with opportunities,
but fraught with hazards.''

245
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,598
And indeed, uh,
this was a prophetic statement.

246
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,521
It can be described much like, uh...

247
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,957
a-a-a singer doing an aria...

248
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,724
that's totally into what he's doing,
you know, totally feeling it.

249
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,561
He knows the aria,
and he's experiencing the aria.

250
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,127
And he knows his limits, and he knows
whether he's doing it and doing it well.

251
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,639
Flying an aircraft
can be a great deal like that.

252
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,641
What's a race driver feel like?

253
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,541
Why does a guy want to drive
in the Indianapolis 500?

254
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,012
I guess, perhaps, the risk of dying,

255
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,345
being killed is part of it
that makes it thrilling.

256
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,618
<i>[ Floyd ] I can tell when the aircraft</i>
<i>feels right, when it's about to stall.</i>

257
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,355
<i>I can tell when I can't</i>
<i>pull another fraction of a pound...</i>

258
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,955
<i>or the airplane will stall,</i>
<i>flip out and spin on me.</i>

259
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,092
I would follow a pathway on something
like a TV screen in front of me...

260
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,637
that would direct me
right, left or center--

261
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,867
follow the steering,
keep the steering symbol, uh, centered.

262
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,433
I'd see a little attack light
when we'd stepped into attack.

263
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,447
I could pull the ''commit'' switch
on my stick,

264
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,517
and the computer took over.

265
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,314
A computer figured out the ballistics,
the airspeed, the slant range...

266
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,480
<i>and dropped the bombs</i>
<i>when we got to the appropriate point,</i>

267
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,683
<i>in whichever kind of attack</i>
<i>we'd selected,</i>

268
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,922
<i>whether it was flying straight and level</i>
<i>or tossing our bombs out.</i>

269
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,727
So it was very much of
a technical expertise thing.

270
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,996
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,

271
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,333
I had a lot of pride
in my ability to fly.

272
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,037
You're up there
doing something that, uh,

273
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:19,709
mankind has only dreamed of; the flying,
especially at night, in an aircraft.

274
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,276
The A-6 is one of the few
that can really do it the way we did it.

275
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,119
Um, a World War II aviator would not
even dream of doing the things we did.

276
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,194
It's definitely
the ultimate in aviation.

277
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,977
Almost everybody
has blown off firecrackers.

278

<i>see something explode as a child,</i>

<i>or even as an adult almost.</i>

280
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,384
You put something in the can
and watch the can blow up in the air.

281
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,354
<i>And the excitement,</i>
<i>the sense of excitement,</i>

282
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,454
<i>especially if you're getting shot at,</i>
<i>is just incredible.</i>

283
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,998
You get there, have a real good mission,
hit your target,

284
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,663
find out later your target
was totally destroyed,

285
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,105
that it wasn't one of these misses
or almost, you got it.

286
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:22,078
And come back and make a night carrier
landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.

287
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,308
To say it's thrilling,
yes, it's deeply satisfying.

and just sprung out of the hole.

And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.

592

with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.

- If you ever have to go to a war,

690
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:46,509
and unfortunately, someday
you probably will have to fight a war,

you'll find out
that life becomes very simple.

692
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,554
Because the only thing you're
concerned about is living and dying.

693
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,253
Everything else is unimportant,

694
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,661
because suddenly
your life is at stake.

695
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:06,065
And that's what it's like to be
when you become a prisoner,

696
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,330
particularly,
a prisoner of war.

697
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,669
<i>Because the thing that got us through</i>
<i>were the things we learned...</i>

<i>before we were ten years old.</i>

699
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,175
<i>I'd like to open up</i>
<i>to questions now.</i>

when the war was over?

704
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,791
I felt real good.
Real good.

705
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,424
It was a long war
and a very difficult war to understand.

706
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:41,595
But the reason we went there
was to win this war.

707
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,106
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.

708
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,302
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.

709
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,846
That's what we really wanted,
was to win this war.

710
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:54,439
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won,

711

<i>it was very pretty.</i>

714
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,924
<i>Uh, the people over there</i>
<i>are very backward and very primitive.</i>

715
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,261

How did you--
How did you, um--

717
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,906
What do you feel about
the people that, um,

718
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,999
went and burned their draft cards
and went into Canada?

719
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,409
We don't agree with them.
I think these people were legally wrong.

720
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,539
I think sometimes they were cowards.

721
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,142
If they wanted to leave
and go to Canada, that's okay.

722
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,188
<i>But they can't come back, though,</i>
<i>because they have disagreed.</i>

723
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,418
<i>They say, ''We don't like your country,</i>
<i>we don't like your people. ''</i>

724
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,426
They're saying that
to you and me.

725
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,428
''I don't like you, so I'm leaving.''

726
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,523
Well, fine, that's okay. There's
no reason to hate a guy for that.

'Cause that's also his right,
but he can't come back.

00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:56,908
I saw that we were party to their
deliberate and systematic destruction.

730
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:02,417
The Vietnamese were considered,
less than humans, inferiors.

731
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,818
We called them ''gooks,'' ''slopes.''

732
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:09,483
Their lives weren't worth anything to us
because we'd been taught to believe...

733
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,687
that they were all fanatical
and that they were all V.C...

734
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,492
<i>or V.C. sympathizers,</i>
<i>even the children.</i>

735
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,499
Many of us, however,
began to understand...

736
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,126
through our personal
experiences in Vietnam...

737
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,832
the depth of the lies and deceptions
practiced upon us,

738
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,432
and the American people,
by our country's leaders.

739
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,707
It was they who trained us
to kill without question...

740
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,908
and to hate our enemy--
the Vietnamese.

741
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:38,454
They concocted such phrases
as ''kill ratios,'' ''search and destroy,''

742
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:42,582
''free fire zones,''
''secure areas,'' and so on...

743
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:47,720
to mask the reality
of their combat policy in Vietnam.

744
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,698
<i>I make no apology</i>
<i>for this act of resistance.</i>

745
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,530
<i>I could do nothing else</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

746
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,572
But underground life
has become intolerable to me.

747
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:02,111
So I'm here today to draw attention
to the true facts concerning my case...

748
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:06,012
and the cases of tens of thousands
just like me.

749
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,415
We are not criminals
to be hunted and imprisoned.

750
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:15,048
Over a half million of us
have deserted the military since 1 965.

751
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,558
Most of us have already returned
to the military...

752
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,152
to be punished with jail
and bad discharges...

753
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,426
that will be carried around
for the rest of our lives.

754
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,902
And it is a supreme irony
to be prosecuted by the very same men...

755
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,065
who planned and executed
a genocidal war in Indochina.

756
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:36,077
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.

757
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:40,115
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth
underground existence...

758
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,448
that still nags at many
of his fellow deserters...

over their shoulders.

<i>''How long do you think that</i>

916
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:27,194
''Uh, do you think that
the 206,000 men will be enough?''

917
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,196
Nobody knew.

918
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:33,291
''Uh, might we have to send more men?''
''Well, possibly.''

919
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,302
''Well, in six months?''
''We don't know.''

01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,065
''Ayear? Eighteen months?''

By the end of that
four-day interrogation,

923
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,747
I was getting down--by the end of it--
into very serious questions,

924
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:53,152
''Do any of you men,
as you look at it objectively,

925
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:58,660
do you find any diminution
in the will of the enemy to fight?''

926
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,991
Well, they said,
''No, we guess we don't.''

927
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:04,498
''Are they sending the same number of men
down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?''

928
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,502
''Well, yes, and even
they might be a little more.''

929
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:13,507
''And how about our bombing? We've placed
great reliance on our bombing.

930
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,907
Is our bombing stopping them?''
''No.''

931
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,448
''Well, what is the amount of attrition
that our bombing's causing?''

932
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,779
''Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent.''

933
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:25,183
So I remember
asking one question.

934
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:30,590
''If a North Vietnamese field commander
in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men--''

935
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,593
They said, ''Yes.''

936
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:36,324
''If he asked for, say, 1,200 men,

937
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,332
1,000 would get through?''

938
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,334
''Well, that's right.''

939
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,872
''Then he'd have the thousand he needed.''
''Well, yes. That's so.''

940
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,874
Well, this type of interrogation--

941
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,206

had been predicting victory in Vietnam.

1009
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,258
In 1961 and in 1962,

as we have shown in Vietnam.

1021
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,737
I had just given the policy line,

1022
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:13,296
stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman,

1023
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,309
helping on a speech
for Robert Kennedy...

1024
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:19,040
which proved to be his last speech
given in San Francisco here...

1025
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,311
to a businessman's luncheon on Vietnam.

1026
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:26,718
Uh, I went up with some corrections
last thing in the morning...

1027
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:30,155
and shook hands with him
in his bathrobe as he stood there.

1028
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:33,820
And then he came down from
the Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.

1029
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:38,161
We were struck with how easy
it was to get onto that floor...

1030
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,167
and approach him at that point.

1031
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,237
At the conference
on lessons on Vietnam,

1032
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:45,569
of course, in the morning I learned
that Robert Kennedy had died.

1033
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,241

I got a colonel that's flying upstairs,
and he's gettin' down on me...

1058
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:18,321
and he's saying, ''Take the hill,
take the hill, take the hill.''

1059
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,487
So I got together
with the tank commander...

1060
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,827
and I said,
''Look, let's take three tanks...

1061
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,833
and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.

and says, ''Let's fly.''

1064
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,510
So I popped up
behind the lead tank...

1065
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:39,137
and, uh, started to go up the hill.

And everything was cool,
until we started taking fire.

And, uh, the A.R.V.N. started to split.

the Marine Corps drill team there.

and they were playing
the ''Marine Corps Hymn''.

1101
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,618
And then they played
the ''Star-Spangled Banner.''

1102
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,919
And I actually started to cry.

1103
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:37,058
I cried because I was so proud
to be an American, you know?

the reasons for our invasion
of Cambodia and of Laos,
