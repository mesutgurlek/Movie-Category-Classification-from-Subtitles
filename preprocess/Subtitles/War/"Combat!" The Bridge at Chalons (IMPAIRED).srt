1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,630
Okay. Saddle up.  We're moving out.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,030
Sarge, it's not even right. 
 We just got here Sarge.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,250
But Sarge. I just washed. You said 
 rest and recreation  were coming up.

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,200
Yeah. Well, I talk too much. 
 We're going on a hike.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,970
Kraut pontoon bridge. A couple engineers
  gonna blow it up, and we're their escorts.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,730
Nelson: Where is this bridge Sarge. 
 Sgt: A town called Chalons.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,000
What? Are they kidding? 
 Chalons is 4 miles behind the German lines.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,600
Why don't they bomb it?

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,170
I don't know. Weather's got 'em 
 socked in. The planes are grounded.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,770
Let's wait. Maybe it'll clear up.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,110
Sergeant. This is the engineer personnel. 
 Sgt. Turk, Corporal McQuillan.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,110
Sergeant Sanders. 
 Hi.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,080
They told me I'd have a platoon.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,370
Well. You were told wrong. 
 A squad is all we can spare.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,220
Saunders. You'll be responsible 
 for getting these men in and out.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,370
Sergeant Turk will be in charge 
 at the bridge. Any questions?

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
Oh,Yeah. I got a question. How do I get 100 lbs of 
 high explosive to that bridge and get out without 
 being picked off by the krauts with this outfit.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,860
Those are your orders Sergeant. 
 Now a truck will take you as close
 to the lines as they can get.

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,020
Good luck.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,570
We'll get you to that bridge.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,840
Or die trying.

22
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,130
Everything.

23
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,750
Take off.

24
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,770
Hey. Take it easy will you Caje. 
  I'm sorry.

25
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,770
This isn't k-rations you know.

26
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,370
Boy. It sure makes me nervous, 
 slinging this stuff. What happens 
 if you get hit carrying it?

27
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,310
It can't go off. You can shoot right 
 into it and nothing could happen.

28
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,950
He's right. Only don't try it. It's a 
 detonator would set it off, a cap.

29
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,640
They'll go off if they're hit. 
But we'll be carrying them. 
 Works like this.

30
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,680
Forget it McQuillan. You'll get your 
 chance to shine at the bridge.

31
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,040
The only thing they have to 
 know about composition C is

32
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,150
how to carry it.

33
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,370
Alright everybody. Gather around here, huh.

34
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,510
Here's where we are right now.

35
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,350
This is the river and this is the bridge at 
 Chalons. We can expect outpost lines here 
 and enemy patrols all the way to the river.

36
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,400
Now we're not looking for a fight. 
 Our mission is to get to the bridge.

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,110
We're gonna go in here. 
 What's so special about this bridge?

38
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,110
How long you been in the war kid?

39
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,220
I came in at Normandy.

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,220
Then start acting like it eh.

41
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,620
By blowing up that bridge we're 
 gonna cut off the German retreat.

42
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,200
Tanks, trucks, guns, so we don't have to fight 
 them all over again on the other side of the river.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,020
Are the krauts at the bridge yet.

44
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,020
No but they're pulling back fast.

45
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,020
Any more questions?

46
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,750
Caje. Take the point.

47
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,020
Alright.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,170
You follow in the middle right behind Nelson here.

49
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,460
Turk and Shelby, just follow my lead.

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,170
Say, Sergeant. I been thinking. A guy  sure 
has to know what he's doing when 
 he's playing around with explosives.

51
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,170
You know, I got some experience with explosives.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,930
Not with composition C. 
 We used to use dynamite.

53
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,420
Lj: Back home on the farm I used 
 to help my dad blow stumps. 
Turk:  Is that right.

54
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,620
Yeah. But listen Sarge. What I really 
 wanted to say is I know more about

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,680
Get away from me.

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,930
But I thought when we got to the bridge I could..

57
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,600
Lookit, stump blower. If and when we get to 
that  bridge I don't want you anywhere 
 around me. Do you understand that?

58
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,930
Now, get back in the file where you belong.

59
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,640
We'll go behind along 
 the face of the slope.

60
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,930
Alright.

61
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,770
Kraut outpost.

62
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,280
We'll slip up the hill behind them. pass the word.

63
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,460
Es war nur ein Hase.

64
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,970
Are you trying to foul up this mission.

65
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,930
It was a loose rock. 
 I couldn't help it.

66
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,820
You got loose brains. 
 A guy with clumsy feet don't belong out here.

67
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Alright. Hold it.

68
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,200
What happened back there was an accident. 
  It could happen to you, me or anybody else.

69
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,600
From now on you have any complaints 
 against  the men in this squad, 
you make them through me.

70
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,910
I'll do that.

71
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,350
Is Turk always that touchy.

72
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,060
He's one of the best demolition 
 men this army's got.

73
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,840
He's just worried you won't be 
 able to get us to that bridge.

74
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,460
Okay. Let's move.

75
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,840
(small engine noise approaching)

76
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,680
Comm mal her.

77
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,130
Was ist es?

78
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,620
Sprengkapseln Eimers.

79
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
Amerikaner Sprengkapseln und Eimers.

80
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,400
Wie ist es hier? 
 Ich weiß nicht.

81
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,110
(German)

82
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,800
Doc.

83
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,020
Littlejohn's hit.

84
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,080
Drag them off to the side. Hide 
 them in the trees. Their bikes too.

85
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Turk's responsible for this. 
He fired the first shot.

86
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,220
Well. What you gonna say now. This wouldn't 
 have happened if you hadn't fired too soon.

87
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,820
How do you think I'm gonna set those 
 charges without this primer cord, eh.

88
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,170
Besides, those krauts would be on their way 
 to report this patrol right now if I hadn't of.

89
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,350
You peek expert, you stump blower. 
  You had no right sticking your nose in that pack.

90
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,570
Let him alone, he's hurt. 
 Get outta here.

91
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,570
Look, I said leave him alone.

92
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,950
Boy, you guys are experts.

93
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,330
First of all you try to get rid of the primer cord, 
 now you're trying to blow up the detonators, huh.

94
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,530
Soldier, you are gonna get court-martialed, 
 I promise you that. If we get out of this, 
 you are going to be court martialed.

95
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,000
Is this what you got so hot about. 
 You had to get off that early shot 
 and get one of my men hit.

96
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,000
That kraut had to be stopped.

97
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,530
We would have stopped him 
  soon as Littlejohn took cover.

98
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,020
Maybe, but that's a margin 
 I can't afford Sergeant.

99
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,150
You know we don't have much 
 chance to get to that bridge as it is.

100
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,150
If those krauts got away, 
 we'd have no chance.

101
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,880
Now you listen to me. I'm gonna remind 
 you just one time. I'm in charge of this 
 outfit until we get to the bridge.

102
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,330
And if anything happens, 
 I'll decide what we do about it.

103
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,330
You got it!

104
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,622
(Click)

105
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,200
How ya doing? 
 OK

106
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,950
Don't be a hero. We got a long ways to go.

107
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,370
I said I'm OK. I wanna be there when 
 the great master puts on his show.

108
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,260
If you hadn't tangled with him, then 
 somebody else would. He had good reason.

109
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,000
Thanks. Hey.

110
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,110
Don't forget there Woody. Cause you'll 
 probably have to come to a court 
 martial when we get back.

111
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,750
Be a pleasure.

112
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,640
Sergeant?

113
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,370
How is Littlejohn doing?

114
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,880
He's okay.

115
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,880
I been talking with McQuillan Sarge.

116
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,260
He tells me Turk's had a long go at this 
 demolition business without any relief.

117
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,060
Alright. Come on. Get to it.

118
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,530
Well, he's been on these ulcer 
 missions since Africa, Sarge.

119
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,240
Sicily, Cilantro, Normandy.

120
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,330
Don't get  me wrong. 
  I'm not trying to excuse him. I

121
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,730
Thought it might help if you knew 
 a little bit about him, that's all.

122
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,730
Alright. So I know a little bit about him.

123
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,840
Well. Too much tension and not enough rest 
 is a tough combination Sarge. You know that.

124
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Guy gets to think his luck's run out on him.

125
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,820
You know, the last time out 
 he lost a longtime buddy.

126
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,820
Who hasn't?

127
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,040
What makes you think Turk is any different to 
 me than any other G.I.  I been thrown in with.

128
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,730
This is just another job.

129
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,350
And I'm doing it.

130
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Well. I better get on back.

131
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,060
I understand you've been 
 blowing up stuff since Africa.

132
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,400
Walton told me you lost a buddy last time out.

133
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,400
C'est La Guerre.

134
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,840
Look Turk. We drew each other.

135
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,330
I didn't ask for this any more than you did.

136
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,950
Alright. You been wrung dry maybe, 
 but you can better your chances 
 and ours if you'd slack off a little.

137
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,150
Oh, I got it.

138
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,550
Mother hen is worried about 
 her little chicks, huh.

139
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,310
You think that a little soft salt will make 
 me drop my charges  against that 
 slug happy buddy of yours.

140
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,550
Well you're wrong.

141
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,330
So why don't you stop trying to 
 understand and just do your job.

142
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,950
Oh, it's not much, but you're 
 all the protection I have.

143
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,622
And I'd feel a little bit better if you'd at 
 least take your place up in the line. 

144
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:16,880
(Snap)

145
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,400
Kirby.

146
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,420
They're a little more to the 
 right up by that high ground. 
 Those trees will give us some cover.

147
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,440
Say Caje. You've got the language and all.

148
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,750
Do you ever think of staying 
over here after the war.

149
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,060
Yeah. Some.

150
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,860
Sure is pretty.

151
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Bang Bang

152
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,460
I think Wilkinson's dead.

153
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,755
Kirby. 
 Yeah? 
 You're with me. 

154
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,200
Caje. You follow us.

155
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,200
Come on. Give us some cover here.

156
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:52,660
(German)

157
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,040
(A steady gunfire erupts from the Germans)

158
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,570
Boom

159
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,910
Boom

160
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,930
Doc.

161
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,930
Nelson. Take the point. After all 
 this racket we'll have to clear 
 out fast. Keep your eyes open.

162
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,080
Doc.

163
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Gonna send you back with Caje and Littlejohn.

164
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,750
If you can't make it all the way, 
 you hole up and you wait. Got it.

165
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,110
Right.

166
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,130
Get the dead man's packs.

167
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,130
Don't touch those packs.

168
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,680
We'll carry them.

169
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,680
Now let's move out.

170
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Hey Kirby.

171
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,820
What's the trouble. 
 You're not keeping up.

172
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,350
Wha, I think it's my ankle Sarge.

173
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,060
I must have sprained it or something.

174
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
Your ankle... Okay, 
 let's take a look at it.

175
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,020
Aah, Oo oo

176
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
When did it happen?

177
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,660
Well. It's not serious.

178
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,910
I think I had it laced too tight for 
 one thing, cause it feels better already.

179
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,910
How long you been walking on this?

180
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,950
This happened when you fell 
 back at the cemetery, didn't it.

181
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,840
Come on Sarge. 
 I don't want to hold you up.

182
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,710
You're holding us up right now. 
 What do you think I'm doing back here.

183
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,510
You're so far behind we were losing you.

184
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,600
There's nothing to it.
 A little sprain, that's all.

185
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Don't give me that. 
 Don't you know Doc needed you.

186
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,420
You at least can handle a rifle. 
 You should have gone back with them.

187
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,730
Okay, come on now. Start back. Try to 
 catch up with Doc and give him a hand.

188
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,910
I'm not going back.

189
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,110
I'm not gonna quit and 
 give him the satisfaction.

190
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,640
You're going back.

191
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,280
Your bridge should be right around the bend.

192
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
If you brought us the right way.

193
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,330
Krauts.

194
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,750
Should have been here sooner.

195
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,310
I thought we were supposed to get here 
 before the Germans pulled back this far.

196
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,550
We were, Trigger.

197
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,550
Wasn't that close. 
 They didn't just get here.

198
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,110
There's more coming.

199
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,350
You still think you can blow the bridge?

200
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,350
Still think you can get me there?

201
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,040
We haven' t had a prayer of 
 getting at it from this side.

202
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,770
We're gonna have to cross the river.

203
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,133
Billy. Take off your packs. 
 We'll hide 'em here.

204
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,550
Turk. You stay here and watch the equipment.

205
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,000
McQuillan.

206
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,800
You look up and down the river. Try to 
 find a boat but keep out of sight.

207
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,480
Billy. You come with me. We're gonna 
 inspect what's left  of that farmhouse up there.

208
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,770
Now we all meet back here in...30 minutes.

209
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,310
Do any good?

210
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,660
I went down as far as the next bend. 
 We're out of luck on a boat.

211
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,280
Or are we?

212
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,330
Couldn't find a boat?

213
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,310
Alright. Maybe this will do.

214
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,220
There's a backwash down there 
 practically surrounded by brush. 
 We can try it out there.

215
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,570
Then if it works, we'll lash everything 
 on the top and make it in one trip.

216
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,660
Can I load it up now. Then we'd be 
 ready to go the minute it gets dark.

217
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,240
Right. Billy.

218
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,040
You go with me up the hill. 
 We'll pick out a spot for you to dig in.

219
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Y, You want me to stay on this side?

220
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,420
You give us cover. Let's go.

221
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,440
What are you doing? 
 I'm thinking. I gotta blow a bridge.

222
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
Where's McQuillan?

223
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,170
He's down by the river putting that raft together.

224
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,570
What kept you?

225
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,260
Did you have to hold junior's hand 
 to get him to stay by himself.

226
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,822
(Splash, splash)

227
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,466
(Splash)

228
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,022
(Splash, splash, splash)

229
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,155
(Splash, splash, splash)

230
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,155
(Splash)

231
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,666
(Splash, splash, splash)

232
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,666
(Splash)

233
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,400
(Splash, splash)

234
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,377
(Splash)

235
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:54,000
(Splash, splash)

236
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,000
(Splash, splash, splash)

237
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:05,555
(Splash, splash)

238
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,660
He's dead.

239
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,080
Stopped the kraut from getting off a shot.

240
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,130
Where were you? Keeping the krauts 
 off our necks is the escort's job.

241
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,550
That''s why you're here Saunders.

242
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,480
Looks like you blew it.

243
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,400
Well, not counting junior up on 
 the hill, that leaves two of us.

244
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,200
I was right.

245
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,440
They didn't send enough men.

246
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,750
Tell me something Turk.

247
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,550
Why do you hate so much.

248
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,820
You can get a lot done with hate.

249
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,480
Let me put it another way.

250
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,400
What are you afraid of.

251
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm only afraid of one thing Saunders.

252
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
That sometime, someplace, some 
 jerk is gonna get me killed.

253
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,220
I've come a long way.

254
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,280
When I was seventeen I was 
 setting charges in open pit mines.

255
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,600
At twenty-one I was blowing oil wells.

256
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,150
I'd hate to cash in now because 
 some  jerk who's not dry behind 
 the ears yet, slops up a detail.

257
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,930
You know Saunders, you don't 
 have to go on with this.

258
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,150
Nobody expected you and one man 
 to hold off the whole German army 
 while I blow a bridge.

259
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,820
My orders are to get you to that bridge and back.

260
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,820
And that's what I'm gonna do.

261
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,110
That is unless

262
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,910
unless you call it off.

263
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,130
You got yourself an excuse, Turk. 
 You lost your assistant.

264
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,130
So, it's your decision.

265
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,970
Do we go?

266
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,600
We go.

267
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,820
Okay Saunders. This is where I take over.

268
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm gonna go up ahead and have 
 a look-see. I'll be back to give 
 you a hand with the stuff.

269
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,570
Cave over there.

270
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,040
Can you get up? You hear 
 me Turk? Can you get up?

271
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,040
Come on. Get up.

272
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,844
Up.

273
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,310
Run for it. Get up.

274
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,040
Eh! 
 Come on.

275
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,460
You can make it. 
Now get up and help me.

276
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,440
Hold on!

277
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,680
I knew I'd get it this time. I knew it.

278
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,770
My luck didn't run out.

279
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,260
They took it away from me,
 when they gave me you. 
 You and and your creeps.

280
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,640
Go on. Get out. 
  Save your own neck.

281
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,370
Turk.

282
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,510
Turk. That bridge is still there.
 Don't quit on me now.

283
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,510
Come on Turk. Don't quit on me now.

284
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,820
What are you doing?

285
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm gonna blow the bridge.

286
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,930
Not like that you're not.

287
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,930
I'll blow it any way I can.

288
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,930
Now take that mess apart, Saunders.

289
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,550
Don't be stupid. You try to 
 blow the bridge that way,

290
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,440
The krauts will have it 
 together before morning.

291
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,530
Turk I haven't got time to take a 
correspondence course. And 
 you're in no shape to do the job.

292
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,680
Just listen to me. Do like I say.

293
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,680
Bust up that ball into three equal parts.

294
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,370
Don't make the charges no bigger than that.

295
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Make about 20 of them.

296
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,550
And get the primer cord.

297
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,860
Cut it in 3 foot lengths.

298
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,020
Put the end of the primer cord 
 in each one of the charges.

299
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,200
I have the primer cord. 3 foot lengths.

300
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,550
Ah, what next.

301
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,933
Turk. 

302
00:34:57,977 --> 00:35:00,930
Turk. 3 foot lengths of 
 primer cord. Now what's next.

303
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,730
Turk.

304
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,730
Turk what's next.

305
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,370
Now you take the rest of the primer cord.

306
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,550
and lay it out.

307
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,860
That'll be your lead wire.

308
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,480
Then tie the charges on to the lead wire.

309
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,440
About every 4 feet.

310
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,280
And make  sure you press the C2 
 in tight around the primer cord.

311
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,550
Right.

312
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,840
Then take your main roll of primer cord.

313
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,600
And put it in one of those new zip bags.

314
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,480
Then take your charges and put them in last.

315
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,510
So they'll feed out like a chalk line.

316
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:42,422
(German voices approaching)

317
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:56,420
(German)

318
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,620
ja ja , ist der Wein gut

319
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,110
es macht die Nacht schnell gehen

320
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,510
Ich habe meine Cointreau

321
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,060
(clicking noise)

322
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,020
Bring the wire over here.

323
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,040
Now cut it. One at a time though.

324
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
(Cough Cough)

325
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,730
Take the plastic box here.

326
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,400
And put those 2 wires on those 2 poles. 
 Make sure they're tight.

327
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,170
I haven't lost it.

328
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,350
Count to a slow forty.

329
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,820
That'll give you time to get out.

330
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,260
Give me the handle.

331
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,950
This is my job.

332
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,240
My job is to get you back.

333
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,950
You'll never get me back.

334
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,950
I said give me the handle.

335
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,330
No.

336
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,840
Alright. You just relax now, expert.

337
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,040
I'll try to be nice and easy on you.

338
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,800
Just relax.

339
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't you mother hen me.

340
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,420
Alright. Hold it now. Here we go.

341
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,370
Here we go.

342
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,440
I'll catch up.

343
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,310
Hans. 
 Komm mal her.

344
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,260
Es ist Holz.

345
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,620
Ein Floß.

346
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,220
Boom Boom Boom Boom

347
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,240
Huh. Huh.

348
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,820
He's dead. What are we 
 carrying him for. He's dead.

349
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,370
He can' t be.

350
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,040
He can't be.

351
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,750
He's alive.

352
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,200
Turk.

353
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,930
Don't die on me.

354
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,770
Don't die on me Turk.

355
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,970
You're alive.

356
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,800
You hear me.

357
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,600
I'm gonna get you back alive, Turk.

358
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,710
You're gonna live till I get you back.

359
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,400
You're gonna live, Turk.

360
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,310
Grab a hold.

361
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,130
Grab a hold.

362
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,600
Turk.

363
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,370
Turk.

364
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,220
Get out.

365
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,330
What are you gonna do about Kirby?

366
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,110
You listen to me Turk.

367
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,660
You prefer charges against Kirby 
 and get him court martialed.

368
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,660
And I'm gonna find you.

369
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,660
Get out of here mother hen.

370
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,660
Go back to your chicks.

371
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,660
Chicks huh.

372
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,970
I fought with them ever since Normandy. 
 They 're good soldiers.

373
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,970
And the reason they're out there 
 all busted up is because they 
 tried to get you to the bridge.

374
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,800
Get outta here.

375
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,170
You know something.

376
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,330
I'm gonna put him up for a Silver Star.

377
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,040
Hey Sarge. What'd he say. 
 He still gonna press charges.

378
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:06,930
He won't make it stick if he doesn't lie. 
 He should be careful, you blew  his
 bridge for him. Got him back alive.

379
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,860
Come on Sarge. What'd he say. 
 What'd he say. Was he still mad Sarge.

380
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,860
Alright. Just knock it off. You knock it off.

381
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,511
You guys make me sick.

382
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:15,220
Go on. 
 Look at yourselves.

383
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,220
You call yourself a squad?

384
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,111
You're a bunch of goof offs.

385
00:45:19,288 --> 00:45:21,020
Littlejohn, you caused nothing but trouble.

386
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,460
You mind everybody else's business but your own.

387
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,280
Like poking around with that primer 
 cord and then dropping it on the road.

388
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,910
And from now on you mind your own 
 business and you follow orders.

389
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,580
Kirby, Kirby.

390
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,130
You're a hot headed showoff, who thinks 
 of himself first, and everybody else second.

391
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,800
You fly off the handle 
 every time you turn around.

392
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,950
Now cooling your heels off in some 
 stockade may be just what you 
 need so you just better shape up.

393
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,570
Now I've had it.

394
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,200
This squad is gonna shape up.

395
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,640
You been in the front lines so long 
 you're forgetting you're soldiers.

396
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,970
I'm sick and tired of holding your 
 hands every time we get into a bind.

397
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:51,022
