would not lift a finger,
save in his own interest.

00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,771
I go to him now

to attack Wang"s city of Urga.

Their failure to return

if Wang does not
take counsel of his Shaman.

much reliance

If Wang discovers your deceit,
we"ll never leave the city.

That is a poor thought

296
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,087
Her slave came to me.

but went nonetheless
to learn her intent.

00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,703
Proceed to make camp
at the water hole.

You"ll find more ease
this night than last.

314
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,374
For me there is no ease
while you live, Mongol.

315
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,718
Your future promises
much discomfort.

316
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,110
Why is no tent
put up for me?

317
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,908
Because you"ll share mine.

318
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,849
I will sleep outside.
You, bring my fur robe.

319
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,179
Tend to your men.

320
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,556
You"ll have no further need
for furs. Come drink.

321

By night, my warmth,
and for adornment by day...

322
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,559
I shall heap precious stones
on you and rare ornaments.

323
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,801
I want no more
your stolen treasure than
your vile warmth, Mongol!

324
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,808
Those furs are mine!

Were Wang younger and
more nimble at dodging swords,

333
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,414
I might give you to him
and keep the furs.

334
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,117
For they, too, are beautiful.

I shall keep you, Bortai.

will kindle into love.

so treacherously poisoned
by the Tartar Kumlek.

349

Is a daughter

351

00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,722
she"s a fair daughter
whoever"s she be.

353
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,821
What means, Temüjin?
This is Bortai,
daughter of Kumlek.

354
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,832
Daughter of
the Tartar?

355
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,425
I had thought to bring
her to you as a gift,

356
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,630
but I could not do you
this ill service,

357
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,300
for her nature is as ugly
as her body fair.
[Chuckles]

I bring you instead

endless pleasure

It seems your Tartar woman
does not share our delight
in these dancers.

382
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:56,723
Forgive her, O Khan.
But lacking the talents

I beg forgiveness
for her, O Khan.

390

With such gestures
does the Tartar woman
prove her love.

Temüjin spoke earlier
of grave intelligence.

May we not
hear it now?
Yes! Yes!

395
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,634
Let"s hear it now.
Be gone! Be gone!

396
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:13,121
The Tartars and the Merkits
are joining forces
to attack us.

397
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,158
You are surprised,
as I was.

398
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,285
Yet we both have cause to know
the perfidy of Kumlek...

399
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,990
and the Merkit,
Targutai"s, ambition.

400
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,592
True.
For long l"ve nursed
revenge against Kumlek.

401
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,263
When I heard
his daughter was to be
the Merkit"s bride,

402
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,306
I struck,
waylaying them.

403
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,365
Targutai, I slew.

404
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,240
And with his dying oath,
he swore he"d be avenged:

405
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,339
that soon Kumlek
would rule the Gobi.
A vain boast in death.

406
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,944
And so I took it, until
the woman, in her wrath,
spat out like threats.

407
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:48,458
I forthwith sent spies
to Tartar territory,
and learned the news...

408
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,188
which brought me here
in haste.
What say you of this, Shaman?

409
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,890
lfTemüjin"s spies
reported truly-

410
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,059
Let the Khan send out
his own spies.

411
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,603
What think you
of that, Shaman?

412
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,435
So grave a question
demands a surer answer.

413
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,910
Let a sheep be slaughtered,
and the shoulder blade
brought hither.

Stay, my son.

Kasar, fetch my healing leaves
and ointments.

I see no betrayal there.

630
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,318
But this, the blackest
kind of treachery,

631
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:56,092
can thus masquerade
as brother"s love.

632
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,702
Speak then! Deny it!

633
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,638
I will not.
To deny it would give
substance to your thought.

l"d spare you!
Curb that silver tongue!

Did you betray me to the Tartars?

No!

tenfold.

the Tartar.
With Wang Khan?

With the legions of Wang Khan,
and the Mongol clans I gather.

My brother,
I know your plan.
But I doubt if-

Kasar, go you with Jamuga.

648
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:56,991
Your brawn may serve
to complement his wit
in case of trouble.

649
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,054
Let us be on our way, Kasar.

650
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:10,465
Come, my Mother.
Work your healing on this.

651
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:13,565
Would that I could cure
the madness that possesses you.

652
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,844
Is that your woman"s way
of saying...

653
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:22,316
you oppose my plan to seize
this chance for power?

654
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:26,548
Can you speak thus to me,
your mother?

655
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:31,025
Did I not hold our tribe together,
and raise you with but one thought:

656
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,857
to regain your father"s power
and avenge his death?

657

Now you"d thwart me
and let our vengeance cool
still longer.

You lie, my son.

659

for your father.
No, not even for yourself.

Even were you right
about Wang Khan, yet would
I venture this unaided.

Approach, Jamuga.

Word reached me
that he was slain by Kumlek.

ofTemüjin"s
miraculous escape.

Treachery?

705
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,497
Treachery.
How say you, Shaman?

706
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:37,663
I have long thought
on this, O Khan.

707
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:42,073
Were the Mongol"s
secret purpose to trick us
into war with Kumlek,

01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,612
he would not act otherwise.

709
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,116
To what end?
To fatten on our flesh,
O Khan.

710
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,880
Remember, they say
that when Temüjin was born,

711
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,218
a clot of blood was found
in his clenched fingers.

712
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,417
A certain augury
of greatness.

713
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,585
Beware, O Khan, beware...

714
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:03,097
lest the Mongol"s greatness
be achieved at your expense.

715

What say the spirits,
Shaman?

716

when these emissaries arrived.

718

With your leave, I will,
myself, look further
into Temüjin"s designs...

01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:51,281
Summon the spirits of heaven
to my aid.

Send me men!
Men!

781
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:58,060
This day I have long awaited.

782
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:01,829
And now I am beset by
weaklings and traitors.

783
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:05,737
And victory is slipping
from my grasp.

784
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,935
Spirits of heaven,
Yessugai my father,

785
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,571
do not desert me
in this fateful hour.

786
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:16,378
Let not treachery prevail!

787
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,188
Lord?

788
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,435

from Wang Khan.

Temüjin.

01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:27,719
I bring you ill tidings,
Temüjin.
I doubt it not.

791
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:30,758
Secure in his city,
Wang Khan waits word...

792
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:33,623
of your destruction
at the Tartar"s hands.

793
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,185
You rode two days
to bring me such news?

794
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:42,169
To give you warning,
and a plan to thwart
the old man"s treachery.

795
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:46,297
And the plan?
Seize Urga!

796
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:50,333
And bleed my strength in
siege of Wang Khan"s city?

797
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:56,174
There will be no siege
and no battle.

798
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,548
I, myself,
will open the gates,

799
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,680
and taken by surprise,
the city will fall
like a ripe plum.

800
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:06,018
The time has come,
Temüjin Khan,

801
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:09,585
if you would tread the path
of power and riches.

802
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:14,863
And the young Khan
will know how to reward
a humble servitor.

803
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:21,003
What of my brothers,
Jamuga and Kasar?

804
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:24,442
Wang holds them captive.

805

Not I, Temüjin, not I.

But you will spare me
further suffering if-
If it is in my power.

874
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:24,189
Let us speak low.
Three of my father"s guard
watch this tent.

01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:32,822
but no more potent than
the water to make me speak.

878

I ask nothing
but to know he lives.

879

I am well rested.
Call your guards.

880
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:40,702
You cannot trust me,
yet I aided his escape.

881
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:43,868
And you will aid mine
if I tell you-
Nothing! Only that he lives.

882
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:47,436
Is he recovered?
Tell me, Mongol!
Guard!

For this betrayal, my father
would tear my heart out
with his own foul hand.

886
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:00,560
I chance this gladly
just to know Temüjin lives.

887
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,686
To reach his arms,
l"d cast Kumlek to his fate...

888
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,926
and betray my people
into Mongol bondage.

more than life.

No, no. Do not tell me.

he must know of.

I was hastening to warn him
when your men captured me.
It must be tonight.

If he should die-
He will not die.

898
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:55,511
The peril is chiefly
to his enterprise.

for destiny has marked him.

a sudden, my hatred for him
could not withstand my love.

902
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:18,362
He has a quality of spirit
that commands love,

903
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:21,875
and makes men
greater than themselves.

904
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:25,673
Lacking this spirit,
I found fulfillment
in our brotherhood,

to the greatness
he knew not yet was in him.

your heart denies me,

You have no need of me
henceforth, my brother,

938
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:14,380
for you have found
your destiny.

939
01:49:14,447 --> 01:49:16,915
Far greater conquests
will be yours, Temüjin,

940
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,817
and men will call you Genghis Khan,
the perfect warrior.

941
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,550
Jamuga of the silver tongue.

942
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:29,891
I have ill repaid your love,
my brother.

943
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,830
Ask now any favor of me,

944
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:36,562
and that I take my oath
to grant you.

945
01:49:38,872 --> 01:49:41,466
Grant that I may die swiftly.

946
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:43,873
No!
Jamuga!

947
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:46,845
That is the favor I ask,
my brother.

948
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:49,973
I hold you to your oath.

949
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:54,783
As in the sacred ritual
of our ancestors, let my dying
be without bloodshed,

950
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:56,822
so that in
the eternal heavens...

951
01:49:56,890 --> 01:50:00,189
my spirit may forever counsel
and protect the Great Khan.

952
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:04,826
So be it, my brother.

953
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:41,227
<i>[Jamuga Narrating]</i>
<i>And the Great Khan</i>
<i>made such conquests...</i>

954
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,929
<i>as were undreamed of</i>
<i>by mortal men.</i>

955
01:50:44,004 --> 01:50:46,302
<i>Tribes of the Gobi flocked</i>
<i>to his standard,</i>

956
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:50,776
<i>and the farthest reaches</i>
<i>of the desert trembled</i>
<i>under the hooves ofhis hordes.</i>

957
01:50:50,844 --> 01:50:54,803
<i>At the feet ofhis Tartar woman,</i>
<i>he laid all the riches</i>
<i>of Cathay.</i>

958
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:58,339
<i>For 100 years,</i>
<i>the children of their loins</i>
<i>ruled half the world.</i>
