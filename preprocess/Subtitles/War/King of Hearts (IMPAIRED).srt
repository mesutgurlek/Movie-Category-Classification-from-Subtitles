00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:49,152
KlNG OF HEARTS

2
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,787
''October 1 91 8.
The War is almost over.

3
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,225
The Germans retreat,
the Allies advance.

4
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,526
A small town in Northern France
awaits its liberation.''

5
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:41,535
- Are the wires set yet?
- Everything's fine.

6
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,405
Hurry up.

7
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,681
Close it.

8
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:59,388
Hurry up.

9
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,559
Enter.

10
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,677
lt's done, Colonel...
with not a moment to lose.

11
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,714
The enemy is near the river.

12
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,578
Shall l blow up the bridge?

13
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,142
NOt yet.
First, we pull out of town.

14
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,812
The munitions?

15
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,378
How much is there?

16
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,553
But there's enough there
to blow up... the whole town.

17
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:13,759
The blockhouse and the whole town
will blow up...

18
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,634
when the English general
is sitting here...

19
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,673
where l am now.

20
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:34,915
You have an artistic clock,
Mr. Frenchman.

21
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,714
A very artistic clock!

22
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:44,424
Artistically the town will blow up.
The clock gives me an idea.

23
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,727
The knight strikes
at midnight, no?

24
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,733
lt shall strike
for the last time!

25
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,333
Colonel, my ideology...

26
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,741
Later, Adolf. Later.

27
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:10,014
The knight strikes
at midnight.

28
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,801
- What is it?
- They're blowing it up!

29
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,866
- The Krauts!
- Blow up?

30
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,243
The town, the bridge,
everything.

31
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:38,250
We must pass the word.
Hurry, there's no time to lose.

32
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,070
Get out! The town
is going to explode!

33
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:33,595
''The mackerel likes frying.
The mackerel likes frying.''

34
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:37,707
Germans blowing up
munitions dump...

35
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,836
tonight before midnight.

36
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,381
The knight strikes
at midnight!

37
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,111
The knight strikes
at midnight!

38
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,915
For God's sake,
don't enter the town!

39
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,918
SPQ to Mackerel, answer.

40
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,957
- They have cut off.
- Give tO me, man.

41
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,207
COme in.

42
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:18,841
Sir.

43
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,529
''The mackerel likes frying.''

44
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,262
The barber, of course.

45
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:37,860
The resistance.

46
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,898
''Germans blowing up
the munitions...

47
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,375
before midnight tomorrow.

48
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,605
DOn't enter tOWn...

49
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,907
for God's sake.

50
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:53,281
The knight strikes at midnight.
lmpossible to--''

51
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,714
Stop! Halt!

52
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,895
And they have every intention
of blowing the whole thing sky-high.

53
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:39,123
The town and the bridge.

54
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,231
When?

55
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:45,395
We don't know,
but sometime before midnight tomorrow.

56
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:50,067
Now, gentlemen,
that bridge must not go up.

57
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:55,171
l don't care what it costs,
but we must save it.

58
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:58,308
Any delay in our advance
at this point...

59
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:01,683
will throw the whole operation
off schedule.

60
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,254
We simply can't have that.

61
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,427
What do you suggest?

62
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, sir, l'd suggest we send in
one of our ordinance chaps.

63
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,394
Time-fuse specialist,
trained infiltrator...

64
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,165
French-speaking, all that.

65
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,570
Splendid.

66
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:23,233
Who do we have who speaks French?

67
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,978
There's Plumpick, sir.

68
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:30,914
Ornitholography specialist,
communications platoon, born in France.

69
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:31,973
Splendid.

70
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,850
Would you ask him to volunteer?

71
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,890
Would you, Captain?

72
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:46,663
Now, what's the matter, Little Fat?
You look depressed or something.

73
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,894
Are you jealous of Cucumber, there?

74
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,835
Well, listen.
l'm gonna read you something now.

75
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:57,166
Let me find you something
nice to read.

76
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,471
Here We gO, nOW.

77
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:04,743
''Now, fair Hippolyta,
our nuptual hour draws on apace.

78
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,547
More happy days
bring in another moon.

79
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,145
But oh, methinks,
how slow this--''

80
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,652
- Aye, sir.
- Report to the Colonel.

81
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,229
Private Plumpick, sir!

82
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,801
Private Charles Plumpick,
ornitholography specialist...

83
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:33,402
communications platoon,
headquarters company, reporting, sir.

84
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,674
- Splendid, Pumpernickel.
- Plumpick, sir.

85
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:39,275
Nickel, splendid.
Good of you to volunteer.

86
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,376
Brave lad.

87
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,180
Stand at ease.

88
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,792
Out!

89
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,929
l suppose you can read a map.

90
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,525
Your mission is quite simple.
Get into the town--

91
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,728
- You do speak French?
- Oui, sir.

92
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:04,068
Make contact with the local spies.
The town barber heads it.

93
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:07,112
Find the explosives
and disarm the fuse.

94
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:10,512
- lt shouldn't take you long, what?
- NO, sir. Yes, sir.

95
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,710
But l wonder, sir,
if you have the right Plumpick, sir.

96
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,946
YOu see, l'm an
ornitholography specialist, sir.

97
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:18,548
This calls for a specialist,
Pumpernickel.

98
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,319
- Plumpick, sir.
- Nickel.

99
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:23,362
You seem to pick your name out of a hat.
How good is your French?

100
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,227
Quite good, sir.
But you see it's the explosives, sir.

101
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,563
l wonder if perhaps one
of the chaps from ordinance...

102
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,499
may not do the job
just a wee bit better, sir.

103
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,130
Send two men in that inferno?

104
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:37,575
See here, man.
That town can go up at any moment.

105
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:41,306
You're asking me to risk the life
of two of my troops?

106
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,212
Why, blast it all?

107
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,876
The life of every one
of those men out there...

108
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,681
is dear to me as my own.

109
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:51,484
The men are aware of that, sir,
and we do appreciate it, sir.

110
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,457
That is leadership, lad.

111
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,721
Yes, sir.
But about the explosives, sir--

112
00:11:55,795 --> 00:12:00,027
That will do, Pumpernickel.
Did you or did you not volunteer?

113
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,535
- Well, as a matter of fact, sir--
- Then good. Let's get on with it.

114
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,834
We have no time to lose.
The town can go up at any moment.

115
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,306
Let's not forget that.

116
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,400
l don't think, sir, that l could
forget that if l tried, sir.

117
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,775
Well, let's get cracking, lad.

118
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:19,210
By the way, the password for your
contact with the barber fellow is...

119
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,878
''The mackerel likes frying.''

120
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:29,519
Say, if you can find it,
what the devil do they mean by...

121
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,460
''The knight strikes
at midnight''?

122
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:36,433
French are so wordy.
Any questiOns?

123
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,026
- NO, sir.
- Good.

124
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,470
But l wonder, sir,
if you do have the right Plumpick, sir.

125
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,008
You see, about the explosives--

126
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,582
A ScOtsman!

127
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,048
Make way for the kings.

128
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,948
Chop, chop off
the woman's head.

129
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,029
- YOur turn.
- Mine.

130
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,457
Where am l?

131
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,327
l'm the Duke of Clubs.

132
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,196
MOnseigneur Daisy.

133
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,992
l'm the Duke of Clubs.

134
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,829
MOnseigneur Daisy.

135
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,892
Come, my friend.
Tell them who you are.

136
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,571
King of Hearts!

137
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,699
- YOur Majesty!
- Such an honor!

138
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,609
Let's go...they're all crazy!

139
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:15,877
Ladies and gentlemen,
the King is back at last!

140
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:23,027
l've never seen the King!

141
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,256
Long live the King!

142
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,702
Ah! Here it is!

143
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,146
Nice kitty!

144
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:48,202
Hey! Come on in, boys!

145
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:59,873
Madame, am l
a suitable husband for you?

146
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,920
And what do you think
of me?

147
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,775
- Are you the barber?
- Obviously.

148
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:49,143
Confidentially:
''The mackerel likes frying.''

149
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,545
Obviously.

150
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,708
Good. l can breathe again!

151
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,979
Don't stop breathing,
or you won't live to be old.

152
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,783
- Good-bye.
- So nice of you to come.

153
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,352
- YOu pay custOmers?
- Yes. That's why business is good.

154
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,366
Okay, quick.
Where are the Germans?

155
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:14,167
l'll find out.
Any Germans here?

156
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,640
lf you speak loudly,
no one listens...

157
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,267
No secrets here.

158
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:23,576
The knight strikes at midnight.
What does that mean?

159
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,378
This fashionable man is very strange!

160
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:28,817
- Where is the blockhouse?
- What is the blockhouse?

161
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,550
- MunitiOns!
- That's not my department!

162
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,819
For that, see the General.

163
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:39,592
- Where is he?
- Open your eyes and look for once.

164
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,232
Young man, have you seen the King?

165
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:45,895
- What king?
- The King of Hearts!

166
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,598
Now there, where were we?

167
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,530
Looking for someone?
Sit down.

168
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,503
Someone named the General.

169
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:24,100
Oh, the General! You can help me out.
l found my costume...

170
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,507
but not my character!

171
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:29,513
lt's so obvious. l'm General Geranium!
What was l thinking?

172
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,447
Let's be brief.

173
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,453
''The mackerel likes frying.''

174
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,951
l don't understand.

175
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:43,893
Neither do l. No one's listening.
Speak openly.

176
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,025
He won't blab.

177
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,535
''The knight strikes
at midnight''?

178
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,803
Ah, midnight,
the hour of crimes!

179
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:58,001
- We must prevent it!
- There's no time to waste.

180
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,407
Where are we going?

181
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,179
Behave, pussycats!
Papa will be right back.

182
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,485
You've left the door open!

183
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:14,615
He's so used to being caged,
he doesn't want to come out!

184
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:17,719
That's for him to decide.

185
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:19,593
The king of beasts.

186
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:22,258
Speaking of kings,
have you seen him?

187
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:25,898
He arrived last night;
a very handsome young man, l hear.

188
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:31,967
Listen, l'm fed up with all your antics
and double-talk!

189
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,910
l'm here for the blockhouse and
the knight, and l don't understand.

190
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,073
l don't either.

191
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:40,346
l'm not here
for cock-and-bull stories!

192
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:42,682
l'm too old
for cops and robbers!

193
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,349
- How old are you, young man?
- Look, l've had it with you!

194
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:49,222
- You're hurting me!
- Where is the blockhouse?

195
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,524
What's a blockhouse?

196
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:56,900
He's mad!

197
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,928
King of Hearts!

198
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,501
l'm the king of the fools!

199
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,543
l have to warn them!

200
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:45,372
Thank God you're still here!

201
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,683
DOn't wOrry, it's me.
l just got some new clothes. That's all.

202
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:51,119
Now, one of you has got to take
a message to the Colonel.

203
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:55,184
Fine. You can decide between you.

204
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:59,129
From Charles Plumpick
to Headquarters.

205
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:07,362
Wrong town. lnhabitants odd.

206
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,841
Chimpanzee checkmate.

207
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,613
Encountered single bear, two lions...

208
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,974
but no contact with Mackerel.

209
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:22,918
Little Fat, it's going to be you.
lt is. lt's going to be you. Yes.

210
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,251
Let me put this on your leg.

211
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,623
Your little leg because l don't
want to hurt you, you see.

212
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,127
That's right.

213
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,399
l forgot the most important!

214
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:48,506
Postscript.:
Blockhouse disappeared.

215
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:52,711
Good luck!

216
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:55,185
Carrier pigeon... shoot it!

217
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,979
Hurry, read it!

218
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,715
''From Charles Plumpick.''

219
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:35,960
''Blockhouse disappeared.''

220
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:41,792
Hamburger, take some men
and go see about it.

221
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:48,370
You men, come with me,
on the double!

222
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,598
Message from Plumpick, sir.

223
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,797
lt's high time too.

224
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:23,069
''Difficulties: wrong town,
inhabitants odd...

225
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:27,202
encountered single bear
and two lions...

226
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,611
but unable
to make contact mackerel.''

227
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:39,455
Gentlemen, l'm sure there's no real
reason to be needlessly alarmed...

228
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:43,688
but it would appear that the outcome
of this whole campaign...

229
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:47,664
is now in the hands
of a stark, raving lunatic!

230
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,363
Private Pumpernickel
has gone crackers!

231
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,904
Captain, will you find
three volunteers now?

232
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,936
- Men.
- Sir!

233
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:03,411
- l want you to leave immediately.
- Sir!

234
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,642
Stop! Come back here!

235
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,451
Where the devil
do you think you're going?

236
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:10,987
No idea, sir!

237
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,328
Look here. Here!

238
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,063
Come and find out.

239
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,461
- You're going after Pumpernickel!
- Sir!

240
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:27,403
StOp!
To disarm that blockhouse!

241
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,809
Pumpernickel.

242
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,737
lsn't that a German name?

243
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:10,063
A polka, Hyacinth!

244
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,919
Look... someone's here.

245
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,068
Got a light?

246
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:43,940
Buy me a drink?

247
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,043
What a big spender!

248
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:50,080
Want to know my name?

249
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,681
That's no answer!
My name is Hyacinth.

250
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:58,153
Shall l dress as a housewife,
a mummy Or a nun?

251
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,689
You look fine this way.

252
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:03,719
Listen...sit down...

253
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,253
and don't move.

254
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,767
- Are you a whore?
- Yes!

255
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:14,697
- And l'm your customer?
- Yes!

256
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:17,934
Good. We understand each other.

257
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:23,313
Do you know what war is?

258
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,148
Surrounding the town...

259
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,777
there in the hills...

260
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:31,583
are people who want
to hurt you.

261
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,319
Go tell them l'm harmless.

262
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,328
lt wouldn't work.

263
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,125
The town may blow up
any minute nOw...

264
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,795
l might not even get to finish
this sentence!

265
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,804
What a shame.
You have a nice voice.

266
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:56,512
Listen, that's just a pipe dream.

267
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,845
l'll tell you my secret.

268
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,942
l live in the moment.

269
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,250
- That's all that counts.
- You're right, but...

270
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,348
l'm not the girl for you, that's all.
l'll get you someone else.

271
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,754
Girls!

272
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:15,330
Daffodil or Rosie,
FOrget-me-nOt Or POppy.

273
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,867
The choice is yours.

274
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,672
Or maybe not.
There's no mistaking a look like that.

275
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:30,647
Unspoiled and beautiful.

276
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:48,224
l'm Poppy. And you?

277
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,759
Charles.

278
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:59,169
- Blush! Men go for that.
- Do l frighten him?

279
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:02,906
Sure. Men seem tough,
but they're soft as asparagus tips.

280
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,915
Teeny babies at heart.

281
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,918
- COme On... cOme in.
- Staying with us?

282
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:12,547
To teach you a thing or two about
the birds and the bees.

283
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:16,491
You don't know where to start?
Neither do l.

284
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:19,823
This is the bedroom.

285
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:24,630
The bed. The lamp. The switch.

286
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:27,694
l suggest starting in the dark,
then turn the light on.

287
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:29,831
Look at the object
of your desire carefully.

288
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:33,673
Turn the light off again. Love is
played like checkers, black and white.

289
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,872
- Will he get naked?
- Yes. Don't be nasty.

290
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:38,643
There's liquor to drink.
l've drawn the curtains.

291
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:46,121
l feel like l've always known you.

292
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:51,787
What would you like?

293
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:54,923
To lose my memory.

294
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,626
lt's easy.

295
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,773
- What are you doing?
- Keyhole-peeping. Shut the door.

296
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,276
The King of Hearts!

297
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,643
What are you doing here, sir?

298
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:15,715
Love has brought
the King back to us!

299
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:27,459
All aboard, your Majesty.

300
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,743
This way, everyone.

301
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,848
The Duke is very emotional.

302
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,857
l once saw him cry
when a fly died. A fly!

303
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:56,120
At Waterloo, in '1 5.

304
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:57,593
He's still crying.

305
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:04,600
Cousin, you're back at last!
But what a state!

306
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:08,969
Quick!
A shirt and a sandwich!

307
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,137
Melons and a hat!
Stockings!

308
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:18,474
The Duchess, my wife.

309
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,744
An old bat.

310
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,786
Her feet are always cold.

311
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,982
But l've loved her
for more than 60 years.

312
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:37,626
Sire, here are my children.

313
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:47,208
Blow your nose.
Comb your hair.

314
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:49,872
- Where's Baby?
- There, Mommy!

315
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:55,015
Alberic, what do you say?

316
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:57,316
- Long live the King!
- Right.

317
00:42:57,388 --> 00:43:01,256
- Some candy?
- Excuse me, it's a sOuvenir.

318
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:03,885
YOu must rest
before the coronation.

319
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:06,987
Well, the dromedary is harnessed. You
know how impatient these animals are.

320
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,759
See for yourself.

321
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,529
- Where are we going?
- To the cathedral.

322
00:43:11,602 --> 00:43:14,901
1 2th century. A bit restored, like my
wife. But l love her, and you will, too.

323
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:20,910
Little rascal!
l'll tan your behind!

324
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:23,242
Will you be still?

325
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,483
lt's the greatest day
of my life.

326
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:35,047
l've always wanted
the cheers of a nation...

327
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,385
seated next to the handsomest man.

328
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,421
DOn't exaggerate.

329
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,763
But l must!
Without it there's nothing!

330
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,947
Everyone here is so happy,
and l've come to break up their party.

331
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:08,719
These flowers, your friends,
this kindness--

332
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:11,159
They will all die, and there's nothing
l can do about it.

333
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:13,059
A real king can do anything.

334
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,191
Maybe, but not me.
Time flies.

335
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:19,133
Everything will blow up,
as sure as my name is Charles.

336
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:28,039
Look! Soldiers!

337
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,288
Greetings.

338
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:11,013
Your missal. Your rosary.

339
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:14,114
Where has Alberic gone to?

340
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:18,087
Back there in the sacristy.
He's always into everything!

341
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,486
That's fine, darling.

342
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,907
What is this carnival?

343
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,973
Take those hats off!

344
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:53,720
What a mess!

345
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,211
To the blockhouse!

346
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:21,775
Sire, allow me to make a comment
about all this.

347
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:23,911
Your mind is obviously somewhere else.

348
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,616
This is a sacred moment...

349
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,783
and you're fidgeting!

350
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,455
Do you have to pee?

351
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:37,023
So, what's the matter? Smile!

352
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:42,828
l'm scared.

353
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,534
You don't like theater?

354
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,235
What theater?

355
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,303
World theater.
Training school.

356
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,679
The Comédie Française, the Vatican.

357
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,911
Ceremonials, masquerades!

358
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:59,354
Smile. Smile!

359
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,355
The crown. The crown?

360
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:07,063
Nobody has the crown?

361
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:10,458
Sire, do you have a crown on you?

362
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:12,525
No, but l'll go look for one.

363
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,728
Company, halt!

364
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:49,896
What is this nonsense?
Hurry up, and clear this away.

365
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:15,427
- Everything's set right?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,203
Who's over there?

367
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:21,533
StOp!

368
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,886
Long live the King!

369
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:42,626
Damn! Here we gO again!

370
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:54,967
You needn't have bothered, Sire.
We have found a crown.

371
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:06,580
Drat! l've got a frog in my throat
from all the stinking smoke!

372
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,078
Thank you.
We've done something fine.

373
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:21,784
Long live the King!
Long live the King of Hearts!

374
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:28,095
We want a speech!

375
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,805
He's so beautiful!

376
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:51,420
My dear flock. Ladies. Citizens.

377
00:51:52,456 --> 00:51:55,050
Life is a valley of tears.

378
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:58,355
We enter this world with a cry...

379
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:01,694
and we leave with a sigh.

380
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:07,135
And do you think it pleases God to see
His creatures crying all the day long?

381
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:11,163
ln truth l tell you, our kingdom...

382
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:14,677
His kingdom--is Joy.

383
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:18,579
The Arab in his desert
carries with him...

384
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:21,140
his fountains and Heaven--

385
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:29,582
Heaven...is the empire
of the prisoner behind bars.

386
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,094
Give me the ball!

387
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,435
StOp!

388
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:47,001
- My respect, Admiral.
- Enter, gentlemen.

389
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,246
What a splendid machine.

390
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,446
You must get off some nice shots
with this, huh?

391
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:00,649
- How about a little ride?
- l would be delighted.

392
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:20,503
The fish in the pond, the bird
in the bush, the lamb in his wool...

393
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:25,605
friends in our thoughts...
and ourselves-- in our voices...

394
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:28,651
like the scent of the rose.

395
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:33,855
That is grammar and the Law.

396
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:38,361
We have decided to be happy...

397
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:41,090
and nothing can stop us!

398
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:48,765
- Quiet!
- Amen.

399
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:56,442
What...? Show me!

400
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:58,981
Block the exits!

401
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:01,529
We're saved!

402
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:03,937
l found the blockhouse!

403
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:06,976
The enemy has fled!

404
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:10,036
Long live the King!

405
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,272
Long live my people!

406
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,287
Everyone to the the Throne Room...

407
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,953
to start a celebration
that will last three years!

408
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,758
The Republic is proud to give you
this bicycle as a present.

409
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,929
You can pedal among the people...

410
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:36,438
incOgnitO!

411
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,458
To the side, ladies.

412
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,658
You look dreadful in daylight.
Go home.

413
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,945
Long live the General!
Long live Mr. Marcel!

414
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:58,208
lt's Plumpick.
Come on, lads.

415
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,746
Ho-ho, chaps.
Oh, gosh, am l glad to see you!

416
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,805
Hey, there was a general
in the ladies' hairdresser.

417
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,215
They're as gentle as lambs.
There's nothing to fear.

418
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:07,515
This bicycle--
it was a gift from the court.

419
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:09,612
You'll be happy to know
l found the blockhouse again.

420
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,555
Meaning it was previously lost,
l suppOse.

421
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,150
Yes, it was simply covered
with flowers for my coronation.

422
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:16,889
- YOur cOrOnatiOn?
- Yes, my cOrOnatiOn!

423
00:58:18,598 --> 00:58:21,658
Look, there's no time to lose. The
whole thing might blow up at any moment.

424
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:26,831
No door.
There's got to be a way out!

425
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,703
Yes, yes, grab him.
COme On!

426
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:32,768
What the hell you trying to do?
l can find it. l'm sure l can.

427
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:38,149
This way, lads.
COme On. Hurry up.

428
00:58:38,752 --> 00:58:40,481
Let's go on with it.

429
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,613
Wake me up.

430
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:14,043
Once mOre.

431
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,255
Good.

432
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:27,961
Let's get out of here.

433
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:43,547
- ls he dead?
-Just sleeping.

434
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:46,017
Exhausted by the coronation.

435
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,316
Carry him gently.

436
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:41,239
He tastes of raspberries... Taste!

437
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:52,880
Ripe raspberries.
The way l like them.

438
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:57,185
l wouldn't mind seeing
the Duke cuckolded.

439
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,825
- Cuckolded? Who?
- Nobody, dear.

440
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:06,759
We need a cuckold for the sake
of the town's equilibrium.

441
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,893
We don't have one.

442
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,801
We share and share alike.

443
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:23,072
- He must come back to us very gently.
- He must wake up happy.

444
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:25,276
l like men
who wake up happy.

445
01:01:26,786 --> 01:01:28,720
l have an idea.

446
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:36,318
Listen. What do you hear?

447
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,327
The charming ticktock
of your heart, sweetie.

448
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:49,240
A beating heart.

449
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:56,380
A secret clock.

450
01:01:56,449 --> 01:01:58,940
A heart whose beating
will blend...

451
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,487
with the heart of our king.

452
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:03,955
A woman is what he needs!

453
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,958
A woman of his own.

454
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,120
- Where can we get one?
- l sacrifice myself.

455
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:14,665
- Good girl!
- Generous soul!

456
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:17,202
Who's talking about soul?

457
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,534
No dirty words, my son.

458
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:23,667
The Duchess's buttocks
belong to the Duke.

459
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:29,147
Don't l belong to everyone?

460
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,679
lmpossible, honey!
Who'd run your house?

461
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:36,586
Do l look like a madame?

462
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:41,522
l'm foolish! l know whom he needs,
and he loves her too!

463
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:43,460
- Where is she?
- My place.

464
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,556
- The brothel?
- Let's go, on the double!

465
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:50,933
Calm down, men. This is not state
business; it's women's business.

466
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,381
Good afternoon, Your Grace!

467
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,096
Where is Poppy?

468
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:20,564
The Duchess has a favor
to ask of you.

469
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:24,463
A pearl.
lnnocent as an apple.

470
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:27,005
Please follow me.

471
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:40,353
Don't undress, child.
We're not here for that, dear.

472
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,882
Tell me, do you know men?

473
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,224
No, but l'd like to.

474
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,963
- That's why you came here?
- Yes.

475
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:55,968
l've a good chance
of finding one.

476
01:03:56,036 --> 01:03:58,800
- Who told you that?
- My little finger.

477
01:04:02,442 --> 01:04:05,878
- You haven't seen anyone else?
- NO.

478
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:07,936
She's the one we need.

479
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:12,752
Look at these curls!

480
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:15,652
She'll have to stick out
her chest more.

481
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:18,657
Head still.
Only the legs move.

482
01:04:18,725 --> 01:04:23,094
Some blue on the eyelids.
An orange blossom in her bosom.

483
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,961
- Can't l gO as l am?
- What a good idea!

484
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,759
To your fiancé, the King!

485
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:32,236
Calm down, ladies. When you want a man,
you mustn't be obvious.

486
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:35,001
- We're just so pleased.
- YOur cOat.

487
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:38,238
Just my tutu.
lt's my favorite outfit.

488
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:41,838
- You're going out like that?
- Yes, On a wire.

489
01:04:58,465 --> 01:05:00,399
The King's marrying an acrobat!

490
01:05:20,787 --> 01:05:22,721
Gentlemen, let's tiptoe out.

491
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:11,135
Who are you?

492
01:06:12,705 --> 01:06:15,265
Poppy. Your fiancée.

493
01:06:18,711 --> 01:06:20,770
Oh, yes. That's right.

494
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:28,451
- l don't need anybody.
- That's not true.

495
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:32,882
l'm a loner, like everybody,
with one idea.

496
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:34,449
TO marry me!

497
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:40,199
How did you get in?

498
01:06:42,235 --> 01:06:44,601
Through the window.

499
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:46,605
We're getting married.

500
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:51,672
l might have known.
lt's starting again.

501
01:06:51,744 --> 01:06:53,905
Yes, everything's starting.

502
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,244
l'm a little naive...

503
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:00,551
because, well...

504
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:03,622
l don't know.

505
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:06,719
l don't know.

506
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,954
But we'll make up
for lost time.

507
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,305
Lost time! What time is it?

508
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,541
6:00!

509
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,653
There's got to be a way out!
There's got to be!

510
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,318
This is madness!
l can't let it happen!

511
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,055
l've got to get in there!
l've gOt tO!

512
01:07:43,162 --> 01:07:45,221
Now we'll see some sparks fly!

513
01:07:45,698 --> 01:07:47,529
Or we'll know the reason why!

514
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:10,282
l can't take it anymore!

515
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:18,457
Why?

516
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:37,808
Don't applaud, you fools!

517
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:42,148
l'll be blown up!

518
01:08:42,221 --> 01:08:46,385
Do you know what dying means?
Do you have any idea?

519
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:47,517
NO.

520
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,897
Listen. The enemy--

521
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,593
- Where is he?
- My army will charge.

522
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:56,601
No, l'll speak to him!

523
01:08:56,669 --> 01:08:58,796
l doubt it, but no matter.

524
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:04,202
Listen. There are bombs
wired here.

525
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:07,804
Time bombs.

526
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:13,318
Before midnight,
in a little while...

527
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:16,719
a spark-- explosion!

528
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:20,188
lt's all over!

529
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,322
Who cares?

530
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:25,896
l do!

531
01:09:25,965 --> 01:09:31,028
lf you need to examine
all the ticktocks, we'll get them.

532
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,665
What are you doing?

533
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:10,607
This is the last one, l assure you.

534
01:10:11,611 --> 01:10:14,045
- Leave it.
- ls that an order?

535
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:18,908
- lt's my royal pleasure.
- Well, in that case...

536
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:36,092
At last, you're laughing!

537
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:37,932
lt's just nerves.

538
01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:39,869
Your Majesty, your balloon.

539
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:41,873
You can keep these balloons!

540
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:45,073
l burst his balloon,
and he claps!

541
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:46,941
What characters!

542
01:10:47,013 --> 01:10:49,504
l can't let you die.

543
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:52,676
COme On.
l'll take you all with me!

544
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:58,453
- To the sea?
- No, to the snow.

545
01:10:58,524 --> 01:11:00,992
To a candy store?

546
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,994
On vacation? ls it far?

547
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:04,495
Yes, very far.

548
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:07,658
We'll pass the lines,
then take a train, a boat--

549
01:11:07,733 --> 01:11:11,999
- To an island?
- To the other side of the sea.

550
01:11:12,071 --> 01:11:15,404
- On horseback?
- Yes. Follow me!

551
01:11:16,642 --> 01:11:18,701
Here's the King's horse!

552
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:21,804
Don't leave me all alone!

553
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:00,541
Come along.

554
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,652
Follow me.

555
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,689
Sir, come back.

556
01:12:16,335 --> 01:12:19,304
There are wild beasts!

557
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:22,933
Can't you hear them?
They're bloodthirsty.

558
01:12:25,311 --> 01:12:27,006
You must come with me.

559
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:30,378
There's a wall between us
and the world out there.

560
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:32,644
lt's too dangerous.

561
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:35,551
Come on, for the last time!

562
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:37,114
Charles!

563
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,159
You have no idea how wicked
they are out there!

564
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:40,743
He's come back!

565
01:13:48,995 --> 01:13:50,519
Look. There he is.

566
01:13:58,604 --> 01:14:02,700
Sire, what's the point of traveling
when everything you want is at home?

567
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:06,003
Long live the King
on my word as a duke.

568
01:14:06,078 --> 01:14:08,569
Duke?
Who made you a duke?

569
01:14:08,648 --> 01:14:10,582
Who made you a king?

570
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:14,086
Brother, yesterday
you were in an asylum!

571
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:20,787
Are you jealous?

572
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,794
And you, Mr. King, yesterday...

573
01:14:24,397 --> 01:14:26,922
you were outside
with ''the others.''

574
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:29,126
Gentlemen, the King's polka.

575
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:31,533
Brilliant idea!

576
01:14:33,272 --> 01:14:35,206
A polka for a king.

577
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:52,048
What's wrong? We didn't
say anything offensive.

578
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:53,853
Who needs a king?

579
01:14:53,926 --> 01:14:57,293
- We're all equal!
- You and your communist ideas!

580
01:14:57,363 --> 01:14:59,729
- Tempers.
- Enough!

581
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:03,257
You're right, sweetheart.
Let's calm down.

582
01:16:20,045 --> 01:16:24,482
Marie, everything is simple,
even dying.

583
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,983
HOW?

584
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:29,350
Just close your eyes
and never open them again.

585
01:16:29,422 --> 01:16:31,913
But if l shut my eyes...

586
01:16:31,991 --> 01:16:35,392
l can no longer see
trees or flowers...

587
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,928
or your lovely moustache.

588
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:43,093
l love its prickly caress.

589
01:16:43,169 --> 01:16:46,229
Was l born for a love duet?

590
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:49,433
Yes. We've been cuddling
for 1 1 0 years!

591
01:16:49,508 --> 01:16:52,705
We've been together
for quite some time.

592
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:06,950
What a gracious hour, Your Grace.

593
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:09,620
You know why l've been
coming up here...

594
01:17:12,097 --> 01:17:14,725
every evening since...

595
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,132
My God, l was so young!

596
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:19,899
l already knew that
to love the world...

597
01:17:20,973 --> 01:17:23,100
you have to get away from it.

598
01:17:25,277 --> 01:17:29,111
Have you ever noticed, Hyacinth...

599
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:31,115
how peaceful it all is...

600
01:17:31,183 --> 01:17:34,277
on the eve of a battle?

601
01:17:34,353 --> 01:17:37,117
How sweet it all seems?

602
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:39,214
HOw it rests Our cOnscience?

603
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:44,960
- GOing tO war?
- l'm thinking of it.

604
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:47,157
What army will lead you to victories?

605
01:17:48,634 --> 01:17:50,898
There's the rub!

606
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,530
Make your own army!

607
01:17:53,873 --> 01:17:55,500
HOW?

608
01:17:55,574 --> 01:17:57,906
We'll make babies for you!

609
01:17:57,977 --> 01:18:00,878
A battalion of sturdy boys!

610
01:18:00,946 --> 01:18:04,746
- Make generals.
- And a batch of pretty girls.

611
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:06,751
All in brothels,
like their mamas!

612
01:18:08,587 --> 01:18:11,613
The world's so simple. On one side men,
and on the other side women.

613
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:15,217
On one side, the whores.
On the other, the generals!

614
01:18:15,294 --> 01:18:17,728
You're right. Life is simple.

615
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:05,138
Three minutes until 1 2:00.

616
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,576
ln three minutes, it'll be over.

617
01:19:13,385 --> 01:19:15,353
l don't want to die.

618
01:19:17,256 --> 01:19:19,349
No one's ever known his own death.

619
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:23,161
There are only three minutes to live.

620
01:19:23,228 --> 01:19:25,219
Three minutes is great.

621
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:28,699
You're right.

622
01:19:39,778 --> 01:19:41,712
You'll see the knight come out.

623
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,275
The knight comes out at midnight.

624
01:19:47,353 --> 01:19:49,344
- Where?
- Up there.

625
01:19:50,456 --> 01:19:52,924
On the clock. At midnight.

626
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:56,861
The password!

627
01:20:52,418 --> 01:20:54,716
Saved!

628
01:21:01,193 --> 01:21:02,524
We are saved!

629
01:21:33,092 --> 01:21:35,754
Good work, men.

630
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:37,762
l've done these sorts
of things before.

631
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:54,145
Long live the Queen!

632
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:07,024
Midnight?

633
01:22:09,294 --> 01:22:12,695
Good show.
Pumpernickel pulled it off.

634
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:16,759
The man's a hero.
The town is ours.

635
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:22,939
Any more of your drunken ravings,
MacFish, and l'll have you locked up.

636
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:27,137
- Be thankful l'm in a good mood, man.
- Sir!

637
01:22:27,212 --> 01:22:29,407
- Forward, Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

638
01:22:29,481 --> 01:22:33,884
Company, prepare to fall in!

639
01:22:33,986 --> 01:22:36,978
Fall in!

640
01:22:49,134 --> 01:22:52,433
Five minutes after midnight!
Five minutes late!

641
01:22:52,504 --> 01:22:54,938
Nothing went off, Hamburger!

642
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:59,205
- You checked the bombs?
- Yes, sir!

643
01:22:59,278 --> 01:23:01,405
SOrry.

644
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,381
Lieutenant!
Take him away!

645
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:07,882
Retreat!

646
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:10,649
Retreat!

647
01:23:33,045 --> 01:23:35,479
l want to make love.

648
01:23:35,547 --> 01:23:38,573
With a king?
You're not afraid?

649
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:42,884
You must be marvelous.

650
01:23:42,955 --> 01:23:44,946
Tell me later.

651
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:04,729
The soldiers!

652
01:25:39,738 --> 01:25:42,571
Good show, Pumpernickel.
First rate.Jolly good.

653
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:44,632
Yes. Sir, l couldn't have done it
without them, sir.

654
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:49,477
l must say, how fiendishly clever.
That bit about the chimpanzee.

655
01:25:49,548 --> 01:25:52,381
l was worried that the townspeople
are a wee bit on the--

656
01:25:52,484 --> 01:25:56,784
Love to see the Jerry's face
who intercepted that messenger, eh?

657
01:25:56,855 --> 01:26:01,349
Surely, sir, the men you sent
after me must have told you that--

658
01:26:01,426 --> 01:26:05,328
You think l'd listen to anything
that dipsomaniac has to say?

659
01:26:06,365 --> 01:26:08,697
- MacFish!
- Yes, sir!

660
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,392
We'll bivouac here.

661
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:12,869
- Here, sir?
- Yes.

662
01:26:14,339 --> 01:26:16,671
The Duke, the Duchess, my wife.

663
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:18,676
An old bat, but l love her.

664
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:25,308
l'd love to curl myself
around that cute moustache!

665
01:26:25,984 --> 01:26:29,818
- Sir, l really must explain to you--
- Later, please, Pumpernickel. Later.

666
01:26:32,257 --> 01:26:34,282
Pleased to meet you, General.

667
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:38,324
Long live France!

668
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,933
- Let's celebrate!
- l don't have the time.

669
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:46,994
DOn't waste it.

670
01:26:48,473 --> 01:26:52,375
MacFish! Overnight pass
for all the troops, Sergeant Major!

671
01:26:57,749 --> 01:27:01,276
Give me a moment to change
into decent clothes.

672
01:27:33,151 --> 01:27:35,016
Sir, l must explain to you.

673
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:39,319
Later, Pumpernickel, later.
l'm too busy listening to the music.

674
01:27:57,676 --> 01:27:59,268
What's under their kilts?

675
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:01,811
Nothing!

676
01:28:02,714 --> 01:28:04,614
You mean everything!

677
01:28:12,023 --> 01:28:14,514
This is the greatest day of my life!

678
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:16,561
l'd like fireworks!

679
01:28:16,962 --> 01:28:18,862
- MacFish.
- Yes, sir!

680
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,830
- You heard the lady.
- NO, sir!

681
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:24,926
- We would like a display of fireworks.
- What shall l use for fireworks, sir?

682
01:28:25,003 --> 01:28:27,301
Cannon, mortar, powder.

683
01:28:27,372 --> 01:28:30,773
Good heaven, man.
l have to do all your thinking for you?

684
01:29:18,156 --> 01:29:19,521
Look, Colonel!

685
01:29:24,396 --> 01:29:28,992
Victory! The town has blown up!
Everyone is dead!

686
01:29:29,067 --> 01:29:31,627
Yes, but Hamburger is, too.

687
01:29:31,703 --> 01:29:34,900
The lron Cross is precious.
Even posthumously.

688
01:30:37,102 --> 01:30:40,560
My life is at your feet.
What would you like?

689
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:45,434
Another ice cream,
a pretty ring...

690
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:47,307
and a parade.

691
01:30:49,514 --> 01:30:52,711
Here's the parade.

692
01:30:52,784 --> 01:30:54,945
ln any case,
it's time to leave.

693
01:31:01,293 --> 01:31:03,921
- Fall the company in.
- Sir!

694
01:31:05,096 --> 01:31:08,224
Company, fall in!

695
01:31:10,101 --> 01:31:11,625
On the double!

696
01:31:18,476 --> 01:31:21,036
Plumpick, fall in behind the church.

697
01:31:23,014 --> 01:31:25,073
l'll be waiting at Hyacinth's brothel.

698
01:31:25,984 --> 01:31:29,750
Don't be afraid. l'll return
covered with medals.

699
01:31:31,423 --> 01:31:33,220
Hurry up, Plumpick.

700
01:31:35,226 --> 01:31:36,659
Good-bye, Poppy!

701
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:44,028
Make way for the parade!

702
01:32:06,057 --> 01:32:08,821
Company, shoulder arms!

703
01:32:18,536 --> 01:32:20,128
The King is going to war.

704
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,864
You're letting him go?

705
01:32:23,942 --> 01:32:25,933
Yes, he's going to get medals!

706
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:30,747
What next?

707
01:32:31,516 --> 01:32:33,177
Say good-bye to His Majesty.

708
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:36,982
Let's kiss him and bring him
to the parade!

709
01:32:48,433 --> 01:32:52,733
Company, forward march!

710
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:20,964
Let me go! l have to leave.

711
01:33:45,123 --> 01:33:48,650
- More of them!
- All over the place, like rats!

712
01:34:12,016 --> 01:34:13,847
They act like
they don't know each other.

713
01:34:13,918 --> 01:34:16,352
Of course not...
they're foreign regiments.

714
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,902
- No umbrellas?
- The last bouquet!

715
01:35:12,143 --> 01:35:14,805
Clear out, or you'll all get it!

716
01:35:23,254 --> 01:35:24,551
Fire!

717
01:35:39,203 --> 01:35:41,763
Surrender!
Never!

718
01:35:51,683 --> 01:35:55,881
Don't you think these actors are
a bit over the top?

719
01:35:57,622 --> 01:35:59,146
What funny people.

720
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:23,106
Thousands of soldiers,
cannOns...

721
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:26,480
autos, coming from
every direction.

722
01:36:28,753 --> 01:36:31,085
What on earth can it be?

723
01:36:34,525 --> 01:36:36,516
The ''liberators.''

724
01:36:37,595 --> 01:36:39,529
This joke has lasted long enough.

725
01:36:39,597 --> 01:36:41,030
Let's go to bed.

726
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:44,660
Your Majesty, we leave you
with your people.

727
01:36:48,172 --> 01:36:49,799
Good-bye, Charles.

728
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:08,124
Come. Let's go home.

729
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,451
General, my town kept faith.

730
01:39:32,703 --> 01:39:34,637
YOu are receiving an army citatiOn.

731
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:37,299
Your bird too.
An A-1 winged creature.

732
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:41,573
Rare bird and soldier.
Brave and astute.

733
01:39:41,646 --> 01:39:43,876
You pulverized your enemy.

734
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:52,782
Good job.

735
01:39:52,857 --> 01:39:55,985
And l would like...

736
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,756
to add my own embrace
to that...

737
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:02,163
which the president
of the Republic sends you.

738
01:40:08,406 --> 01:40:12,240
Plumpick, you're going up
to the front again immediately.

739
01:40:13,444 --> 01:40:15,537
The Jerries are still holding on
to this town...

740
01:40:15,613 --> 01:40:17,945
and we're going to blow it sky-high.

741
01:41:10,268 --> 01:41:12,031
What now?

742
01:41:27,752 --> 01:41:31,984
- lt's yOur turn, YOur Majesty.
- l still don't understand the rules.

743
01:41:32,056 --> 01:41:33,785
There aren't any.

744
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:39,425
Well, you're here now.
And you won't be running off anymore.

745
01:41:39,497 --> 01:41:41,522
l'm staying here, General.

746
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:44,261
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Smart thinking.

747
01:41:49,707 --> 01:41:52,301
The most beautiful journeys...

748
01:41:53,044 --> 01:41:55,808
are taken through the window.
