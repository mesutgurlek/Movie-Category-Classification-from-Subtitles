and a very good conversationalist.

1677
01:57:24,051 --> 01:57:25,518
Huh.

1678
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,289
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

1679
01:57:29,456 --> 01:57:32,084
...I almost died in that goddamn room.

1680
01:57:32,259 --> 01:57:35,888
And if you had died,
I would have told her what you did for her.

1681
01:57:36,063 --> 01:57:40,261
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1682
01:57:40,934 --> 01:57:44,301
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1683
01:57:44,972 --> 01:57:47,463
That's great news.

1684
01:57:49,943 --> 01:57:51,968
Fantastic work, Hani.

1685
01:57:52,145 --> 01:57:54,170
Really. Excellent.

1686
01:57:55,182 --> 01:57:57,343
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1687
01:57:58,185 --> 01:58:00,050
That was the plan, my dear.

1688
01:58:01,855 --> 01:58:05,552
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1689
01:58:05,726 --> 01:58:07,284
Not yet.

1690
01:58:19,273 --> 01:58:21,400
HOFFMAN:
Your work's done here, buddy.

1691
01:58:21,842 --> 01:58:24,242
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1692
01:58:24,411 --> 01:58:26,538
...just down the hall from mine.

1693
01:58:26,713 --> 01:58:29,978
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1694
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:32,380
More money, a fancy title.

1695
01:58:32,552 --> 01:58:36,352
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1696
01:58:36,523 --> 01:58:40,254
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1697
01:58:40,427 --> 01:58:44,523
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1698
01:58:45,265 --> 01:58:48,200
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1699
01:58:48,368 --> 01:58:49,767
Hm.

1700
01:58:49,937 --> 01:58:54,499
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1701
01:58:54,675 --> 01:58:57,701
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1702
01:58:57,878 --> 01:58:59,903
Why would you?

1703
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,239
What if I like the Middle East?

1704
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:03,610
[CHUCKLING]

1705
01:59:03,784 --> 01:59:07,584
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1706
01:59:08,055 --> 01:59:09,613
Hmm.

1707
01:59:10,023 --> 01:59:13,117
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

1708
01:59:14,628 --> 01:59:15,993
Hm.

1709
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:18,355
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1710
01:59:18,532 --> 01:59:22,696
You know, you're the best I got.

1711
01:59:22,869 --> 01:59:24,598
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1712
01:59:27,607 --> 01:59:30,667
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1713
01:59:30,844 --> 01:59:34,575
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1714
01:59:39,886 --> 01:59:41,786
You're not safe here.

1715
01:59:41,955 --> 01:59:43,718
I'm not safe anywhere.

1716
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:45,983
HOFFMAN: You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1717
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,059
What does that mean?

1718
01:59:49,129 --> 01:59:51,063
That means you're giving up
on America.

1719
01:59:51,732 --> 01:59:55,327
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1720
01:59:56,203 --> 02:00:00,867
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1721
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:03,441
HOFFMAN:
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

1722
02:01:23,423 --> 02:01:24,447
HOFFMAN:
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1723
02:01:24,624 --> 02:01:26,353
MAN:
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

1724
02:01:27,494 --> 02:01:30,395
<i>What about us, sir?</i>
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

1725
02:01:30,564 --> 02:01:32,156
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

1726
02:01:32,332 --> 02:01:35,199
No. Buddy's done.

1727
02:01:35,368 --> 02:01:36,926
He's all by himself.

1728
02:01:37,104 --> 02:01:40,471
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>

1729
02:08:12,799 --> 02:08:14,790
