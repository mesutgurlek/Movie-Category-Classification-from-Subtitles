BILL BASCH: There is one thing
that has puzzled me...

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,673
and has puzzled the world--

4
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:30,483
that the Germans dedicated
manpower and trains...

5
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,285
and trucks and energy...

6
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:37,090
towards the destruction of
the Jews through the last day.

7
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,757
Had they stopped six months
before the end of the war...

8
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:43,892
and dedicated that energy

9
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,198
towards strengthening
themselves...

10
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,762
they may have carried on the war
a little longer.

11
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:52,674
But it was more important
to them to kill the Jews...

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,940
than even winning the war.

13
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:07,077
IRENE ZISBLATT: I grew up
in a town called Polena...

14
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,414
in the Carpathian mountains.

15
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:11,478
It was a small town
of two main streets.

16
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,581
This leads all the way up to--

17
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,990
There is a church over there.
You can't see it.

18
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:19,484
We had a post office,
and we had a town hall...

19
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,624
and we had a church
and a synagogue.

20
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,258
Everybody knew each other.

21
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:26,360
It was beautiful.

22
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:29,770
I lived
in a town called Uzhorod.

23
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,674
It was a small town...

24
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,171
yet it had the feel
of a big cosmopolitan town.

25
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:41,013
Right here was a little deli.

26
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,747
Right around...
Right here.

27
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,311
And...

28
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:50,956
We used to come here...

29
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:53,896
to have our sandwiches
for the afternoon.

30
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,394
ALICE LOK CAHANA: We lived
in a town called Sarvar.

31
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:05,272
It's in Hungary,
close to the Austrian border.

32
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:09,703
Every day, the peasants
would bring their wares...

33
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:13,649
from the neighboring villages
in big baskets...

34
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:18,212
and they would carry them
on their head or shoulders.

35
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,883
Szaszovo was a very small,
little community...

36
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:26,294
consisting of 3,000 people.

37
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,959
No electricity
and no utilities at all.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,094
So it was a very simplistic,
boring life.

39
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,729
Nothing exciting.

40
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:39,368
But then Budapest,
where I ended up...

41
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,708
was an entirely different life.

42
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,179
It was an enormous adjustment.

43
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:48,173
I looked at this city,
and I said, "Wow."

44
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:52,052
It was like--I never believed
anything like this exists.

45
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:57,022
TOM LANTOS:
Budapest was a magnificent...

46
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,052
world-class city...

47
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,691
on par with
Vienna or Paris or London...

48
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,701
as a great European capital.

49
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,636
This magnificent
Parliament building...

50
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:12,108
saw the best and the worst
in Hungarian history.

51
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:15,873
The bulk of the Jews
in Budapest...

52
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:19,644
were utterly assimilated,
deeply patriotic...

53
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:24,484
and enormously proud of their
Hungarian cultural heritage.

54
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:29,185
There were about 800
Jewish families in our town...

55
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:36,462
and I think that the town
was 10 or 11,000 non-Jews.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,992
I had non-Jewish friends.
I dated non-Jewish boys.

57
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:42,631
My parents
had non-Jewish friends.

58
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:46,507
We also felt quite Hungarian
at the same time...

59
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,010
not just Jewish.

60
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:52,846
So Judaism was our religion,
but we were Hungarians.

NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
On August 2, 1934...

62
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:59,452
officers and men
swear the oath of allegiance...

63
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,618
not to Germany,
but to Hitler personally.

64
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,960
2nd NARRATOR: As Hitler's rule
over Germany became absolute...

65
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:09,295
to his alarmed neighbor
Austria...

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,961
Hitler promised
to keep hands off.

67
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:15,096
TOM: ln 1938,
when I was ten years old...

68
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,334
I bought my first newspaper.

69
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:20,138
And I saw the headlines--

70
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:23,044
"Hitler Marches lnto Austria"--

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,211
and I sensed that
this historic moment...

72
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,311
will have a tremendous impact...

73
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,822
on the lives
of Hungarian Jews...

74
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,824
my family, and myself.

and the free state of Danzig.

Warsaw is bombed,
blasted, and shelled.

77
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,058
Poland is in ruins.

78
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:56,243
RENEE: There were refugees
coming to Hungary...

79
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,748
running away from Poland.

80
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,148
And most
of the Jewish families--

81
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:04,052
Friday night,
the men went to temple...

82
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,852
to bring these people home
and give them shelter.

83
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,120
They would come
and tell stories...

84
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,755
and I remember, very often...

85
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:16,593
we didn't believe them.

86
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:20,694
I heard a conversation between
my father and another man...

87
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,070
and he was telling my father...

88
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,405
what the Nazis
are doing in Poland.

89
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:28,309
And one thing that
l'll never forget that I heard--

90
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,607
And he said...

91
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:33,514
"The Nazis are taking
our young Jewish infants...

92
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,646
"and they're tearing them
in half by their legs...

93
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,952
"and they're throwing them
in the Dniester."

94
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,220
The Dniester
is a river in the Ukraine.

95
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,719
Then later, of course,
the stories were getting worse.

96
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:52,794
We began to hear about
mass shootings into mass graves.

97
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:56,704
But there was
a sort of a naive--

98
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,538
I hate to use the word,
but I have to--

99
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:05,310
patriotic feeling that we
Hungarians don't do such things.

100
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,816
Hitler was in Germany...

101
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,581
so what happened in Germany
didn't reflect on us.

102
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,749
We were far away from it.

103
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,009
DR. RANDOLPH BRAHAM:
There were two wars.

104
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,186
There was a military war...

105
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,448
There was a military war...

106
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,854
and hand-in-hand
with that war...

107
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,414
there was a second war--

108
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,825
the war of the SS
directed against the Jews.

109
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,883
[Gunshots]

110
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:34,068
The dark side of the Hungarian
national character...

111
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,166
was becoming
more and more obvious.

112
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,667
The persecution of Jews
became more and more obvious.

113
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,204
Jews were losing their jobs,
their businesses.

114
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:46,707
There was a Hungarian Nazi
movement, the Arrow Cross...

115
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,517
and this became, of course...

116
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:55,495
the most hated and feared group
for Hungarian Jews.

117
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:03,034
RENEE: People wonder how is it
that we didn't do something.

118
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:06,197
We didn't run away.
We didn't hide.

119
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,764
Well, things
didn't happen at once.

120
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:11,470
Things happened very slowly.

121
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:15,948
So each time a new law came out
or a restriction...

122
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:20,510
we said, "Just another thing.
It'll blow over."

123
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,750
TOM: Hitler moved into Hungary
on March 19, 1944.

124
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:31,696
I was sixteen years old.

125
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:35,326
1944. March 19th.

126
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:39,566
Germans entered.
SS entered our town.

127
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,871
IRENE: Two motorcycles
was the whole Nazi regime...

128
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,103
that occupied our town.

129
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,202
Because
they were already there...

130
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,407
with the people that lived there
the whole time...

131
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,779
and did their dirty work.

132
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:52,341
Most of them were people...

133
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,546
that we thought were our friends
all these years...

134
00:09:54,587 --> 00:10:00,116
but they turned overnight on us
and went with the other side.

135
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,026
And the next restriction...

136
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,587
was that the Jew cannot walk
out on the street...

137
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,361
without a yellow star.

138
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,992
We heard that in Germany...

139
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:13,096
they had to wear the yellow star
before they were taken away.

140
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,004
And in Poland, they did that.

141
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:19,444
So at that point,
we were worried.

142
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,039
TOM:
I did not wear a yellow star...

143
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,881
and I was caught.

144
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:29,217
I was put into
a forced-labor camp...

145
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,122
in a place north of Budapest...

146
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:34,353
which had
an important railroad bridge.

147
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:41,898
And our job
was to repair the railroads...

148
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,963
the lines, the bridges--
nonstop--

149
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:50,237
while the British and Americans
were bombing day and night.

150
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:53,404
We were obviously worried
that we would die...

151
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:57,007
but we were also hoping
that the bombers...

152
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,248
will hit all of their targets
and destroy this bridge...

153
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:05,621
because that was the way
to defeat Hitler.

154
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,853
I escaped
from that labor camp...

155
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:12,797
and I joined
the Hungarian underground.

156
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:18,395
And the next decree would be
we have to pack up 25 kilos.

157
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,463
And at first,
we didn't understand.

158
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:21,973
What do you take?

159
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:25,034
Think about your home,
your own home.

160
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,069
What would you take?
Twenty-five kilo.

161
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:32,346
What is twenty-five kilo?
How much is twenty-five kilo?

162
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,819
Do you take the pillows?
Do you take your covers?

163
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:37,322
Do you take your dishes?

164
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,120
What do you take?

165
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:42,594
When we were packing...

166
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:47,588
I wanted to take something
to remind me of the good times.

167
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:53,230
I was very depressed
and worried.

168
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:56,503
And so I came across
a bathing suit...

169
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,807
a bathing suit that...

170
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:02,144
my father brought me.

171
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:07,915
I don't want to do this.

172
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:24,202
On one of his business trips
about three years earlier...

173
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,171
my father came home...

174
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,663
and he always brought us
something...

175
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,507
my sister and myself.

176
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,773
And...

177
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:38,049
of course we always asked,
"What did you bring?"

178
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,712
And he opened this box...

179
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:44,553
and out of the box came this
most beautiful bathing suit.

180
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,048
It had a shiny satin finish...

181
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:52,531
and a print
of multicolored flowers.

182
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,533
And then in the afternoon...

183
00:12:54,567 --> 00:13:00,437
when I heard the soldiers' boots
coming up the stairs...

184
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:04,432
I ran back and put this
bathing suit under my dress.

185
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,869
And that's how I left.

186
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,881
They broke down the front doors.
They came in.

187
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,441
They gave us a few minutes--

188
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:15,420
they said a half hour,
but it was not a half hour--

189
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:18,822
to get all our valuables
together...

190
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:21,053
and they marched us
out of the house.

191
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:26,858
ALICE:
I couldn't imagine...

192
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,800
that they'd just take out
people from their homes...

193
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,335
because they are Jewish.

194
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:37,570
Our friends, so-called,
and neighbors...

195
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,239
they were standing lined up
alongside of the road...

196
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,181
and they were yelling,
"It's about time."

197
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:45,741
"You go on out of here."

198
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:48,117
And "We don't need
any Jews in our town."

199
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,588
"We need to get rid
of all you Jews."

200
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:55,322
And I stood, and I could not
believe my eyes.

201
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:59,229
The people I went to school
with, their children...

202
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:02,257
We were friends.
We were sharing things together.

203
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,734
Why are they so hostile?

204
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,760
Why do they hate us
all of a sudden?

205
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:10,071
It's like when you read that
the Jews went out of Egypt.

206
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,940
We are carrying all our baggage.

207
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:15,709
The pillows and the covers
are tied in a bundle...

208
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:18,774
and we children helped
to carry it.

209
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,217
And I'm so ashamed.

210
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:24,121
RENEE: We wanted to believe
they're taking us to Germany...

211
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,714
and that we're going to work.

212
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,487
We really wanted to believe.

213
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:28,789
And by then...

214
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:34,789
the whole European Jewry
was already in camps...

215
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,158
which we didn't know.

216
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,192
The concentration,
ghettoization...

217
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:42,891
and deportation took place
in a concentrated manner--

218
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,924
that is, within twelve weeks.

219
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,335
And nowhere else...

220
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,772
was the deportation program
carried out...

221
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:59,942
with the barbarity and speed
that it was in Hungary.

222
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,712
They said that
they will take us to a ghetto.

223
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,049
I mean, we never hear that word.

224
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,181
It is not a Hungarian word.
"Ghetto."

225
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,590
RENEE:
We had no idea where we were.

226
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:13,026
ln the morning,
when we woke up...

227
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:16,589
I realized
that we are in a brickyard...

228
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,463
a brick-factory yard.

229
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,761
And in April, it was rainy.
It was a lot of rain.

230
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,933
And we were always--

231
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:29,069
We had to change the sheets,
because the roof was sheets...

232
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,908
and we were always wet.

233
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,880
There were thousands
of people there...

234
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:36,544
because they came
from the whole county.

235
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:39,452
And there were guards
everywhere with dogs...

236
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,388
walking around all the time.

237
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:46,292
Big German shepherd dogs
on very, very tight leashes.

238
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,162
This was all just these huts
with people all over.

239
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,497
ROBlN: Do you know
where your hut was?

240
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,266
IRENE: Yes. My hut was right
where these piles of bricks are.

241
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:57,431
[Irene crying]

242
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,065
And then one day,
they announced...

243
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,236
that everybody
that wants to go to work--

244
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,247
to Tokaj and the vineyard
to make wine--

245
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,771
should come on the train.

246
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:11,411
And everybody, voluntary,
gladly went on the train...

247
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,683
because this was hell.

248
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,681
And going to work in a vineyard
was like going to heaven.

249
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,092
We were taken
to the railroad station...

250
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,461
by the Hungarian soldiers.

251
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,398
IRENE:
My mother said to me...

252
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,459
"I rolled up diamonds
in your skirt--

253
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,698
"in the hem of your skirt--

254
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,605
"and if you don't have enough
to eat...

255
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:34,768
"those are to buy bread."

256
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,937
When we arrived
at the railroad station...

257
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:41,712
we realized that we're not going
on passenger trains.

258
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,378
The cattle cars
were waiting for us.

259
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,945
IRENE: My father said they
ran out of the other trains--

260
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:50,516
because there's wartime
they don't have other trains...

261
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,992
so they have to use
what they have.

262
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:55,758
ALICE: Anybody who didn't go
and didn't go fast was beaten.

263
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,266
IRENE:
When they closed the doors--

264
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,892
when I heard
that knock on the outside...

265
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,802
like a bolt
closing us in there--

266
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:04,635
it wasn't normal anymore.

267
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:08,234
I didn't accept they were
running out of the other trains.

268
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:16,083
BILL: ln Budapest, as times
started getting worse...

269
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,316
I really had to acquire
gentile papers.

270
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,120
I did not exist as a Jew.

271
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,626
I would have been shot.
I would have been killed.

272
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:32,328
You were a hunted animal
twenty-four hours every day...

273
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,832
and you didn't know
if anybody you encountered...

274
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,805
was really on your side.

275
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,308
Had it not been
for Wallenberg...

276
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,334
neither I nor
the other tens of thousands...

277
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,779
would have ever survived.

278
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,114
Raoul Wallenberg arrived
when all of Hungary...

279
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,418
with the exception of Budapest,
was already free of Jews.

280
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:58,415
He went to Budapest at a time
when, in the countryside...

281
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,759
the Jews had already been
put into cattle cars...

282
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,662
and shipped away from Hungary.

283
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:07,260
And he decided to join
the Swedish embassy there...

284
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,761
for the sole purpose
of trying to save Jewish lives.

285
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:15,399
By issuing so-called
Swedish protective passports...

286
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:18,572
he declared that the individual
who had this document...

287
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:21,481
at the end of the war,
planned to go to Sweden.

288
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,109
This was pure fiction.

289
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:26,679
But in the chaos
and the confusion of the war...

290
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:31,091
this miraculous,
worthless piece of paper worked.

291
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:35,392
BILL: Several of us acted
as distributors or runners...

292
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:38,525
to deliver this fake passport...

293
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,832
to the people that were waiting
in those protected houses.

294
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,966
TOM: Wallenberg leased
large apartment houses...

295
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:51,446
put up a Swedish sign indicating
that all the residents...

296
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,540
were under the protection
of the Royal Swedish government.

297
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:59,350
I stayed at St. Steven Park,
number twenty-five.

298
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,323
[Speaking Hungarian]

299
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,825
Most of these houses...

300
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:07,124
were upper middle-class
apartment houses.

301
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:12,156
And a 3-bedroom apartment that
may have had 4, 5, 6 people...

302
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,931
living there
before this crisis...

303
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,270
suddenly became a hovel
with sixty, seventy people...

304
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,869
jammed into
a three-bedroom apartment.

305
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,776
GIRL:
Very uncomfortable.

306
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,644
TOM: Well, it was
very uncomfortable, honey...

307
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,311
but, more importantly,
it was unbelievably dangerous.

308
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,378
The word "protected house"
obviously is a misnomer...

309
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:39,420
because many people living
in these "protected houses"...

310
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,758
were rounded up...

311
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,924
taken to the bank of the Danube
and killed.

312
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:50,535
Now, to get into
the protected houses...

313
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,737
was not difficult.

314
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,471
The soldiers didn't care.

315
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:57,911
They were out in the front.
"Go in there."

316
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,642
However, to come out...

317
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,582
that was the very, very
difficult thing.

318
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,246
lf German soldiers...

319
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,724
or Hungarian Nazi soldiers
were suspicious...

320
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,522
they ordered us
to take down our pants...

321
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:16,964
because we were the only people
who were circumcised.

322
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,934
One day, I had on my body,
strapped around...

323
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,199
the fake passports I was
delivering to these people...

324
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:25,001
so they could get out
of the building...

325
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,099
and I miscalculated.

326
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,772
I went through the sewer line,
and I knew when to get out...

327
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,782
and I made a mistake.

328
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,684
lnstead of coming out
in the middle of the building...

329
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,687
I came out
in front of the building...

330
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:43,157
where two soldiers
were guarding the building.

331
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:46,059
I started running
as fast as I could...

332
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:47,391
crossing the street
back and forth.

333
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,364
And they were deporting
a group of Jews.

334
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,390
Not knowing where
they are taking them...

335
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,959
I jumped
into that group of Jews...

336
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,598
thinking, just as I got in
so many times into trouble...

337
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,905
l'll get out one more time.
This is just one more escape.

338
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:05,209
We wound up five days later
in Buchenwald.

339
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:12,085
IRENE: We were on the train
for about five days.

340
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,715
ALICE: Sitting on a heap of
luggage that we carried there.

341
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:19,784
The cattle car I was in,
there was about 120 of us.

342
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:23,423
Mashed together like sardines,
and it's very, very hot.

343
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:27,231
They had one pail
for going to the bathroom.

344
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,533
And suddenly
the bucket filled up...

345
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,903
and then the odor
was unbearable.

346
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,239
They never opened the doors
to go to the bathroom.

347
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:38,337
They never gave us
any water or any food.

348
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,075
The children were screaming.
They wanted to go home.

349
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:44,076
Where are they taking us?

350
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,579
Nobody answers.

351
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:48,173
It was total darkness.

352
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:52,482
The light seeped only through
the cracks of the cattle car.

353
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,115
IRENE: My father found
a crack in the cattle train...

354
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:58,250
and he looked out,
and he just spoke out loud...

355
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,489
"I don't think
we're going to the vineyard...

356
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,326
"because we just
crossed the border...

357
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,491
"and we're heading
towards Poland."

358
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,262
And when he said Poland...

359
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:10,862
I remembered the man's story
about the children...

360
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:13,066
what they're doing
to the children in Poland.

361
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,709
I was holding my little brother,
two and half years old...

362
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:20,043
and I was holding him
so tight...

363
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:24,211
and I said to myself,
"I will never let him go.

364
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:26,311
"They will never
take him from me."

365
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:28,845
When they opened the doors
suddenly...

366
00:22:30,124 --> 00:22:32,820
and suddenly the light hit you--

367
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:37,792
and because you had your eyes
for four or five days shut...

368
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:41,632
or used to this darkness,
you're almost blinded.

369
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,536
We were so happy because
we were going to get air.

370
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,166
We were going to get off
and maybe go to the bathroom...

371
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,675
like normal people...

372
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,506
and have water
and maybe some food.

373
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:53,275
And everybody would ask,
"Where are we?"

374
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,248
"What is the name?"

375
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:58,013
And it was a very strange name--

376
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,212
Auschwitz.

377
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,096
Here we had to be stopped.
Here was stopped.

378
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,966
Here was a lot of selection
happened.

379
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,765
MICHAEL: So you're all
standing in a line...

380
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:19,864
ALICE: Thousands of people,
and close to each other.

381
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:22,102
And confusion and noise.

382
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:25,203
And "Don't move and don't..."

383
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:29,273
Like soldiers,
standing straight, you see.

384
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,616
And in the middle
would the SS go here...

385
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:34,621
to check all of us...

386
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:37,123
walking their dogs
and just threatening.

387
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:38,455
MICHAEL: ln single file?

388
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,461
Or were there people
standing next to you?

389
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,122
-Five.
-Five in a row.

390
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,791
ALICE: So it was easy to count.
Right.

391
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,300
RENEE: When I jumped off
the cattle car...

392
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:50,793
I knew right away that
whatever they promised us...

393
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,238
whatever they told us,
were lies.

394
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:55,799
And you see
a lot of people running...

395
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:59,370
in striped clothes
and shaved heads.

396
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:03,474
Surrounded by Nazi soldiers
and vicious dogs.

397
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:06,510
They were yelling,
and they were screaming.

398
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:08,454
"Just hurry up.
Leave all your luggage there.

399
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,786
"Just leave everything."

400
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,590
All of a sudden,
there was a separation.

401
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:15,687
And my mother and my--

402
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,694
My mother and--

403
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:26,940
And my brother and my sister--

404
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:30,432
She held my little brother
in her arms--in one arm...

405
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:33,447
and my 4 1/2-year-old sister
in her hand--

406
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,142
and I was holding
on to her hand...

407
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,447
and this is how
we were walking towards--

408
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:40,579
They were pushing us
towards that destination.

409
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,550
[Speaking German]

410
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,818
RENEE: My mother was selected
at the railroad station.

411
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:24,160
"Go to the left"--

412
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,598
while my sister and I
went to the right.

413
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:30,001
My mother was taken straight
from the railroad station...

414
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,664
to the gas chambers.

415
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:35,699
By the time my sister and I
were processed into the camp...

416
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,938
my mother was no longer alive.

417
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,708
RENEE: We were taken
to a dressing room.

418
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:13,145
And we were told we were going
to be taking a shower...

419
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,584
after this horrendous journey.

420
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,087
And we are going
to refresh ourselves...

421
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,750
and then we'll be assigned
to our work.

422
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:28,285
IRENE: They ordered us to take
our shoes in one hand...

423
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,887
and our clothes
in the other hand.

424
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,422
Then I remembered the diamonds
and grabbed my blue skirt...

425
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,901
and in the crowd, you know...

426
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:39,531
I just took out the diamonds
and held them in my hands.

427
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:41,370
And I had no clothes on my body.

428
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:45,869
And I remember I got undressed
with the rest of them...

429
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:49,610
and there I was,
standing in the bathing suit.

430
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,292
I had a premonition.

431
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:04,455
I had this feeling that if
I take this bathing suit off...

432
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,729
if I leave
this bathing suit behind...

433
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,702
all the wonderful memories...

434
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,570
that were built
in this bathing suit...

435
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:16,508
I kept remembering how I wore
there on the swimming pool...

436
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:19,069
and how the boys
were whistling at me...

437
00:27:19,113 --> 00:27:21,877
and my friends were so jealous.

438
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:26,250
And now I'm gonna take it off,
and I'm gonna leave it here.

439
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:29,745
Everything that meant anything
in life to me...

440
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,690
I'm going to leave behind.

441
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:37,119
They kept on saying...

442
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:40,258
if anybody has any valuables
left, to leave them.

443
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,428
They had a section for that.

444
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,938
And I held on to the diamonds
for dear life...

445
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:47,133
because that was to buy bread.

446
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:49,472
So I put them in my mouth.

447
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,705
And then,
when I walked up again...

448
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:53,976
I saw they were opening up
people's mouth...

449
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:55,709
and they were looking
in the mouth and--

450
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,880
But I was
at the road of no return.

451
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,548
I couldn't give them up anymore
because I would be shot.

452
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,558
"Why didn't I leave them
back there?"

453
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:07,891
I had them in my mouth,
and I didn't know what to do...

454
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,418
so I swallowed them.

455
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,795
We walked into
the shower room...

456
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,801
and the dressing room
was locked behind us.

457
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,928
And a commando came in...

458
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,531
and removed
all our belongings right away.

459
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:23,566
They did give us a shower--
a little trinkly shower.

460
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,079
Again, there was another door...

461
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:28,581
on the other side
leading out to the courtyard...

462
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,584
on the other side
of this building.

463
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:33,314
And at the door
they had a pile of clothes...

464
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:37,085
and they ordered everybody
to pick one piece of clothing.

465
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:40,423
We waited till about midnight,
and then they permitted us...

466
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,915
to walk into
one of these wooden barracks.

467
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,882
ALICE: A thousand people
in a barrack.

468
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:50,514
lf one person turned,
everybody had to turn...

469
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:53,753
because we were so close
to each other.

470
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:56,523
I used to wake up so cold.

471
00:28:56,562 --> 00:29:01,499
And I used to have
returning dreams...

472
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:04,901
that I'm at home,
that I'm very cold...

473
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:08,134
but my father
would come and cover us.

474
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:11,632
And then you wake up
to a whistle.

475
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:16,205
It's dark outside,
and this is a madman's hell.

476
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,818
RENEE: We saw this group
of about twenty men...

477
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:26,722
coming through the camp.

478
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,819
And as they were marching by,
I was watching.

479
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,921
"Maybe I know somebody."

480
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:35,092
And suddenly
I recognized my father.

481
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:41,863
And my first thought
was to hide.

482
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:47,642
It was terribly painful seeing
him with his shaved head...

483
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,841
in this uniform like a prisoner.

484
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,181
This man
who was helping everybody...

485
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,687
who was the kindest human being.

486
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,690
I just couldn't imagine
how would he feel...

487
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:02,888
if he saw us with
the shaved heads in this rag.

488
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:08,027
So I really just wanted to hide
so he can't see me.

489
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,729
And at that moment,
our eyes locked.

490
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:20,473
And I could see his tears
rolling down his cheek.

491
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,150
That was the last time
I saw my father.

492
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,396
IRENE:
I saw trucks coming...

493
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:43,402
and screams on the trucks.

494
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:47,338
And I saw two children
fall out of the truck.

495
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:54,813
And the truck stopped...

496
00:30:57,283 --> 00:31:00,013
And the truck s--

497
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:03,180
And one SS man
came out from the front...

498
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:06,350
and he picked up
the children like that...

499
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:09,486
and he banged him
against the truck...

500
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:11,359
and the blood
came running down...

501
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,524
and threw him into the truck.

502
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:17,229
So that's when
I stopped talking to God.

503
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,879
They told us that
we're going to get a number.

504
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:30,582
A prisoner's number.

505
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:34,712
Well, of course, we expected
to get a prisoner's number...

506
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,722
on our clothing or somewhere.

507
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:39,520
And they set up these tables...

508
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,686
and at each table
sat a few girls...

509
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:46,892
with these huge books
opened in front of them.

510
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:52,393
And we presumed that they are
going to put our name in it...

511
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:55,839
and the number
that they are going to give us.

512
00:31:56,842 --> 00:32:01,336
And then we realized that
they are putting this number...

513
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,476
on our flesh, on our arms.

514
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:17,525
They took five of us
and put drops in our eyes.

515
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,861
We didn't know why.
They didn't tell us.

516
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,595
And they put us in the dungeon.

517
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:24,034
They closed us in there...

518
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,871
and we were standing in water up
to our ankles, tightly packed.

519
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:31,376
And it seemed like forever.

520
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,708
It seemed like
it was an eternity.

521
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,714
They never opened the door.

522
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:38,717
They never gave us
anything to eat or drink.

523
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,219
So we drank the water
we stood in.

524
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,222
We went to the bathroom
in the water we stood in.

525
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:47,714
And then they opened the door
and took us out.

526
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,096
And they brought us up
into the courtyard...

527
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:55,794
and they examined our eyes.

528
00:32:55,835 --> 00:33:00,329
Some of the people couldn't see
for several days after that.

529
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:02,840
And they took us
back to the barrack.

530
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,673
We found out later
that what they were doing...

531
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:08,578
is they were trying to change
the color of our eyes.

532

[Speaking German]

533
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,334
RANDOLPH: Having survived
the first 4 1/2 years...

534
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,498
of the war...

535
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,940
the Hungarian Jews
were killed...

536
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:47,537
in the last chapter of Hitler's
war against the Jews...

537
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,641
when the leaders of the world
were already fully aware...

538
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,675
of all the details of Auschwitz.

539
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,687
When we came to Auschwitz...

540
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,884
it was during
the Final Solution...

541
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:01,654
when he just
was desperate already.

542
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:05,027
He was losing the war.
Hitler was losing the war.

543
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,931
But he was not going to lose
the war against the Jews.

544
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:11,664
The sadism, the cruelty...

545
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:13,968
the irrationality...

546
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:16,839
of the German
and Hungarian Nazis...

547
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,673
of killing the remaining
Jewish population...

548
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,510
when the war was all over...

549
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:26,006
when they could have gained
brownie points...

550
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:30,010
by being more civilized with--
vis-a-vis these people...

551
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:34,116
was really not present because
their hatred was so blind.

552
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,458
RANDOLPH:
The Nazis diverted trains...

553
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:41,227
and other transportation means
useful to the Germans...

554
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:44,202
for purposes of deporting Jews.

555
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,568
That is, to complete
the Final Solution program.

556
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:50,132
While I was in Auschwitz,
the transports were coming in.

557
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:54,475
Two, three transports a day
with thousands of people.

558
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:57,982
RANDOLPH:
Within less than six weeks...

559
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:04,479
more than 438,000 Hungarian Jews
were deported to Auschwitz.

560
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:07,890
The gas chambers,
the crematoria could not cope.

561
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:14,495
The SS had to dig special pits
to burn the bodies...

562
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:19,732
using the Jews' own fat as fuel.

563
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:25,404
I saw how they were throwing
people into these fire pits.

564
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,337
I said to myself...

565
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:31,042
"Something is wrong with me.
My mind is going.

566
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,108
"I couldn't be seeing this."

567
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,014
ALICE: What vast landscape
you are seeing here.

568
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:19,953
How could people,
normal people...

569
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:25,016
go back after working here
or plan this?

570
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,528
OK, somebody had to plan it.

571
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:30,361
Somebody had to be an engineer.

572
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:37,669
Somebody had to really put on
a map this kind of efficiency.

573
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,577
The whole time
I was in the camp...

574
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:45,580
through the experiments,
every time I was selected...

575
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:47,707
I swallowed the diamonds.

576
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:51,344
So every time I swallowed them,
I had to find them again.

577
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,719
We were allowed to go
to the latrine once a day.

578
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:59,523
I never sat on the hole because
I had to find my diamonds.

579
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,724
One day, the SS woman
walked by the door...

580
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,356
and she saw me in the corner.

581
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,264
And I already had
the diamonds in the hand...

582
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:09,327
and usually I was waiting
until on the way back...

583
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,839
I would rinse them off
in the mud...

584
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:14,001
or if there was no mud...

585
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,010
in the soup
that we were gonna get next.

586
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,444
But I had no time,
and I had to swallow them.

587
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:24,113
ALICE: My God.
This is the latrine.

588
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,554
Oh, my God.

589
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:34,586
At this place, I was with
my sister, Edith, next to me.

590
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,724
And so Edith whispers to me
and says...

591
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,731
"It's almost Shabbat.
This is Friday.

592
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,703
"It's almost Shabbat."

593
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,536
How we used to celebrate Shabbat
in our house...

594
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,042
with food and with singing...

595
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:52,274
and with praying
and lighting the candle.

596
00:38:52,314 --> 00:38:57,081
I told her, "Why don't we
celebrate inside the latrine?"

597
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,647
We ran back to the end...

598
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:02,486
and we started to make
our Shabbat ceremony...

599
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,321
and we started to sing...

600
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:06,350
[Speaking Hebrew]

601
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,827
And as we sang the melody...

602
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:13,164
other children
came around us...

603
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:14,999
and they started to sing
with us.

604
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:18,234
Somebody was from Poland,
somebody was German...

605
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,833
somebody was from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia...

606
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,002
all thrown together...

607
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:27,004
and suddenly the Hebrew songs,
prayers, the Shabbat...

608
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:30,041
united us in the latrine
of Auschwitz.

609
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:37,024
IRENE: People couldn't endure
all this pain...

610
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:39,857
the conditions
and the hunger and the lice.

611
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:43,524
The lice were
as big as my pinkie nail...

612
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,965
embedded into our bodies.

613
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:49,402
We were sore from
scratching and infections.

614
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:51,906
And so when
the electricity went on...

615
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,398
they ran to the barbed wire
to commit suicide.

616
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:56,911
Then they punished us.

617
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,913
For every man
that ran through the wire...

618
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:02,508
they took a hundred inmates
and killed them...

619
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:05,577
in front of everybody
as an example.

620
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:08,590
They didn't even let us die
when we wanted.

621
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:10,592
And then I thought of something.

622
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,890
They took away my parents.

623
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,862
They took away my identity.

624
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:16,989
They took away my siblings.

625
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:20,126
They took away my possessions.

626
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,796
There is something
that they want from me.

627
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,329
And then I thought of my soul.

628
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,805
And I says, they're not
going to take my soul.

629
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,811
And I decided
right then and there...

630
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:36,215
I'm going to get up from this
mud and I'm going to fight...

631
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,719
because I'm not going
to become ashes.

632
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:42,757
RENEE:
When we arrived to Auschwitz...

633
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,694
thousands and thousands of
people were cremated every day.

634
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:53,099
The Nazis used Jewish inmates,
a special Sonderkommando...

635
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:56,400
to remove the bodies
from the gas chambers...

636
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:59,839
and taking the bodies
into the crematorium.

637
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,333
As far as I know,
there is only four of us...

638
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:08,372
that worked in
the Sonderkommando alive today.

639
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:11,853
And we are
the only eyewitness...

640
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:16,051
that saw the whole thing
from "A" to "Z"...

641
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:18,889
how the Final Solution was done.

642
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:23,754
I'm Jewish from Greece.

643
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,233
And I lived in Greece...

644
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:30,034
until the time they took me
to concentration camp.

645
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:36,636
The first week of April, 1944,
I arrived in Auschwitz.

646
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,911
They selected some of the Greeks
to go to work on crematorium.

647
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,852
Now is my first day there.
I don't know what was going on.

648
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:50,915
I saw 2,500 people, all naked,
go into the big chamber...

649
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,587
which eventually
they take only 500 people.

650
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:55,926
They were putting in
2,500 people.

651
00:41:55,964 --> 00:42:00,367
So nobody could do anything
but stand up their children.

652
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:03,894
And fifteen minutes later,
after they close the chambers...

653
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:08,069
and the SS threw the gas
from these four openings...

654
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,236
they open up.

655
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,471
What did I see?

656
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,878
I see the people
I saw fifteen minutes ago.

657
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,541
I see them all dead...

658
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:17,552
standing up with their children,
black and blue.

659
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:20,555
And I said to myself,
"What's going on?

660
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:22,386
"What's going on here?"

661
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:25,882
There was a Polish guy
that was there before...

662
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:28,589
and I said, "Where is God?"

663
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,929
He says, "God is where
you have your strength."

664
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:37,065
There were four crematoriums,
you know.

665
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:39,938
And they were working
twenty-four hours.

666
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,569
There were a lot of big shots
from Berlin...

667
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:45,603
coming and watching
how the Jews were dying.

668
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,310
There was a hole
in the hermetically closed...

669
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:53,378
and they were looking there how
the Jewish people were dying.

670
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:56,983
It takes two to four minutes.
Depends where you are.

671
00:42:57,025 --> 00:43:01,189
A lot of people think that we--
working in the Sonderkommando--

672
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:03,697
we were guilty of something...

673
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:06,200
because we were doing
such kind of a work.

674
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:11,171
But ourselves,
we couldn't get out of it.

675
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,367
lf you don't do whatever
they're asking you to do...

676
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:14,807
they kill you right away.

677
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:18,538
One time I had
two friends of mine...

678
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,038
very close friends of mine,
they came in, you know.

679
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,210
Their names were the Venezias.

680
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:30,054
And I told them right away
that they were going to die.

681
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:31,285
They asked for food.

682
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:34,193
Whatever I had,
I gave them to eat.

683
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:38,063
I told them exactly
where to keep themselves...

684
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:42,399
where the openings were,
so they can die fast.

685
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:44,905
And after they were through...

686
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,238
I took them out,
and I washed them...

687
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:50,676
and I put them in the oven
to be burned.

688
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:59,791
[Machine gun firing]

689
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:14,031
TOM: We could hear the artillery
moving closer and closer.

690
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:17,600
And Budapest
was the battlefield...

691
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:21,044
between the Germans
and the Soviet Army.

692
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,915
And although we knew it would be
weeks before the Soviet Army...

693
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:28,887
would hopefully liberate
the remaining Jews...

694
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:32,914
we knew that lots of hardships
were still ahead.

695
00:44:36,295 --> 00:44:38,388
ALICE:
ln Auschwitz, after Christmas...

696
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:42,765
we hear more the bombing
came closer and closer.

697
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:45,771
IRENE: The Nazis didn't want
anybody to get liberated.

698
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:50,265
So they were herding the people
away from the camp.

699
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:52,800
RANDOLPH:
The death march was in winter.

700
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:57,839
Those who could not keep pace
were simply shot by the wayside.

701
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:06,552
lf anybody tries to run away...

702
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,528
or do anything
that is not permitted...

703
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:11,962
will be shot on the spot.

704
00:45:11,998 --> 00:45:16,958
There were three of us friends
together up to that point.

705
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:20,939
And we swore
that we would sacrifice...

706
00:45:20,973 --> 00:45:22,941
each other's life
for each other...

707
00:45:22,975 --> 00:45:25,068
that we would never
let each other down.

708
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:29,070
Kids. We had this sort of
a dream that will be possible.

709
00:45:29,115 --> 00:45:33,916
One of the three had
a knee injury and had gangrene.

710
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:36,080
One of the soldiers
noticed him limping...

711
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:38,784
so he comes up,
and he wants to shoot him.

712
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:41,589
When we step in front of him,
he pulls out his Luger...

713
00:45:41,627 --> 00:45:44,095
and he says,
"I give you three seconds.

714
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,657
"Count to three.
Either you let him go...

715
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,600
"or all the three of you die."

716
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:51,603
Can you imagine?

717
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:55,073
Even though you're young,
that decision we had to make.

718
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:59,101
Here we promised that
we will die for each other...

719
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:02,546
but we couldn't keep that
promise under threat of death.

720
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:04,641
We did let him down.

721
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:11,557
We arrived,
about ten days' march or so...

722
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,388
we arrived into Dachau.

723
00:46:32,512 --> 00:46:34,446
BILL: Oh, my God.

724
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,407
After fifty-three years...

725
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,353
it's as if it were yesterday.

726
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:53,426
You could find them right here
in the street, just laying...

727
00:46:53,466 --> 00:46:55,195
and we didn't even
pay any attention.

728
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,327
You stepped over bodies.
Didn't pay attention.

729
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,997
They didn't mean anything.

730
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:00,869
-Right here?
-Yeah.

731
00:47:00,907 --> 00:47:04,741
I never knew anybody's name...

732
00:47:04,777 --> 00:47:07,678
never wanted to know anybody.

733
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:10,511
I never wanted to know
just in case someday...

734
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,008
someone will know this person...

735
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:17,511
whose shoes I have taken off
when he died.

736
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:22,821
lf you can imagine
that every morning...

737
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:24,830
my job was for a while--

738
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:28,231
I had to go barrack
to barrack to barrack...

739
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:31,896
and take those bodies and
bring them to the crematorium.

740
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:34,031
We had one of those pushcarts.

741
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:38,501
I remember the Sonderkommandos
that worked the crematorium...

742
00:47:38,544 --> 00:47:41,775
came out and opened the gate.

743
00:47:41,814 --> 00:47:43,839
They took it over from here
and walked it in.

744
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:46,078
We were never allowed
to cross this.

745
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:50,578
They never talked about
a crematorium, but we knew.

746
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:52,488
lf we walked in here,
we never got out.

747
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:55,255
We never got out from here,
from this area...

748
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:59,432
because if they let him out,
and he escapes...

749
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:01,366
they have witness,
they have testimony...

750
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,425
so they wouldn't let him out.

751
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:12,109
Oy, look at this.

752
00:48:28,628 --> 00:48:33,327
The inhumanity of man
against man.

753
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:34,924
It's beyond belief.

754
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:41,636
This is the most monstrous thing
that man devised.

755
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:48,846
Burning human beings
just to get rid of them quicker.

756
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:50,940
Unbelievable.

757
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:13,738
It's just so emotional for me.
It's so hard.

758
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:22,109
Now, why did I survive?

759
00:49:23,182 --> 00:49:25,173
Why did God spare me?

760
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:32,753
Somebody started to yell,
"Americans, Americans!"

761
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:35,060
We didn't know
what they mean by Americans...

762
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,032
and they were pointing up
to the sky.

763
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:40,662
Planes came out from behind
the mountains, from nowhere...

764
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:44,504
and they just bombed the convoy.

765
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:47,704
And they didn't touch us.
None of us got hurt.

766
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:49,678
That's when I found out
the first time...

767
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:52,341
that the United States
was at war.

768
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:57,615
It was April 29th when
I was ordered to go to Dachau.

769
00:49:57,654 --> 00:50:00,214
Actually,
it was the night of the 28th...

770
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:03,124
and we were ordered
to take off...

771
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,924
as fast as possible
to get to Dachau...

772
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,862
not knowing what we were facing.

773
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:11,834
We thought it was
a German military camp...

774
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:13,597
that we were going in to take...

775
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:17,232
and therefore we were gonna
capture the people inside it.

776
00:50:17,274 --> 00:50:19,242
We were in the vicinity...

777
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:24,111
of what we found out to be
concentration camps.

778
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,844
BILL: Suddenly,
we hear machine guns...

779
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:29,317
guns shooting off.

780
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:33,015
First thought
was that we are being killed.

781
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:34,887
And then we saw
the American soldiers...

782
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:36,051
climbing and crawling
and shooting...

783
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:40,655
and then we saw German soldiers
coming from that direction.

784
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:44,155
As they met here in the center,
the Germans gave up.

785
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:51,607
But visualize 32,000 people
coming out of those barracks.

786
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:56,203
Outside the camp
on railroad tracks was...

787
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:59,181
forty boxcars,
I believe, was the count...

788
00:50:59,216 --> 00:51:01,946
absolutely full of dead bodies.

789
00:51:04,621 --> 00:51:08,614
And not having had any knowledge
of what we were facing...

790
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:13,355
this was totally unreal.

791
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:18,396
Most of them
were wearing flannel pajamas.

792
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,062
That's all what they had.

793
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:24,665
Blue striped, white striped
flannel pajamas.

794
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,040
PAUL: People were weak.

795
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:30,069
Weak probably isn't even
the right term.

796
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:33,908
But they were emaciated.

797
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,080
Some of the people looked
very old who weren't old.

798
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:40,385
MIHO: They were walking dead.
That's what we called them.

799
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:41,617
Skeletons.

800
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,084
PAUL:
A few came out first...

801
00:51:44,127 --> 00:51:46,595
then more came out
and more came out...

802
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,461
and they kept
coming toward us...

803
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:51,467
because it was almost
as if they realized--

804
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:52,798
and I guess they did--

805
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:55,270
they realized
that we were different...

806
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:58,399
that we were people
coming to help them.

807
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:02,468
And the Americans held the gun
against the Germans...

808
00:52:02,512 --> 00:52:05,743
but they didn't kill them.
They let us have them.

809
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:09,582
And taking a dozen or so
German soldiers we caught...

810
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:13,953
literally tore them apart
piece by piece.

811
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:20,959
We captured a German colonel,
and I went back and told him...

812
00:52:20,997 --> 00:52:26,060
that we're gonna send you to
our officers to talk to you...

813
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,933
and he spit in my face...

814
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:30,233
and I killed him.

815
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:34,405
It wasn't long before
the war was over after that...

816
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:38,210
but throughout those last days,
we intended to stop Germany...

817
00:52:38,248 --> 00:52:39,374
from ever having
the opportunity...

818
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:42,180
to stand up again and do this
to anybody.

819
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:46,486
l've seen
many a horrible sight...

820
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:50,687
that two years
in ltaly, France, and Germany...

821
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:53,992
but the worst
l've ever seen in my life...

822
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,430
were the survivors
of the Holocaust.

823
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,633
This is something which is...

824
00:53:07,277 --> 00:53:08,801
to this day I cannot forget.

825
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:38,044
I wasn't young anymore.

826
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,172
I was very old.

827
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:43,183
I was sixteen,
but I was very old.

828
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:46,948
Returning to freedom
was very difficuIt.

829
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:50,286
We didn't know how
we were going to make peace...

830
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:52,987
with the outside world
which didn't want us...

831
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,756
and we didn't know...

832
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,124
who we were going to find
or not find.

833
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:03,103
They didn't know
what to do with us...

834
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:05,002
and they put us in a DP camp...

835
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,769
which is
a displaced persons camp.

836
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:11,506
And the closest one
from where I was was in Austria.

837
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:15,983
And all the survivors
that had no other place to go...

838
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:18,178
were in that camp.

839
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:21,848
So it was another camp,
but it was free.

840
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:27,183
TOM: After the Soviet Army
liberated Budapest...

841
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:31,062
and I became
a free human being again...

842
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:34,034
I did not know for months...

843
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:37,834
whether my mother
or other members of my family...

844
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:39,032
would ever return.

845
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,444
RENEE: I was hoping
that going back to Auschwitz...

846
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:48,881
is finally going to give me
some closure.

847
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:54,519
And I was shocked to find out...

848
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:59,515
that it opened up
new questions and new doubts.

849
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:18,435
Rene. R-e-n--e.

850
00:56:20,348 --> 00:56:24,284
RENEE: This is the first time
that I decided...

851
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,515
to find some records
on my family.

852
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:34,494
And my sister was Klara.

853
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,519
Give me some.

854
00:57:25,813 --> 00:57:27,280
Klara.

855
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,340
Mm-hmm. lt's my sister.

856
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,516
Yeah.

857
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:37,423
RENEE: I found records
of my sister, my father...

858
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,824
and my own...

859
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:42,091
and when I asked about
my mother...

860
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:46,195
the archivist, the historian
told me...

861
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:48,702
that those who were taken...

862
00:57:48,736 --> 00:57:51,466
from the railroad station
and killed immediately...

863
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:53,701
there is no record of those.

864
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:15,288
This is a test
of her blood or...

865
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:19,823
or some medical researchment
of Klara Weinfeld.

866
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:23,234
RENEE: I found out that
my sister was experimented on...

867
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:27,207
that they were doing
some blood tests on her.

868
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:29,106
And what does the zero mean?

869
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,272
RENEE: And he said,
"I really don't know.

870
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:36,112
"Nobody ever asked me."

871
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:40,177
But there is a Dr. Munch who
was the head of this clinic...

872
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:41,381
who is still alive.

873
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:45,620
Then I found out you're going
to interview this man...

874
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,652
and that I may have a chance
to ask him...

875
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:50,926
what those symbols meant.

876
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:21,886
MUNCH:
Nothing important.

877
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:53,316
-Six months.
-Bitte?

878
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:56,353
-Six months.
-Six months.

879
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:12,972
RENEE:
I tried to be civilized...

880
01:00:13,014 --> 01:00:15,380
but he was very evasive...

881
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:18,783
and I became very angry.

882
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:22,516
I kept thinking that thousands
and thousands of people...

883
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:24,717
died in his clinic.

884
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:30,191
I am going to go back
to Crematorium 5...

885
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:33,723
because I know that my mother
was taken there for sure.

886
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:36,362
I'm going to light
some candles...

887
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:40,364
and I know that I am not
coming back here anymore.

888
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:49,783
And now...
just very recently...

889
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:54,311
I got a new letter
from Bergen-Belsen...

890
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:56,789
that they don't have Edith Lok.

891
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:59,122
They looked through
their books...

892
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,561
but they found an Edith Schwarz.

893
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:05,258
And I remembered at one point...

894
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:10,999
my sister Edith decided
she will use my mother's name...

895
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:12,164
but I forgot it.

896
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:17,200
And all these years
I looked for Edith Lok.

897
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:19,678
Can you find me, though,
with Hungaria--

898
01:01:19,714 --> 01:01:20,874
Hungaria?

899
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,407
Let's just look at it.

900
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,317
It's not alphabetized.

901
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,132
ALICE:
Going back to Bergen-Belsen...

902
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:50,666
I want my husband
to say a prayer...

903
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,179
with my children and with me...

904
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:58,777
because we will
symbolically bury Edith.

905
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:02,311
MAN: This is a cemetery where
all the people were buried...

906
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,221
who were brought after
liberation...

907
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:05,919
to the military blocks.

908
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,855
We found the name
of your sister.

909
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:13,790
She died here, we think,
on the 2nd of June 1945.

910
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:18,334
So all the people who died
in those days...

911
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,271
were buried here,
one beside the next one.

912
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:31,276
ALICE: Today is the most
special day of my life.

913
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:34,481
Finally, the search is over...

914
01:02:35,688 --> 01:02:39,556
and we know now what happened
and when it happened.

915
01:02:42,328 --> 01:02:45,661
I brought here
my mother's prayer book...

916
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:48,223
and here we will say for you...

917
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:51,031
the prayers
that's traditional...

918
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:54,562
and light this candle
in your memory...

919
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:58,838
and remember you forever...

920
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:01,411

ALICE: But there are a lot
of people like me out there...

932
01:03:58,203 --> 01:03:59,670
who are still looking...

933
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:04,605
because for us...

934
01:04:05,477 --> 01:04:08,310
liberation wasn't the last day.

935
01:04:17,189 --> 01:04:20,386
TOM: I got an announcement
that I had been selected...

936
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:22,451
to receive
an academic scholarship...

937
01:04:22,494 --> 01:04:26,396
to the University of Washington
in a town called "Seetle..."

938
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:30,334
because nobody told me
it's pronounced Seattle.

939
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:35,102
I had a ticket
on the SS Marine Falcon.

940
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,837
I went to bunk B-20,
put down my knapsack...

941
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:41,038
and they called for chow.

942
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:42,444
I had no idea what chow was.

943
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,949
It wasn't part
of my English vocabulary.

944
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:46,883
So I got into the chow line.

945
01:04:46,919 --> 01:04:48,887
We had these huge metal trays...

946
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:50,684
and this was
a period when, of course...

947
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:54,351
my mental preoccupation
was still with hunger.

948
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:57,459
And these wonderful people
slopped on...

949
01:04:57,496 --> 01:04:59,521
all the wonderful things
on this metal tray.

950
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:02,159
And at the end of the line...

951
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:06,262
there was a huge wicker basket
of oranges...

952
01:05:06,305 --> 01:05:09,297
and a huge wicker basket
of bananas.

953
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:11,639
My mother always taught me
to do the right thing...

954
01:05:11,677 --> 01:05:13,406
and I didn't know
what the right thing was.

955
01:05:13,445 --> 01:05:15,504
So there was
another huge sailor...

956
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:18,812
and I asked him,
"Sir, do I take a banana...

957
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:20,284
"or do I take an orange?"

958
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:23,619
And he said, "Man, you eat
all the damn bananas...

959
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:26,317
"and all the damn oranges
you want."

960
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:28,519
And then I knew I was in heaven.

961
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:30,554
IRENE: I loved my town...

962
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:34,327
and I see it
picturesque and happy.

963
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:38,195
I'm planning to go there
for the first time...

964
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:40,569
since I left in 1944.

965
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:42,073
Now, look at the sign, Robin.

966
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,803
Look at it.
It says Polena in Russian.

967
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,304
The river is running
on the right-hand side.

968
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:51,179
We used to go bathing here.

969
01:05:51,216 --> 01:05:52,740
I'm hoping I can find...

970
01:05:52,784 --> 01:05:56,720
some of the people that I knew
before the Holocaust...

971
01:05:57,656 --> 01:06:00,124
and maybe
that I can talk to them.

972
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,422
ROBlN: There's the mushrooms
in the jar, see?

973
01:06:03,996 --> 01:06:05,156
[lrene speaking Hungarian]

974
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:06,664
IRENE:
Maybe they can tell me...

975
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:09,166
things that happened
while we were away.

976
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:12,864
[Speaking Hungarian]

977
01:06:24,216 --> 01:06:26,116
IRENE:
This one woman, Mariska...

978
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:30,815
she remembered my grandparents,
my father, my mother, and me.

979
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:34,155
I was most surprised
that she remembered me.

980
01:06:35,694 --> 01:06:40,825
I was really afraid the people
were going to be hostile...

981
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:44,029
that they were going to be
accusing me of coming back...

982
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:46,037
to take something
away from them.

983
01:06:47,005 --> 01:06:50,236
I was asked
in a very nice way...

984
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:53,039
am I planning
to take my property...

985
01:06:53,078 --> 01:06:55,546
and come back to live there?

986
01:06:55,581 --> 01:06:57,549
And I said no.

987
01:06:57,583 --> 01:07:01,246
I just want my children to know
where I come from...

988
01:07:01,286 --> 01:07:03,550
and I wanted to see my town
where I grew up...

989
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:05,420
one more time before I die.

990
01:07:11,063 --> 01:07:14,499
RENEE:
Going back to my hometown...

991
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:18,060
with my family, with my child...

992
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:20,936
showing her
this beautiful town...

993
01:07:20,973 --> 01:07:26,878
which everywhere we went,
the word "Jew" doesn't exist.

994
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:30,507
This building was
the Jewish community center.

995
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:33,814
I wanted
to go to the Jewish temple...

996
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:37,219
which was a beautiful synagogue.

997
01:07:39,424 --> 01:07:43,622
Look how they let this--
Oh, my God.

998
01:07:43,662 --> 01:07:46,597
What they did to this city,
you just have no idea.

999
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:49,362
It's just unbelievable.

1000
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:52,393
We went to the temple...

1001
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:55,838
and there I met this man,
this Jewish man.

1002
01:07:55,874 --> 01:07:57,739
He was also in Auschwitz.

1003
01:07:57,776 --> 01:07:58,936
Hello.

1004
01:08:41,386 --> 01:08:43,946
RENEE: Then he walked us
through the temple...

1005
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:48,551
and explained to us this is
no longer a Jewish temple.

1006
01:09:02,507 --> 01:09:07,535
RENEE: It was very painful
to see that this holy place...

1007
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:13,108
was transformed
into a place of entertainment.

1008
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:19,083
The most difficult part
was going back to my house.

1009
01:09:19,124 --> 01:09:20,921
Oh, my God!

1010
01:09:23,995 --> 01:09:27,089
That is the original...

1011
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:29,930
That's the original gate.

1012
01:09:29,968 --> 01:09:31,196
The entrance.

1013
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:33,136
The entrance. Yeah.

1014
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,274
RENEE:
It was neglected...

1015
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:41,905
this beautiful house that
my father took care of always...

1016
01:09:41,947 --> 01:09:45,405
and everything
was manicured around it.

1017
01:09:46,918 --> 01:09:48,044
MAN:
I think it's locked.

1018
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:51,385
RENEE: No, it isn't.
It just doesn't open.

1019
01:09:51,423 --> 01:09:54,529
[Sobbing]
It doesn't open.

1020
01:09:54,663 --> 01:09:58,326
RENEE: At that moment I wished
I wouldn't have seen it.

1021
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:01,665
[Sobbing]

1022
01:10:09,244 --> 01:10:12,509
One of the neighbors
who was a young child...

1023
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:16,244
at the time they took us away
was still there.

1024
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:34,366
He has now a Russian wife
who was very sympathetic.

1025
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:50,747
She was scared to tell me...

1026
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:53,549
what really happened
after we left.

1027
01:11:26,855 --> 01:11:29,050
At that moment,
I felt very lucky...

1028
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:34,585
I will have a chance to go back
to the United States to my home.

1029
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:39,456
I saved the diamonds
all the way--

1030
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:41,833
all the way through
the whole everything.

1031
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,703
And when I was free...

1032
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:47,799
I didn't talk
about the Holocaust...

1033
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:49,605
but I took the diamonds
and mounted them...

1034
01:11:49,644 --> 01:11:51,976
into a teardrop-shaped
pendant...

1035
01:11:52,013 --> 01:11:53,981
because every time
I had to save them...

1036
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:55,482
I had to cry so much...

1037
01:11:55,517 --> 01:11:58,748
so I felt that the tears
are appropriate for that...

1038
01:11:58,787 --> 01:12:01,347
and I told my children
that these diamonds...

1039
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:04,153
should go down
from generation to generation...

1040
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:06,786
to the firstborn girl
in the family...

1041
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:08,659
until...forever.

1042
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:13,493
And you can see
they are different shapes...

1043
01:12:13,535 --> 01:12:15,901
and they're different cuts.

1044
01:12:15,937 --> 01:12:18,269
And they're
the only thing that l...

1045
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:22,199
that I'm holding
that my mother ever held.

1046
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:28,247
OK, well, I don't know
what you think about...

1047
01:12:28,283 --> 01:12:32,743
TOM: My life today is something
I myself cannot believe.

1048
01:12:34,823 --> 01:12:38,782
Having been elected by
my constituency in California...

1049
01:12:38,827 --> 01:12:43,423
of some 600,000 people
nine times...

1050
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:47,731
it all seems like a dream,
and it all places...

1051
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:50,795
an incredible sense
of responsibility on me.

1052
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:53,899
As the only survivor
of the Holocaust...

1053
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:57,708
ever elected to the Congress
of the United States...

1054
01:12:57,746 --> 01:13:00,112
I know I speak
for all of my colleagues...

1055
01:13:00,148 --> 01:13:03,140
Republicans and Democrats...

1056
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:07,917
in expressing our outrage
at the most recent terrorist...

1057
01:13:07,956 --> 01:13:12,484
The central focus of my life
obviously is human rights...

1058
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:15,826
because I am convinced
that this is really the path...

1059
01:13:15,864 --> 01:13:18,298
of a more civilized world.

1060
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,430
My wife Annette and I have known
each other all our lives.

1061
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:26,929
We grew up as children
in Budapest...

1062
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:31,236
and we have been married now
for forty-seven years.

1063
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,612
We have two daughters
who early on came to us...

1064
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:40,143
and said that they planned...

1065
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:42,884
a special gift
for their parents.

1066
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:46,919
Since our families
were wiped out...

1067
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:48,929
they will give us
a large family.

1068
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:56,170
And we have been blessed with
17 wonderful grandchildren...

1069
01:13:56,204 --> 01:13:58,570
and it's really
the focus of our life.

1070
01:14:02,477 --> 01:14:04,968
RENEE:
I would like to be known...

1071
01:14:05,013 --> 01:14:08,278
as an educator
of the Holocaust...

1072
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:11,217
so I go to
the Museum of Tolerance...

1073
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:13,652
where I was a founder
of the Outreach Program...

1074
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:20,491
and I speak to groups
who come into the museum.

1075
01:14:20,528 --> 01:14:25,090
...came into being. When
these things are happening...

1076
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:28,933
you almost begin to believe
that you did something wrong.

1077
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,631
Why would they do this to me...

1078
01:14:30,672 --> 01:14:34,199
I feel that it is my duty...

1079
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,344
to make the world aware...

1080
01:14:37,378 --> 01:14:40,176
of what happened
during that time.

1081
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:43,707
I always felt that
my language is inadequate...

1082
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:50,788
and that if I wanted to tell
the story of my experiences...

1083
01:14:50,825 --> 01:14:54,955
I have to talk through a medium.

1084
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:59,262
And I found art,
because art transcends.

1085
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,325
It's beyond words.

1086
01:15:03,438 --> 01:15:06,430
I wanted the surface
to be very much layered.

1087
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:09,637
It should look like
a crumbled wall...

1088
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:13,875
like it's papered over
with yesterday's news...

1089
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:16,816
because people want
to forget the past.

1090
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:20,116
People want to forget
about the Holocaust.

1091
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:22,953
What keeps me going is really...

1092
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:25,515
the family...

1093
01:15:26,628 --> 01:15:29,256
that my husband and I created.

1094
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:34,698
My grandchildren,
three wonderful children...

1095
01:15:34,736 --> 01:15:36,931
two of them rabbis...

1096
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:39,462
and my beautiful daughter.

1097
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:43,637
She teaches me every day
what is important in life...

1098
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:49,379
And my husband,
who is four-generation lsraeli.

1099
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:52,147
And such a gallant man.

1100
01:15:52,187 --> 01:15:55,247
And he helped me
to construct a life.

1101
01:15:56,424 --> 01:16:00,224
This painting is
"Arbeit Macht Frei."

1102
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:04,721
When you read this welcome gate,
so to speak...

1103
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:06,358
"Arbeit Macht Frei..."

1104
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:09,632
My art today
is about the Holocaust...

1105
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:14,165
because I have no memorial
for my people.

1106
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:18,509
I don't know where they are.

1107
01:16:18,546 --> 01:16:21,572
Why, so many
of my family members died...

1108
01:16:21,616 --> 01:16:24,050
so many got killed...

1109
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:26,553
that the Basch family
was almost wiped out.

1110
01:16:26,588 --> 01:16:28,055
We have regenerated.

1111
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:33,485
So when we get together,
we are quite a large group.

1112
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:38,432
And the joy of sitting
with my family...

1113
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:42,527
and looking around and saying
that I was so close to death...

1114
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,832
and here I am
sitting at a table...

1115
01:16:43,872 --> 01:16:47,467
and there are eleven,
twelve of us rejoicing life.

1116
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:51,968
The pleasure of living
is wonderful.

1117
01:16:52,013 --> 01:16:55,005
-Salud.
-L'chaim.

1118
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:58,951
One day, it was on a Sunday,
someone knocked at my door...

1119
01:16:58,987 --> 01:17:01,751
and I asked him into the door.

1120
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:05,589
They had something wrapped in
a newspaper under their arm...

1121
01:17:05,627 --> 01:17:07,151
and they said,
"Are you Paul Parks?"

1122
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:08,423
And I said yes.

1123
01:17:08,463 --> 01:17:11,455
He says, "We've been looking
for you for several years."

1124
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:13,467
"Off and on, various people
have been looking for you.

1125
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:15,969
"We wanted to find you."
I said, "Why?"

1126
01:17:16,004 --> 01:17:19,565
"There was a fellow
who was liberated by you guys...

1127
01:17:19,607 --> 01:17:22,474
"at Dachau
who remembered you...

1128
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,944
"and he died
several years ago...

1129
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:28,073
"and he'd made
a menorah in the camp.

1130
01:17:28,116 --> 01:17:30,243
"He made it out
of concrete nails...

1131
01:17:30,285 --> 01:17:33,448
"and welded it together
and braised it together...

1132
01:17:33,488 --> 01:17:38,858
"while he was in the camp,
and he wanted you to have it.

1133
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:40,918
"So we've been looking for you
to give it to you...

1134
01:17:40,962 --> 01:17:42,122
"and here it is."

1135
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:44,461
And he gave me
this beautiful menorah.

1136
01:17:51,706 --> 01:17:55,437
IRENE: Liberation was like
a present from the world...

1137
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:58,843
and that's the first time
I acknowledged God again...

1138
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,074
that He is around
and helped me get to this point.

1139
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:05,336
I don't think that God
created the Holocaust.

1140
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:12,580
I think that God gave us a mind
and a heart and free will...

1141
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:14,449
and it is up to man...

1142
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:18,248
what he's going to do
with his life.

1143
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:23,350
And I blame man, not God.

1144
01:18:23,396 --> 01:18:29,028
I cannot rationally explain,
emotionally explain...

1145
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:32,037
intellectually explain
the Holocaust.

1146
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:35,438
I cannot find...

1147
01:18:35,474 --> 01:18:40,776
a place
for a higher authority...

1148
01:18:40,813 --> 01:18:42,212
in this nightmare.

1149
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,478
What kind of people are we?

1150
01:18:44,517 --> 01:18:47,680
What are the books teaching us?

1151
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,087
What is the difference
between me...

1152
01:18:51,957 --> 01:18:53,219
and another child?

1153
01:18:53,259 --> 01:18:55,386
What is the Bible teaching me?

1154
01:18:57,797 --> 01:19:00,493
What is this about?

1155
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:06,596
Hitler remained a pathological
anti-Semite to the end.

1156
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:11,770
ln one of his last testaments,
or warnings to his followers...

1157
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:16,273
was for them to continue
the war against the Jews.

1158
01:19:16,315 --> 01:19:21,912
BILL: ln his will executed
April 29, 1945, it says...

1159
01:19:21,954 --> 01:19:26,823
"Above all,
I enjoin the government...

1160
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:31,819
"and the people to uphold
the race laws to the limit...

1161
01:19:31,864 --> 01:19:36,096
"and to resist mercilessly...

1162
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:41,664
"the poisoner of all nations,
international Jewry."

1163
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:19,505
RANDOLPH: The Holocaust
has to be taught as a chapter...

1164
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:23,379
in the long history
of man's inhumanity to man.

1165
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:29,884
One cannot ignore
the discrimination...

1166
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:32,254
inflicted on many people...

1167
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:34,851
because of race, color,
or creed.

1168
01:20:34,894 --> 01:20:37,089
One cannot ignore slavery.

1169
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:40,189
One cannot ignore
the burning of witches.

1170
01:20:40,232 --> 01:20:42,427
One cannot ignore
the killing of Christians...

1171
01:20:42,468 --> 01:20:44,163
in the Roman period.

1172
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:48,897
The Holocaust, perhaps,
is the culmination...

1173
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:53,436
of the kind of horror
that can occur...

1174
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:58,212
when man loses his integrity...

1175
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,481
his belief
in the sanctity of human life.
