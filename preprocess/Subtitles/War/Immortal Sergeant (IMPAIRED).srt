how to explain it.

299
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:20,774
In fact, I don't know that
I even understand it myself.

300
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:24,938
But-You see, there was a waiter
I used to know in Paris.

301
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,709
He worked in a little café on the Left Bank
called the ''Blue Monkey.''

302
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:31,480
Well, I just happened
to drop in there one night.

303
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:34,317
I'd been tryin' to write all day,
and it hadn't come off.

304
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:36,687
I didn't care
whether I ate or not.

305
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:40,091
ButJoe- Least that's
what I always called him.

306
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:44,599
I never knew his real name-
Pierre, I suppose.

307
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,691
Well, you know
how Frenchmen are about food.

308
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:50,363
Well, he kept asking me how I liked this
and how I liked that...

309
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:52,406
and I just kept muttering,
''Mm-hmm.''

310
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:54,408
I wasn't paying any attention
to what he said.

311
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,172
My mind was
a thousand miles away, and-

312
00:26:57,245 --> 00:27:01,045
Suddenly he got so mad, I thought
he was gonna throw me out of the place.

313
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:04,279
You know how taximen are in Paris when
they don't think you've tipped 'em enough?

314
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:06,752
Well, that's the way he behaved,
only it-it wasn't the money.

315
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:08,790
It just seems
I was a poor, stupid idiot...

316
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:12,953
that didn't have sense enough
to appreciate good cooking when I tasted it.

317
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:18,764
- This doesn't make any sense at all, does it?
- No, it doesn't.

318
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,893
Go on.

319
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,369
Well, the long
and short of it was, I-

320
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:27,431
I apologized and explained
why my mind wasn't on food...

321
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:30,239
and it wasn't long before
I got him calmed down.

322
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:33,804
After that, I- I got in the habit
of dropping in there almost every day.

323
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:35,816
I tell you,Joe was a real person.

324
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:41,322
I used to tell him he was a poet,
only he used sherry instead of rhymes.

325
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:47,089
And French to the core. You know-
Liberty, equality and fraternity.

326
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:49,221
They really meant
something to him...

327
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:52,266
although of course he didn't
talk much about it...

328
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,529
except in terms of soup and truffles.

329
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:58,138
Well, I saw Joe yesterday.

330
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:01,232
- Here?
- In a newsreel.

331
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,642
I got just a glimpse of him
in a crowd of Frenchmen...

332
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:06,943
being herded along
by German soldiers.

333
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:13,818
Anyhow- Suddenly,Joe looked
right straight at me.

334
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,723
He didn't have to say anything.
It was all there in his eyes, the whole story.

335
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:23,258
And somehow I- I couldn't
get him out of my mind...

336
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,391
and this morning, I went back
and looked at the fiilm again.

337
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:30,837
And... suddenly I knew I just
couldn't sit around any longer.

338

[ Chuckles ]
If I did...

339
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:35,877
I'd never be able to look a bowl
of soup in the face again.

340
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,108
I told you
this didn't make any sense.

341
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:45,416
It makes
a great deal of sense, Colin.

342

[ Exhales ]

343
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,660
- Seen anything?
- Not a thing.

344
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,940
Kind of gives you
the creeps, don't it?

345
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:44,244
It's all this stillness.

346
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,806
How would you feel
if I told you we were lost?

347
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:53,843
- Lost?
- Yes, sir. Lost in this bleedin' desert.

348
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:57,448
Not a blasted thing,
not a landmark in sight.

349
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:02,394
- Do you have a compass?
- No good. The needle's busted.

350
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:06,058
I didn't tell the others, but that last bomb
gave her too much of a jolt.

351
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,096
It's worse than I thought.

352
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:13,231
We have about three gallons of petrol
left in the tank.

353
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:17,410
You know what that means.

354
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,081
Finish this trip on foot.

355
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,174
Right you are.

- What about Cassity?
- Him?

357
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:32,117
He can ride while the petrol lasts.

358
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:39,357
The only thing we can do
is watch the North Star, move on northeast...

359
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:42,459
and hope one of our planes spot us.

360
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:47,166
Maybe they'll get the wind up back at headquarters
and send out a searching party.

361
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:53,675
Should I shake 'em up, Sergeant?

362
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,273
Just a minute.

363
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,979
You know, if anything happens to me,
you're in command.

364
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:03,148
Well, nothing's gonna happen to you,
Sergeant. I mean, it can't.

365
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:05,385
Well, it won't, lad,
if I can help it.

366
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:08,895
Still, if I stop a packet, it's up to you
to get the patrol back...

367
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,056
and that's not an easy job.

368
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:15,000
But I'm no leader. I haven't had the experience
to take up a command like this...

369
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,230
with other men's lives
depending on me.

370
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:20,467
I can carry out orders,
but I can't give them.

371
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:26,446
I'm just a civilian
with a couple of chevrons on my sleeve.

372
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:28,539
Come to think of it,
that's what most of us are.

But it's different with you.
You've been in the army all your life.

They know you know your job.

Aw, nonsense.
I've been watchin' you, lad...

a wartime-educated amateur.

and the fiine points of soldierin'...

and I'll put my mind
on dodgin' the bullets.

And we'll get home in one piece.

Nothin' but a heap
of old iron now.

Should we smash it up a bit before the Eyeties
get hold of it, Sergeant?

391
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:51,224
No. We'll take out the carburetor
and the distributor.

392

It isn't likely the Eyeties will have any
spare parts. We'll take them back with us.

When I write about a woman,
a principal character...

613
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,886
I don't think of her as
very different from a man.

614

I mean, I don't try to give her
a different psychology.

615

Unfortunately,
women aren'tjust like men.

she's helpless to do anything about it...

a great deal of difference.

Or do you think so?

633
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:34,643
Maybe that's what's been wrong. I haven't given
my characters the right point of view.

she'd already promised a dance.

01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:50,118
Thank you.

- [ Cottrell ] Right in here, sir.
- [ Man ] Thanks, old man.

01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:13,474
Well.

896
01:27:13,549 --> 01:27:16,814
- This is a bit of all right, old boy.
- Hello, Tom.

897
01:27:16,886 --> 01:27:19,013
- How do you feel?
- All right.

898
01:27:20,356 --> 01:27:23,120
Well, well.

899
01:27:23,192 --> 01:27:27,128
You, a hero.
I could hardly believe it.

900
01:27:27,196 --> 01:27:30,654
I was in Alexandria when the report
came through. I came right over.

901
01:27:33,436 --> 01:27:35,370
Look. You want my story, don't you?

902
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:37,372
Oh, rather.

903
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,374
Then you do something for me fiirst.

904
01:27:39,442 --> 01:27:41,376
I want to send a cable.

905
01:27:41,444 --> 01:27:43,378
Okay.

906
01:27:43,446 --> 01:27:46,472
It's to Valentine.
You know her address.

907
01:27:47,717 --> 01:27:49,651
Yes.

908
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:54,918
Say, ''Thanks. I want to marry you.

909
01:27:54,991 --> 01:27:58,483
Will send engagement ring.
Love, Colin.''

910
01:28:00,262 --> 01:28:02,253
Oh, what is this?
Some kind of a joke?

911
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:04,993
I don't expect she'll think so.

912
01:28:05,067 --> 01:28:07,592
Well, I'm afraid it's against
regulations for me to send this...

913
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:09,831
but, um, an orderly
will take it, or a nurse.

914
01:28:09,905 --> 01:28:12,703
No. It might wait about for days.
That won't do.

915
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:15,243
You're a correspondent.
You've got priorities.

916
01:28:15,311 --> 01:28:17,472
Send it to your paper.
Tell them to forward it.

917
01:28:17,546 --> 01:28:19,571
I'm afraid you don't know
what the censors are like.

918
01:28:19,649 --> 01:28:21,583
I don't care either.

919
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:24,518
They want to turn me into a tin-pot hero,
I'm gonna cash in on it.

920
01:28:27,123 --> 01:28:31,617
You see, I'm no longer the fellow
you knew in London as Colin Spence.

921
01:28:31,694 --> 01:28:35,630
I'm another man altogether,
and a very good one.

922
01:28:35,698 --> 01:28:40,158
I had to come all the way out here
to meet a tough sergeant named Kelly...

923
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:43,205
who was born in a slum
and educated in an army camp...

924
01:28:43,272 --> 01:28:46,036
before I was fiit
for a woman like Valentine.

925
01:28:48,044 --> 01:28:51,172
He's dead now,
but he taught me one thing.

926
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:56,310
If I want Valentine or anything else
worthwhile in life, I gotta fiight for it.

927
01:28:56,385 --> 01:29:00,481
That's not a bad thing
for a man to fiind out, is it, Benedict?

928
01:29:00,556 --> 01:29:03,320
Or for a nation either,
for that matter. To fiight?

929
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,455
- You're delirious.
- Never mind what I am. Go get that cable off.

[ Sighs ]
I'll murder you if you don't.

931
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:16,403
I've killed men, you know.
Men who'd make a meal of you.

932
01:29:16,472 --> 01:29:21,432
You think I'm joking,
but you're not quite sure, are you?

933
01:29:22,511 --> 01:29:25,605
I'll remove that doubt. I'm not.
