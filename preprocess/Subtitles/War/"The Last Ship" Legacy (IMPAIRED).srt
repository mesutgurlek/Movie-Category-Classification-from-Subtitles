Well, that confirms it.

165
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,180
If they're covering a High Value Unit,

166
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,381
that means Peng is there himself.

167
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,949
That ship is protecting him.

168
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,384
Peng's the kind of man that's
going to want to be there

169
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:18,919
to watch that art burn.

170
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,721
If the ship in the bay
is monitoring the area

171
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,356
outside the Archives and we
send a ground team after Peng...

172
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:24,318
His people spot us, ship
fires on the ground team.

173
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,726
But if we fire on the
ship without knowing

174
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,661
where the second destroyer
is, we give away our position.

175
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:30,696
And the second ship sinks us.

176
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,365
Doesn't leave us many
options for an approach.

177
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,801
It's a smart play by Peng.

178
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,470
Our target is the Japanese Archives

179
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,004
currently under the
protection of the Henan,

180
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,674
which is patrolling three
klicks off shore.

181
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,610
The mission to capture
Peng is a 2-pronged assault.

182
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,345
Cobra Team will take the
Chinese Destroyer Henan

183
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:49,582
at Tokyo Bay, cripple its
CIC, enabling Vulture Team,

184
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:52,752
led by CNO to storm Peng inside
the National Archives.

185
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,554
We estimate Henan's ordnance covers
a Weapons Engagement Zone

186
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:57,823
around the Archives of 80-plus miles.

187
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:00,993
However, they'll likely focus
their attention and their fire

188
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,696
on the area surrounding the
Archives building itself.

189
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,264
We'll call this the Hot Zone.

190
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:08,100
Now if Vulture Team is
detected approaching the Archives

191
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,402
from anywhere inside that Hot Zone

192
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,937
and we haven't taken Henan's CIC,

193
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,006
that ship fires on Vulture Team.

194
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:16,008
From our monitoring, we
know that Henan checks in

195
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,645
with Peng's ground forces
once every 15 minutes without fail.

196
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,714
Cobra Team will dive and
board Henan when it's D.I.W.

197
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:23,749
at the end of its patrol run in the bay.

198
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,451
Ship will be drifting toward us,

199
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,154
so that'll just shorten
our swim. Master Chief?

200
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,889
Henan is a Luyang III class

201
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,024
guided missile
destroyer similar to our...

Ripped off from our Arleigh Burke.

204
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,465
Everyone will study the layout.

205
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,567
We need to know every blind
alley on that ship.

206
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,502
Surgical strike on the pilot house, CIC,

207
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:46,071
and armory will give us
complete control over that vessel.

208
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,040
This goes as planned,
the rest of their crew

209
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,942
won't even know we're there.

210
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:54,313
Make no mistake, we're
going after a target

211
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,515
who's clearly anticipating us

212
00:10:56,517 --> 00:11:00,286
and who has a second
destroyer we cannot find.

213
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,022
Just one part of this
mission fails, it all fails.

In the absence of a...
legislative branch,

530
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:50,439
and without an operational
central government,

531
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:53,075

The Howard Oliver that
we know saved St. Louis.

Under your leadership, there
was no panic, no riots.

538

Even when there were 5,000

[Panting]

650
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:04,037
[Gun cocks]

651
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,340
Don't do this. Don't do this.

652
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,677
- Please, don't do this! Don't do...
- [Gunshot]

653
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,245
But that is not all.

654
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:14,714
We have just learned that this
cabal was also responsible

655
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:18,785
for the kidnapping of the
crew of Nathan James in Asia.

656
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,186
This was done with the cooperation

657
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,122
and planning of Captain Tom Chandler.

658
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:25,692
In fact, I struggle
to believe it's true.

659
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:29,162
But we have indisputable
evidence of his treachery.

660
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,130
Captain Chandler is
currently under arrest

661
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:35,068
and is heading back to North America.

662
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,938
[Voice breaking] These are
not easy words for me to say.

663
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,208
Oh, my God. She's
putting all this on you.

664
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,244
- <i>Excuse me. My apologies.</i>
- Nobody'll buy it.

665
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:46,579
The greater the lie, the
more people will believe it.

666
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:49,516
<i>We are strong people, and we
have survived worse than this.</i>

667
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:51,618
<i>And those who still love life, liberty,</i>

668
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,653
<i>and the pursuit of
happiness have come together</i>

669
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:56,389
<i>and formulated a plan to move forward.</i>

670
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:59,859
<i>So in the absence of any working
federal government,</i>

671
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,661
<i>and deriving their just powers</i>

672
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:03,730
<i>from the consent of the governed,</i>

673
00:40:03,732 --> 00:40:06,733
<i>your regional leaders,
Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft</i>

674
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:08,735
<i>hereby call for the immediate suspension</i>

675
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:12,305
<i>of the government of the United States.</i>

676
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:14,307
<i>Each region will be
able to govern itself</i>

677
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,009
<i>and focus on reconstruction</i>

678
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:17,877
<i>until such time as a central authority</i>

679
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,412
<i>can be safely reestablished.</i>

680
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,967
Yeah. In other words, never.

681
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,869
<i>By the time you hear these words,</i>

682
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,571
<i>control of the Armed
Forces will have been split</i>

683
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,740
<i>among the regional leaders,</i>

684
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,375
<i>and I would like to assure you...</i>

685
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,543
<i>that the military
turnover has been peaceful,</i>

686
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:34,513
<i>thanks to an unprecedented collaboration</i>

687
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,849
<i>between the nation's highest-ranking
generals</i>

688
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,518
<i>and your four regional leaders. Aah!</i>

689
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,653
<i>All enlisted men and
women are to report to</i>

690
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,023
<i>regional military offices
immediately to become part...</i>

691
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,692
<i>Of one of four localized
armies under the command...</i>

692
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,294
Captain, I can't get the
generals on the line...

693
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,030
Any of them.

694
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,733
I tried to raise an entire Naval base.

695
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,435
It's a coup, Captain.

696
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,670
<i>Thank you and God bless.</i>

697
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,273
Those men are already dead.

698
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:05,044
If there's no military, what
does that mean for us?

699
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,014
It means we're all alone.

700
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:14,086
We lost our country, Tom.

701
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,491
Not yet.

702
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:24,062
Captain, set a course for
Naval Base San Diego, helpful.

703
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,408
Take us home.

704
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:41,001
