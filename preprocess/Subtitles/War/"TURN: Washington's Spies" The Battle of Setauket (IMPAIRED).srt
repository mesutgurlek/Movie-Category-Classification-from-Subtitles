Are you suggesting poison?

4
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:10,176
Someone was trying to kill you, sir.

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,141
Ah!

6
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:13,925
Father! Father!

7
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:16,861
Your father's been arrested, Ben.

8
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,882
<i>- My father?
- And Lucas Brewster, too.</i>

9
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:20,409
The charges are false.

10
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,266
Simcoe has created the threat.

11
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,517
All I have to do is present the case

12
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:25,674
and then just see it fall apart.

13

Do you have a better idea?

15
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:31,269
Gather those loyal, raid the armory,

16
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,335
storm the church, and...

17
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,133
Then we bring the war here to Setauket?

18
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:35,513
The war is already here!

19
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,271
I left town to cheat the hangman.

20
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,082

21

We wait for the rest of the unit

His wish was that I returned here.

I'm sorry if that upsets you.

The traitors here in
Setauket, hiding in secret,

Now listen to me.

00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,262
I'm gonna tell you something
that you can't repeat

56
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,434
to anyone else, and I mean it this time.

57
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:50,275
If you whisper this like
you did the gravestones,

58
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:54,185
there will be a price
to pay for both of us.

59
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:58,329
Captain Simcoe shot my father.

60
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:01,704
What?

61
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,780
He used an accomplice. Not sure who it was.

62
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:07,519
I don't think he cared if
my father lived or died,

63
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,494
just as long as he
hanged a Tallmadge for it.

64
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,906
This is wrong.

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,811
Well, Mary, it's the truth, so...

66
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:19,785
What about the petition that
Tallmadge and the others signed?

67
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,355
The one that you prosecuted them for?

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,929
All the petition says is
that they believe in liberty.

69
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,937
I took the case on with
the aim to prove that.

70
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,576
You lied to everyone

71
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:32,150
Didn't you just
hear what I...

72
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,994
Fine. That's just fine, then.

73
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,733
<i>Now that... no, now that you
know, you can go make it right.</i>

74
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,672
No, go tell Hewlett. Go
and get that ruling reversed

75
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,443
so you can see all of those men hanged.

76
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,113
- I wouldn't do that.
- No, of course you wouldn't

77
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:45,380
because then you'd be
the wife of a traitor.

78
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,382
And you would be hanged for treason.

79
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,185
(scoffs) Treason?

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,354
Is that truly how you see it?

81
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:55,124
- Yes, that's the law.
- And is that what you believe?

82
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,526
<i>Huh? Tell me.</i>

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,467
Tell me what you believe in.

84
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,758
I believe in family.

85
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,863
I believe that a husband
should live with his wife,

86
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:06,366
should lay with his wife if he's able to,

87
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,769
and if he's not, then
be truthful about why.

88
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,471
You don't think that I'm able?

89
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:12,975
Well, I haven't had any
proof since the winter.

90
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,112
I assume you've been proving it elsewhere.

91

Just another thing that you've been hiding.

You want proof?

preferably along with the armed vessel

165
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,461
we so graciously loaned him
in order to ship his tobacco.

166
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,329
- Yes, Major.
- Go!

167
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,302
Richard, what are you doing out of bed?

168
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:47,671
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no, nonsense.

169
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:50,874
You've already taken a wound
in service to the crown.

170
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,776
It is now time for me to defend Setauket

171
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,811
from those who wish to defile her.

172
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:58,448
I knew this day was coming
and I am ready, my old friend.

173
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,650
I want to meet my
enemy face-to-face.

174
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:02,585
You must protect Whitehall.

175
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,088
It's sure to be a target of this raid.

176
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,024
I will try to hold them at the water.

177
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,265
No.

178
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,468
Please, I cooperated.

179
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,269
I gave you the names
of these men, remember?

180
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,571
Like it was yesterday.

181
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,873
Come on, Brewster. Up with you.

182
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:26,209
Give him some help.

183
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,982
We were sentenced to a prison ship.

184
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,351
Under whose orders are we now to be hanged?

185
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,452
Mine.

186
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,488
<i>(men shouting)</i>

187
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,761
We're with you!

188
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:48,964
To the garrison! Grab them!

189
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,936
(shouting continues)

190
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,471

191
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,541
<i>(women screaming)</i>

192
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,616
Shoulder the muskets. Ready.

193
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,387
Shoulder. Tend to the cannon.

194
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,389
<i>British soldier: Make ready!</i>

195
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,491
<i>Present!</i>

196
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,860
Fire!

197
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,395
(yelling)

198
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,563
Reload!

199
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:23,532
<i>Simcoe: Into the church!</i>

200
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,609
Fall back!

201
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,778
Fall back!

202
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:48,323
- Get back in there.
- Get your hands off me.

203
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,191
<i>Don't give me any trouble.</i>

204
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,861
The town's ours.

205
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:57,265
- They've taken the captives to the church.
- Shite.

206
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,602
- Search every door and get everyone inside the tavern.
- All right.

207
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,637
And remind the men that no private
property is to be destroyed.

208
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,272
<i>(gunshot)</i>

209
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,648
<i>Man: That's Selah Strong.</i>

210
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,896
Oi.

211
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,056
You're gonna love this.

212
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,192
You know them bloody-backs
used the church as stables?

213
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:00,527
Well, they're using your old
schoolhouse as a magazine.

214
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,229
Two dozen barrels of powder.

215
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,698
He wasn't lying. They
ripped out the gravestones.

216
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:09,436
<i>Caleb: Unholy bastards.</i>

217
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,505
<i>Ah, here comes their leader.</i>

218
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:22,115
Smuggle out the powder and any
other military stores you can find.

219
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,718
All right.

220
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,490
I don't recall giving
the orders to hang anyone.

221
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:33,827
But, sir, don't you see? This very raid
confirms the treason of the accused.

222
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:36,496
They obviously got word out to
these rebels to come and rescue them.

223
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,733
No doubt the selfsame dragoons that
ambushed our regiment in Connecticut.

224
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,735
I cannot abide executing
prisoners, Captain.

225
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,239
Not when it reflects
dishonorably upon my command.

226
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:50,343
This conflict will be
conducted in a civil manner!

227
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:56,416
Complement one, are you ready to fire?

228
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,918
Well, uh...

229
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,887
we'll likely hit the gallows, sir.

230
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,989
<i>If that's acceptable.</i>

231
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:08,027
No, it is not.

232
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,442
You secured the prisoners,
but not the powder!

233
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:25,344
Complement two,

234
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:28,948
adjust your quadrant,
target the storehouse.

235
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:31,750
Now!

236
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,287
Assistance is on its way and
I will not have the rebels

237
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:36,889
absconding with our powder.

238
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:39,358
Or using it against us.

239
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:42,261
You may fire when ready.

240
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,498
- Shh, shh. It's all right.
- (Thomas crying)

241
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,301
<i>It's all right. Shh, shh.</i>

242
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,838
It's all right. Come on. Shh, shh.

243
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:56,208
- It's all right.
- Would you please shut that thing up?

244
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:02,114
May I offer your men some ale?

245
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,484
<i>May you offer?</i>

246
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:08,086
(all gasp)

247
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,188
This is my tavern, DeJong.

248
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:13,158
I built it, I own it.

249
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:16,561
And your wife sold it to me.

250
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:20,365
I had no choice. They were
going to take it anyway.

251
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,066
She had no right to sell it.

252
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:24,169
The agreement is not binding.

253
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,538
I did not write the attainder.

254
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,473
Take it up with Judge Woodhull.

255
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:31,009
Oh, I will, trust me.

256
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,444
I have plenty to settle with the judge.

257
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,449
<i>Last one out the door. Quickly.</i>

258
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,718
Got it.

259
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,060
Stand clear.

260
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:55,466
Fall back! Fall back!

261
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,135
(rumbling)

262
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,109
Ah.

263
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:06,710
Reload.

264
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,546
- Reload!
- Yes, sir.

265
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,648
And hold fire until ordered!

266
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:14,051
- Sir? Sir?
- Yes?

267
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:16,954
The magistrate is requesting
access into the camp.

268
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,226
(groans)

269
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:25,462
Richard, you shouldn't be here.

270
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:28,532
Have you seen my son? Is he in the town?

271
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,001
Let's get you inside.

272
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:34,838
Hey.

273
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:37,040
Will you burn your hometown now, Tallmadge?

274
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,209
It's the king's men who are burning it,

275
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,144
but take heart, we'll
have them out soon enough.

276
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,979
Why don't you hold your tongue, Robeson?

277
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,581
<i>Before you lose it?</i>

278
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:47,918
Selah.

279
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:55,091
Hewlett has us at range.

280
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,660
We can't hope to hit him from here.

281
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:58,628
I need you to put pressure on his flank.

282
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,531
We can move up the ridge
to conceal our approach.

283
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:03,767
That's even higher ground than his church.

284
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:07,604
<i>Our church. Let's take it back, hmm?</i>

285
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,941
Come with me.

286
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,677
Say something.

287
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,416
Benjamin.

288
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:27,624
The major isn't firing
on us, he's firing on you.

289
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,994
<i>Now, whatever you boys came here
to prove, I think you've proved it.</i>

290
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,664
But I'm telling you right now,
you will never take that garrison.

291
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:38,434
All you're gonna do is get all
these people killed, all right?

292
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:45,908
Is that your wife, Woodhull? And your son?

293
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,477
Yes, it is, yeah.

294
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:50,313
Hmm.

295
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:52,481
It's very fine to meet you, Mrs. Woodhull.

296
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:56,118
I seem to remember your
husband as a much quieter man.

297
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,751
Where the bloody hell is Floyd?

298
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,352
Are you sure we need him?

299
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,588
Seems to me you're doing an
excellent job of repelling the rebels.

300
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,256
If you simply continue
the bombardment...

301
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,425
My orders are to protect
this port, not level it.

302
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,260
We must hold for reinforcements.

303
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,828
We have the high ground, sir,

304
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,698
and they failed to achieve their
objective with their opening thrust.

305
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:22,467
To simply wait when it's
within our power to crush them...

306
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,536
I will determine the
strategy here, Captain Sim...

307
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,073
<i>(gunshots)</i>

308
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:30,909
Selah: Rear right forward!

309
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,712
<i>- (groaning)
- (Gunsts)</i>

310
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:36,281
Take aim! Fire!

311
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,050
(shattering)

312
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,352
<i>(gunshots)</i>

313
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,923
"They that sow wickedness, reap the same."

314
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,424
Indeed, Reverend.

315
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,231
Put your arms up towards the heavens.

316
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:55,533
Shield the windows with the others!

317
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:59,804
Captain, don't do this.

318
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,440
Sit down before you fall down.

319
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:08,613
Selah: Hold your fire.

320
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,481
Who's the fastest man here?

321
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,049
Ben: Damn it, what kind of a commander

322
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:13,751
uses prisoners as a barricade?

323
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,820
It's likely Captain Simcoe.
You may not know of him,

324
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,588
but he's less subtle than the major.

325
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,423
They mean to hold out
until reinforcements arrive.

326
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,258
<i>Caleb: I figure we got
till sundown to break them.</i>

327
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,826
<i>Ben: If that. You need
to take another detachment</i>

328
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,495
<i>and round on them from the east.</i>

329
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,330
<i>Then I'll send forth terms for surrender.</i>

330
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:27,565
<i>If we take the church,
then we can use their cannons</i>

331
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,233
to defend against the next wave.

332
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,068
Hewlett will never surrender to you.

333
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,971
And Simcoe will shoot down any Continental

334
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:37,574
who approaches the church and then he
will kill your father and your uncle.

335
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,245
Well, maybe we'll use his men to shield us.

336
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,213
(cups clatter)

337
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:44,848
<i>- (gasps)
- Anna: Leave him be!</i>

338
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:46,450
<i>If you say you're better than them,</i>

339
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,151
then show it by your restraint, Brewster.

340
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:51,788
The major is a fair man. He
will respect a flag of truce.

341
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,557
(Thomas crying)

342
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:56,259
You said that Selah saw the
magistrate inside the church.

343
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,896
That means your father's
there as well, Abe.

344
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,798
Whatever happens to mine happens to yours,

345
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,035
which makes you the perfect
man to deliver our terms.

346
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:13,510
Let's take him somewhere private, huh?

347
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:15,111
No!

348
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,746
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- It's all right.

349
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,715
We need your husband to send a message.

350
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:20,016
We're not gonna hurt him.

351
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,451
(gasps)

352
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:24,287
Not much anyways.

353
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:27,791
Mrs. Strong, would you
kindly open the cellar for us?

354
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,531
Easy, easy, easy!

355
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:37,166
Hey, hey! (laughs)

356
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,402
Just keeping up the ruse, Woody, all right?

357
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:41,804
- Ben, what the hell is this?
- Anna: Shh, you want them to hear us up there.

358
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,473
Hey, I'm sorry.

359
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,441
I couldn't send warning. There was no time.

360
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,610
It was only by God's good grace
that we came across Walter Havens.

361
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,978
He told us about the hangings.

362
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,280
- There were no hangings.
- What?

363
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:54,750
Not till you showed up. I had convinced
Hewlett to commute their sentences.

364
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,218
They were bound instead for the Jersey.

365
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:58,888
Oh, the Jersey.

366
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:00,723
'Cause that ain't a death sentence, is it?

367
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:04,427
Anna: Apparently it's not.

368
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,464
I stood on the deck of that ship

369
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:11,767
and had the warden tell me that
Selah died there over Christmas.

370
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:15,004
I have lived with that belief

371
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,473
since last we were in
New York spying for you.

372
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,408
Surely you had time enough to warn me

373
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:23,045
that my husband was alive and
serving alongside you both.

374
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:27,382
Look...

375
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,151
Anna, I'm sorry.

376
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:31,053
It was my decision.

377
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:35,324
Caleb wanted to tell, you but I said no.

378
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:38,060
The truth is, your husband is alive

379
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:40,395
because my brother is dead.

380
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,565
Robert Rogers used the promise of Samuel

381
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,901
as bait to trap me.

382
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,110
Samuel is dead?

383
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,647
Selah was with him when he passed.

384
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,683
So I can confirm for you that, yes,

385
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:03,985
the Jersey is a death sentence,

386
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,789
and I will not see my father sent there.

387
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:09,857
So...

388
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,461
so this raid is family business?

389
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,396
It's personal?

390
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,434
You saying you wouldn't do the same?

391
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,803
No, no, I'm just saying
it makes sense, is all.

392
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,372
More sense than Washington
sending you both here anyway.

393
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:27,642
He granted me discretion to
advance my mission as I see fit.

394
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,944
Oh, I see. So you're gonna have
to explain it all to him, then.

395
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:33,414
Good. When you do, please inform 711

396
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:36,484
that his precious Mr.
Culpepper is finished.

397
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,853
- I am out.
- Nobody is out.

398
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:42,323
Your standing in this town is intact
and I intend to keep it that way.

399
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:44,625
I'm not a soldier in your army, Major.

400
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:47,528
I don't have to take your orders.

401
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:51,231
But you're right about one thing.

402
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,802
My standing in this town
is all you've got left.

403
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:58,372
Now, I wasn't lying when I told
you Hewlett would never surrender.

404
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:02,176
And you know there's no chance
that you take that church

405
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,112
before some force on this island shows up.

406
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:11,051
We ain't leavin' without
our family, all right?

407
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:15,689
Well, then I guess today
you take your orders from me.

408
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,709
<i>Abe: They are more
than 50, less than 100.</i>

409
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:12,178
I tried to take a silent count,
but they caught me lookin'.

410
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,713
I knew their numbers were exaggerated.

411
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,881
They still outnumber us
and they have our flank.

412
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,817
- So you mean to surrender?
- No.

413
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,452
- They don't request...
- Good because I'd hate

414
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:21,053
you to become the first commander

415
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,812
to let the patriots get
a foothold on Long Island.

416
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,290
<i>Abe: to They don't askts get
a for surrender, sir.</i>

417
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:27,660
They... they know that
you will never bow.

418
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,962
<i>(Richard coughing)</i>

419
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,901
Abraham, what are their terms?

420
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,471
Tallmadge says that he will trade

421
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,306
the soldiers that he has in his custody

422
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,208
<i>for the prisoners here in the church.</i>

423
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:46,478
And that he will then
order a withdrawal, sir.

424
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,915
Eight civilians in exchange
for conceding the field?

425
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,683
When they have the numbers?

426
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,019
I can't decide whether they think
themselves cowards or us fools.

427
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,988
If further harm comes to any
of the prisoners here, sir,

428
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,356
<i>he will retaliate in kind,</i>

429
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,025
<i>and I am concerned for my family</i>

430
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,727
and the other Loyalist captives down there.

431
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,562
Your concern is none of our concern.

432
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,864
Enough! You make it so I
cannot hear myself think.

433
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,668
Major, you said yourself these
men are like a gangrenous limb,

434
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,670
a sickness that needs to
be bled from this town.

435
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:13,705
<i>- This is our chance.
- Lucas: A sickness?</i>

436
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,473
What do you know of sickness, Woodhull?

437
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,509
Quiet, Lucas, if you
know what's good for you.

438
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,644
And this Major Tallmadge,
he has given his word

439
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,346
that he will withdraw
following the exchange?

440
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,348
The word of a traitor means nothing.

441
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,517
These are hardened criminals.
If we just let them go,

442
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,686
we're only adding to the
ranks of the Continental Army!

443
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,687
Captain, you will keep your
opinion to when it is required.

444
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,322
To yield is to show weakness.

445
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,224
I will yield nothing that
I do not wish to yield!

446
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,693
- I'm trying to save the town!
- Then kill the enemy!

447
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,595
<i>Force them to charge the barricade!</i>

448
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,964
Give them cannon and musket full-on!

449
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,802
All they require is proper motivation!

450
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,637
Captain, bring him back at once!

451
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,776
(hammer clicks)

452
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,781
(gunshot)

453
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,185
(shouts)

454
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,860
Fire!

455
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,130
(shouting)

456
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,499
No, Caleb, stop!

457
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,401
<i>Caleb!</i>

458
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,805
- Calm down. Caleb. Caleb, calm down.
- God!

459
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,340
Eastin, your pistol, please.

460
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:26,009
<i>Hewlett: Belay that.
Arrest Captain Simcoe.</i>

461
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,711
Now!

462
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,585
(grunting)

463
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:39,822
<i>You deserve what's coming
to you, Oyster Major.</i>

464
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,591
That's what they call you, you know.

465
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,761
Commander of the
army's backwater-bred...

466
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,663
(muffled)

467
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:57,874
Prepare the cannon to repel a charge.

468
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,876
We're in a fight to the death now.

469
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,744
Not if you let them go.

470
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:07,483
The prisoners, now. All of them.

471
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:10,286
I'm quite sure an exchange
is off the table, Richard.

472
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,189
No exchange...
a release,

473
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:16,725
unconditional and immediate.

474
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,063
And the good reverend will
convince his son to withdraw.

475
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:26,969
I see no honor in this fight
going on. Only further bloodshed.

476
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:29,605
(coughing)

477
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:36,912
I'll have you know, it wasn't
me who took that shot at you.

478
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:45,954
- Caleb: Come on!
- Ben: Just calm down. Calm down.

479
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,923
(grunts)

480
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:50,025
All right!

481
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,661
- Stay down. Stay down.
- All right!

482

498
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,380
Tell Washington it's Samuel Culper,

499
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:21,415
not Culpepper.

500
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,184
I won't sign the letters as anyone else.

00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,602

like every other thing in creation,

525
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,271
is subject to the natural
laws of cause and effect,

00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:17,441
especially when it is misused.

527
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:20,877
You are familiar with the science

528
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:23,647

529
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:25,782

Sherry or physics?

531
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:31,354
Best of luck with that.

532
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,456
You may need a drink after we're done.

533
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:38,194
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
come when I was summoned,

534
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,264
but, you see, the cursed
rebels had other ideas.

535
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:45,001
Benedict Arnold cut off half
our regiments from the fleet.

<i>If it weren't for

won't spare you from yours, Robert.

539
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,742
Did you really think General
Howe would countenance

540
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:55,612
your insubordination of last
month's prisoner exchange?

541
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,814
<i>For every action,</i>

542

<i>there is an equal and opposite reaction.</i>

Or consequence, if you prefer.

544
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:09,292
Inspector General Innes has
granted me full authority

545
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:11,427

546
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:13,563
before they become, and I quote,

547
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:17,400
"a disorderly and destructive banditti."

548
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,772
This ain't about no
prisoner exchange, is it?

549
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:25,040
You lads have had it in for me

550
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:28,544
ever since I refused to line your pockets

551
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:32,214
in exchange for commissions
and weak officers.

552
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:34,516
Instead, I hire
mean sorts...

553
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:38,287
Indians, trackers,
Negroes, brawlers...

554
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:41,490
and I refuse to let any man

555
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:45,828
tell me how to go about my business.

556
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,865
That shouldn't be a problem anymore.

557
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:53,302
The Queen's Rangers will be
put under another's command.

558
00:35:55,905 --> 00:36:00,442
I am the Queen's Rangers,

559

and those boys won't follow anyone else.

560
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:05,414
Those boys are mercenaries.

561
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:06,982
They follow coin.

562
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:14,055
And I plan to pay.

563
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,593
Oh, aye, you'll pay, all right.

00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:42,684
about causes

568
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:44,919

Hmm?

<i>(laughs)</i>

A trick about these effects

572

is they have ways

573
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:10,544
of turning into new causes

Let me explain about all of this.

What is there to explain?

597
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:10,863
You are a traitor and an adulterer

598

Oh, I'm sorry...

your Patriot friends
