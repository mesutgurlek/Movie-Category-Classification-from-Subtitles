1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,540
Bloody rope.
What?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,300
Is it too heavy for you?

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,580
Ah!

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,140
Come on.
I'm coming.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,740
Got the torch?
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,820
Trust me. Come on.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,820
Right, this is the place.
Are you sure?

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,980
I told you, there's no-one there.
Okey-doke.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,100
Hurry up.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,900
I love the war, the blackout,
no cars on the street.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,380
It just makes life so easy.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,860
You sure there's no-one here?
Hand it over.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,060
Trust me, mate. This'll do it.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,540
Cor, look at this place.

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
It's like a bloody museum.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,460
This stuff must be worth a fortune.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,380
No bloody use to us.
We can find the smaller stuff.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,180
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,580
Frank?
We got the wrong house.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,220
We thought a friend lived here.

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,780
You are thieves.
I heard you break the door.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,820
No. No, you got it wrong, mate.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,540
Tell me your names. If you do not
tell me, I will shoot you where you
stand.

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,900
I will start with him.
Frank Morgan.

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,940
That's my brother, Terry.

26
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,980
You are...burglars.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,540
We didn't mean anything, mister.
We're sorry. We'll scram.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,580
You will stay exactly where you are.

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,940
Do you know what this place is?
Do you know who I am?

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,340
No, we just...

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,100
Sh-sh! Hm.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,060
This could be the very worst night
of your life

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,260
or it could be the best.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,340
It could make you very rich

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,300
because it just so happens I am
looking for someone just like you.

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,220
What do you mean? Ah!

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,020
From now on, you speak
only when you are spoken to.

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,340
From now on, you work for me.

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,340
Don't you recognise me?
Lydia?

40
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,860
I was afraid you wouldn't.

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,940
You been here long?
No, no, not long.

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,620
We came on the coach.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,500
Is this erm...

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,100
This is James. This is my son.

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,940
Well, may we come in?

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,140
Well, of course. Yes, erm...

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,060
Come on, James. Pick your bag up.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,140
Sit down.

49
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,220
Right.
So, here I am.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Yes, well...
You're looking very well.

51
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,340
I am well.

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,500
I don't know what you must think of
me...

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,420
...turning up like this.

54
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
I was very sorry not to see you at
the funeral.

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,300
Oh. Yeah, I wanted to go but they
wouldn't have wanted me there.

56
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,540
I'm sorry. I know how close you and
Daddy were.

57
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,100
My husband's in Tripoli. He's erm...

58
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,580
He's a staff sergeant in the 11th
Hussars.

59
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,940
You married him?
Yes.

60
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,100
I'm Lydia Nicholson now.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,380
Mm.

62
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,380
Erm, I'm sorry you never met him.
You know, you'd like him.

63
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,700
And, er, have you had something to
eat?

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,940
No. No, we haven't had anything.
What would you like?

65
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,980
He won't talk to you.

66
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,020
He won't talk to anyone.

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,660
He was er...
at Sibford Street School.

68
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,340
Ah, right.

69
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,500
It's a very simple question,
Professor Townsend.

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,460
Is it or isn't it going to work?

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,620
Well, the question may be simple,
Captain Boothroyd

72
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,060
but I'm afraid the answer is rather
less so.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,100
We need to know. We've got the test
tomorrow

74
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,500
and the actual operation itself is
planned for just one month from now.

75
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Now, we're only going to get one
crack at this. We have to know.

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,980
There's nothing wrong with the
machine. It works. Thank you, Hans.

77
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,740
It's not just the machine.

78
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,140
There are all sorts of elements we
need to factor in.

79
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,860
Initial velocity, underbody
turbulence, speed and height,

80
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,060
of course, and then there's the
question of weight.

81
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,060
These are the latest figures,
Professor.

82
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,940
They're reducing the size and
weight.

83
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Mm.

84
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,220
Well, it may make a difference.
I don't know.

85
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,700
And then there's still the question
of the framework. I'm sorry?

86
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,180
These wooden slats that will encase
the central sphere.

87
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,460
That's the problem. They won't hold.

88
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,180
Well, we don't know, of course,
but it's what we believe.

89
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,860
Anyway, tomorrow's tests will tell
us one way or another.

90
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,300
Well, maybe we should cancel the
test.

91
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,580
Absolutely not. There's a whole
world of difference between theory
and practice.

92
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
We need to see...
Professor Townsend -

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,620
I think you're forgetting the reason
why this unit was set up.

94
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,140
Mr Tizard wants facts, not
assumptions.

95
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,300
He will not continue to support this
project without your assurance that
it will actually work.

96
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,100
And I think I've explained to you,

97
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,980
I cannot give him that...yet.

98
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,140
Well, I hope for your sake that this
test is a success.

99
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,860
You're running out of time.
We all are.

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,020
Looks like a bit of a dump.

101
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Just as long as we get paid.

102
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,860
We're doing all right out of this and
when the war ends, we're going to be
well set up.

103
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,460
So what are we going to do this
time? What do you think?

104
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,020
There was just one bomb.

105
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,260
They say it was a thousand pounder.

106
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,620
I don't suppose the pilot knew he'd
targeted a school.

107
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,460
The teachers had heard the plane and
they were leading the children down
when it hit.

108
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,500
38 of them were killed
and six teachers.

109
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,620
When I got there, it was...

110
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,500
Well, you can imagine.

111
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,580
Those tiny bodies.

112
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,340
Some of them six years old.

113
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,660
And nobody crying.

114
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,900
Nobody screaming.

115
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,380
Some of the older children were
searching through the rubble,
"Can I help, Miss?"

116
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,580
James wasn't hurt.

117
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,820
Not even a scratch.

118
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,300
But he hasn't spoken since.

119
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,260
He won't say anything.

120
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
He's like this all the time.

121
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,660
I'm not even sure
he knows I'm there.

122
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,140
Does his father know?

123
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,620
I told him about the bomb and that
James wasn't hurt. That's all.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Robert is a wonderful father.

125
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,340
I wasn't wrong about him, you know,
no matter what everyone said.

126
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,820
Why have you come HERE?

127
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,940
What? You want us to go!
No, no, no. No, I didn't say that.

128
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,860
I just, erm, well, we haven't seen
each other for ten years...

129
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,780
We haven't been in touch. All of a
sudden you're here and...

130
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,260
I had nowhere else to go.

131
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,340
Things have been rather difficult
for me.

132
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,580
I have a job.

133
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
I'm erm... I'm an OWL operator.

134
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,860
You know, operator, wireless and
line.

135
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,780
It's with the Army
and it's very important work

136
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,460
and, well, having James like this,
it makes it completely impossible.

137
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,980
Well, the MO said maybe what he
needed was a change of scenery.

138
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,220
A bit of fresh air and when he
mentioned the seaside, well,
I thought of you.

139
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,260
I thought, maybe if we could stay
with you just...

140
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,700
just for a few days,
you know, maybe...

141
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,620
Thank you for walking home with me,
Hans. Good night.

142
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,060
Ah, you're home early.

143
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,540
Well...Yes.

144
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,940
I haven't started the tea yet.
Erm... I'll do it.

145
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,620
Oh, will you?

146
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,220
Oh, no, no, no. That's my job.

147
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,820
You sit down. You must be tired.

148
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,980
Did you...

149
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,060
walk home by yourself?

150
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,700
No, Hans came with me.

151
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,380
You were watching.

152
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,260
Hans.

153
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,220
And how is Hans?

154
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,380
Please don't start this again,
Michael. We do this all the time.

155
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,260
Round and round in circles.
You're the one in the circle.

156
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,420
I'll make the tea. And why don't we
go out this evening, the two of us?

157
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,580
We can go to the pub.
Don't patronise me, Evelyn.

158
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,260
I'm already going out.
I'm seeing some friends.

159
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,380
Oh! Hello. I'm Sam.

160
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,940
Is Mr Foyle in? I'm his driver.

161
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,540
James! Oh. I'm sorry.

162
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,180
I... I didn't see him open the door.

163
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,740
That's all right. I'll wait here.

164
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,780
All right.

165
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,060
Are you going to be all right?
Oh, yes.

166
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm going to take him down to the
sea.

167
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,380
Well, erm...
get yourself some lunch.

168
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,020
The British Restaurant is as good as
any. I do appreciate this.

169
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,580
See you this evening.

170
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,300
Isn't it absolutely wonderful what
the Russians are doing, sir?
Have you read the papers?

171
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,860
Good old Uncle Joe,
that's what I say.

172
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,980
Her name is Lydia. I'm her godfather.
James is her son.

173
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,740
Thank you. I wasn't going to ask.
Well, of course you weren't.

174
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,020
You haven't mentioned her before.

175
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,980
I haven't seen them for a very long
time. I knew her parents.

176
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,340
Her father was my commanding officer.
They were both killed in the blitz.

177
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,740
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what are you
going to do with them?

178
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,660
I'm not at all sure but if you keep
quiet about this for the moment, I'd
appreciate it.

179
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,980
I'll keep mum. You know me.
Yeah.

180
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,420
Mr Foyle, morning, sir.
Good morning.

181
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,620
I was expecting you half an hour
ago, sir. Yeah.

182
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,260
Mr Parkins is here, sir. The new
Assistant Commissioner.

183
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,140
He arrived early so I put him in
your office. Thanks.

184
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,860
You must be Detective Chief
Superintendent Foyle.

185
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,460
That's right.
Not a good start, if I may say so.

186
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,540
I don't like being kept waiting.

187
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,380
Well, it's nine o'clock, sir.
We were told to expect you at 11.

188
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,980
No matter. I take it you received my
letter.

189
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,500
I did. This is something about
gambling, isn't it?

190
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,380
From the tone of your voice, I take
it you don't consider it to be a
matter of importance.

191
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,860
Well, it is, I can assure you.

192
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,220
In fact, I've received instructions
at the very highest level.

193
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Er, what instructions exactly?

194
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,540
To crack down, Foyle!

195
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,580
Look, we've got these pontoon
schools everywhere not just in Pall
Mall and Chelsea.

196
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,300
Sometimes £10,000
changes hands in one night.

197
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,060
They're in shipyards, factories,
air-raid shelters

198
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,100
and some workers are losing a
month's wages in one throw.

199
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
Marked cards, impossible odds.

200
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,540
What you're talking about here is
nothing short of organised crime.

201
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,740
We do have a sergeant looking into
it. Just one man?

202
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,140
A very capable man.
I don't think it's good enough.

203
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,620
Perhaps you should wait to see the
report.

204
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,140
I take it you're too busy to look
into this matter yourself.

205
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, I am as a matter of fact.

206
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,900
Anything you care to share with me?

207
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,660
Well, you're very welcome to see the
file.

208
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,100
Sabotage?
That's right.

209
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,060
And? Well, there's been a fire at
the munitions works.

210
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,300
Another at the docks. Telephone lines
have been brought down

211
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,700
and all by the same people,
as far as we can see.

212
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,260
What makes you think that?
Just a feeling.

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,820
A gang of saboteurs working their
way along the coast.

214
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,180
That could be a serious business.

215
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,740
Not quite as serious as the gambling
perhaps but erm...

216
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,780
I should warn you, Foyle.

217
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,180
I've been told about you.
You get results.

218
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,220
You're a good worker. But you're
also insubordinate.

219
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,580
You seem to forget that you're part
of a chain of command that stretches
all the way back to London.

220
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,460
Well, I'm here to remind you that
you're not indispensable.

221
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,900
Well, I'm very pleased to hear it.

222
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,900
I shall be here for a week. I shall
be visiting other stations.

223
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,660
I've booked in to the Regency Hotel.

224
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,020
May I borrow your driver?

225
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
Er, please do.

226
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,260
Scared the life out of him.
He choked on a chicken bone...

227
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,180
I need Mr Foyle's driver to take me
to the Regency Hotel. Where is he?

228
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,140
Oh, that's me, sir.

229
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
What?

230
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,220
I'm Mr Foyle's driver.

231
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,900
But that's not a police uniform.

232
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,540
Well, no. I was, erm, transferred
from the MTC.

233
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,020
I know it's irregular but what with
the war, there was no-one else.

234
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,260
It's more than irregular. A transfer
from the MTC? It's unheard of.

235
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,980
How long has this been going on for?

236
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,540
About three years.
I don't mind, really!

237
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,740
It's not you I'm thinking of.

238
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,740
It's police procedure.
Would you rather walk, sir?

239
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,380
I'd thank you not to be insolent,
Sergeant. How far is it?

240
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,340
About half an hour. Uphill.

241
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,260
Where's the car?

242
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,060
This way, sir.

243
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,180
Any luck?
Oh, yes, sir.

244
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,260
I've managed to join a game tonight.

245
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,740
Where's that?
They're meeting at a warehouse.

246
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,340
They?
No names yet.

247
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,780
They're a London-based gang.

248
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,780
They run games in the docks.
What games?

249
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,620
Dice. Crown and Anchor.

250
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,300
Looks fair enough on the face of it

251
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,820
but as soon as you start betting on
doubles and triples,

252
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,620
the odds are stacked against you.

253
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,020
Need any help?
I don't think so, sir.

254
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,780
I'll get some names and then I'll
make the arrest. Right.

255
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,380
And get the Assistant Commissioner
off your back. Thank you.

256
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,820
Here it comes.

257
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,380
What happened?
I didn't see. What happened?

258
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,897
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

259
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:58,497
All right. Come on, last throw of
the evening, I'm in a generous
mood.

260
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:00,377
I'm offering 4-1 on triples.

261
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,577
3-1 on doubles. Evens all the rest.

262
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,577
Three crowns. Here's a quid.

263
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:08,297
Doubles on hearts.

264
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,057
Diamonds the same.
Will you take an IOU?

265
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,257
Mr Richards, unless I'm very much
mistaken you're already...

266
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,097
30 bob...
30 shillings down.

267
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,897
Hendry, you know I'm good for it.

268
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,897
What are you betting?
Five bob on spades.

269
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:21,617
All right. Put him down.

270
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:24,017
What's all this chat about?
Get on with it.

271
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:27,177
Young man in a hurry, eh?
All right. Any more bets?

272
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,777
DISAPPOINTED GROANS

273
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:40,137
Three anchors but no takers. Pay out
on one heart, one crown and one
club.

274
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,937
And, gentlemen, that is the last
throw of the evening.

275
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:44,857
Thank you very much.
Wait a minute.

276
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,857
One more throw.
You've lost enough.

277
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,617
Look, I've got plenty of money.

278
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,777
Two nicker on crowns.
Frank.

279
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:54,857
Three crowns?
Let's go, Frank.

280
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,857
This is just for you.

281
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:00,297
Oh!

282
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,377
Bad luck. Bad luck.
And this is just for me.

283
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,857
That's 35 shillings, Mr Richards.

284
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:09,417
Yes, of course. Well, I'll make it
up to you. I just need a bit of
time.

285
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:11,857
How much time?
Riley, let him go.

286
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:16,017
Mr Richards, you've got 24 hours.

287
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,897
Then we come calling.

288
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:25,457
Mr Hendry? I was wondering,
when can I get another game?

289
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:27,897
I don't think I know you.

290
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:31,217
No. Paul Milner.
I ain't seen you here before.

291
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:33,937
Well, I haven't been here long.
You from the Smoke?

292
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,857
Why do you want to know?
No reason.

293
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:39,937
I didn't see you put too much money
on the table.

294
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,017
Oh, well this was just a warm-up.

295
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,777
Pretty lukewarm, if you ask me.
You be here tomorrow night?

296
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,017
Maybe.
All right. I'll see you, then.

297
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,017
Sure.

298
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,177
So, how much did we lose?
I don't know how they do it.

299
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:03,657
Every bloody time.

300
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,057
Oi, copper.
Oi!

301
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:12,737
Are you talking to me?
You think we can't see through you?

302
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:15,657
Asking questions. Sniffing around.

303
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,537
We can smell you.

304
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,537
Hey, you've made a mistake.

305
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,617
Yeah?
It's you who's made a mistake.

306
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:28,657
Frank.
Get him!

307
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:34,257
Hey, what are you doing? You get
away from here, you nancies.

308
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:36,337
It's none of your business.
Yeah?

309
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,097
Come on!
Hit him!

310
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:55,097
Yeah, you bloody cowards!
Thanks.

311
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,417
Hey, don't mention it, mate.
Come on, Terry.

312
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,417
Hey, wait!

313
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:10,937
Oh, morning.
I'm sorry. James has wet the bed.

314
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:17,737
He does it quite often.
Oh, right. Well, is he all right?

315
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,577
Oh, yes, he's fine.
Shall I just take them through?

316
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,177
Yes, put them in there.

317
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:35,977
Erm, breakfast?
Erm, not just yet, thanks.

318
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:44,417
Listen, it's not really any of my
business but erm...

319
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:47,777
it seems to me perhaps you should be
thinking about getting some help.

320
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,257
For me?
No, no, for James.

321
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:54,097
Well, what help is there?

322
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:58,457
I've been to doctors. And, well,
they all say the same.

323
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,897
He's still in shock because of what
happened with the bomb.

324
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:04,617
I'm hoping being here will help.

325
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:10,457
Erm, how long can we stay here?

326
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,617
Well,
how long were you thinking of?

327
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,857
I don't know. I've got nothing to
get back to in London.

328
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,537
It wasn't my fault, you know.

329
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:27,257
I fell in love.

330
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:31,697
Daddy didn't want to see me again.

331
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:34,937
After James was born,
it was as if I didn't exist.

332
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,657
Well, I don't know.
I wasn't there but erm...

333
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,377
I was with your father in very
difficult circumstances

334
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,977
and the man you're describing is,
frankly, nothing to do with the man I
knew.

335
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:48,097
Well, it's as you say.

336
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:50,177
You weren't there.

337
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:56,697
He hurt me. Well, you all did.

338
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:02,497
I was in love and I chose a life for
myself with Robert.

339
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:05,497
You didn't even try to understand.

340
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,657
I wrote to you.
Did you?

341
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:12,097
You didn't get the letter I wrote to
you? No.

342
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:19,057
KNOCK AT DOOR
It's your driver.

343
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,577
Yes, erm...

344
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:31,937
Listen,
these people might be able to help.

345
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:40,457
Try them.
Melanie Klein and Anna Freud?

346
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:44,457
Yeah, they've been very helpful for
some children.

347
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,497
They're Germans?

348
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,617
Erm, Jewish refugees, I believe.

349
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:54,297
You do realise if I wasn't here,
James would have no-one.

350
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:58,177
He has his father.
He HAD a father.

351
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,657
A wonderful father.

352
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,977
But, erm, I haven't heard from
Robert in a long while and who knows
where he is right now?

353
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:18,817
I'll see you, then. I've done the
washing up and your lunch is in the
pantry.

354
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,057
Thank you.
I may be home late.

355
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:26,817
Oh, really? It's a big day. There
was a test last night.

356
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:30,657
A test? Don't ask me to talk about
it, Michael. You know I can't.

357
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:34,777
Whatever made you think I was going
to ask you about it? It's nothing to
do with me.

358
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,177
So how much did you lose last night?
What?

359
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,417
I take it that's where you were.

360
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,337
What was it? Chuck-A-Luck?
Pontoon? How much?

361
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:53,257
A few bob. I've got to have
something to do with my time.

362
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:54,897
Don't look in my purse.

363
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,777
You've gone through the
housekeeping. I've got my own money.

364
00:24:58,017 --> 00:25:01,137
You got through that weeks ago. The
local shop won't take our credit.

365
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:02,937
That's all right for you, isn't it?

366
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:07,217
What with your cushy little number.
"Working late..."

367
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:10,257
What's that meant to mean? You think
I don't know what's going on?

368
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:13,177
You think I'm just going to stand
here and put up with it?

369
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:16,257
What are you going to do, Michael?
Are you going to be cruel to me?

370
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:19,297
Are you going to start drinking? Are
you going to hurt me?

371
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:22,777
You've done it all already.
I won't even notice.

372
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,657
Hold still.

373
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,657
Sorry. Does it hurt anywhere else?

374
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,457
Everywhere. You should have had
somebody else with you.

375
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,617
Sam... Well, it could have been a
lot worse.

376
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:45,577
Are you all right?
Yes, sir, thank you.

377
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:48,617
First aid training in the MTC. I
always knew it would come in handy.

378
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,217
Are they likely to be back?
I doubt it.

379
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:55,297
My guess is they'll move the game
further down the coast.

380
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:58,617
It's a result of a sort. Not the one
the Assistant Commissioner wanted.

381
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,257
Is it my imagination or is the new
Assistant Commissioner worse than
the old one?

382
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:04,897
That's enough, thank you.
Sir? Yep.

383
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:08,377
The two lads that helped me, Terry
and Frank, I'd say they're brothers.

384
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:11,817
The eldest couldn't have been more
than 18 but they had plenty of cash

385
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,057
and they were throwing it away.
Wealthy family?

386
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,177
I don't think so.
They didn't seem the sort.

387
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:19,017
You know where to find them?
I don't but I'd like to have a go.

388
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:22,577
Do. If it hadn't been for them, who
knows what would have happened?

389
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,377
Well, if I find them,
I'll thank them.

390
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:34,617
Maybe if we're lucky, we'll see a
destroyer or a spitfire.

391
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:37,457
Hey? You'd like that, wouldn't you?

392
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:47,657
James, you've got to talk to me.

393
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:56,537
You've got to talk to Mummy because
if you don't tell me what you're
thinking, how can I help you?

394
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:02,457
I'm so sorry.

395
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,537
God, I have tried so hard...

396
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,177
And it's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

397
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:20,257
But I'm going to make it
better for you.

398
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:24,137
That's all that matters.

399
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,497
And one day, you'll understand.

400
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:31,417
James, huh?

401
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:36,337
I'm doing it for you.

402
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,777
That's all you need to know.

403
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:50,457
You have located the building?
Yeah. What do they do there?

404
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,977
Nothing of great consequence, my
friend.

405
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:58,137
You are concerned?
This stuff we're doing for you...

406
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:02,137
It is, I am sure, preferable to many
years with hard labour.

407
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,137
We don't want to do it any more.

408
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:07,217
Hm, it is a little too late for that
now.

409
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:13,897
I have told you, Frank, I am a
pacifist. I wish harm to no-one.

410
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,017
What I am doing only is to show that
the war is wrong.

411
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:19,337
Yeah, but it's not you doing it. It's
Terry and me.

412
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,577
And you are being well paid for it.

413
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:24,337
This time I will pay you double.

414
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:28,577
It is only because I am pleased with
the work you have done.

415
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,857
Another fire?
No.

416
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:37,297
This time I have something more
dramatic in mind.

417
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:41,377
It is very safe

418
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:43,337
and simple to use.

419
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:55,577
Now on the face of it, the test was
a complete fiasco.

420
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,057
The wooden cladding shattered on
impact.

421
00:28:58,217 --> 00:29:00,217
As we predicted.

422
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:03,857
Yes. Well, we don't gain any points
for nay-saying, Hans.

423
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,617
But the steel core held.
Yes.

424
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:10,937
Were they using our figures? The
back spin was 500 revs per minute.

425
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:14,297
The package was dropped from 60 feet
at 240 miles per hour.

426
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,937
But then it works.

427
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:19,897
It works.

428
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:23,777
Tizard has persuaded the RAF to move
ahead with a full-scale
operational version.

429
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:25,457
That's wonderful!

430
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:29,497
Yes, but we're going to have to go
over everything again.

431
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:33,057
The pilots are going to have to go
in so low that it's almost suicidal
anyway.

432
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:36,057
Plus the fact that they'll have
6,000 pounds of high explosive

433
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,137
spinning in the middle of their
fuselage.

434
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:43,017
Now, let's make sure that they don't
blow up before they arrive.

435
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:46,857
I've brought you some lunch,
darling.

436
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:49,097
It's a Spam sandwich
and a glass of milk.

437
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:01,457
I have to go away for a little
while.

438
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:15,017
You're to wait here for your Uncle
Christopher to come home.

439
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:42,857
We know AB and CD are parallel.

440
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:47,457
So, what can anyone tell me about
this angle here at AEF?

441
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:52,257
Yes, Nicholas?
It's the same as EFD?

442
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:54,617
Spot on.

443
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,777
Is that meant to be me?

444
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,017
Not very flattering.
Come on, concentrate.

445
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:03,577
Yes, so if EFD is 45 degrees
and we know that the total

446
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:09,057
has to add up to a 180 degrees,
therefore, this angle here is...

447
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:12,857
Yes, Nicholas?
45 degrees.

448
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:16,417
45 degrees. Well done, well done.

449
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:19,857
Mr Richards? Yes.
I want to play football.

450
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:23,217
I wonder if I might have a word?
Bye, sir.

451
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:26,217
Bye. Do I know who you are?
Bye, see you Tuesday.

452
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,257
I was there last night.

453
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:33,457
Geometry?

454
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:35,137
Not my strong suit.

455
00:31:35,297 --> 00:31:37,457
I used to be at St Edmund's.

456
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,857
It's a rescue party depot now.

457
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:42,097
Requisitioned in '41.
Yes. I know it...

458
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:44,457
St Jude's is an ambulance station.

459
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:49,977
And Mill Road closed down as a
short-term rest centre and never
opened again.

460
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,377
They say that truth is the first
casualty of war but it isn't, you
know.

461
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:59,137
Education is.
You take classes here.

462
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,897
I do what I can. I was teaching when
the war began.

463
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:07,377
20,000 teachers went into the
forces.

464
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:10,697
I sometimes think it won't matter
who wins.

465
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:14,417
Either way we'll have a whole
generation who won't know a thing.

466
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,377
You WERE at the game.
I remember you now.

467
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,577
Have you come to arrest me for
taking part?

468
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:24,657
No, that's not why I'm here.

469
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:27,017
Then how can I help you?

470
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,257
I'm looking for two lads that were
at the game.

471
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:31,657
You might have noticed them. They
were about 18.

472
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,577
Plenty of cash.
I noticed them.

473
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,577
They were hard to miss. They were
losing more than I did.

474
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:40,297
Their names are Frank and Terry. Do
you know anything more about them?

475
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:42,217
I don't know their surnames.

476
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,697
I find these dice games aren't
exactly sociable.

477
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:48,537
True. Do you know
where I might find them?

478
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,497
Would you like to tell me why?

479
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:57,537
You expecting visitors?

480
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:00,617
No. Lessons are over for the day.

481
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,097
So, Frank and Terry...

482
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:07,177
Well, I don't know where they live.

483
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:10,817
I don't know anything much about
them. They were young.

484
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:14,217
They have money. I'd seen them a few
times. That's it.

485
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:17,377
Mr Richards, can I give you some
advice?

486
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,977
Stay away from any further games.

487
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:21,977
Oh? And why is that?

488
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:25,137
Well, I've just seen two of Hendry's
men outside.

489
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:28,137
And, as you say, I can't imagine
they were here to be sociable.

490
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:31,257
If you owe them money, they will
make you pay, one way or another.

491
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:55,417
Good night.
Good night, sir.

492
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:59,497
Ooh, I wonder if you'd noticed that
The Wizard of Oz is playing at the
Palais, sir?

493
00:33:59,777 --> 00:34:02,817
I can't say I have.
I was just thinking...

494
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:06,137
Right. Thank you.

495
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,577
Lydia?

496
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,337
Where's your mother?

497
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:14,457
Come on.

498
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:21,218
A single shot. I heard it clear as
day. It came from the inside.

499
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:24,978
And this is on the Melton Road?
Yeah, that place there.

500
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:26,778
It used to be a supply dump or
something.

501
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:28,458
I think it's an office now.

502
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:30,258
And what time was this, sir?

503
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,458
Only half an hour ago. I came
straight here.

504
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,698
Well, thank you, sir. I'll make a
report.

505
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,978
Is that all?
Well, I haven't got any men here.

506
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:40,818
I shouldn't be here except the night
officer is off sick.

507
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:45,258
Well, you can't have people shooting
each other in the middle of the
night. It's not right.

508
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:49,178
No, sir. Erm, where can we find you
if we need to ask any more
questions?

509
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,898
I have a shop on the parade. You'll
see my name.

510
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,298
Thank you, Mr Woodridge.
We'll look into it.

511
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:57,458
No, Frank.
Terry!

512
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:58,658
I said no.
Why not?

513
00:35:58,938 --> 00:36:01,138
Cutting wires and setting fire to
stuff is one thing.

514
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:03,538
This is different. This is a bomb!
I know what it is.

515
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:06,058
Tell him we've had enough.
Look I can't. He'll turn us in.

516
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:08,498
Then let him. He's a bloody dago,
for God's sake.

517
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,458
What we're doing, it could be
treason.

518
00:36:10,698 --> 00:36:12,338
He's Spanish. They're not in the war.

519
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,218
They're nothing to do with it.
No.

520
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:16,858
Look, if we don't do what he says,
he'll come after us.

521
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:19,898
He's got friends. They'll find us.
They'll kill us, Terry.

522
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,818
It's not that. You don't believe
that. You just want the money.

523
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:24,298
Listen.

524
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:25,858
We'll make this the last one.

525
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:30,738
We'll just do this and then we'll
tell him we've got to stop.

526
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,898
Get down.

527
00:36:58,298 --> 00:37:00,538
What is it?
Sh!

528
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:10,058
Wait. What are they doing?

529
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,778
Come on, Terry. We'll follow them.

530
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,938
Sam.
Sir.

531
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:34,298
Would you mind coming in a moment,
please?

532
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:47,498
Look, erm, she's gone.

533
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:49,578
Gone, sir?

534
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:52,138
Yes.
Lydia?

535
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,898
Yes.
With James?

536
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,898
No, he's upstairs.
Well, that's rather strange.

537
00:37:58,178 --> 00:37:59,978
Do you think she's in trouble?
Possible.

538
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,418
Always was a bit wayward. Fell in
love with an insurance salesman and
they eloped.

539
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:09,138
And the parents are dead now.
Did they ever forgive her?

540
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:10,938
Well, not a case of forgiveness.

541
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:15,458
For some reason or another, they
never saw her again and neither did I
until she showed up here.

542
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:18,738
Where's James's father? North
Africa, evidently, according to her.

543
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:22,218
He doesn't talk very much, does he?

544
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,538
Well, not least because he was at
the Sibford Street School.

545
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:28,898
The school that was...

546
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:31,578
Oh, poor little boy.

547
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:37,778
Sir, if you want me to look after
him while you're looking for Lydia,
I'm more than happy to. Thank you.

548
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:40,898
It'll make a nice change from
hanging around outside murders.

549
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:45,698
Listen, erm, get him some...
tea, cake. That sort of thing.

550
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:49,098
There's a toy shop on the parade.
Good, good.

551
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:52,138
Oh, I wonder
if he's seen The Wizard of Oz.

552
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:56,898
Sergeant Milner, I wonder if you'd
like to look into this?

553
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,778
A shot was heard on the Melton Road.

554
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:01,858
An elderly gentleman came in last
night.

555
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,578
Where's Mr Foyle?
He's er... He's not in yet.

556
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:06,858
It's the second time he's been late
this week.

557
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,098
I wouldn't have said that was any of
your business, Sergeant.

558
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,338
I was just making an observation,
Sergeant.

559
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:19,818
Morning. Someone heard a gunshot
last night, I thought I'd look into
it. Do.

560
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:27,218
I need to get a search organised for
a 28-year-old woman name of Lydia
Nicholson

561
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,698
or she might be using Lydia Wallace.
What's she done, sir?

562
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:34,418
Nothing apart from going missing.
She's from Clapton.

563
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:36,138
Ah, that's my old stamping ground.

564
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:38,378
She could well have gone back there.

565
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:41,378
Get a description put in the coach
and railway stations

566
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,338
using this photograph.

567
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:47,218
She's very attractive.
Yeah.

568
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:52,018
A gun shot? What time would this
have been?

569
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:53,498
About nine o'clock.

570
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:57,498
I can't help you, I'm afraid. I left
at six. Hans?

571
00:39:57,698 --> 00:39:59,218
Ten minutes after you, Professor.

572
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:02,058
And you are...?
Oh, Hans Lindemann.

573
00:40:02,298 --> 00:40:05,138
And in case you're wondering, I'm
Danish.

574
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:09,858
Hans was studying under me at
Cambridge when the Germans invaded
Denmark. And I decided to stay.

575
00:40:10,178 --> 00:40:12,298
And were there just the two of you
here last night?

576
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,258
No, I have a secretarial assistant.
Evelyn Richards.

577
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,858
You've just missed her, I'm afraid.
I sent her home.

578
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:23,338
What sort of work do you do here,
Professor?

579
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:27,258
We're a branch of the National
Physical Laboratory at Teddington.

580
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:29,218
We report to the Admiralty in
London.

581
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:31,858
I can't tell you any more,
I'm afraid.

582
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,978
Our work is classified.
All right.

583
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,498
And yet you have no security.
No Home Guard.

584
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,138
Oh, we keep a low profile, Mr
Milner.

585
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:44,058
Nobody really knows we're here. So
that's all the security we need.

586
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:47,338
And there was no sign of any
disturbance this morning when you
arrived?

587
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,978
No, absolutely not.
Everything was as normal.

588
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:57,818
Look, I know nothing about this
gunshot but I can assure you it
didn't happen here.

589
00:40:58,058 --> 00:40:59,178
Maybe somewhere nearby.

590
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,098
Thank you, we'll have a look.

591
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:07,578
Ooh, can I just ask, Mr Milner, who
is your superior officer?

592
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:10,338
Of course. It's Detective Chief
Superintendent Foyle.

593
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:13,098
Ah, yes, I thought it might be.

594
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:16,418
I know him well. Please give him my
regards.

595
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,018
Right, let's take a look around.

596
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:32,178
Search the woods and the side of the
road. Two of you have a look round
the back of the building.

597
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:44,378
What's that? Over there!

598
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,618
Get Sergeant Milner.

599
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:59,898
I'll drop this explosive egg on
Hitler's palace.

600
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,298
That night over Germany...

601
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:05,298
(GERMAN ACCENT) Look, Goering.

602
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:09,138
I'm sick of this. Half a sausage
between us?

603
00:42:09,378 --> 00:42:12,818
My patience is exhausted.
Bring me an egg!

604
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,778
Now where shall I put it?

605
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:20,658
Ha, I'll take that fine big egg for
Adolf's breakfast.

606
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:27,578
Ach, what a fine big egg, at last I
will have the good breakfast.

607
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:32,018
You're not
really enjoying this, are you?

608
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:33,818
How about a puzzle?

609
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:35,418
I've an old blackout book here.

610
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:36,538
We could try that.

611
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:41,658
Do we know who he is?
He had no wallet on him.

612
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:45,498
No identity card, no ration book,
but as a matter of fact I do, sir.

613
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,378
I spoke to him yesterday...
at his house.

614
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:51,458
His name is Michael Richards.

615
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,778
He was at the dice game.
He lost a fair amount of money.

616
00:42:55,178 --> 00:42:59,618
He may well be in debt because two
of Hendry's men paid him a visit
while I was there.

617
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,098
They saw me and walked off.

618
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:03,818
It looks like I might have to go
after Hendry after all.

619
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:09,098
There's a Professor Townsend here at
the Research Centre.

620
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:10,898
Says he knows you.

621
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:13,018
Townsend. Mm, that's right.

622
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:17,698
He also said that he has a
secretarial assistant called
Richards.

623
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:21,378
Did he?

624
00:43:22,618 --> 00:43:27,498
Well, if he was shot because he owed
money, why here do you think?

625
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:35,698
Dressed up for something.

626
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:37,658
A lot smarter than the last time I
saw him.

627
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:47,578
Foyle, I can't believe we're meeting
under such circumstances.

628
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:48,978
That's right.

629
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:51,978
Michael Richards.

630
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:56,018
This man with the dog,
he must have been mistaken.

631
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,098
Mr Richards may have been killed
nearby

632
00:43:59,298 --> 00:44:01,898
but it certainly wasn't in here.

633
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:08,178
Right. And who would have been first
here this morning?

634
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:10,738
I was. I came at seven o'clock.

635
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,778
Oh, right.

636
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:16,898
You come far?
Mm. Bexhill. I have a room there.

637
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:18,738
Uh-huh.

638
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:20,818
Everything was just the way you see
it now.

639
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:25,098
Right.
Somebody should talk to Evelyn.

640
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,138
She - she needs to be told.

641
00:44:27,818 --> 00:44:29,978
And how long has she been here?

642
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:33,258
Two years.
An invaluable member of staff.

643
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:36,138
Very efficient, I mean.

644
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,218
Accurate.

645
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,818
Discreet.

646
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:50,458
How do you know Professor Townsend,
sir? He's a neighbour.

647
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:55,218
He said he was attached to the
Admiralty. Involved in something
hush-hush.

648
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,778
It wouldn't surprise me. He taught
physics at Cambridge.

649
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:00,818
Highly regarded.
Published several books.

650
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:04,298
I wonder why he was lying to us.

651
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,338
Same reason everybody else does.

652
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,578
I don't know where to begin.

653
00:45:10,818 --> 00:45:12,898
There's not much to tell.

654
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:15,578
I, I went to bed early.

655
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:19,538
I was so tired. I've been working
very hard recently.

656
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:22,458
Michael wasn't in the house
when I got in.

657
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:28,258
I thought I heard him come in later
but obviously I was wrong.

658
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,618
We sleep in separate rooms.

659
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,898
I might as well be straight with
you.

660
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:39,498
Things haven't been very easy
between us for some time.

661
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:42,458
Michael resented my going to work.

662
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,178
He lost his own job when they closed
St Edmund's.

663
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:48,618
He gave lessons here, didn't he?

664
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:50,658
Yes, a home school.

665
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:59,898
Townsend. Is this yours?
No, it's my husband's.

666
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:04,338
I just type and keep files.

667
00:46:05,938 --> 00:46:09,578
Michael understood more about
Professor Townsend's work than I
ever did.

668
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:12,218
It was the main reason for the
tension between us.

669
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:14,538
I was there - and he was here.

670
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:16,818
So would this be...?
This is his desk.

671
00:46:17,098 --> 00:46:19,818
I can't see why you're asking all
these questions, Mr Foyle.

672
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:22,498
I know perfectly well who killed my
husband.

673
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,658
He was a compulsive gambler.

674
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:29,938
He had fallen in with a bad lot
and he owed them money.

675
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:34,298
He used to steal from the
housekeeping and from my purse.

676
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,338
I know he was afraid of them.

677
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:42,338
And, erm, why would he have gone to
the research centre last night?

678
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,658
I've no idea.

679
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:49,578
But you didn't, erm, you didn't part
on very good terms?

680
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:53,338
No. I suppose I'll have to live with
that.

681
00:46:54,818 --> 00:46:56,378
But he wasn't the man I married.

682
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:02,658
This was the man I married.

683
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:04,538
He was young.

684
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,138
An idealist.

685
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:08,138
He loved his work and he had a
career.

686
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:11,858
But the war changed all that...

687
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:14,658
..and the man who was killed,

688
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,298
the man you're telling me about,

689
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:18,978
in the end I hardly knew him.

690
00:47:22,138 --> 00:47:24,458
All right, then. Here's another one.

691
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:26,698
It's called A New Deal for Nazis

692
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:29,138
and what you have to do

693
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:30,898
is put four cards to form a swastika

694
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,658
inside the frame.

695
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:35,418
I don't think that's possible,
do you?

696
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,698
Oh, hello, sir.
How's everything?

697
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:44,978
All present and correct.

698
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:47,938
I haven't made much progress, I'm
afraid.

699
00:47:48,258 --> 00:47:50,178
I don't suppose there's any news
of...

700
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:53,138
No. Erm, you'd better get home.

701
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:54,218
Right.

702
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,538
I thought I'd take James out for a
picnic in Taybury Woods tomorrow.

703
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,538
I baked a cake. Powdered eggs.
That's very kind.

704
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:05,938
All right, then, James. I'll see you
tomorrow. TTFN.

705
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,418
Thank you.

706
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:25,098
Michael Richards?
I remember who he is now.

707
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:27,538
I knew I'd seen him before.

708
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:29,978
Who is he?

709
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:33,338
He was that geezer from the game.
Kept on losing.

710
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:35,058
You were the one who kept on losing.

711
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:37,018
He couldn't afford it. That's who he
is.

712
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:38,298
That's who he WAS.

713
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:44,298
Yeah, I'd say there's money to be
made out of this, Terry,
if we're smart.

714
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,938
What are you talking about?

715
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:48,338
Well, we saw what we saw, didn't we
in the woods? Yeah.

716
00:48:48,578 --> 00:48:51,658
Well, I reckon they'd pay us plenty
to keep our mouths shut.

717
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:56,258
So what about the dago?
He's never here. He's in London.

718
00:48:56,498 --> 00:49:00,138
We'll make the money and vamoose.
He'll never find us.

719
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:04,578
Yeah, and what about this?
We'll get rid of it.

720
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,898
How? Dump it in the sea?
I'm not going in no boat with it.

721
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,218
Rough seas and all the rest.

722
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:12,458
No. We'll blow it up.

723
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:15,138
Where?

724
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:18,098
Taybury Wood. Tomorrow.

725
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:22,978
And then we'll go and see the boffin
and see what he has to say.

726
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:27,538
LYDIA: God, I've tried so hard.

727
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:30,738
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

728
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:35,978
But I'm going to make it better for
you. That's all that matters.

729
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:39,498
And one day you'll understand.

730
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:44,871
Four cards?
That's right.

731
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:47,031
Inside the frame to form a swastika.

732
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:51,191
Can they overlap? I don't know,
Brookie. It doesn't say.

733
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:54,631
It doesn't seem do-able to me.
Where did this come from?

734
00:49:54,831 --> 00:49:56,311
The Brighter Blackout Book.

735
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:58,391
Let's have a look.

736
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:08,351
No. I don't see it.

737
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:11,791
Neither do I. I was up all night
thinking about it. Hardly got a wink
of sleep.

738
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:15,391
Aren't the answers in the back? They
should be but it's missing a page.

739
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:17,831
Morning.
Morning, sir.

740
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,031
What's going on?
It's a puzzle.

741
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,511
Miss Stewart was just showing it to
me, sir.

742
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:24,671
Solved it?
We're working on it.

743
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:27,951
Mm-hm.
Can I go, sir?

744
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:30,391
Yep, here he is.
Ready?

745
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:33,431
Now, young man. I hope you like very
slightly burned walnut cake!

746
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:34,951
Have a good time.

747
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,431
Any news?
Er, nothing so far, sir.

748
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:43,391
I had her description circulated at
the coach and the train station.

749
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,871
I've been onto the Home Guard.

750
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:48,311
Er, we did manage to find an address
for her in Clapton

751
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:51,951
but there's no-one there.
Keep trying.

752
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:53,991
Sir.

753
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,951
Morning, sir. Good news.
What's that?

754
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:00,431
Had a tip-off about a dice game
being played at Hythe.

755
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:03,111
I don't know if it's Hendry but it's
the same game. When?

756
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,191
Lunch time. Are you going to take
anybody with you this time?

757
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:08,711
Er, yes, sir.
What a good idea.

758
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:16,251
LYDIA: Dear Uncle Christopher,

759
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:19,011
everything has been so difficult for
me for so long

760
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,451
and I've often wondered how I can
carry on.

761
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:25,891
Please forgive me writing to you
like this but I can't take James
with me

762
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:28,611
so I have decided to leave him with
the one person I can trust,

763
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:34,331
someone who has always been kind to
me and who will understand what it
is that I have to do.

764
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:42,731
Goal!

765
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:44,851
Are you really a 'tec?

766
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:47,971
Yes, I am.
Can I see your warrant card?

767
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:57,131
Hm.

768
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:00,931
How did you find me here?
Your mother told me where you were.

769
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,291
Oh. I thought it would be something
more clever than that.

770
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:07,051
Oh, sorry to disappoint you.

771
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:09,291
Are you investigating Mr Richards?

772
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:10,371
Yes, that's right.

773
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:13,091
He was shot by gangsters.
Everyone knows that.

774
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:16,491
You were having a lesson with him,
weren't you, when I came to see him?

775
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:18,931
Yes. Geometry.

776
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,571
So, how was he?
Mr Richards?

777
00:52:23,851 --> 00:52:26,011
Mm. Was he nervous?
No.

778
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,891
He was usually grumpy but he was all
right.

779
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:31,611
He had a phone call.

780
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:33,091
During the lesson?

781
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:37,331
Yes. It cheered him up.
He was tickety-boo after that.

782
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,091
Right.

783
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,331
Maybe it was the killers.

784
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:45,171
They tricked him into going to a
meeting and then they done him in.

785
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:49,931
You've been reading too much Sexton
Blake. I prefer Just William.

786
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:53,211
Do you play here a lot?
Most days.

787
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,171
We found a piece of shrapnel once.

788
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,051
I hope the war never ends!
Come on. Yep!

789
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:09,931
This search. You better start
checking the local hospitals,

790
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:13,731
call the coastguard. See if they
found anybody over the -
You don't think she...

791
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:16,811
It's worth checking.
Sir.

792
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:18,851
Thank you.

793
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:22,651
I feel rather awkward coming to you,
but I felt I should.

794
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:26,971
Why's that?
It's Michael Richards.

795
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,691
Oh, yeah.
It's just that what's happened

796
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:33,371
couldn't have come at a worse time
as far as we're concerned.

797
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:38,411
Well, probably not a very good one
for him either, I wouldn't have
thought.

798
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,771
No, of course not.

799
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:45,411
It's just that there are things
happening that I can't explain to
you.

800
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:47,451
I'm not allowed to.

801
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,611
But erm...as you and I have met on
several occasions, I...

802
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,411
I thought you might understand...

803
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:55,731
Understand what?

804
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:02,611
Well, that my team and I are on the
brink of something momentous.

805
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,891
I'm not exaggerating when I say that
it could change the course of the
war.

806
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:13,451
The team being?
Myself and Hans Lindemann, I mean.

807
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:16,411
Mrs Richards?
She's part of it, yes.

808
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,451
So, you're saying what?

809
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,491
Well, a lot of awkward questions

810
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:27,811
are the last thing that we need just
now.

811
00:54:29,051 --> 00:54:33,811
Michael Richards was an alcoholic.
He was a violent, unattractive man.

812
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,931
Unintelligent?
Yes.

813
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:41,491
A great reader of your books,
evidently, according to her.

814
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:44,691
Look, I've come to tell you that his
death,

815
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:47,611
in the proximity of where I am
working,

816
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:52,331
well, it cannot be allowed to get in
the way of what's happening.

817
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:56,571
Well, it looks as if it already has,
you know.

818
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:07,211
Do you see anything you like, James?

819
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,251
Shall we go inside?

820
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:20,611
How about a model plane?

821
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:23,531
I could sell you a kit for four
shillings

822
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:27,411
or a made-up one for eight shillings
and ninepence.

823
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:29,811
We were looking for something less
about the war.

824
00:55:30,051 --> 00:55:32,011
That's not easy, these days.

825
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:34,171
Er, how about a jigsaw?

826
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,931
Oh, that might be fun.

827
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,131
I have a jigsaw here and it has 200
pieces.

828
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:45,531
RAF Reconnaissance Planes Beat off
German Fighters.

829
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:47,851
Well, that's still a bit war-like.

830
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,171
Well, er, what have you in mind?

831
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:54,171
Have you anything soft and cuddly,
like a teddy bear?

832
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,011
Oh, you won't find any teddy bears
here.

833
00:55:56,331 --> 00:55:59,611
I heard that there were some in
Harrods in London

834
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:03,651
at ten shillings a time but they'll
have gone long ago.

835
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:06,851
If you don't mind my saying so, for
a toy shop you don't have many toys.

836
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:10,331
Well, that's not my fault. All the
toy factories have closed down -

837
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:12,291
or switched over to war production.

838
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,611
You, as a mother, should know that.

839
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:18,531
Oh, I'm not his mother. I just don't
want anything to do with the war.

840
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:23,331
Have you any board games?
Yes, we have board games.

841
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:25,251
Let's see.

842
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:31,731
Submarine Hunt, Sky Battle
and Ocean War.

843
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,171
All at two bob.

844
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,731
James?

845
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:56,771
What's the matter?

846
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,971
What's going on here?
You're Mr Townsend.

847
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,411
I'm Professor Townsend, yes.
Who are you?

848
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:04,691
I'm Frank.
This is my brother Terry.

849
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:06,891
What are you doing here?

850
00:57:07,171 --> 00:57:11,171
Well, it just so happens we were
passing the other night, Professor.

851
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:14,571
And we saw things, didn't we, Terry?
Yeah, that's right.

852
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:18,411
Seems to me we could have a pretty
story to tell if we went to the
police.

853
00:57:18,691 --> 00:57:22,171
You wouldn't like that, would you?
What do you want?

854
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:26,731
50 quid. We need to leave Hastings.
We're gonna need living expenses.

855
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:30,331
50 pounds? I don't have that sort of
money!

856
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:31,731
Each.

857
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,571
This is madness.
Professor, this is more important.

858
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,571
Say nothing, Hans. Young man, you
are wasting your time.

859
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:41,571
We're not going to pay you anything.
I think you are.

860
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:46,131
I'll tell you what, I'll give you
24 hours to think about it.

861
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:48,131
Talk it over with your friends.

862
00:57:57,691 --> 00:58:01,331
Now there's a lucky throw for you.
I'm paying out on three crowns.

863
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:03,331
Wish you'd bet more now, don't you?

864
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,411
Who says the odds are with the
house?

865
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,611
I'm paying out more than you lot
earn in a week.

866
00:58:12,051 --> 00:58:13,731
Grab the doors!
Go for it! Scarper!

867
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:16,171
Go on, get outta here!
No, you don't. No, you don't.

868
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:20,491
I've got him!
Hold him over there! Hold him!

869
00:58:20,691 --> 00:58:22,611
Nice to see you again, Mr Hendry.

870
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:24,531
You're talking nonsense, Mr Milner.

871
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:27,091
I mean, what do you take me for?

872
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:29,531
I know what you are, Mr Hendry.
Listen to me.

873
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,611
He owed us 35 bob.

874
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:37,131
Now do I look like someone who's
gonna put a bullet in someone's head
for 35 bob?

875
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:39,571
I saw your men outside his house.
They saw you too.

876
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,971
They were there to put the wind up
him, that's all.

877
00:58:42,211 --> 00:58:44,451
For 35 bob?
I can't have people welching on me.

878
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:46,371
It's bad for business.

879
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:51,131
Word gets around. Five bob, 35 bob.

880
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:57,011
If you don't pay up, you're going to
get slapped around a bit. I mean,
I got a reputation.

881
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,931
So, you're admitting to conspiracy
to cause actual bodily harm?

882
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:02,011
I'm admitting to thinking about it

883
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,971
but thinking ain't a crime, is it?

884
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,211
No, but illegal gaming is.
So?

885
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:10,651
And you attacked an officer in the
course of his duty

886
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,811
so if I offered you evens on a £500
fine and a year in jail... A year?

887
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:17,051
What do you think?
I think that's a safe bet, sir.

888
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,131
Yeah, I'd say so.

889
00:59:31,692 --> 00:59:33,612
Over here!

890
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:47,132
I know. I know.
It's not right.

891
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:51,252
No! You have to use four cards
inside the square.

892
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:54,052
A swastika.
Only four? Yes.

893
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:58,052
It can't be done.
I know. It beats the hell out of me.

894
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:05,732
Hastings Constabulary.
Sergeant Brooke. Yes, sir.

895
01:00:07,372 --> 01:00:09,612
Thank you.

896
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:10,972
Yeah, I will.

897
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,572
Put those away. I've got to speak to
Mr Foyle.

898
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,812
When they brought her here, they
thought she was going to die.

899
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:40,972
The doctor says she's come through
the worst.

900
01:00:41,252 --> 01:00:45,172
They said she walked into the sea
with her pockets full of stones.

901
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,212
A mortal sin.

902
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:50,172
I can't imagine what drove her to
it.

903
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:53,572
And attempted suicide, I believe, is
a crime.

904
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:55,212
Is that why you're here?

905
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:59,812
No, I'm her godfather
and she has a son.

906
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,172
That makes her sin even harder to
forgive.

907
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:07,212
Where is her child?

908
01:01:09,372 --> 01:01:11,892
He's being looked after.
Come back tomorrow.

909
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,492
She'll be able to speak to you then.
I will, thank you.

910
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:23,652
James, a picnic in the wood might be
more fun if you would actually talk
to me.

911
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:30,332
Let's see if we can find somewhere
nice to sit.

912
01:01:33,132 --> 01:01:36,212
Why are you so down in the dumps?
We're out of our depth, Frank.

913
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:39,012
We should just chuck it.
What and risk someone getting hurt?

914
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:41,412
Don't tell me you're scared of loud
noises?

915
01:01:41,652 --> 01:01:43,292
I'm scared of getting into more
trouble.

916
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,052
We're getting out of trouble.
That's what all this is about.

917
01:01:48,892 --> 01:01:52,372
When I was your age, my father made
me learn the name of every tree in
the wood.

918
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:57,372
That's a beech...

919
01:01:57,612 --> 01:01:58,812
Or is it a chestnut?

920
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,012
This over here, this one is an ash.

921
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:16,052
Over here.

922
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:34,372
Let's get out of here.

923
01:02:41,772 --> 01:02:43,892
There's someone coming.
What?

924
01:02:44,092 --> 01:02:45,892
These definitely are beeches.

925
01:02:47,572 --> 01:02:49,292
You can tell by the nuts, look.

926
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,572
You've got to warn them.
No, it's too late.

927
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,092
Watch out, there's -

928
01:02:57,092 --> 01:02:58,092
Frank.
Run, Terry.

929
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:27,327
I have to say, it was the last thing
I was expecting.

930
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:30,527
Do you realise it's the third time
I've been blown up?

931
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,567
I can't say I was counting.
First of all, there was the pub

932
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:35,767
and then Jerry dropped a bomb on my
house.

933
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:39,087
Now this! I was only going for a
walk in the woods.

934
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:41,007
It seems nowhere's safe these days.

935
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:44,647
And you saw what?
Two youths.

936
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:47,087
They were both about 18, I'd say.

937
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:52,127
One was tall, had dark hair
and HIS name was Terry.

938
01:03:52,447 --> 01:03:53,767
I heard the other one call out to
him.

939
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,967
The other wasn't called Frank by any
chance?

940
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,367
Do you know, I think that might have
been his name.

941
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:01,127
How did you know?

942
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:04,927
They're the same men who helped
Milner when he got into trouble the
other night.

943
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:09,167
That's nice of them (!) Rescue
Milner and then try to kill me.

944
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:11,447
I wish they'd get their priorities
sorted out.

945
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:15,207
Are you going to be all right?

946
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,607
Absolutely. I feel tip-top.

947
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:20,687
Thank you for the whisky.

948
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:23,407
Pleasure. Where is he?

949
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:24,927
He's upstairs.

950
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:28,087
I think you'll find he's completely
changed.

951
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:29,767
In a way, it's a sort of a miracle.

952
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:32,527
When the bomb went off, he started
calling for a Mrs Jukes.

953
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:36,607
Mary Jukes was a teacher who was
killed.

954
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:39,167
In a way, it sort of unlocked
everything.

955
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,247
Did you find his mother?
I did.

956
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:43,687
Where?
She's somewhere safe.

957
01:04:45,087 --> 01:04:47,007
Good. All right then, sir.

958
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:49,727
I'll see you tomorrow and good luck
with James.

959
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:52,047
Thank you.
I mean...Jimmy.

960
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:53,967
Ah.

961
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:03,727
I don't like it here.
Where's my mum? I want to go home!

962
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:14,647
Well, at least we're finally talking.

963
01:05:14,807 --> 01:05:16,167
What have you done with my mum?

964
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:18,847
I haven't done anything with your
mum, James. Jimmy!

965
01:05:19,087 --> 01:05:20,767
Everyone calls me Jimmy except her.

966
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:25,327
Jimmy. She's not very well, I'm
afraid and we're still trying to get
in touch with your father.

967
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,567
I haven't got a father. He's dead!

968
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:32,127
Not according to your mother.
She's lying. She always lies.

969
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:39,887
Right...

970
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:45,367
It looks as if we're going to have to
spend a couple more days together at
least.

971
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:48,287
Why? I don't like you.
You're a copper.

972
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,207
Yeah, that's right.

973
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:52,167
Have you ever been to prison?

974
01:05:57,447 --> 01:06:00,527
Their names. I don't know any names.
They're punters.

975
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:04,167
Mr Hendry, this is now a murder
investigation and I saw your men,

976
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:08,807
acting under your orders, at the
victim's house just hours before he
was killed.

977
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,487
That had nothing to do with me. You
can't pin that on me.

978
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:20,527
Frank and Terry Morgan. They're
fishermen.

979
01:06:20,847 --> 01:06:23,527
They've got one of those huts down
the beach. Brothers.

980
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:27,967
Look...

981
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:29,887
I'm co-operating with you.

982
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:32,087
Maybe you can do something for me.

983
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,327
No dice.

984
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:10,807
How old are you?

985
01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:15,287
I'm 18.
I'm 16.

986
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:22,167
Where are your parents? You on your
own? Yeah.

987
01:07:23,967 --> 01:07:25,647
Dad's away. Convoy duty.

988
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,647
Mother?
She died.

989
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:36,687
Well, it seems as if you've got
yourselves in an awful lot of
trouble.

990
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,767
We haven't done nothing.
Haven't you?

991
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:43,087
How do you account for the money
you've been chucking about at dice
games?

992
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,127
How d'you get your hands on
explosives device which nearly killed
a young woman and child?

993
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:49,527
What about the murder you're involved
with?

994
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:51,567
What?

995
01:07:53,047 --> 01:07:54,887
We found this in your hut on the
beach.

996
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:58,567
It belonged to Michael Richards. You
knew him from the card game.

997
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,647
This is his identity card.
His ration book.

998
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:04,607
He was shot two nights ago.
What do you know about that?

999
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:08,727
Look, we looked out for him,
for your oppo, didn't we?

1000
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,527
What?
This is what we get in return?

1001
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:15,007
No, I'm very grateful. Which is why
we will do what we can for you but
you've got to tell us the truth.

1002
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,007
We can't tell you.
Frank!

1003
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:23,127
Terry, just shut up! No. I've had
enough of it. Frank, please.

1004
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:31,647
I don't even know where to start.

1005
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,247
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
Mr Foyle.

1006
01:08:37,407 --> 01:08:39,447
Can I offer you some refreshment?

1007
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:41,607
A small sherry, perhaps?

1008
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,887
We won't, thank you.

1009
01:08:44,087 --> 01:08:46,087
Then how can I help you?

1010
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:51,247
You are...
Jose Oliviera de Perez.

1011
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,207
Is your sergeant going to write it
down?

1012
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:55,127
I will be very happy to spell it for
you.

1013
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:56,447
No, thank you.

1014
01:08:56,847 --> 01:09:00,847
I am a Special Observer for the
Spanish Institute of Political
Studies.

1015
01:09:01,087 --> 01:09:03,567
I am attached to the Spanish embassy

1016
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:08,367
but I find it expedient to keep a
house down here by the coast also.

1017
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:13,847
Expedient in that it allows you to
sabotage coastal installations?

1018
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,407
That is a very grave accusation, Mr
Foyle.

1019
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:19,647
I wonder what evidence you might
have to support it.

1020
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:23,207
We've arrested two delinquents.
Frank and Terry Morgan.

1021
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,327
According to their testimony,

1022
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:28,767
they broke into this house five
weeks ago on the 17th March.

1023
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:32,607
How interesting. I was unaware of
any break-ins.

1024
01:09:32,847 --> 01:09:36,287
They claim you discovered them and
that you effectively coerced them

1025
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:39,847
into undertaking several acts of
sabotage on your behalf.

1026
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:42,247
These include a fire at Hythe docks,

1027
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,807
a munitions work just outside
Bexhill,

1028
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,047
the cutting of telephone wires in
various locations and most recently,

1029
01:09:49,327 --> 01:09:52,047
a plan to blow up a research centre
here in Hastings.

1030
01:09:52,247 --> 01:09:54,007
And this is your evidence?

1031
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:57,487
The word of, how did you put it, two
delinquents?

1032
01:09:57,767 --> 01:09:59,447
They can describe you and this
house.

1033
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:03,207
So can my cleaner. So can many other
people, I am sure.

1034
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:07,007
So, you're denying the charges, sir?

1035
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,527
I am neither denying them nor
confirming them, Sergeant Milner.

1036
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:13,407
I think you perhaps failed to hear
when we first spoke.

1037
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:15,527
I am attached to the Spanish embassy

1038
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,127
and, as such, I come under their
protection.

1039
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:22,527
I am not required to answer any of
your questions

1040
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:25,647
and, more to the point, this house
is also theirs.

1041
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:30,247
I am sorry to tell you this,
gentlemen, but in effect,
you are on Spanish soil.

1042
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:34,807
Your law does not extend here.

1043
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:42,807
In which instance, therefore, I will
wish you both a very good day,
gentlemen.

1044
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:49,087
Thank you for your time. I only wish
I had more of it to share with you.

1045
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:52,527
I'm sure you will next time.
We will see.

1046
01:10:57,847 --> 01:10:59,847
I was going to come back and see you
again, Foyle.

1047
01:11:00,087 --> 01:11:02,647
Before or after the Morgans tried to
blackmail you?

1048
01:11:03,047 --> 01:11:07,047
I was never very happy about our
attempts to lie about what happened
here

1049
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:10,767
but I persuaded myself that it was
in the national interest.

1050
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:13,607
But there was no crime.
A man was killed.

1051
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:16,527
It was self-defence. More than that.

1052
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:19,207
He was threatening to destroy our
work.

1053
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:21,007
Please just tell me what happened.

1054
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:30,247
I was working late.

1055
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:32,607
There had been a test the previous
evening.

1056
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:36,247
I can't give you any of the details
but I had to type up the results.

1057
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,767
Michael wasn't happy about it.

1058
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:43,887
I already told you
he resented my being here -

1059
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:47,687
and that night he decided...I don't
know why.

1060
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:52,927
He'd been drinking.

1061
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,927
He came round.

1062
01:11:57,487 --> 01:11:59,687
I was astonished to see him

1063
01:11:59,927 --> 01:12:02,127
but there was nothing I could do.

1064
01:12:07,047 --> 01:12:11,487
Evelyn?
I told him to leave and we argued.

1065
01:12:12,847 --> 01:12:15,167
We'd argued before, often, but...

1066
01:12:15,327 --> 01:12:17,567
this was different.

1067
01:12:18,407 --> 01:12:22,767
He became angry, then violent...
He was always like that.

1068
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:23,967
He was a brute.

1069
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,407
He didn't try to hurt me this time.

1070
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:29,087
It was the machine.

1071
01:12:29,247 --> 01:12:30,767
It was our work.

1072
01:12:32,527 --> 01:12:35,407
I, er, I can't tell you what it
does.

1073
01:12:35,687 --> 01:12:39,127
But er, it's taken us months to get
it right.

1074
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:42,407
He tried to destroy it.
I think he was mad.

1075
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:45,247
I'd never seen him like it before.

1076
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,287
He picked up a spanner and that's
when I did it.

1077
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:50,767
I knew I had no choice.

1078
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:57,847
Come on.

1079
01:12:58,087 --> 01:12:59,927
I shot him to protect our work.

1080
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:02,727
I didn't mean to kill him. I just
wanted to stop him.

1081
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:06,407
You did the right thing.
No. I never hated him.

1082
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:10,247
Despite everything, I...
I never meant to hurt him.

1083
01:13:11,127 --> 01:13:13,047
I see.

1084
01:13:15,527 --> 01:13:16,647
Where did you get the gun?

1085
01:13:16,887 --> 01:13:18,807
It's mine.

1086
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:20,927
I kept it here because...

1087
01:13:21,207 --> 01:13:24,247
Well, all these instances of
sabotage.

1088
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:27,287
Bexhill. Hythe.

1089
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:31,687
I thought it might be sensible to
have it on hand, to protect
ourselves if needs be.

1090
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:35,287
And what happened afterwards?
I didn't know what to do.

1091
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:38,687
I telephoned Professor Townsend.
I thought he'd know what to do

1092
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:40,567
and he had to know what had
happened.

1093
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:42,407
He said he'd come straight round.

1094
01:13:43,447 --> 01:13:47,047
I didn't even know if he was dead.

1095
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:50,127
I tried to find a pulse...

1096
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:53,167
It was horrible and I was so scared.

1097
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:59,007
And then what?

1098
01:13:59,207 --> 01:14:02,327
Well, then I telephoned Lindemann.

1099
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:05,647
I couldn't stand being on my own.

1100
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:09,847
Mrs Richards was very upset
when I arrived.

1101
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:13,687
Lindemann was comforting her but she
was beside herself.

1102
01:14:14,127 --> 01:14:18,367
And so what? Then, you decided to,
erm, carry the body out into the
woods

1103
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:20,967
and pretend somebody else had done
it?

1104
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:26,647
What difference did it make?
He had no rights to come here

1105
01:14:26,927 --> 01:14:30,447
and, Evelyn, Mrs Richards, she did
the right thing to stop him.

1106
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:32,967
It's all right, Hans. I...

1107
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:37,127
I take full responsibility for the
decision, Foyle.

1108
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:39,527
But I...

1109
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:43,887
I have to say that what was foremost
in our minds was our work here.

1110
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:46,487
If you knew what, what we're doing,

1111
01:14:46,727 --> 01:14:50,487
if I could only tell you, I'm...
I'm sure you'd understand.

1112
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:55,767
Are we still pretending that Mrs
Richards here is just a secretary?

1113
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:02,567
The books in your house are yours
not your husband's.

1114
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:05,127
Your desk. Not his. Am I right?

1115
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:08,407
How did you know?

1116
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:12,007
Well, it's just odd for him to keep
a photograph of himself on his desk.

1117
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:14,687
More likely to be one of you,
I'd have thought.

1118
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:21,247
Mrs Richards is erm...
is much more than a secretary.

1119
01:15:21,527 --> 01:15:25,327
She, er...
she has an astonishing mind.

1120
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,887
I mean this is her work.

1121
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:32,487
The Admiralty are completely
blinkered.

1122
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:36,407
I mean, they wouldn't think of
having a woman involved at this
level.

1123
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:41,327
And so we've...we've always had to
keep up with the pretence.

1124
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:48,967
Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you
that, erm, astonishing or not, er,

1125
01:15:49,247 --> 01:15:53,207
there are still one or two questions
for Mrs Richards here so erm...

1126
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:56,807
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask
you to come with us, Mrs Richards.

1127
01:15:57,047 --> 01:16:01,087
Ah, you can't do that! Please. I
thought I'd explained to you.

1128
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:03,687
This work that we're part of...

1129
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,967
Will have to wait, I'm afraid.
It can't.

1130
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:13,327
Er, Professor...
It's all right, Hans.

1131
01:16:20,887 --> 01:16:23,967
Foyle. Well, that didn't take long.
Afternoon, sir.

1132
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,407
This is Captain Boothroyd
from the Admiralty.

1133
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:27,807
I see. Afternoon.

1134
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:31,447
You're holding a Mrs Evelyn Richards
here. Is that right? It is.

1135
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,567
I want you to release her
immediately.

1136
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:38,567
Shall we...
talk about this in my office?

1137
01:16:49,327 --> 01:16:52,807
Released on whose authority? It's all
right, Assistant Commissioner.

1138
01:16:54,007 --> 01:16:56,287
I can assure you this comes right
from the top.

1139
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:59,047
I've been acquainted with all the
facts at the highest level.

1140
01:17:00,207 --> 01:17:04,047
The Admiralty has also given me
access to further, restricted
information.

1141
01:17:04,247 --> 01:17:05,887
Well, that's kind of them.

1142
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,127
It means that I do have the full
picture here.

1143
01:17:08,527 --> 01:17:12,767
Mrs Richards was defending the work
of her colleagues against a man who
was drunk and demented.

1144
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:14,407
She has no case to answer.

1145
01:17:14,807 --> 01:17:17,687
I'm not asking you to close the
book on this one, Foyle. No need for
that.

1146
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:22,327
At the same time, I see no reason
why Mrs Richards shouldn't remain at
liberty, and at work,

1147
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:24,207
while you tie up the loose ends.

1148
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:29,127
Well, just two problems with that, as
far as I can see. What are they?

1149
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:32,607
Firstly, we'd have to accept she's
telling the truth. She confessed.

1150
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:35,287
I don't see what possible
explanation there could be.

1151
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:37,327
Well, I can think of one or two.

1152
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:42,767
And we'd also have to accept that,
police procedure, British law,
British justice are irrelevant

1153
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:46,767
if any old uniform can turn up here
and decide who can or can't be
detained.

1154
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:52,967
Look, I'm the one making the
decisions here, Mr Foyle.

1155
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:56,567
You can continue your investigation,
if you must,

1156
01:17:56,807 --> 01:18:00,407
but I see no reason to keep Mrs
Richards behind bars.

1157
01:18:17,487 --> 01:18:19,527
Did they let you go?
Yes.

1158
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:22,007
Then we did it.

1159
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,687
We got away with it.

1160
01:18:40,815 --> 01:18:44,175
So, this is young James, is it?
Jimmy.

1161
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:46,815
We can look after him for a few
days.

1162
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:50,335
That's a relief. You will find him a
little erm...lively?

1163
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:53,695
Affliction is good for the soul.
Lydia wants to see you now.

1164
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:56,135
Thank you. See you soon.

1165
01:18:56,335 --> 01:18:58,215
This way, Jimmy.

1166
01:19:05,935 --> 01:19:08,295
Why are you dressed like that?
It's my habit.

1167
01:19:08,455 --> 01:19:10,335
You look stupid.

1168
01:19:10,655 --> 01:19:14,255
Not as stupid as you'll look when
you're feeling the back of my hand.

1169
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:37,895
I've been so unhappy
and I didn't know what to do.

1170
01:19:39,415 --> 01:19:41,615
And after what happened with
James...

1171
01:19:41,895 --> 01:19:45,055
well, I felt so useless,
I just couldn't cope any more.

1172
01:19:46,895 --> 01:19:48,775
You should have said something.

1173
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:50,855
It was too late.

1174
01:19:51,135 --> 01:19:53,815
You should have said something ten
years ago.

1175
01:19:57,015 --> 01:19:59,015
I did get that letter you sent me.

1176
01:19:59,175 --> 01:20:01,015
You were very kind.

1177
01:20:03,495 --> 01:20:06,695
But after what happened with Robert,
I couldn't go back home.

1178
01:20:06,975 --> 01:20:09,455
My parents didn't want to see me.
They did.

1179
01:20:09,855 --> 01:20:14,375
They'd have taken you back in an
instant. They didn't want to see you
go in the first place.

1180
01:20:14,615 --> 01:20:16,855
Are you saying it was my fault?

1181
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:20,055
You never gave them a chance to
accept what had happened.

1182
01:20:21,455 --> 01:20:24,055
Go on.
Well, erm...

1183
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:27,255
None of my business.
All too long ago...

1184
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:30,735
but it did seem to me that...
you wanted to be hurt.

1185
01:20:33,015 --> 01:20:35,055
They tried to get in touch with you
several times.

1186
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,015
You never replied. You never replied
to me.

1187
01:20:37,335 --> 01:20:40,575
I was in love.
Is that an excuse?

1188
01:20:40,855 --> 01:20:44,255
No, but it explains it
and now it's too late.

1189
01:20:47,455 --> 01:20:50,895
You might as well know,
I'm not an OWL operator.

1190
01:20:51,175 --> 01:20:54,095
I'm not doing anything for the war
effort.

1191
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:57,175
I have a couple of rooms in Clapton
and I...

1192
01:20:57,455 --> 01:21:00,455
earn a living charring and taking in
laundry.

1193
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:03,175
What do you think my parents would
say to that?

1194
01:21:05,295 --> 01:21:07,695
The truth is that...

1195
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:10,815
Robert left a few months after James
was born.

1196
01:21:11,095 --> 01:21:14,295
I don't... He's not in Africa. I
don't know where he is.

1197
01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:17,375
He just shoved off and disappeared.
I have a little money.

1198
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:20,895
What am I to do?

1199
01:21:30,215 --> 01:21:32,015
You should, er, stay a little longer.

1200
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:35,935
The sisters have been very kind but
I'm not sure they'd let me...

1201
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:38,775
No, I mean with me,
both of you, for the time being.

1202
01:21:38,975 --> 01:21:40,815
Are you sure?

1203
01:21:41,055 --> 01:21:43,015
No...

1204
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:45,615
but somebody's got to look after you.

1205
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,135
What about your work?

1206
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:52,175
Well, I've got a feeling there's
going to be...less of it from now on.

1207
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:54,655
I'll be back.

1208
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:10,695
Your desk sergeant told me I would
find you here.

1209
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:13,175
I wondered if we could talk.

1210
01:22:14,135 --> 01:22:19,495
I feel terrible
about all this business.

1211
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:24,415
I've known you...
I don't know how many years.

1212
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:27,255
And lying to the police!

1213
01:22:27,535 --> 01:22:30,415
It's not something I would normally
contemplate.

1214
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:38,895
But you erm...you must understand
what I've been trying to tell you.

1215
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:43,575
My work is classified.

1216
01:22:43,895 --> 01:22:47,575
Now I've spoken
with Captain Boothroyd

1217
01:22:47,855 --> 01:22:50,895
and he has sought clearance at the
highest level

1218
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:55,855
to enable me to tell you what we've
been working on.

1219
01:22:57,175 --> 01:23:00,335
I... I feel I owe it to you.

1220
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:03,455
Too kind.

1221
01:23:06,135 --> 01:23:10,015
Very soon, the RAF are going to bomb
a series of dams

1222
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:13,015
in Germany's industrial heartland,

1223
01:23:13,215 --> 01:23:14,375
the Ruhr Valley.

1224
01:23:15,455 --> 01:23:17,895
Now, if we can knock those dams out,

1225
01:23:18,215 --> 01:23:20,975
we will do vast damage to their war
machine.

1226
01:23:21,255 --> 01:23:26,775
Factories, power stations, roads,
bridges, farmland.

1227
01:23:27,015 --> 01:23:31,655
We'll put them all under hundreds of
millions of gallons of water.

1228
01:23:32,855 --> 01:23:35,775
But it's going to need a...

1229
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:45,095
It's going to take
a very special bomb.

1230
01:23:46,295 --> 01:23:48,735
A bomb that bounces along
the surface of the water.

1231
01:23:49,055 --> 01:23:51,495
Now nothing like this has ever been
attempted before.

1232
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:58,335
The bomb has to be sent spinning
before it's released

1233
01:23:58,615 --> 01:24:04,535
and my team have helped to develop a
machine that does precisely that...

1234
01:24:05,495 --> 01:24:08,615
..and that was the machine that
Michael Richards would
have destroyed

1235
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:10,815
if Evelyn hadn't stopped him.

1236
01:24:16,095 --> 01:24:18,455
And that's why...you protected her?

1237
01:24:20,015 --> 01:24:21,375
Well, she was protecting us.

1238
01:24:22,455 --> 01:24:25,135
And that's worth...

1239
01:24:25,295 --> 01:24:27,935
perverting the course of justice?

1240
01:24:31,295 --> 01:24:33,695
I thought so.
Poor decision, Professor,

1241
01:24:33,975 --> 01:24:36,455
because, apart from betraying our
friendship,

1242
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:40,335
you've also made yourself an
accessory to premeditated murder.

1243
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:44,615
Evelyn Richards said that she acted
in self-defence.

1244
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:46,695
She lied.

1245
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:50,895
She lied to you and to us.

1246
01:24:51,095 --> 01:24:52,815
Lied? Lied about what?

1247
01:24:53,015 --> 01:24:55,815
Well, amongst other things...

1248
01:24:56,015 --> 01:24:58,815
about what happened.

1249
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:02,015
I didn't know what to do. I
telephoned Professor Townsend.

1250
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:05,415
I thought he'd know what to do and
he had to know what had happened.

1251
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:07,495
He said he'd come straight round.

1252
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:10,735
Then I telephoned Lindemann.

1253
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,735
I couldn't stand being on my own.

1254
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:18,335
You live er...less than a mile away
from the research centre.

1255
01:25:18,575 --> 01:25:22,135
Yes. Lindemann's rooms are eight
miles away in Bexhill.

1256
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,695
Yes, they are.
If she called you first...

1257
01:25:25,015 --> 01:25:27,695
how come he was already there when
you arrived?

1258
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:33,855
She...

1259
01:25:34,015 --> 01:25:35,775
she must have made a mistake.

1260
01:25:37,695 --> 01:25:39,615
If you say so.

1261
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:55,015
Well, I don't get it.
Join the club.

1262
01:25:55,335 --> 01:25:57,895
I even got that chap Hendry to have
a go at it.

1263
01:25:58,175 --> 01:26:01,415
Well, him being a gambler an' all.
Are you sure you got it right?

1264
01:26:01,655 --> 01:26:04,215
Absolutely. It's in the book.
Ready?

1265
01:26:05,095 --> 01:26:07,015
Yes, sir.
Still at it.

1266
01:26:07,335 --> 01:26:09,975
It's beaten everyone, sir.
Why don't you have a go?

1267
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:12,175
No. It's not quite my sort of thing.

1268
01:26:12,495 --> 01:26:15,655
Oh, go on, sir. Help us out. It's
very simple. Is it?

1269
01:26:16,055 --> 01:26:20,895
At least, it should be. What you
have to do is make a swastika inside
the frame...using four cards.

1270
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:22,375
Mm. Has anybody got close?

1271
01:26:22,615 --> 01:26:25,135
Nowhere near. It's called A New Deal
For The Nazis.

1272
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:28,215
Well, you know,
sometimes it helps to erm...

1273
01:26:28,415 --> 01:26:31,175
look behind the cards, maybe.

1274
01:26:31,335 --> 01:26:33,015
What do you mean, sir?

1275
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:36,655
Well, I was just thinking about
shapes. You know, but...

1276
01:26:36,855 --> 01:26:37,855
No, frankly I don't see it.

1277
01:26:38,135 --> 01:26:40,375
If it's foxed you, what hope is
there for the rest of us?

1278
01:26:40,775 --> 01:26:44,655
That's enough from you. Come on, this
is getting us nowhere. We're going to
be late. Milner.

1279
01:26:44,895 --> 01:26:46,735
Yes, sir. Good luck.

1280
01:26:51,735 --> 01:26:53,615
Behind the cards.

1281
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:05,295
Oh!

1282
01:27:05,495 --> 01:27:07,375
There it is!

1283
01:27:07,535 --> 01:27:10,255
I've got it, I've got it.

1284
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:12,095
I've done it!

1285
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:22,255
Right, this won't take long.

1286
01:27:22,495 --> 01:27:24,295
Back soon.

1287
01:27:35,895 --> 01:27:37,775
Crafty old fox.

1288
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:50,535
Morning. I've finished my
investigation of the south coast. I
have to get back to London.

1289
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:52,775
I've absolutely no intention of
keeping you.

1290
01:27:55,295 --> 01:27:59,575
Well. I'm primarily here to find out
about the De Perez situation.

1291
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,175
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1292
01:28:02,415 --> 01:28:05,095
He is attached to the embassy,
as he told you,

1293
01:28:05,335 --> 01:28:07,655
and, as such, he's beyond our reach.

1294
01:28:08,815 --> 01:28:12,735
Spain declared their neutrality back
in September '39.

1295
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:17,215
However, many of their diplomats,
the consular service, the police

1296
01:28:17,455 --> 01:28:19,855
and the coast guard
work for the Germans.

1297
01:28:21,695 --> 01:28:23,615
I got this from a friend in
Whitehall.

1298
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:27,935
He suggested we pass on what we know
about De Perez to the security
services.

1299
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:31,775
And what will they do?
I doubt they'll do anything.

1300
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:34,695
They know who he is and what he is.

1301
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:37,775
Doubtless they have their own
reasons for keeping him at large.

1302
01:28:38,015 --> 01:28:39,855
And so he goes free.

1303
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:45,215
That's marvellous. They all go free.
Who do you mean?

1304
01:28:45,495 --> 01:28:51,055
Well, him, Evelyn Richards,
Lindemann. Lindemann?

1305
01:28:51,335 --> 01:28:54,015
Lindemann. You're not saying he was
involved, are you?

1306
01:28:54,255 --> 01:28:57,855
I am.
What on earth are you suggesting?

1307
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,895
On the day he dies,
how does Michael Richards, sir,

1308
01:29:03,215 --> 01:29:06,415
in such an extremely good mood as a
result of taking a phone call,

1309
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:11,335
come to be so very angry and violent
so very shortly afterwards?

1310
01:29:11,735 --> 01:29:15,615
If he goes to the research centre
with the intention of doing as much
damage as possible,

1311
01:29:15,895 --> 01:29:18,575
why does he need his best suit and a
bunch of flowers to do it?

1312
01:29:18,815 --> 01:29:22,215
How does a woman with no experience
of firearms

1313
01:29:22,535 --> 01:29:25,655
manage to shoot her drunk, violent
husband

1314
01:29:25,895 --> 01:29:29,535
so very precisely between the eyes in
such a very premeditated fashion?

1315
01:29:29,815 --> 01:29:33,535
I'm suggesting that she made the call
to her husband,

1316
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:39,935
inviting him to the centre with the
prospect of an improvement in their
relationship

1317
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:42,655
where he was shot by Lindemann.

1318
01:29:42,855 --> 01:29:44,495
And why would they do this?

1319
01:29:44,655 --> 01:29:46,375
Because they're having an affair...

1320
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:50,015
..for which we do have proof.

1321
01:29:53,135 --> 01:29:55,095
It's not enough.

1322
01:29:58,175 --> 01:30:00,095
Right.

1323
01:30:03,295 --> 01:30:05,535
Well, it certainly is for me.

1324
01:30:05,815 --> 01:30:07,975
Foyle...
No, with this sort of thing, erm...

1325
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:10,655
virtually condoned for the sake of
the war effort,

1326
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:14,535
a man guilty of coercion and sabotage
can't be touched, while two boys,

1327
01:30:14,935 --> 01:30:19,455
guilty of nothing more than slipping
off the rails because of a lack of
parental control,

1328
01:30:19,735 --> 01:30:21,695
will get several years with hard
labour.

1329
01:30:22,015 --> 01:30:24,935
Assistant Commissioners doing their
very best to undermine me

1330
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:27,415
in front of my staff,
yeah, I'd say I'd had enough.

1331
01:30:27,735 --> 01:30:31,615
Look. I know you and I got off to a
bad start, Foyle.

1332
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:34,775
It was my fault
and I apologise for it.

1333
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:38,575
But it's not too late. We can have
another look at Mrs Richards

1334
01:30:38,815 --> 01:30:40,895
and I'll tell you what...

1335
01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:45,415
You know a young woman.
Lydia Nicholson.

1336
01:30:45,735 --> 01:30:49,535
Mmmm. I have here a report concerning
an attempted suicide.

1337
01:30:49,775 --> 01:30:52,015
A recommendation to prosecute.

1338
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:59,855
You see?

1339
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:04,495
Justice can sometimes be manipulated
to help the individual.

1340
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,255
Well...

1341
01:31:09,335 --> 01:31:12,655
Your justice, perhaps. Not mine.

1342
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:14,855
Look. You can't do this...

1343
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:20,055
Damn it.

1344
01:31:31,815 --> 01:31:34,135
FOYLE: 'Assistant Commissioner
Parkins,

1345
01:31:34,535 --> 01:31:39,895
I have suggested to you that
maintaining the law in a time of war
is all but impossible.

1346
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:44,975
I have now reached the conclusion
that I am no longer up to the task

1347
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:49,615
and it would seem, therefore, that
there can be no useful purpose in me
remaining in my position.'

1348
01:32:01,575 --> 01:32:06,135
'I am, therefore, offering you my
resignation, effective as of now.

1349
01:32:06,335 --> 01:32:09,255
I remain, sir, your obedient servant,

1350
01:32:09,415 --> 01:32:12,175
Christopher Foyle.'
