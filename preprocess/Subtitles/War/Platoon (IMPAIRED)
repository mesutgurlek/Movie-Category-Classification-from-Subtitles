01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,876
and Charlie Company had been probed
that night.

1101
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,921
There were other battalions in the valley.
We weren't the only ones.

1102
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,174
But we knew we were gonna be the bait
to lure them out.

1103
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,387
Somewhere out there
was the entire 141st NVA regiment.

1104
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:08,323
Caught those motherfuckers
trying to pull some shit

1105
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,659
on Charlie Company last night.

1106
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,203
They found maps on them, man.

1107
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,247
Got a friend at battalion,

1108
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:18,292
says they had every fucking foxhole here
fixed on it.

1109
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:22,587
Distances, tree-lines, our claymores,
everything.

1110
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:27,050
This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

1111
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:29,803
I also heard we're in fucking Cambodia
right now.

1112
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,306
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.

1113
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,267
You wanted to see me, sir?

1114
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,022
Yeah, Ramucci.
Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

1115
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:41,481
Squad, sir?

1116
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,318
I didn't know we were still referring
to this platoon in terms of squads.

1117
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,944
All right, look.

1118
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,947
I want you to take those two holes
right there and there.

1119
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:52,242
You're tying it off with Barnes up here,
King down there.

1120
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,410
Yeah.

1121
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,412
Begging your pardon, sir.

1122
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,248
My two holes are far enough apart
you can run a regiment through them

1123
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,333
and never see them.

1124
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,084
I have five live bodies left, sir.

1125
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,378
Look, I don't wanna hear your problems,
Ramucci.

1126
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,130
You'll get new men any day.

1127
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:07,132
Meantime, you make do
like everybody else. Okay?

1128
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,718
-I didn't ask for this job.
-I don't want to hear it.

1129
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,763
-Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
-Yeah, that's right.

1130
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:16,641
I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell
the truth, I don't give a shit, okay?

1131
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:19,936
-l just don't give a flying fuck anymore.
-Right.

and he hungry tonight.

What a fucking bummer.

1136
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:40,999
Ten days and a wake-up,
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

1137
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:46,296
What's the matter with you, man?

1138
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,965
How come you ain't writing nobody?

1139
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,051
What about your folks?

1140
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,388
That grandma you was telling me about?

1141
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,474
Girl?

1142
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,855
You got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

1143
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,817
Nah, there's nobody.

to the bush.

You was green as a...

1148

Did you ever get caught in a mistake
that you just can't get out of, King?

1149
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,839
There's a way out of anything, man.

1150
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:31,925
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry,

on that chopper with King out of here.

-Hey, Francis.

1407
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:31,744
-Hey, man, how you doing?
-I'm okay. How you doing?

1408
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,996
Fine, man. Just fine. Hey, dig it.

1409
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,665
We two timers, man.
We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1410
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:40,919
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1411
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,629
CAPTAIN: Sergeant O'Neill.

1412
01:52:43,965 --> 01:52:46,091
-How you doing?
-Well, I'm just fine, sir.

1413
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:49,344
Well, that's good.
'Cause you got second platoon.

1414
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:51,013
Yes, sir.

1415
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:02,858
-You ready?
-You bet.

1416
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:37,351
(GRUNTING)

1417
01:54:31,906 --> 01:54:34,616
CHRIS: I think now, looking back,

1418
01:54:35,618 --> 01:54:39,580
we did not fight the enemy.
We fought ourselves.

1419
01:54:39,747 --> 01:54:42,291
And the enemy was in us.

1420
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,461
The war is over for me now,

1421
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:50,340
but it will always be there
the rest of my days

1422
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:53,302
as I'm sure Elias will be,

1423
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,639
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called
possession of my soul.

1424
01:54:59,475 --> 01:55:01,101
There are times since,

1425
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:04,771
I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.

1426
01:55:07,942 --> 01:55:09,818
But, be that as it may,

1427
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:11,820
those of us who did make it

1428
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:14,239
have an obligation to build again,

1429
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,159
to teach to others what we know,

1430
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:20,871
and to try with what's left of our lives

1431
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,499
to find a goodness and meaning
to this life.
