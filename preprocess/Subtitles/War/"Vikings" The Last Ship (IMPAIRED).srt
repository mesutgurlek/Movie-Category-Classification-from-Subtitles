I'm listening.

260
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:12,234
I went on a raiding party
last year to England,

261
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:14,269
with Earl Gunnar Asgrimsson.

262
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:17,912
We fought against the armies of King
Ecbert, and wintered in Wessex.

263
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,466
And made a treaty with
Ecbert's ealdormen.

264
00:27:23,304 --> 00:27:27,266
And they told us that
your father, King Ragnar,

265
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,269
had sired a child there by
Queen Kwenthrith of Mercia,

266
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:32,511
and that this child still
lives at Ecbert's court.

267
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:37,767
What's the child's name?

268
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:40,169
Magnus.

269
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,860
He is a young man now, 12 years old.

270
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:55,358
And you are certain that this
Magnus is really my father's child?

271
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,593
How can I be certain?

272
00:27:57,954 --> 00:27:59,420
I was not there at the conception.

273
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:06,460
Why would they lie?

274
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:20,816
There was something else you learned
from Ecbert's ealdormen, was there not?

275
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:24,387
Well?

276
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,525
It was about your father's
farming settlement in Wessex.

277
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:32,604
We asked if it still
existed and they laughed,

278
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,483
and said it was destroyed almost as
soon as your father sailed away.

279
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,949
But that they allowed some
of the settlers to escape,

280
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:44,092
so they would take the word
to your father, as a warning.

281
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:48,661

He is our father.

339
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,110
And that is the end of it.

340
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:02,706
You all sound like a
bunch of Christians.

341
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:06,837
I love our father as much as you do.

342
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,445
Who said I loved him, Ubbe?

343
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,373
I said I admired him.

344
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,708
He's Viking.

345
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,656
And you are soft.

346
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,625
I am not soft!

347
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:22,394
None of us is soft.

348
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,830
But we want to understand
what our father did.

349
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,898
And what he was.

350
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,808
As his son, his fame
does not interest me.

351
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:33,656
What he used his power for,
now that would interest me.

352
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,750
(SCOFFS)

353
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:40,329
By now, my brothers, there will
be a lot of anger in Kattegat.

354
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,034
Now they know the truth.

355
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,234
Our father betrayed a whole
generation of people.

356
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,015
-So if he ever came back... -I don't
think he is ever going to come back.

357
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:55,922
I think what happened in
Paris finally broke him.

358
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,419
You can all say whatever you
want, but he was a human.

359
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:03,917
People started to talk
as if he was a god.

360
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,618
He was not a god, he was a man!

361
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,725
A man with many dreams
and many failings.

362
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,559
I've learned that in the
years since he went away.

363
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,667
If I was him, I wouldn't come back.

364
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,463
Despite all his failings,

365
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,866
he's still the greatest
man in the world to me.

366
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:12,888
Did you know Ragnar lied to us all?

367
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,793
The settlement in Wessex was
destroyed as soon as we left.

368
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:26,335
I know.

369
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,776
A farmer who escaped the slaughter

370
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,512
told your father and
I what had happened.

371
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:35,087
Ragnar killed him so no
one else would find out.

372
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,816
You're a good friend to my father.

373
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:44,587
HELGA: Hello, Bjorn.

374
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:46,589
Helga.

375
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:52,631
I was just coming to see how
the boats were progressing.

376
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,435
FLOKI: What do you say, Helga?

377
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,298
What shall we tell him?

378
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,534
We think that it won't be
long until you have boats

379
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:04,437
ready and able to take you
to the Mediterranean Sea!

380
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,179
(SCOFFS) If it exists.

381
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:09,391
Of course it exists.

382
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,026
FLOKI: It's just a map, Bjorn.

383
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,802
Marks on a paper. A child
could have drawn it.

384
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,256
How can we know it's real?

385
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:19,828
I learned from my father.

386
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,564
The only way to tell if
something is real...

387
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:30,480
...is to sail there.

388
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,754
I hope you'll come with me, Floki.

389
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,951
Are you joking?

390
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:43,086
The lure of an imaginary land.

391
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,195
Traveling somewhere that doesn't exist.

392
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:49,801
Of course I'm coming. (LAUGHS)

393
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,964
And I hope you'll come too, Helga.

394
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:59,169
Well, if Floki is mad enough to go,

395
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:01,319
then I guess I will follow.

396
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:27,214
(INHALES SHARPLY)

Let us pass. Move.

404
00:39:58,461 --> 00:39:59,427
Hello, Ivar.

405
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,459
There's no mistaking you.

406
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:06,401
(RAGNAR BREATHS DEEPLY)

407
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:11,552
It appears my return is not welcome.

408
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,619
You've obviously all made
your mind up about me.

409
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,325
I cannot blame you for that.

410
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:25,524
(SIGHS) So.

411
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:28,515
Well, boys,

412
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,885
who is going to do it, then?

413
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:37,379
Who's going to kill me?

414
00:40:41,618 --> 00:40:42,918
Well, I don't mind.

415
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:46,154
Go ahead.

416
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:48,690
Please.

417
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,140
What about you, Hvitserk?

418
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,576
You think you're a man now?

419
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,613
I dare you.

420
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:04,018
Put me out of my misery.

421
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:06,691
Do it.

422
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,687
Do it.

423
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:09,921
Do it, do it. (SHOUTS) Do it!

Look!

Why would they?

429
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:26,911
I am your leader, and I just left!

430
00:41:29,015 --> 00:41:31,616
What kind of leader does that, huh?

431
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,238
(SHOUTING) What kind of
king abandons his people?

432
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,571
What kind of father abandons his sons?

433
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,191
So, who wants to be king?

(SHOUTS) Oh, you know how this works!

If you want to be king,

436
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,038
you must kill me.

No?
