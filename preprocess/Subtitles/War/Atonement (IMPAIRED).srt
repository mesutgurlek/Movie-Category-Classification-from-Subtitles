unnecessarily provoked.

bruised her arm. Gave her Chinese burns.

I'm afraid she's quite right.
I had to pull them off her.

-No, Sister.

Yesterday, you were seconded
to men's surgical.

When your patient came round from his
anaesthetic, it seems the first thing he did

629
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,355
was to ask for Briony.
Who might Briony be?

-There is no Briony.

The Allied Forces have not lost
cohesion, and their morale is high.

The RAF continues to give all the support
in its power

to the Allied armies in northeastern
France and Belgium. Railways, roads,

continuously attacked, yesterday...

01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,673
A name that will live forever
in the annals of warfare.

775
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,396
In the course of a comprehensive tour,

776
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,075
Queen Elizabeth is seen here visiting
a chocolate factory in the north of England.

777
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,390
The confectionary magnate
and friend of the British Army,

778
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,553
Mr Paul Marshall, gave the Queen a tour
of the Army Amo factory

779
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,838
with his lovely,
soon-to-be-wed fiance, Miss Lola Quincey.

780
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,559
What a mouthwatering couple they are.

781
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,070
Keep the Amo coming.
Our boys have a sweet tooth.

782
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:19,271
Secondly, for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication,

783
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,069
that such persons
as have not the gift of continence,

784
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:28,518
might marry and keep themselves
undefiled members of Christ's body.

785
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:34,314
Thirdly, it was ordained,
for the mutual society, help and comfort,

786
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,790
that the one ought to have the other.

787
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:38,949
I saw him.

788
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,794
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause

789
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,713
why they may not be
lawfully joined together...

790
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,869
I know it was him.

791
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,353
...Iet him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

792
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,709
(GASPS)

793
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,274
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

794
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,396
(ORGAN PLAYING)

795
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,598
WOMAN: Let the nursey through.

796
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,069
They're going down to the country today.
Never been out of London before.

797
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,309
I hope they get a nice family.

798
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,550
They don't know what they're in for
with this lot.

799
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,675
Come on.

800
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,998
I'm looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia Tallis.

801
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,395
Is she in?

802
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,669
Tallis! Door!

803
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,310
I tried writing. You wouldn't answer.

804
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,917
I have to talk to you.

805
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,715
(DOOR CLOSING)

806
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,835
-So you're a ward sister now?
-Yes.

807
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,715
Thanks.

808
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,676
I want to go in front of a judge
and change my evidence, Cee.

809
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,398
Don't call me that.

810
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,711
Please don't call me that.

811
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,835
I know what I did was terrible.
I don't expect you to forgive me.

812
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,876
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

813
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,354
You're an unreliable witness.
They'll never reopen the case.

814
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,112
Well, at least
I could tell everyone else what I did.

815
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,509
I can go home and explain
to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

816
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,750
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

817
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,956
They don't want to hear any more about it.

818
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,112
That unpleasantness is all tidied away
in the past, thank you very much.

819
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,269
But...

820
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,110
I'll be late. Better get moving.

821
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,794
Excuse me.

822
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,717
He sleeps so deeply.

823
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,717
-What is she doing here?
-She wanted to speak to me.

824
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,597
Oh, yes, what about?

825
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,999
The terrible thing I did.

826
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,513
Robbie. Darling.

827
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,992
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

828
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,271
I'll be quite honest with you.

829
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,759
I'm torn between breaking your neck here

830
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,718
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs.

831
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,869
Oh, God.

832
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,873
Do you have any idea what it's like in jail?
Of course, you don't.

833
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,708
Tell me, did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside?

834
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,552
-No.
-But you did nothing about it.

835
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,278
-No.
-Do you think I assaulted your cousin?

836
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,395
-No.
-Did you think it then?

837
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,515
Yes. But yes and no.

838
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,431
-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

839
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,999
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

840
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,117
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

841
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,553
What are you, 18?

842
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,393
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

843
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,393
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

844
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,833
-did you know that?
-Yes.

845
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,115
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

846
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,397
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

847
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,472
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

848
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,472
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

849
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,438
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

850
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,990
Come back. Come back.

851
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,590
Come back to me.

852
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,675
CECILIA: Briony.

853
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,118
There isn't much time.

854
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,915
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

855
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,794
So sit down.

856
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,119
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

857
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,912
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

858
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,319
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

859
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,312
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

860
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,992
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

861
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,150
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

862
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:44,309
Yes.

863
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,119
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

864
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,111
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

865
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,394
Try to include whatever you can remember

866
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,198
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

867
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:53,474
-Hardman?
-Yes.

868
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,152
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

869
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,911
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

870
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,755
I don't believe you.

871
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,957
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

872
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,280
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

873
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,516
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

874
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:17,953
He's immune.

875
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:37,631
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

876
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,710
I am very, very sorry.

877
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,151
ROBBIE: Just do as we've asked of you.

878
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,798
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

879
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,152
And then leave us be.

880
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,353
I will, I promise.

881
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,915
(DOOR CLOSING)

882
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,716
BRIONY: I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

883
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,598
MAN: Of course. Is something the matter?

884
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,797
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

885
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,998
(TAPE REWINDING)

886
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,832
...minutes by myself.

887
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:14,354
MAN: Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

888
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,195
Briony?

889
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,316
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

890
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,113
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

891
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,636
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

892
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:10,432
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

893
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,388
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

894
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,834
I'm dying.

895
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,999
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

896
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,518
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

897
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,993
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

898
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,992
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

899
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:43,157
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

900
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,190
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

901
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,759
Strangely enough,

902
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,592
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

903
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:05,714
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

904
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,869
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

905
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,995
MAN: Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

906
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,436
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

907
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,272
And was that the problem?

908
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,629
No.

909
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:25,031
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

910
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,550
No rhymes, no embellishments.

911
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,474
And I think...

912
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,914
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

913
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,913
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

914
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:55,275
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

915
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,792
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

916
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:05,716
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

917
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,628
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

918
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,789
By honesty.

919
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,394
Or reality.

920
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,437
Because, in fact,

921
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:26,236
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

922
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,678
I never made that journey to Balham.

923
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,352
ROBBIE: Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

924
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,396
BRIONY: So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

925
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,549
CECILIA: He sleeps so deeply.

926
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,629
BRIONY: Invented.

927
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,518
ROBBIE: How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

928
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,955
BRIONY: And, in fact,
could never have happened.

929
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,075
Because

930
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,110
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

931
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,430
on June the first, 1940,

932
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,431
the last day of the evacuation.

933
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,269
Cheerio, pal.

934
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:37,599
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

935
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,671
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

936
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,152
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

937
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,037
(BOMBS EXPLODING)

938
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,435
So...

939
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,429
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

940
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,919
they both so longed for, and deserved.

941
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,393
And which, ever since, I've...

942
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,353
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

943
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,672
But what sense of hope,

944
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:04,478
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

945
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:11,549
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

946
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,908
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

947
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,476
but a final act of kindness.

948
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:30,673
I gave them their happiness.

949
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,719
(BOTH LAUGHING)
