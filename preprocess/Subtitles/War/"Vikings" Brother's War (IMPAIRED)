00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,121
RAGNAR: I've had no message
from my brother,

2
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:37,064
but I still believe in my heart
that he will not betray me,

3
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,821
for he has no reason.

4
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:46,311
Who needs a reason
for betrayal?

5
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:50,634
One must always think
the worst, Ragnar,

6
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:52,933
even of your own kin.

7
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:57,781
That way, you avoid too much
disappointment in life.

(Horse snorts nervously)

14
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,529
There is the
treacherous one.

15
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,375
I was right, Ragnar.

16
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,882
(Inhales forcefully)

17
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,724
I was right.

What is it you want?

32
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:45,613
ARNE: I'm here on behalf
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

33
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,494
I want to speak
to his brother.

34
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:51,907
JARL BORG:
Then speak.

35
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,598
Rollo,

36
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,062
you and I fought
together many times.

37
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,724
I don't suppose
you've forgotten.

38
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,708
I think of you
as a brother...

39
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,555
but over there is
your real brother,

40
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,944
your own flesh and blood.

41
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:15,540
Are you sure you want to
raise your axe against him?

42
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:18,753
Did Ragnar send you?

43
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,749
(Exhales)

44
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,761
What answer shall
I give him?

(Exhales slowly)

46
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:40,649

(Wind blows)

132
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,343
KING HORIK:
Without being defeated,

133
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:43,795
we have grown weary of the slaughter
of our young men. So, Jarl Borg,

134
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,884
I offer you...

135
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:50,212
one third of the profits
from the disputed lands.

136
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,657
Unless you continue to
dispute my claim to it.

137
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,790
I would rather go back fighting,
than receive such scant justice.

138
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:03,505
(Weary, frustrated sigh)

139
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,794
So, you'll not accept
my fair offer?

140
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:13,036
No.

141
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,455
Why do we continue
looking inwards?

142
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,812
(Shouts)
Why?!

143
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,831
Why do we fight each other about
this piece or that piece of land?

144
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:39,061
Why are we not looking
outwards to the West?

145
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,723
If we raided together,

146
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,947
we would not need

147
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,481
to fight amongst
ourselves.

148
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:53,858
We would not need to kill
anymore of our young folk.

149
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,223
But instead,

150
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,828
offer them land,

151
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,866
land that they can farm.

152
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,892
WARRIOR: (Quietly)
He speaks the truth.

153
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:13,157
My mind tends the
same way as Ragnar's.

154
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:18,477
It is my intention to join
with him and sail West.

155
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,249
What do you say, Jarl Borg?

156
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:28,157
Yes,

157
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,837
I will raid with you,

158
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,204
and so I accept
your offer.

159
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,159
(Warriors talk quietly)

160
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,297
Not that you'd
care, brother,

161
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,875
but your niece,
Gyda, is dead.

162
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,726
Time to go home.

163
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:11,030
(Spits in disgust, groans)

164

00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,008
(Women weep openly)

169
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,807
Floki! Floki!

170
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,046
Don't die.

171
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,068
- Please don't die.
- WOMAN: What's happened to them?!

172
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:04,899
TOWNSPEOPLE:
(Shout angrily)

173
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,938
One Eye died.

174
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,259
Arne?!

175
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:15,055
Rollo killed him.

176
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:21,749
And Floki may not survive
for he is so badly wounded.

177
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,212
LAGERTHA:
This was not your quarrel.

178
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,265
You should not have
become involved.

179
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:30,477
Look what has happened!

180
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,667
No man can walk through life without
things happening to him, Lagertha.

181
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,623
You chose.

182
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,211
Yes. I chose, and
Rollo chose.

183
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,631
And Rollo's choice led to all this!

184
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,461
BJORN:
Don't argue you two.

185
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:48,781
I am weary

186
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,148
and I'm blood-sickened,

187
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,775
and that is the truth.

188
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,955
(Bites food)

189
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,960
(Quietly)
Who is Aslaug?

190
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,491
(Grunts angrily)
(Plate strikes floor)

191
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:06,948
Stop.

192
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:10,570
Who is Aslaug?

193
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:13,369
She's a Gotaland princess.

194
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:15,536
We met her over there.

195
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,410
You just met her?

196
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,014
SIGGY: (Warningly)
Lagertha.

197
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,786
What has the boy told you?

198
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,659
What did you
tell her, boy?

199
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:32,924
LAGERTHA: It doesn't
matter what Bjorn says.

200
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,948
What do you say?

201
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,373
I say...

202
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,948
(Chairs crash)

203
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,985
we should not wash our dirty
clothes in front of others.

204
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,088
(Water splashes and drips)

205
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:56,646
(Doors crash open)

206
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:00,732
Ungh!

207
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,635
Ungh!
(Object smashes)

208
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,384
Did you have sex with her?

209
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:07,069
Yes, I had sex with her.

210
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,184
(Object clatters)

211
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,913
How many times?!

212
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,174
Once.

213
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,756
Ungh!
(Struggling grunts)

214
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,228
(Panting)

215
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,220
I don't love her.

216
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,446
(Sharp gasp)

217
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,334
How can I make
you let this go?

218
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,386
- Never see her again.
- Done.

219
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:49,763
Never again.

220
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:53,138
(Passionate gasp)

221
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,757
BJORN: Why are there such
problems between you?

222
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,215
RAGNAR:
You know why.

223
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:01,206
But I don't want there
to be problems.

224
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,256
Can't you just say sorry
for what you've done?

225
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,131
(Laughs)

226
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,439
It's not so easy
with your mother.

227
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:11,396
And what will
happen to Rollo?

228
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:14,345
RAGNAR: I cannot judge
my own brother.

229
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,590
We will have an assembly and
the Law-Giver will judge.

230
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,081
We will take Rollo
up to the Law Rock

231
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:23,617
and that is where his
fate will be decided.

232
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,351
What's that you have?

233
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,420
A gold coin.

234
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:31,141
From England.

235
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:34,647
You see?

236
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,587
It even has King
Aelle's face upon it.

237
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:47,339
So it's worth a fortune?

238
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,471
(Townspeople chatter, seagulls cry)

239
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,420
(Approaching footsteps)

240
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,600
TORSTEIN:
What do you want?

241
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,809
To talk to him.

242
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,783
(Whispers)
Rollo...

243
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,867
Rollo, it's me.

244
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,459
Don't bother.

245
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,172
You cannot warm
up a dead man.

246
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,829
(Angry shouting and jeering)

247
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,241
MAN:
He is without honor!

248
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,479
- MAN 2: Kill him!
- WOMEN: I spit on you!

249
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,086
MAN AND WOMAN:
Traitor! Traitor!

250
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:03,523
WOMAN 2: Now he'll pay
for what he's done!

251
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,732
- WOMAN 3: Kill him!
- MAN 2: Traitor! Traitor!

252
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:08,214
WOMAN 4:
Kill him!

253
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,186
WOMAN 5:
Shame on you!

254
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,571
(Bangs staff)

255
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,957
LAW-GIVER: People,

256
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,264
as your Law-Giver,

257
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:25,659
I have been asked to determine
the fate of this man.

258
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:31,469
This man chose to fight
with our enemies.

259
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:36,080
Chose to fight
against his brother.

260
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:37,491
MAN:
Traitor!

261
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,722
LAW-GIVER:
He killed many of our sons,

262
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,362
brothers,

263
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,360
fathers.

264
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,419
What hope is
there for him?

265
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,790
TOWNSPEOPLE:
(Angry jeers)

266
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,643
TORSTEIN:
He has no defense!

267
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,125
MAN:
He has no defense!

268
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,060
LAW-GIVER:
This man deserves to die.

269
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,722
TOWNSPEOPLE:
Yeah!

270
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:58,408
We all know that.

271
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,360
But...

272
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,558
I have decided
to spare him.

273
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:06,392
(Shouts of disagreement)

274
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:09,992
LAW-GIVER: I have taken
the advice of the gods.

275
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,137
If they had
wanted him dead,

276
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,133
he would have
died in battle.

277
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:19,091
But they spared him.

278
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,167
He came forward

279
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:23,924
and threw himself upon the
mercy of his brother.

280
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,618
He behaved in an interesting
and unexpected way,

281
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,881
and therefore,
I conclude...

282
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:35,362
that the gods have made
their own judgment,

283
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:38,196
which I cannot overturn.

284
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:42,991
LAW-GIVER: I therefore order
this man be set free.

285
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:45,126
CROWD:
(Shouts angrily)

286
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,917
MAN:
Kill the traitor!

287
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,038
TORSTEIN: We should kill him
anyway. You are the Earl!

288
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,488
No. We must obey the law.

289
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,517
Who is the Law-Giver?
Just an ordinary man.

290
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,139
Not when he stands
on the Sacred Stone.

291
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:31,546
(Ships creak, dog barks, seagulls cry)

292
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:42,256
(Goats bleat, geese honk)

293
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,856
(Sighs heavily)

294
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,326
I wanted to step out
of your shadow.

295
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,457
You understand, don't you?

296
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,061
But when I stepped out
of it, there was...

297
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:14,900
there was no sunlight,

298
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:18,942
no sunlight at all.

299
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,530
(Ships creaks, seagulls cry)

300
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:34,494
(Door creaks open)

301
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:41,180
What are you doing?

302
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:43,244
Leaving.

303
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,179
Everyone hates me here...

304
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:52,794
with good reason.

305
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:54,651
I have betrayed them.

306
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:58,478
There is no point
in my staying.

307
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,518
But you are going to leave and
not even say goodbye to me?

308
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:06,857
I thought you would
prefer it that way.

309
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,624
Do you really know
me so little?

310
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,064
I have nothing...

311
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,649
to offer you.

312
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,112
It would have been better for
you, for me, for everyone

313
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,878
if I had been executed.

314
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:44,474
So you take no
account of the gods?

315
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,409
What would you say the
gods have offered you?

316
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,932
A lifetime of humiliation.

317
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,993
SIGGY:
No! That is not it!

318
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:59,934
The gods have offered you
a chance to be reborn,

319
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,076
to be redeemed,
to gain Valhalla.

320
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:04,346
That is what they
have offered you.

321
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:10,971
But you, you want to run away. You
want to hide in a hole somewhere.

322
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,461
Where else can I go?

323
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:17,838
Why do you have
to go anywhere?

324
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:28,419
(Birds chirp and cry, fire crackles)

325
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:31,110
RAGNAR:
Gyda,

326
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:35,011
I have come to say
goodbye to you properly.

327
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:41,235
I have been thinking about you,
about when you were small.

328
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:47,287
You were so lively, you could
run as swiftly as the wind.

329
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:50,031
You were like quick-silver.

330
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,757
But then, before
I knew it,

331
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:57,227
you stopped running here
and there and everywhere

332
00:25:57,926 --> 00:25:59,722
and you became still.

333
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:04,474
At 12-years-old,

334
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,677
you had the stillness and
the calm of a fine woman.

335
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,508
What children you
would have produced!

336
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:16,502
What joy...

337
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:19,366
that would have
brought to all of us.

338
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:31,265
Dear child,

339
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:33,536
Gyda,

340
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:37,846
you are not gone because you
are always in my heart.

341
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:44,074
They say that a man must
love his sons more,

342
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,590
but a man can be
jealous of his sons,

343
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:52,431
and his daughter can always
be the light in his life.

344
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,808
I know very well that
you are with the gods,

345
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,930
but I will wait
here awhile,

346
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:11,223
and if you want to come and
talk to me, then come and talk,

347
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:18,864
and I will gently stroke your long
and beautiful hair once again

348
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:21,764
with my peasant hands.

349
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:26,334
(Waves lap gently)

350
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,892
(Waves lap against the ship)

351
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:44,671
(Ship creaks)

352
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:51,372
(Low hum of chatter, wind howls)

353
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,359
(Running footsteps)
BJORN: Father!

354
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,922
Father!

355
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:58,855
- RAGNAR: What?
- BJORN: There's someone coming.

356
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,080
(Buzz of excited chatter)

357
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,954
CAPTAIN:
Keep steady! Take the oars!

358
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:18,042
Pull in the ropes!

359
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,253
(Buzz of excited chatter)

360
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:42,969
RAGNAR: You must believe
me, I had no idea.

361
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,070
I did not ask her to come.

362
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,327
(Sheep bleats)

363
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,736
(Low hum of chatter)

364
00:28:57,725 --> 00:29:00,928
(Excited whispers)

365
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:19,326
(Boisterous chatter)
(Music fill the hall)

366
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:24,629
(Goat bleats)

367
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:37,627
Bjorn told me that your mother
was the shield-maiden, Brunhilde,

368
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,499
of whom we've all heard?

369
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,930
It's true. Although she
died when I was very young.

370
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:44,971
And your father?

371
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,560
My father was Sigurd.

372
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,254
Sigurd...?

373
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:51,034
Just Sigurd?

374
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:54,213
ASLAUG:
No, I mean the Sigurd

375
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:57,432
who, according to the sagas,
killed the dragon Fafnir.

376
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,851
Then your father
is also a hero.

377
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:06,432
People talk about him, it's true, and
I'm proud that he was my father.

378
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:09,065
But I never knew him.

379
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,477
What about your parents?

380
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:13,856
LAGERTHA:
Hmm.

381
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,637
They were just farmers.

382
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,885
Surely nobody is
just a farmer.

383
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,168
Believe me, princess,

384
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:28,041
that is exactly what some people
are, and are happy to be.

385
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,146
Forgive me.

386
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,419
Do you remember me, Bjorn?

387
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:39,052
Do you remember we stood
in front of the Tree of Life?

388
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,316
It wasn't Yggdrasil.

389
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,292
It was just a tree.

390
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,283
ASLAUG: You're right.

391
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,634
We both know that.
It creates a bond between us.

392
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,405
BJORN:
I don't think so.

393
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,137
We don't have any bond.

394
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,505
I don't want any
bond with you.

395
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:01,052
(Uneasy silence)

396
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:12,454
BJORN: Why don't you just tell
her that she has to leave soon?

397
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:14,369
She can't stay here.

398
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:16,263
She is carrying my child.

399
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,701
She brings unhappiness
and difficulty.

400
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:22,225
Can't you see that?
Are you blind?

401
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:28,242
I know it is hard
for you to accept,

402
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,155
but unhappiness is more
common than happiness.

403
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,805
Who told you you
should be happy?

404
00:31:39,387 --> 00:31:42,205
You've come to an age
where you must be grow up

405
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:44,612
and be responsible
about such things.

406
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,177
When I was your age,
I had many friends.

407
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:51,375
All are dead.

408
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,569
The happiness is neither
here nor there.

409
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,730
SIGGY: How much do you
know about this woman?

410
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,491
Only what Bjorn told me,
which was not much.

411
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,268
He did not wish to be
disloyal to his father.

412
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,120
(Sighs heavily)

413
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,998
I did not know she was
carrying his child, though.

414
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,996
And you believe it?

415
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:19,228
LAGERTHA:
Ragnar believes it.

416
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,810
What of all her stories

417
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,655
of Brunhilde and Sigurd?

418
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,590
I suppose so. She is
clearly different from us.

419
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,240
(Women chatter nearby)

420
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,685
What are you going to do?

421
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,067
I don't know.

422
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:44,161
I must do what is
right for my son.

423
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,859
(Water splashes)

424
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:56,431
(Geese honk, people chatter)

425
00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:02,150
Oh, Floki!

426
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,458
I'm not dead yet, Bjorn.

427
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:10,438
No thanks to you, Ragnar.

428
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,719
RAGNAR: Oh.

429
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:13,911
Say what you'd
like about me,

430
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm just glad that the gods
were stupid enough to save you.

431
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:20,444
FLOKI:
The gods...

432
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:22,774
and Helga.

433
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,097
You must regain your strength.

434
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:32,723
There's much to do. A whole
fleet of boats to be built.

435
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,243
You and I have
seen nothing yet.

436
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,748
Our journeys have just begun.

437
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:40,502
FLOKI:
It's true!

438
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,514
I thought I was dead

439
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,072
and while I was dead, I was
dreaming of other places,

440
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,610
the places that you and I
shall sail to, Ragnar.

441
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:53,307
(Laboured breath)
(Exhales in pain)

442
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,796
Rest.

443
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,796
Come on, boy.

444
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:01,530
(Wind blows fiercely)

445
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:06,501
(Loud chatter fills the hall)
(Fire crackles)

446
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,174
(Doors bang open)

447
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:12,492
- BJORN: Floki!
- MAN: Hey, Floki!

448
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:15,496
- FLOKI: Hello, Bjorn.
- MAN: Floki!

449
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:19,456
(Doors latches)

450
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:23,005
(Loud chatter resumes)

451
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:42,137
(Everybody quiets down)

452
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,760
ASLAUG: I hope you will accept what
I have chosen and prepared for you?

453
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:51,834
(Hushed whispers and laughter)

454
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,473
WOMAN:
Generous!

455
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,410
I did not expect you to
go to so much trouble.

456
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,300
It is no trouble, if
it is pleasing to you.

457
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,527
(People laugh and chatter)

458
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,023
To tell you the truth,

459
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:18,334
I did not imagine
you could cook!

460
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,142
I can't. My women cooked,

461
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:23,179
I just bought the
ingredients.

462
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:31,334
Looking at both
of you here,

463
00:35:31,592 --> 00:35:33,229
in my home...

464
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:37,350
I see no reason why you two
should not get on together.

465
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:46,247
You two are very different,
yet both strong.

466
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:54,562
I have heard that similar arrangements
exist all over this country.

467
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,616
What arrangements?

468
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:07,736
That an Earl can live
with more than one woman.

469
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:13,108
In fact, it is not unusual.

470
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:18,060
It works to the
benefit of everyone,

471
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:19,986
especially the children.

472
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:28,424
Of both marriages, of course.

473
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:34,047
It's true. I know of
many such instances.

474
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:35,879
Yes.

475
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:43,297
Is that what
you're suggesting?

476
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,357
If I were,

477
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:56,391
what would you say?

478
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:09,258
I'm sorry, but this woman
is carrying my child.

479
00:37:10,455 --> 00:37:12,295
I must take care of her.

480
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
You must accept.

481
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:21,068
When we lost our
unborn son,

482
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,214
it broke my heart.

483
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:27,042
I had failed and I
will not fail again.

484
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,908
I cannot turn
this woman away.

485
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,930
I have to take
care of my child.

486
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,311
(Sighs heavily)

487
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,761
Don't forget the axe.

488
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,075
You are leaving then?

489
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,454
Of course I'm leaving.

490
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:26,724
TORSTEIN:
Is Bjorn going with you?

491
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,256
That's up to Bjorn.

492
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:43,004
Bjorn, you have a
big choice to make.

493
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:48,025
I admire your mother.
We all do.

494
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:51,394
But you have to stay
with your father.

495
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:55,290
If you don't, you will regret
it for the rest of your life.

496
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:58,402
Remember,

497
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:01,799
your father is
Ragnar Lothbrok.

498
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:13,925
(Townspeople chatter)

499
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:25,137
Bjorn.

500
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,848
You have to choose.

501
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:41,837
Say it now.

502
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:47,677
I... I choose my father.

503
00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:57,408
(Emotional)
Very well.

504
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,582
(Tearful, shaky breaths)

505
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:04,796
(Light kiss)

506
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,711
(Shaky, emotional breaths)

507
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:24,989
(Quiet whimper)

508
00:40:39,085 --> 00:40:41,353
(Shaky, emotional breaths)

509
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:45,370
(Cart rattles, tack jingles lightly)

510
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,652
(Weeping)

511
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:58,156
(Hooves thud)

512
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,246
What?

513
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:07,521
Mother's left.

514
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:11,696
(Horse whinnies)

515
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:13,151
Move!

516
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:15,199
(Hooves thud)

517
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:19,103

(Cart rattles to a stop)

520
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,123
You're really going
to abandon me...

521
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,676
without even
saying a word?

522
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:35,272
You insult and
humiliate me.

523
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:40,638
I have no choice but to
leave you and divorce you.

524
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,185
I don't want you to go.

525
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:47,627
It's fate.

526
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:54,875
(Running footsteps)

527
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:56,908
(Panting)

528
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,660
I've changed my mind.

529
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:05,825
I'm coming with you.

530
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,018

00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,597

(Shaky, emotional breath)

533
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,324

Look after your mother.

534
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:40,606
(Emotional exhale)

535
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:42,881
LAGERTHA:
Come on.

536
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,426

Move on.

537

00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,768
