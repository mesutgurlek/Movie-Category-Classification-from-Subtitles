the war is over at last.

3
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,630
We shall have
hundreds of thousands
of disbanded soldiers.

4

5

Men badly in need
of work, Mr. President.

6

Gentlemen, we have
the country to save fiirst.

7
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,236
But these men
have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.

8
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,212
Their return home
in such great numbers
might paralyze industry...

9
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,684
by furnishing suddenly a greater
supply oflabor than for which
there could be a demand.

10
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,050
Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.

11
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,056
I have read an editorial
in the Terra Haute Express...

12
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:16,585
written by Mr.John Soule,
in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''

Where there is
room for all.

14
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,298
Gentlemen, our land
stretches from an Eastern sea
to a Western sea.

15
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,033
Surely, in that vast territory,
there is a place for men
to live and work and be happy.

16
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,837
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.

17
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,574
I hope to attract our disbanded
soldiers to the hidden wealth
of our mountain ranges...

18
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,276
and to the wealth
that lies in the soil itself.

19
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,717
And to the grasslands
of the Great Plains.

20
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,986
The fields of Illinois,
the broken sod of Kansas,

21
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,994
the long furrows
of the West.

22
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,691
Yes, Mr. President,
but if only the frontier
could be made safe for the plow.

23
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,699
It must be made safe.

24
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,430
But during the war
hostile Indians massacred
our settlers there.

- Yes, Mary?

26

for the theater.

27

Gentlemen, I promised
to take Mrs. Lincoln
to Ford's Theater tonight.

tomorrow...

[ Colfax ]
I have never seen him
looking so well.

33
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,958
But the war is over,
and we have on our hands
order after order...

34
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,966
canceled by
the government.

35
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,002
Hundreds of thousands
of rifles unsold.

36
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,766
Once we were the saviors
of our country.
Now we're outcasts.

37
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,308
Our money invested
in an unsalable product.

38
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,708
But a good product, gentlemen.

39
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,975
A new repeating rifle would have
made short work of the war...

40
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,040
had it been introduced earlier.

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,418
But now the subject of guns
is an unpopular topic...

42
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,721
to those who needed them
so badly a short while ago.

43
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,819
We'll have to look to Providence
for a market.

44
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,126
Providence? Where?

45
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:04,067
I've been told that the Indians
hunt with bow and arrow.

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,231
Still, they obtain furs,
valuable buffalo hides,

47
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,605
otter, fox and beaver.

48
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,045
With our new repeating rifle--

49
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,877
Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?

50
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,680
I have every reason
to believe the Indians
will pay $1 00 for each rifle.

51
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:25,690
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece
for every cartridge.

52
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
But we can't sell rifles
to the Indians!

53
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,622
I think we can...
to peaceable Indians.

54
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,393
[ Man ]
But how--
For hunting.

55
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,926
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.

56
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,768
Won't they use those guns
against white men?

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,970
We'll get the Indians
to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!

58
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,343
But why?
It's bound to make trouble
on the frontier.

59
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,882
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right
to do it.

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,441
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.

61
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,818
They control trade
with the Indians.
They did, my friend.

62
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,950
But Indian affairs
have been taken out
of the hands of the army...

63
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,552
and given to
a civilian authority.

64

A civilian authority?
Yep,

in which we are to have
a certain participation.

Perfectly.

Yes, he's right.
Use mules.

449
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:16,035
They'll have to get by
about a thousand Cheyenne.

450
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,743
Why not send them
east of the trail
through Deep Valley?

451
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,686
Yes, and across the upper
ford of the Republican,
but who's going to guide them?

452
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,882
I haven't got a scout
who knows that territory.

453
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,723
I beg your pardon,
but Buffalo Bill Cody
just got in town.

454
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,786
Cody? Yes, he knows
the lay of that land.

455
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,492
And he's up to
all Indian tricks.

456
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,230
He's got himself a squaw.
You'll probably find him
knitting or washing dishes.

457
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:44,537
What do you mean?
He's married a ravishing
little woman from points East.

458
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,943
I don't care if
he married an Eskimo.
Tell him to come here.

459
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,244
His mind's set
on starting a hotel.

460
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,184
There's an Indian war starting.

- Suppose I go in his place?
- You're going after Yellow Hand.

464
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,756
Don't let him catch you.
He doesn't treat
his prisoners very well.

that ammunition train
is leaving before sundown.

466

Yes, sir.
And he'll be leaving with them.

Well, I'll tell ya.

I'll take that.
You've got a lot to do.

That stove smokes,
and there's no mattress on the bed.

You haven't got

This is a grand shebang.
Oh, Calamity.

492
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,492
You could stable
the queen of Sheba.
How can you say that?

493

That would make a pretty

ever wear dresses?
I might if I had one.

Have you had any experience

Is Custer sending that
ammunition to Fort Piney?

they'll get through...

Through the upper ford

Yeah. They might
get through that way.

519
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:22,088
They would get through
if Bill Cody showed them how.
There's no trail.

There are things that

to tell the living

Bill Cody knows that
as well as I do.

535
