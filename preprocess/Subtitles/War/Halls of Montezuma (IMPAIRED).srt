20
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,838
Officer: Colonel Gilfillan
will address the men.

21
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,506
Aye, aye, sir.

22
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,553
Boatswain:
Now hear this.

23
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,145
Now hear this.

24
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,589
Gilfillan: Marines,
Company B, First Battalion,

25
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,456
this is Colonel Gilfillan.

26
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,792
We're gonna be landing on
a Jap-held island before long.

27
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,524
A couple of things
I've said to you before

28
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,159
I think are worth repeating.

29
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:46,463
When you hit that beach,

30
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,733
there's gonna be a lot of
noise and smoke and confusion.

31
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:51,034
You're gonna have
to keep your eyes

32
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,541
on your squad leaders
and platoon leaders.

33
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,737
I don't want any lost
little lambs runnin' around.

34
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,609
You know where lambs end up.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,807
And let's get it straight,
this is a big island.

36
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,281
There's a lot about it
we don't know yet,

37
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,648
and a lot
we're gonna have to find out

38
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,879
from theJaps themselves.

39
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:08,014
We used to say that the only
good Jap was a dead Jap.

40
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:11,492
I'll remind you
that that's changed.

41
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,791
From here on in,

42
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:18,425
a good Jap is also a Jap
prisoner who tells us things.

43
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,025
Now, this is an order.

44
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,503
Whenever possible,
you will take prisoners.

45
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,665
I say again,
you will take prisoners.

46
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,336
Some of us were together
at Guadalcanal

47
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,969
and again at Tarawa.

48
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,775
I was proud to be with you.

49
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,679
I know it will be
the same after this.

50
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,410
Believe me,

51
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:40,081
this trip is necessary.

52
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,784
All hands, good luck.

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,851
I'll see you on the beach.

54
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,493
Wouldn't you know,
I'd get a stinkin' cold.

55
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,934
What's the matter,
Whitney?

56
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,972
I don't like the dreams
I've been having.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,803
Ah, don't let it
worry you.

58
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,365
I've landed
on 2 Jap islands,

59
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,774
and I'm still here.

60
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,210
Yeah, but this guy
I'm a replacement for,

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,804
where's he?

62
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:06,940
Got a half inch
of whiskey.

63
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:07,948
It's all I got left
in the world.

64
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,575
- You want it?
- I don't drink.

65
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,313
You will.

66
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,319
Gonna make
some more

67
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,753
the first
minute I get.

68
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,688
No, thanks,
I don't drink.

69
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,453
Okay,just take this
ashore for me.

70
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:18,551

Now, look, pal,
we've a war to fight.

89
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:57,732
Yeah, and you're
gonna fight it sober.

91
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,167
Come with me.

00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,178
Now, listen to me...
you new men...

step up here.

Don't let Slattery
give you a snow job

and get you into trouble.

96
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,682
He's got no more sense than
a setting hen in a hurricane.

97
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:23,555
That's why
he's been a private

98
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,753
longer than any man
in the Marine Corps...

99
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,887
and he'll die
a private.

100
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,194
Don't have nothin'
to do with him.

101
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,734
Except when things
get tough,

102
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,771
stick to him
like plaster.

103
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,602
The best fighting man
I know.

104
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,335
But before and after,

105
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,241
he's a no-good,

He'll be here.

Yeah, but he said he'd meet us
on the deck, like always.

Take your pack off and
loosen your leggings.

115

Did he ever miss
a train before?

comin' out of our ears.

There are no bands
playing here.

he was just as scared...

Well, speak up.

I apologize, Mr. Conroy.

150
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,450
You may sit down.

151
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:48,164
All right, Conroy,
repeat slowly after me,

152
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:52,196
hope is the mother
of all men.

153
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:58,235
Hope...is the mother...
of all men.

154
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,544
Uh, h-h-hope
is t-t-the--

155
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,549
Now, wait a minute.

156
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,882
Read that top line,
will ya?

157
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,853
The top one.

There you are.
You see?

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,239
You don't stutter as much
when you read.

163
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:28,538
No, not--
not much.

00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,408
Now, Stuart,
listen to me.

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,574
Stuttering is a matter
of conflict and fear.

166
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,675
Maybe in your case,
fear of failure.

167
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,186
Now we may not be able
to cure all of it,

168
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,085
but I'm sure we'll be able
to fix that stuttering.

169
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,590
After all, we've got
a whole year to try.

170
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,957
So let's get started.

171
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,929
Now, close your eyes and
pretend that you're all alone,

172
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,295
and you see words
in your mind--

173
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:57,236
The words, hope is
the mother of all men.

174
00:10:57,306 --> 00:11:00,764
Now, close your eyes
and read what you see.

175
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,909
Uh...

176
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,379
hope...

177
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:10,885
is...the...

178
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,581
mother...

179
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:18,991
of...all...

180
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,494
men.

181
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:23,429
It worked.

182
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,728
Good. Now,
let's try it again.

183
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:30,966
Uh, hope...
is the mother...

184
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,472
of all men.

185
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,735
Swell.

186
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,841
Mr. Principal,

187
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:42,179
members of the faculty,

188
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,583
honored guests...

189
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:03,168
fellow graduates of
the class of 1 941 --

190
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:04,933
Hope...

191
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:09,706
Hope is the mother
of all men.

192
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,713
And as we leave
these hallowed halls,

193
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:14,715
we must, each one of us,

194
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,478
fearlessly hold on
to the belief

195
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,950
in the promise
of the future.

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,716
There is no limit
to our achievement.

197
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,724
What are you thinking,
Lieutenant, that I'm a coward?

198
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,726
Is that
what you're thinking?!

199
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,713
Thinking of
dear old school days.

200
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,748
That's a laugh!

201
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,682
No! I was thinking
you handled fear once,

202
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,584
you can
handle it again.

203
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:56,283
Mr. Conroy, have you
ever had chemistry before?

204
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,620
Boatswain:
now hear this.

205
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,320
Now hear this.

206
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:02,261
All hands go to
debarkation stations.

207
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,698
All hands go to
debarkation stations.

208
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,741
Okay, Lieutenant.

209
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:18,837
Let's walk.

210
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,044
I want to tell you men

211
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,745
who've never been
in combat before

212
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,253
that it's okay to be scared.
We're all scared.

213
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:05,089
But if anybody feels
like vomiting, do it now.

214
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,165
What's holdin' us up?
Let's get rollin'.

215
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,034
How many landings
you gotta make to learn

216
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:47,630
we circle out here until
they're ready for us?

217
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,903
I'm in a hurry to get home,
that's all.

218
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,912
You and Pretty Boy
buddies, are ya?

219
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,814
Sure. We kinda
look after each other.

220
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,681
He's tough.

221
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,879
He's a nice fellow,
but he is tough.

222
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,898
Something the matter,
Lieutenant?

223
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,799
Get out of here.

224
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,638
Hey, Doc, you better
talk to Anderson.

225
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,643
He's in some kind
of pain.

226
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,372
Did he ask for me?

227
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,379
No.

228
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,380
Then let me alone.

229
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,381
But, Doc, I--

230
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,439
If he needs me,
he'll ask for me.

231
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:31,643
Now, look, Doc,
I'm an old friend of his.

232
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,846
Let me alone,
I told you.

233
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:43,991
Doc: I'd do anything
for Anderson,

234
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,225
but it ain't up to me.

235
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,461
I ought to be on my farm
where I belong,

236
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:50,560
working with cows.

237
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:54,233
It's easy to figure
right and wrong with cows.

238
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,948
That's a honey of a pipe,
Lieutenant.

239
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,643
Say, thanks a lot.

240
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,116
Forget it, Doc.

241
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,346
The principal of
my old school sent it to me.

242
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,616
I don't smoke pipes.

243
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,715
Hey, uh...

244
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:15,159
you did a fine job getting
that plasma into me at Tarawa.

245
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:16,457
Forget it, sir.

246
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,795
The medical brass say I'll
be out of here pretty soon.

247
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,129
Hey, that's fine,
Lieutenant.

248
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,634
Yeah.

249
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:23,795
Sit down.

250
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,806
Go ahead,
it's all right.

251
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,275
There's an old witch
of a nurse out there

252
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:33,313
with an ear like radar and
a tongue like a fire bell.

253
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,972
Heh heh.

254
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:42,651
You know what
psychological migraine is?

255
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:43,655
A lot of pain
in the head,

256
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,986
no functional
disorder.

257
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,152
Heh heh, for a guy
who was a manure spreader

258
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,923
in South Dakota 3 years ago,
you're pretty hep.

259
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:51,692
Well, I always wanted
to be a doctor.

260
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,392
You know where
a migraine comes from?

261
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,733
I ain't that hep,
Lieutenant.

262
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,795
It comes from being scared
too many times

263
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,669
and wanting to run away...

264
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,868
and not running away.

265
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:04,376
I got it.

266
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,379
What do the doctors say?

267
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,109
I haven't told them.
I'm not going to.

268
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,946
I want you to see
that I'm supplied

269
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,820
with enough of these
to keep me going.

270
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,223
If the lieutenant will
excuse the expression,

271
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,895
the lieutenant
is a 5-star fool.

272
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,699
You have a chance to
go back to the states,

273
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:33,797
don't you want to live?

274
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,933
The gentleman on
the middle aisle says no.

275
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,567
Oh...

276
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,475
that's
no explanation.

277
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:40,478
What about
the future?

278
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:41,479
What about
your teaching?

279
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,606
Heh.

280
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,548
Yeah, I used to get
a bang standing up there,

281
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,552
pretending to know
all the answers.

282
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,453
But now?
Teach high school boys

283
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:53,015
the bright new world
of science after this?

284
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,152
Oh, Doc, you can have
the future for peanuts.

285
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,161
Listen, if you think
the future--

286
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,162
I had 44 men
in my platoon

287
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,664
when I started out
on the Canal.

288
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,962
Now I've got
37 replacements.

289
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,002
I believe in nothing
but the survivors.

290
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,059
Listen,
about the future, you--

291
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,628
Pigeon Lane, Slattery,
Pretty Boy, Coffman,

292
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:06,900
Conroy, Zelenko,
and you,

293
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:09,408
you're all I've got left
in the world.

294
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,467
I want to stay out here
till I'm dead...

295
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,877
or till we're all dead.

296
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,953
Now, how about
these painkillers?

297
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,614
It ain't gonna
help you very much.

298
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,850
They're only temporary.

299
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,187
Ha, so am I.

300
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,854
Listen, about this
psychological migraine,

301
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,157
I know
that it's something

302
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,197
you've got to
beat down by yourself

303
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:32,197
without medicine.

304
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,198
Yes or no, Doc?

305
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,199
If you don't solve
your own problems,

306
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,235
you're gonna be like
a full-grown man

307
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,530
hangin' on to your
mama's apron strings.

308
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:38,730
Yes or no?

309
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:39,898
Is that an order?

310
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,974
No.

311
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,101
Okay, I'll do it.

312
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,080
Thanks.

313
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:49,809
Yeah, but you're wrong
about the future.

314
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:52,776
Well, I was a farmer.

315
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:53,820
If we didn't believe
in the future,

316
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,320
we'd never grow wheat
to make the bread.

317
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,357
Oh, beat it, Doc.
I'm tired.

318
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,654
Oh, sorry. I--

319
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:02,990
So long.

320
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,133
Oh, hello, Doc.

321
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,499
What's the matter,
you sick?

322
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,764
No, I came to see
the lieutenant.

323
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,830
Anderson: Hi, Coffman.
Come on in.

00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,202
Coffman: Lieutenant, I--
I brought you a book.

325
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,370
Oh, thanks.

326
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:21,437
Thanks very much.

327
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:22,812
Uh, Lieutenant, I--

328
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,248
I just dropped by
to thank you.

329
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:25,307
For what?

330
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,649
For pullin' me out of
the drink at Tarawa.

331
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,618
I pulled no one out
of the drink at Tarawa.

332
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,659
[Buzz]

333
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:33,624
But, Lieutenant,
they told me that you--

334
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:34,626
Forget it, Coffman,
in this war,

335
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,356
everybody's
a lifesaver.

336
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,057
But, Lieutenant,
a man saves your life,

337
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,120
it's only decent
to thank him.

338
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,860
Forget it.

339
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,631
What is this,
a clambake?

340
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,940
The old witch, huh?

341
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:50,306
Heh.

342
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:52,477
I see
the lieutenant's

343
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,945
been complaining
about me again.

344
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,379
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

345
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,679
He spoke
very highly of you.

346
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,946
You're a liar. Oh!

347
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,952
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,215
Oh.

349
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,431
What's the matter,
Doc?

350
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,527
You nervous?
You dropped your pipe.

351
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:20,095
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

352
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,338
Doc: did I do
the right thing?

353
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:27,675
Shouldn't I have told
the doctors?

354
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,010
How can he go on
fighting this war

355
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,947
with his head in a vise?

356
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,010
I feed him the pills, and
he keeps gettin' the pain.

Yes, sir?

00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,339
Yes, sir.

362
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay, that's all.

363
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:51,594

the line of departure.

You want me
to get killed?

got to get killed.

Zelenko said to stick
to you like plaster.

here at the ridge. Over.

What's in front of you? Over.

385
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:14,554
2 pillboxes, maybe
half dozen machine guns.

We need tanks.
Need 'em bad. Over and out.

It's 4 days.

4 days, a week?

for the admiral?

with the navy.

Heh heh,
well, some joke.

442
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,789
Yes, it is.
I was fightin' in L.A.

443
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,390
In January 1 942...

444
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,335
and a marine colonel
asked me

445
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,895
if I'd put on
an exhibition for them.

446
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,167
So I did.

447
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,802
I was walking around camp,
the general comes up to me,

448
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:05,281
and he says, "" Hey, you know,
we can use a fighter like you

449
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,976
to teach our fellas
how to box.""

450
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,519
I said, "" Me?""

451
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,851
He said, ""Sure.""

452
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,792
He says, ""You can box,
get all the fighting you want.""

453
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,797
So I joined.

454
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,856

but...

to get killed, maybe?

461
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,350
I'm just in a hurry
to get home, that's all.

462
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,414
What are they gonna do
when you get home,

463
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:49,152
give you a big parade?

one at a time.

my hands on thatJap.

gonna be a nobody.

Get him. You'll find him
in a saloon somewhere.

Your sister
was married last week.

Okay. Okay for her.

You keep your mouth
shut about this,

495

or they'll ride us
out of town

I won't let 'em!

be a nobody.

They'll do whatever
I tell 'em.

503

about me or my sister,

and they'll cut
his tongue out.

505

I gotta learn how
to do things smart.

506

Gotta learn.

507
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:10,451
Gotta learn with this.

508
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,188

Don't you say
I'm gonna be a nobody.

Why don't you leave
the kid alone?

516
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,666
He gets on my nerves.
Big talk. Big wind.

517
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:07,731
He saved my life.

518
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,710
His life's
worth saving, too.

he's not.

I know that.
You all know that.

What you don't know
is why.

522
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:19,283
It's because
he hates what he is.

523

How you doing, kid?

524

Oh, look, now,

I didn't mean
to hit you like that,

but I can't
let you get killed.

Well, what's so special
about them?

535
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,272
They've ordered us

to take them
before lunch.

Lieutenant,

00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:42,776
for us to pull back
to the ridge and dig in.

get back of that ridge!

You don't need a special

Yeah, you got it,

Don't worry about
the apron strings, Doc.

I told you
I'm not going home.

Lieutenant,

570
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,264
the company passed
the word down

for us to dig in.

572

We're convinced that's where
the rockets are coming from.

575

What's the matter, Doc?

00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:57,979
Nothing's
the matter.

577
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:01,788
Dickerman asked
for this pencil.

I gotta get the C.P.

00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:28,949
You think this stuffll

00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:29,985
really do the trick,
Lieutenant?

589
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:31,246
Oh, the Nips
don't have rockets.

590
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,810
They're just
kidding around.

pestering everybody.

This is Andy!

629
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,395
Was it you who said the Nips
don't have any rockets?

630
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:09,081
All right, we learned
that the hard way.

631
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,709
Don't waste time saying
we should have known.

632
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,184
Question is,
where are the rockets?

633
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:16,017
Where?

634
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,320
Sir, if my memory
serves me right,

635
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:22,418
the rocket is
a high-angle fire weapon

636
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:25,953
designed primarily to fire
over mountains and ridges.

637
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:28,626
Therefore, my guess
is that the rockets

638
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,670
are located on the reverse
slopes of the hill.

639
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:33,001
Sergeant Dickerman,
for your private information,

640
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,200
I'm well aware of what
the rocket is designed for.

641
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,775
For hours we've been pounding
those reverse slopes

642
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,284
with everything we've got.

643
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:48,253
So far we haven't
touched them.

644
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,881
Why? Where are they?!

645
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:52,891
Does the colonel
have a theory?

646
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:59,228
I sent out a patrol
instructed to take prisoners.

647
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,233
They killed Nips
and no prisoners.

648
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:03,269
When are these men
going to understand

649
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:04,598
the importance
of liveJaps?

650
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,003
You can't teach men
to hate and kill, Colonel,

651
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:08,802
then suddenly
teach them not to kill.

652
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,399
We teach them
to follow orders.

653
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:11,910
Colonel, may I suggest

654
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:13,445
that with the right kind
of indoctrination--

655
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:14,912
Sergeant Dickerman,
you're what's known

656
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:17,779
as a combat
correspondent.

657
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:18,943
Yes, sir.

658
00:47:19,018 --> 00:47:20,417
And since this is
your first combat,

659
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:21,954
I suggest you
correspond.

660
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,181
Don't worry yourself
about things

661
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:24,587
that don't concern you.

662
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:26,648
Sir, I'm concerned
about everything.

663
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:29,957
This war is as much
mine as yours.

664
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,291
We did get one Nip,
Colonel.

665
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:32,524
Charlie company found him

666
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,725
wandering around
about an hour ago.

667
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,767
What's the scoop on him?

668
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:36,324
I passed the word on
to regiment, sir,

669
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:37,995
and they said for us
to work him over.

670
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,096
SergeantJohnson's outside
questioning him now.

671
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:41,765
See what he's found out.

672
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:52,776
Now, rockets
or no rockets,

673
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,116
we've been ordered
to secure these hills.

674
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:57,952
It's 025 5 now.

675
00:47:58,024 --> 00:48:00,015
We jump off at 1 200.

676
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:02,493
That's exactly 9 hours
and 5 minutes from now.

677
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:05,622
Any comments?

678
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:07,825
If we try to take
those hills, Colonel,

679
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:09,766
the whole battalion
will be wiped out.

680
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:12,771
Unless we find a way to
wipe out the rockets first.

681
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,101
The general made this
our baby,

682
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,505
and we're gonna see
that it's well-diapered,

683
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,564
or you--

684
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,907
He'll be right in,
sir.

685
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,210
Johnson.

686
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:26,217
Yes, sir.

687
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,257
Well, any resemblance
of your present attire

688
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:38,889
to a marine uniform is--

689
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,125
You're impossible!

690
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,167
Yes, sir.

691
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:42,326
The colonel knows
it's a mistake

692
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:44,233
to let war interfere
with one's personal comfort.

693
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:46,272
Get rid of that
cigarette holder.

694
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:49,797
The colonel knows it's
the only way I enjoy smoking.

695
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,036
What about the Nip?

696
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,134
The Nip was in a cave

697
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:54,544
cut off by our artillery
from his own forces,

698
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:57,674
bypassed by us.
Rather unpopular, I think.

699
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,241
Last night he tried to make
contact with his blokes,

700
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,117
but ran into
Charlie Company.

701
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:04,418
He says the men he left
behind--1 0 of them--

702
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:06,857
Have been commanded to hold on
and fight to the death,

703
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,154
but they're
pretty well gone now,

704
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:11,197
and he rather guesses they'll
be willing to surrender.

705
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,231
Where's the cave?

706
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:14,289
The approximate position--
may I, sir?--

707
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,165
Is-- Is here.

708
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:18,704
What about the rockets?

709
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,068
He knows nothing
about them,

710
00:49:20,139 --> 00:49:21,572
but he thinks
maybe his friends do.

711
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:24,804
I've persuaded him
to guide a patrol for us.

712
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,039
What do you think, Mac?

713
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:28,705
Why, I rather think we
ought to take him up on it.

714
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:29,805
I didn't ask you.

715
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,544
Well, why not? I'm
an expert on theJapanese.

716
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:33,347
That's the only reason
you're not in the brig.

717
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:35,353
Well?

718
00:49:35,421 --> 00:49:37,582
Sir, to me it don't
look kosher.

719
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:40,148
He's persuaded the Nip
to guide us to the cave,

720
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:41,659
but remember
what happened

721
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,389
1 2 August
on Guadalcanal.

722
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:45,727
Remember Colonel Goettge's
patrol?

723
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:48,665
He was informed someJaps
wanted to surrender, too.

724
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,532
So he went out
to bring them in.

725
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:52,366
25 marines
went with him.

726
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:54,633
Only 3 came back.

727
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:55,867
Colonel,
it's an ambush.

728
00:49:55,942 --> 00:50:00,811
It's a dead certainty,
and I mean dead.

729
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,812
Joe?

730
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:05,817
Well, it's
a big risk.

731
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:07,318
What else is
there to do?

732
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:10,814
Frank?

733
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,357
Maybe we invest
6 men.

734
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,154
Maybe we save
600.

735
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:16,487
Lieutenant Butterfield?

736
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,662
In my opinion, sir,

737
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:20,323
they sent this Nip over
to suck us in.

738
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,992
The lieutenant
doesn't make sense.

739
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:23,660
Sergeant, you're
way off base.

740
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:25,328
Sergeant, this war isn't
gonna last forever, and--

741
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:26,667
It's a nice
thought, sir.

742
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,829
Colonel?

743
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,341
There may be an ambush.
I don't know.

744
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,843
But this Nip
isn't in on it.

745
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:33,344
He's tired,
and he's hungry,

746
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:35,176
and, well, he wants
to live and go home,

747
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:37,341
like the rest of us.

748
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,180
Stinkin' cold!

749
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:44,022
It'll take us
about 2, 2 1 /2 hours

750
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,684
to get in there.
Anybody got a match?

751
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,192
Sir, if there's
gonna be a patrol,

752
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:49,455
I'd like to--

753
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:50,860
Joe, you got some experienced
scouts in your company.

754
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,194
Yes, sir. That's why I
asked Lieutenant Anderson

755
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:54,198
to come over.

756
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:55,199
Anderson?

757
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,366
Well, it's
the same old question...

758
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,531
gambling
the lives of a few

759
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:01,972
against the lives
of many.

760
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,039
I want you to take out
a small patrol.

761
00:51:07,113 --> 00:51:08,478
Use this Jap
as a guide,

762
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,311
and Johnson here'll
go along to interpret.

763
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:12,650
Hello.

764
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:13,708
Sir.

765
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:15,378
Now, I want prisoners.
You understand me?

766
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:16,945
No ""yes, buts...""
and ""howevers.""

767
00:51:17,023 --> 00:51:17,955
Aye, sir.

768
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,651
McCreavy, bring
that Nip in here.

769
00:51:22,228 --> 00:51:23,991
Can you fire
an M-1 ?

770
00:51:24,063 --> 00:51:25,325
I shot expert, sir.

771
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:26,990
Take this writer
along with you.

772
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:29,500
He's pining to get
his head blown off.

773
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:30,831
I suppose
I'll be the villain

774
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,837
of your great
American war novel.

775
00:51:32,905 --> 00:51:33,837
Well, sir--

776
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:34,838
Don't tell me.

777
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:36,932
Jump off
as soon as possible.

778
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,841
You've got 8 hours
and 5 5 minutes.

779
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:40,503
I'll lay a harassing fire
on the cave area.

780
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,842
Let me know when
you want it lifted.

781
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:43,176
Yes, sir. Uh...

782
00:51:43,249 --> 00:51:45,513
do I have to take
the sergeant along?

783
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:46,677
Up to you.

784
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:48,015
Oh, take him along,
Lieutenant.

785
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:49,179
It isn't every patrol

786
00:51:49,255 --> 00:51:50,847
that has its own
private historian.

787
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:52,540
Here's your Nip,
Anderson.

788
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:57,143
<i>Shimpai shinai de</i>.

789
00:51:57,211 --> 00:51:58,303
Old Willie here
doesn't look

790
00:51:58,379 --> 00:51:59,971
like a decoy,
now, does he?

791
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:06,746

792
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:08,755

[Cough]

794
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,417
Well, if that's
all, Colonel,

795
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:15,757
I'll be
seeing you.

796
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,762
That's all.

797
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:17,763
Okay,Johnson.

00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:18,764
<i>Iko!</i>

799
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,765

let's go.

800
00:52:21,002 --> 00:52:21,934
Anderson.

801
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:23,595
Yes, sir?

802
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:25,263
Don't cut your corners
too sharp.

803
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:26,431
Good luck.

804
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:27,906
Thank you, sir.

805
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:32,604
And, uh...

806
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,944
I hope your cold
gets better.

through with it.

970
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:38,977
Whitney.

971
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,310
<i>Omae wa dare da?</i>

972
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:42,474
Oh, you're right.

973
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,847
He's too frightened
to know anything.

974
01:04:43,918 --> 01:04:44,850
Yeah.

975
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:46,750
Have Doc
take a look at him.

976
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:51,716
Well, we've got 5,
maybe 1 0 minutes

977
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,225
so start working
on the Nips.

978
01:04:53,294 --> 01:04:54,818
If we get any dope
on the rockets,

979
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:55,862
we can radio back.

980
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,490
Oh. Here's a map
I took off the captain.

981
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:00,659
Okay.

982
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,929
Duncanon,
search the dead.

983
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:05,062
Lane, you can
give him a hand.

984
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,333
I want all diaries
and maps.

985
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:07,533
Step on it. Let's go.

986
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,972
How's he doin'?

987
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,278
I don't know.

988
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,749
Whitney,
you set up here.

989
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,317
We're going to have to wait
till those mortars lift,

990
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:29,987
if they don't
take too long.

991
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,265
Picked up
your carbine

992
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:34,494
and your radio,
Lieutenant.

993
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:35,660
Mm-hmm.

994
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:36,964
And that's not all.

995
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:41,136
Now find a spot
where that radio will work...

996
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:46,044
without getting
your head blown off.

997
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,877
Johnson: Lieutenant,
I think I got something.

998
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,576
Slattery:
Pansy baker. Pansy baker.

999
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,583
What's up?

1000
01:05:51,652 --> 01:05:53,051
Take a look at this map.

1001
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,678
Now, according
to Colonel Gilfillan,

1002
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,188
the rockets are coming
from the general direction

1003
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:57,588
of these hills.

1004
01:05:57,658 --> 01:06:00,024
Here's a sugar cane field
next to them.

1005
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,425
Fukado.

1006
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:02,985
This man was in
an infantry company

1007
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:05,174
ticked off
to defend that field.

1008
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:06,331
He didn't see any rockets,

1009
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:08,775
but he did see a couple
of hundred coolie carts,

1010
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:10,505
and they all had
grooved wheels.

1011
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,911
So what?

1012
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:15,007
Coolie carts seldom have
grooved wheels.

1013
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:16,881
What does that suggest
to you, Lieutenant?

1014
01:06:16,952 --> 01:06:18,783
I don't know.
A railroad, I suppose.

1015
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:21,015
Well, what would a railroad
be doing in this wilderness?

1016
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,853
Look, if you've got
any ideas, spill them.

1017
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,620
We've no time
for guessing games.

1018
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:27,594
Well, it could be a railroad
carrying rocket shells.

1019
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:31,190
Mm-hmm...
or sugar cane.

1020
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:32,495
Slattery: I've got
the company, Lieutenant.

1021
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:34,502
Hold them.

1022
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,537
All right.

1023
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:37,071
See if you can get
some confirmation

1024
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,401
on your wacky idea

1025
01:06:38,474 --> 01:06:40,032
while I pass
the word on.

1026
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,382
This is Andy.

1027
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:56,186
Find target area 2-7-4,
Love and Mike.

1028
01:06:56,258 --> 01:06:59,489
West of hills.
Sugar cane field.

1029
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:04,294
<i>Oi, honto</i>
<i>no koto ie</i>.

1030
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:05,333
Tobacco, sir.

1031
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,392
I tell very good truth
for tobacco.

1032
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,664
Oh, you speak
English, huh?

1033
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,295
Oh, very good English,
sir.

1034
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:11,498
You see, before war,

1035
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,202
I am Tokyo guide
for American.

1036
01:07:14,276 --> 01:07:15,641
I am called Romeo.

1037
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:17,679
I buy everything
for Americans:

1038
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:20,078
kimono, painting, girl.

1039
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,343
I am very good man.

1040
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,384
Well, Romeo,
how long have you

1041
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:23,440
been on this island?

1042
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,079
Maybe a year
before you come.

1043
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:27,122
What's your work?

1044
01:07:27,189 --> 01:07:30,488
I tell truth.
I am truck driver.

1045
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,187
This is a big
sugar cane field here.

1046
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,696
Did you ever truck
things up there?

1047
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:37,891
What things?

1048
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,663
Maybe I have tobacco
for later, huh, sir?

1049
01:07:40,736 --> 01:07:42,829
Yeah.

1050
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:44,998
A whole pack.

1051
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:47,065
Oh, I be very good
to American.

1052
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:48,700
I buy kimono,
painting--

1053
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:50,802
Yeah. What did you
carry in the trucks?

1054
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,677
Concrete.

1055
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:56,184
Small rail. Big rail.
Little rail.

1056
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,049
Little engine also.

1057
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,109
What did they do
with them?

1058
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:00,849
I no know.

1059
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:04,022
The mortars have lifted.
Let's get out of here,

1060
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:05,025
on the double.

1061
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:06,391
Slattery, take the point.

1062
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:08,453
Whitney, you cover
the left flank.

1063
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,294
Dickerman,
stick with Zelenko.

1064
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,095
Doc, you nursemaid grandpa.

1065
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,429
Conroy, go with Slattery.

1066
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:17,433
Lane, you bring up
the rear.

1067
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:19,406
Duncanon, you cover
the right flank.

1068
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:20,772
Johnson, get those
Nips of yours

1069
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:22,071
to make a litter
for the officer.

1070
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:23,111
- Hurry it up.
- What did they say

1071
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:24,167
about the sugar cane field,
Lieutenant?

1072
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,178
Wrong spot.

1073
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:26,179
They say they've
blasted that field

1074
01:08:26,248 --> 01:08:27,272
from beer
to breakfast.

1075
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,577
The rockets
are still coming in.

1076
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:30,346
Okay.
We'll start back

1077
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:32,444
on a first leg
of 67 degrees

1078
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:34,682
till we hit
Susana Creek.

1079
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:36,156
6 hours left.

1080
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:38,716
We got to get back
in 3.

1081
01:08:38,794 --> 01:08:39,818
Where you going?

1082
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:40,827
I forgot my sword
and pistol.

1083
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:42,363
There's no time
for souvenirs.

1084
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:44,023
You've got your orders.
Get going!

1085
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,031
Yes, sir.

1086
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,533
All right,
let's walk.

1087
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:50,095
Would have brought
a pretty drop.

1088
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:43,752
This looks like
the best place to cross.

1089
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:44,815
Conroy,
you get over first.

1090
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:45,951
Look around.
We'll cover you.

1091
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:47,996
Slattery, you get the B.A.R.s
into position.

1092
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:49,724
Have the rest stand fast.
Hurry it up.

1093
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:55,136
Conroy's going across.
Cover him.

1094
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:57,536
Hold fast.

1095
01:09:57,606 --> 01:10:01,201
Conroy's going across.
Cover him.

1096
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:02,208
Hold fast.

1097
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,541
Okay, now.

1098
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:11,645
You're rear guard...

1099
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:13,238
and don't cross
till I signal.

1100
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:48,450
Anderson:
hold it up.

1101
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:49,643
Hold it up.
Hold it up.

1102
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,530
Anderson:
Snipers! Take cover!

1103
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:13,841
All right, into that gully.
Let's go!

1104
01:12:36,598 --> 01:12:39,965
Lane. Lane, you stay here
with the prisoners.

1105
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,469
Doc, Dickerman,
up on the road.

1106
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:43,698
Keep your eye out
for the flank.

1107
01:12:43,772 --> 01:12:46,332
The rest of us'll get after
those snipers. Let's go.

1108
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,519
Zelenko, you nuts?

1109
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:16,491
Lane, watch Zelenko.
Keep him with you.

1110
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,192
Aah!

1111
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:29,489
Hyah!

1112
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,105
Hyah!

1113
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:46,506
Aah!

1114
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,580
Water.

1115
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,953
Water,
please.

1116
01:14:54,024 --> 01:14:56,424
Water.

1117
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,482
Water.

1118
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,051
Give him some water,
Pidge.

1119
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,563
Fresh out.

1120
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,064
Well,
go get him some.

1121
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:20,741
Who is it?

1122
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:32,858
Pidge?

1123
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,590
They all gotta die.

1124
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:37,565
Pretty Boy,
are you nuts?

1125
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:38,601
After all we've
gone through

1126
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:39,794
to get
these prisoners?

1127
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,496
They all gotta die!

1128
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,436
Get back. Pidge!

1129
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:47,202
Okay, Tojo.

1130
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:48,471
You're first!

1131
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,103
No, Pretty Boy.

1132
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,875
Don't make me
shoot you.

1133
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,006
Pidge!

1134
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,278
Bugs and lice!

1135
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,751
They'll save the lives
of our own men, you fool!

1136
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:59,755
Pidge!

1137
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:00,790
They all gotta die!

1138
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:02,484
What are you trying
to do, Pretty Boy?

1139
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:06,188
He wants to kill
the prisoners, Pidge.

1140
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:07,991
Oh, don't, Pretty Boy.
Don't.

1141
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,033
I can't let you
do that.

1142
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:13,433
They stink.
They crawl.

1143
01:16:13,503 --> 01:16:14,902
They all
gotta die.

1144
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:16,734
Now, don't do it,
Pretty Boy.

1145
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,171
I don't like them
any more than you do,

1146
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,209
but we've got
to follow orders.

1147
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,335
Come on.
Drop your gun.

1148
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,184
Sit down over there.

1149
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,896
What'd you do,
you crazy punk?

1150
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,400
What'd you do?

1151
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,772
You dope! Why did you
pull the rifle?

1152
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,673
Pretty Boy.

1153
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,939
Kill 'em for me,
will ya?

1154
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:04,683
Doc!

1155
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:07,655
They ain't gonna
drive me out of town.

1156
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,022
I'll-- I'll cut
their tongues out.

1157
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,355
I didn't mean it,
Pretty Boy.

1158
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:12,451
You--you pulled
the rifle.

1159
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:14,224
It-it-it
was an accident.

1160
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,060
Kill them for me,
Pidge.

1161
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,827
You're my friend.

1162
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:19,892
I-I'm a big shot
in my town.

1163
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,233
Don't you forget it.

1164
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:26,833
You shouldn't have
pulled the rifle!

1165
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:27,842
Pidge.

1166
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:32,608
I don't want to die.

1167
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,116
I don't want to die.

1168
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,875
Come on, men.
Hurry it up.

1169
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:12,854
Conroy, you and Whitney
pull in Doc and that writer.

1170
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,048
They're down on the road.

1171
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,818
And snap it up. We're late.

1172
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:16,824
Come on.

1173
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:41,644
Who else got it?

1174
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,618
I killed him.

1175
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:45,449
What?

1176
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:46,579
I murdered him.

1177
01:18:46,656 --> 01:18:49,147
No. He didn't do it,
Lieutenant.

1178
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,590
I heard it.

1179
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,094
Pretty Boy
blew his top.

1180
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,891
He wanted to kill
the prisoners.

1181
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,626
Pidge did it
in the line of duty.

1182
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,031
I'm a murderer.

1183
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:00,899
He pulled
my rifle.

1184
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,267
All right! Shut up!

1185
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:09,436
Is that the way
it happened?

1186
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:10,945
Yes, sir.

1187
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,444
Sir, he was just
a mixed-up kid. I...

1188
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:20,847
I could've
straightened him out

1189
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:25,224
if I'd only had
a little more time.

1190
01:19:25,295 --> 01:19:27,627
He was gonna be
my fight manager.

1191
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:31,898
For a bunch
of crummyJaps.

1192
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:33,959
Take it easy.
I liked Pretty Boy, too,

1193
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:36,801
but he disobeyed orders.

1194
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:39,603
It happens sometimes.

1195
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,769
Not often,
but it happens.

1196
01:19:45,682 --> 01:19:49,948
Slattery,
you and Johnson bury him.

1197
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:51,247
I'm sorry to hurry, Lane,

1198
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:52,879
but we gotta get
out of here fast.

1199
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:55,550
I'll bury him myself.

1200
01:19:57,694 --> 01:19:59,915
You won't lose any time,
Lieutenant.

1201
01:20:22,604 --> 01:20:25,471
Doc: Now I can go back
to being a farmer.

1202
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:27,441
Dickerman:
sure you can.

1203
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:29,272
Fine corpsman I am.

1204
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:33,140
Hey, I-I ain't
supposed to be

1205
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:34,273
on the receiving end.

1206
01:20:34,349 --> 01:20:35,941
Take it easy,
Doc. Don't talk.

1207
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,817
You like Anderson?

1208
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:41,651
Yeah.

1209
01:20:41,723 --> 01:20:44,886
I've known him
from the beginning.

1210
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,190
He is the best.

1211
01:20:47,262 --> 01:20:48,627
I'll take your
word for it,

1212
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:50,324
but relax now,
will ya?

1213
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,425
Okay. I'm okay.

1214
01:20:56,905 --> 01:21:01,069
Men like Anderson
gotta live and go home,

1215
01:21:01,143 --> 01:21:02,974
tell them what it's like.

1216
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:04,706
Please, Doc, huh?

1217
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,840
I am a corpsman, right?

1218
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,679
Right. Then I know
my condition.

1219
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,611
Well, will you talk
to him about it,

1220
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,714
sometime?

1221
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,960
You speak his language,
being a writer.

1222
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,791
Sure. Yeah.

1223
01:21:21,863 --> 01:21:23,455
I...

1224
01:21:23,532 --> 01:21:25,557
I put down on paper

1225
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:29,331
something I've been trying
to tell the lieutenant.

1226
01:21:29,404 --> 01:21:30,530
It ain't finished,

1227
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:33,234
but will you
take a look at it?

1228
01:21:33,308 --> 01:21:35,299
Maybe fix it up?

1229
01:21:35,377 --> 01:21:37,402
You know what I mean.
Being a writer, you know.

1230
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:40,505
Okay, but pipe down
now, huh?

1231
01:21:40,582 --> 01:21:42,413
Pipe.

1232
01:21:42,484 --> 01:21:44,111
Pipe.

1233
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:49,889
It's Doc.

1234
01:22:02,337 --> 01:22:04,134
How bad is it?

1235
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:06,071
He'll be okay, I think.

1236
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:12,680
Hold it.

1237
01:22:15,817 --> 01:22:18,377
Doc, what are you
trying to pull?

1238
01:22:18,453 --> 01:22:19,818
You can't--

1239
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,152
Dead?

1240
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:30,823
Yeah. Why not?

1241
01:22:32,901 --> 01:22:33,833
Bury him quick.

1242
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:35,836
We gotta get out
of here fast.

1243
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,574
What happened?

1244
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:46,273
Will someone tell me
what happened?

1245
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:47,975
It's poor old Doc.

1246
01:23:03,598 --> 01:23:05,532
What's the matter
with you guys?

1247
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,467
Get on with it!
We gotta walk.

1248
01:23:08,537 --> 01:23:11,836
Someone get the dead men's
personal effects.

1249
01:23:11,907 --> 01:23:14,467
Someone take a compass
reading of this place.

1250
01:23:14,543 --> 01:23:17,171
We'll have to notify
the graves registration.

1251
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:19,406
And someone take
their weapons and ammo.

1252
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,768
My patrol has just been
reported in, sir.

1253
01:24:14,836 --> 01:24:16,963
[Explosions]

1254
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,238
Yes, Colonel.
I know what time it is.

1255
01:24:24,746 --> 01:24:26,475
Aye, aye, sir.

1256
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:34,088
[Explosions]

1257
01:24:35,424 --> 01:24:39,292
Between this stinking cold
and those stinking rockets,

1258
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:42,091
I'm gonna end up
a mental case!

1259
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,495
Well, where's that patrol?

1260
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:45,829
It was reported in
1 0 minutes ago.

1261
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,114
Anderson,
what's the scoop?

1262
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:08,952
We got 4 prisoners
for you

1263
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:10,457
and a shell-shocked
old man.

1264
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:12,550
These are their
effects.

1265
01:25:12,627 --> 01:25:15,027
I lost 2 men.

1266
01:25:15,096 --> 01:25:17,963
One of them
was a corpsman...

1267
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:20,627
C.E. "" Doc"" Jones.

1268
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:27,572
Anything
on the rockets?

1269
01:25:27,642 --> 01:25:29,132
No, sir.

1270
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:31,804
We've bombed and shelled

1271
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,871
every inch of those
reverse slopes,

1272
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:35,541
and they're still
comin'.

1273
01:25:40,622 --> 01:25:42,749
McCreavy, start
interrogating thoseJaps.

1274
01:25:42,824 --> 01:25:44,587
And don't forget time, time,
time is the essence.

1275
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:46,593
All we got
are 90 minutes.

1276
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:49,425
All right, sir.
Paskowicz. Davis.

1277
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:51,591
Colonel,
I'd like to get back

1278
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:53,600
to my men
as soon as possible.

1279
01:25:53,668 --> 01:25:55,602
No. Work with Mac
and that fantasticJohnson.

1280
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,967
You know the prisoners.

1281
01:25:57,038 --> 01:25:59,233
Yes, sir.Johnson's
already at work.

1282
01:26:02,777 --> 01:26:03,937
Anderson.

1283
01:26:04,012 --> 01:26:05,206
Yes, sir?

1284
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:10,812
Thanks.
That was a good job.

1285
01:26:10,886 --> 01:26:12,080
Thank you, sir.

1286
01:26:19,194 --> 01:26:19,628
Johnson:
You must put your mind

1287
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:21,118
Johnson:
You must put your mind

1288
01:26:21,196 --> 01:26:22,629
on different thoughts,
captain.

1289
01:26:22,697 --> 01:26:24,130
When the war's over,

1290
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:26,133
you can go back
and rebuild your country.

1291
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:28,999
You've much to live for.
You'll live well.

1292
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:31,834
Sergeant, you seem
to have forgotten

1293
01:26:31,907 --> 01:26:34,000
that for generations

1294
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:36,134
my people think
not of living well

1295
01:26:36,211 --> 01:26:37,974
but of dying well.

1296
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:40,640
Have you not studied
our philosophy,

1297
01:26:40,715 --> 01:26:43,047

1298
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:45,313

1299
01:26:45,387 --> 01:26:47,014
Do you not remember

1300
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:49,318
that we always
take the obvious

1301
01:26:49,391 --> 01:26:51,256
and reverse it?

1302
01:26:51,326 --> 01:26:54,159
So, reverse
the role of life.

1303
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:58,325
To us, it is death
that is desirable.

1304
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,369
It is the source
of our strength.

1305
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:03,028
Do not say to me

1306
01:27:03,104 --> 01:27:05,766
that I have
anything to live for.

1307
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,432
And now, Sergeant,

1308
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:10,137
I believe I know what
information you are seeking.

1309
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:11,906
Will you help us?

1310
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,948
Go... bring
commissioned officer.

1311
01:27:14,015 --> 01:27:15,778
Well,
I'm the expert here,

1312
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:18,466
but this is no time
to stand on pride.

1313
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:21,894
How's it going,
Johnson?

1314
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:22,901
Oh, pretty good, sir.

1315
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,562
Lieutenant,
the captain just told me

1316
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,402
he's willing to talk...
but to an officer.

1317
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:27,406
Good.

1318
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,303

The boys
are aiming better.

1321
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,119
What's happened
to him?

1322
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,859
He's committed hara-kiri.

1323
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,691
And with your knife,
SergeantJohnson.

1324
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,196
I thought I'd lost it.

1325
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:52,198
It never occurred to me
someone had taken it.

1326
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:54,200
Makino:
Sir, is custom to finish hara-kiri

1327
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:55,735
with gun. Please.

1328
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,395
Sorry. The situation
doesn't allow

1329
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,564
for peacetime
customs.

1330
01:27:58,639 --> 01:27:59,571
Get a corpsman.

1331
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,073
I'm afraid
it's too late.

1332
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,742
He's dead.

1333
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,870
Take his body outside.

1334
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,549
Your negligence
cost us a prisoner.

1335
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,887
Take it easy, Mac.

1336
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,952
It could have happened
to any one of us.

Yeah.

I have Pretty Boy's and
Doc's personal effects here.

1340
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,663
What should I do
with them?

1341
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,203
Go through them.

1342
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,278
Hey, uh, put this on
for me, will you?

1343
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:42,748
Sure.

1344
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,751
Well, I guess
it's up to us

1345

to pay off
this stinkin' business.

You're the big brain.
What do we do first?

1347

Well, let's start
working on Romeo.

1348
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,592
He's one of those
know-it-all types

1349
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,628
that if we flatter
the wig off him,

1350
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:55,627
he'll chatter

1351
01:28:55,696 --> 01:28:57,391
like a gooney bird
at mating time.

1352
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:58,796
Okay. Here,
I'll finish it.

1353

Say, Lieutenant.

1354
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,095
Yeah?

What do I do
about this stuff?

1356
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,602
What's that?

Oh. Oh, yeah.
Well, check it

1359

and see if there's anything
embarrassing to their families,

1360
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:09,608
and we'll send it on.

for a man

Yes, sir. You trust me.

1375

trust you, we can--

I found something

1377
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,582
in Pretty Boy's stuff
that I--

1378
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,417
I told you what you're
supposed to do with it.

1379
01:29:55,489 --> 01:29:56,581
- Yes, sir, but--
- Later.

1380

to look at what I found.

please not interrupt?

Will you just take
a look at it, sir?

1383

Hold it
till I get back.

1384

This is a Jap overlay.

positions in the hills.

What's this symbol
mean?

1392
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,959
It means fire.
Where did you get this?

1393

In this case. I found it
in Pretty Boy's stuff.

The question is,

1395
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,129
did Pretty Boy
find it in the cave?

1396

for months.

will you, Pigeon?

1449
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:02,608
He's gotta know.

1450
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,840
Hope...

1451
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,681
is the mother...
of all men.

1452
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:16,522
We must...

1453
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:20,117
hold... on
to that belief.

1454
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:24,062
Andy!

1455
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:41,114
It's too late,
Mac.

1456
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:42,615
He got the count.

1457
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:09,274
Come on, Bill.
What's holding you up?

1458
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,072
Andy, all I got
on this overlay

1459
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,578
is 3 little wiggles.

1460
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,240
And there's 3 little wiggles
just like them on this map.

1461
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:16,248
Mm-hmm.

1462
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,251
Now all I got to do
is find them.

1463
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,752
Would y'all
like to try it?

1464
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,912
Okay. Go ahead.

1465
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,752
Now if we only knew
where to start with it.

1466
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,088
Forward slope,
reverse slope,

1467
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,094
east flank,
west flank...

1468
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,754
well, here's
where we were

1469
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,127
when the rockets
first hit us.

1470
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:32,790
The Nips probably
stuck them

1471
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:34,767
on the reverse slope,
so try it in there, huh?

1472
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,102
Reverse slope.
Check.

1473
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:45,344
Man, what a job. I'll be
here the rest of the war.

1474
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:46,901
Well,
just keep pushin'.

1475
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:49,243
Johnson, you better get
back to friend Romeo.

1476
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:50,339
Okay.

1477
01:34:56,689 --> 01:34:59,021
Come on, come on.

1478

Lieutenant Anderson?

1479
01:35:00,493 --> 01:35:01,425
Yeah?

1480
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:02,961
You got
an old Nip to go?

1481
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:04,428
Yeah, he's in there.
First door.

1482
01:35:04,497 --> 01:35:05,464
Yes, sir.

1484
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:08,325
Yes.
How did you know?

1485
01:35:08,401 --> 01:35:09,425
How could I miss?

1486
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:11,436
My uncle's got a big
business in El Paso.

1487
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:13,267
Yeah. Well,
that explains it.

1488
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:19,210
I come for
the old Nip.

1489
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:21,575
Come on, old sport.

1490
01:35:21,647 --> 01:35:24,411
I'm gonna take you
to a nice, quiet place.

1491
01:35:24,484 --> 01:35:27,282
Hey, come on, pops.
I ain't got all day.

Hold it, chum.

01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:50,570
Lieutenant.

1499
01:35:50,643 --> 01:35:52,076
Did he get it?

1500
01:35:52,145 --> 01:35:53,737
No, sir.
Just knocked cold.

1501
01:35:53,813 --> 01:35:54,745
Lieutenant,
it's important

1502
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:56,714
that we keep
the old man with us.

1503
01:35:56,783 --> 01:35:58,683
Okay. Take him
to the aid station.

1504
01:35:58,751 --> 01:36:00,742
Let me know as soon
as he comes around.

[Coughing]

1506
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:08,426
What's the story
on it?

1507
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:09,927
The old man
didn't want to be

1508
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:11,258
taken away
from Nomura.

1509
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:12,592
He begged him
to interfere.

1510
01:36:12,665 --> 01:36:14,189
Nomura kicked him
to shut him up.

1511
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,098
Did he say anything
of value to us?

1512
01:36:16,169 --> 01:36:17,932
Yes, sir. He called
Nomura Matsuoda,

1513
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:19,403
which must be
his real name.

1514
01:36:19,472 --> 01:36:20,530
Nomura is Matsuoda.

1515
01:36:20,606 --> 01:36:21,937
Ah, good for grandpa.

1516
01:36:22,008 --> 01:36:24,442
Okay, now let's get
acquainted with Matsuoda.

1517
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:26,444
Let's first find out
from Romeo

1518
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:27,774
why Matsuoda's
lying, sir.

1519
01:36:27,847 --> 01:36:28,779
Right.

1520
01:36:35,822 --> 01:36:37,380
Nomura!

1521
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:40,017
Romeo...
who is this man?

1522
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:43,459
Oh, yes, sir.

1523
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:44,723
He is Nomura.

1524
01:36:44,797 --> 01:36:46,059
Private
in naval battalion,

1525
01:36:46,132 --> 01:36:47,224
like me.

1526
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,392
What was his job?

1527
01:36:48,468 --> 01:36:49,560
He do many things.

1528
01:36:49,635 --> 01:36:50,567
Did he mix
cement?

1529
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:51,660
Oh, yes.

1530
01:36:51,737 --> 01:36:53,261
Tell him to hold
out his hands.

1531
01:36:53,339 --> 01:36:54,772
<i>Te o dase</i>.

1532
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:56,570
His hands are soft.
You're lying!

01:36:56,642 --> 01:36:58,507
Now stand up
and tell us the truth!

<i>Kiotsuke!</i>

1535
01:36:59,846 --> 01:37:01,905
We know that his name
is Matsuoda.

1536
01:37:01,981 --> 01:37:03,642
Now, who is he?

1537
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,380
He is officer.

1538
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,752
He are a big man.

1539
01:37:10,823 --> 01:37:12,415
Very big
in allJapan.

1540
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:14,585
Of course.
Big general maybe, huh?

1541
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,594
Navy captain?

1542
01:37:16,662 --> 01:37:18,152
Air force colonel?

1543
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:21,098
Oh, no. He are
a major in army.

1544
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,761
But in Japan,
I know his name.

1545
01:37:23,836 --> 01:37:25,929
I make gamble
money on him.

1546
01:37:26,005 --> 01:37:28,439
He is big... very big
baseball player.

1547
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:29,770
What team?

1548
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:31,366
Meiji University.

1549
01:37:31,444 --> 01:37:34,413
But surely you're not
interested in baseball.

1550
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,209
I am.

1551
01:37:36,282 --> 01:37:38,113
Come on,Johnson.
Let's go.

1552

Oh, Lieutenant
Anderson.

1553
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,022
Yeah.

1554
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:46,422
We brought
the old man around.

1555
01:37:46,492 --> 01:37:47,925
Good. You get
back to him.

1556
01:37:47,994 --> 01:37:48,926
Yes, sir.

1557
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:50,519
Talk to him.
I'll handle our major.

1558
01:37:50,596 --> 01:37:52,564
Right. But, Lieutenant,
if I may make a suggestion:

1559
01:37:52,632 --> 01:37:54,725
tear down his ego. He's
rolling in pride and vanity.

1560
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,028
Okay.

1561
01:38:16,589 --> 01:38:18,420
Meiji University
teaches engineering,

1562
01:38:18,491 --> 01:38:20,482
doesn't it?

1563
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,528
Japanese universities
teach everything.

1564
01:38:22,595 --> 01:38:24,756
What kind of
an engineer are you?

I have 3 university
degrees.

1567
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,933
Uh-huh. And in spite

1568
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:30,935
of your 3 university
degrees,

1569
01:38:31,003 --> 01:38:33,028
your rank and your name,
you're a coward.

1570
01:38:33,105 --> 01:38:35,938
You hide
in a private's uniform.

1571
01:38:36,008 --> 01:38:37,942
Lieutenant,
you're a fool.

1572
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:39,443
All right.
What's your story?

1573
01:38:39,512 --> 01:38:41,446
You'll know the story
when you see

1574
01:38:41,514 --> 01:38:43,448
the number of dead you have
through my efforts.

1575
01:38:43,516 --> 01:38:45,279
You're a liar!
You probably got to be

1576
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:47,285
a major because your
family had influence!

1577
01:38:47,353 --> 01:38:49,981
I became a major
because I planned a big--

1578
01:38:52,525 --> 01:38:53,787
Lieutenant...

1579
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:56,453
you seem to know
Japanese psychology.

1580
01:38:56,529 --> 01:38:58,861
But I'm smart, too.

1581
01:38:58,931 --> 01:39:00,796
I know you know.

1582
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:02,800
I say no more.

1583
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:06,929
The rule of war states
I give only my name and rank.

1584
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:09,304
Major Kenji Matsuoda.

1585
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,501
No more.

1586
01:39:10,576 --> 01:39:12,237
This is important,
Lieutenant.

1587
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,748
Dickerman, tell the colonel
we stumbled onto something.

1588
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:23,152
One of the Nip privates
is a major. Hurry it up.

1589
01:39:23,222 --> 01:39:24,154
Yes, sir.

1590
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:25,315
What did you
find out?

1591
01:39:25,391 --> 01:39:27,154
The old man told me that
Matsuoda lived with him

1592
01:39:27,226 --> 01:39:28,989
and his son a year ago
on their plantation.

1593
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,824
He treated them well,
but after a while

1594
01:39:30,896 --> 01:39:32,830
he moved them out, and
the army built a tunnel

1595
01:39:32,898 --> 01:39:34,160
from the house
for wolf-tails.

1596
01:39:34,233 --> 01:39:35,495
What are wolf-tails?

1597
01:39:35,568 --> 01:39:37,502
Rockets. Lieutenant,
don't you remember

1598
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:39,834
what I said to you in the
cave about grooved wheels?

1599
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:42,305
They're using that tunnel
to transport rockets.

1600
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:43,706
Yeah, you're right.

1601
01:39:43,776 --> 01:39:45,971
That's why we couldn't
see the rail line from the air.

1602
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:47,103
Where's the house?

1603
01:39:47,179 --> 01:39:48,942
He said it's on
a sugar plantation.

1604
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:50,949
Wait a minute. There was
that sugar cane field

1605
01:39:51,017 --> 01:39:52,678
you found
on Captain Makino's map.

1606
01:39:52,752 --> 01:39:53,946
That's right.

1607
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,954
Where are they? Let me
take a look at this, Bill.

1608
01:39:56,022 --> 01:39:56,954
Let's see.

1609
01:39:57,023 --> 01:39:58,786
There it is,
and there's the house.

1610
01:39:58,858 --> 01:40:00,792
But how can we be sure
it's his house?

1611
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:03,294
He says that when he stands
in front of his house,

1612
01:40:03,362 --> 01:40:04,294
there's water on his left.

1613
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:06,297
Here we are...water.
It's a lake.

1614
01:40:06,365 --> 01:40:08,299
It's in front of and to one
side of the ranch house.

1615
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:10,301
And on the right
some hills and woods.

1616
01:40:10,369 --> 01:40:12,030
Here we are. Hills
and woods to the right.

1617
01:40:12,104 --> 01:40:14,163
And he says that in front
of his house there's a hill

1618
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,140
some distance away with a road
on the other side.

1619
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,869
There's the hill.
There's the road. Right.

1620
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:18,967
Bill, those rockets
are somewhere near

1621
01:40:19,045 --> 01:40:20,239
that ranch house.

1622
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,177
Now work the overlay
around there, quick!

1623
01:40:22,248 --> 01:40:23,442
Right.

1624
01:40:23,516 --> 01:40:25,950
Boy, this climate is sure
death on a man's pleasures.

1625
01:40:26,018 --> 01:40:28,486
All right, Anderson.
Let's have a look at that Nip.

1626
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:30,488
It's no use, Colonel.
I've been at him.

1627
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:31,648
He won't talk.

1628
01:40:31,724 --> 01:40:33,157
What have we got
here?

1629
01:40:33,225 --> 01:40:35,125
Found a Jap overlay.
If we match it right,

1630
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:36,422
the rockets'll
be pinpointed.

1631
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:39,020
That'll take all day.
We've got 45 minutes.

1632
01:40:42,168 --> 01:40:44,068
Will you wipe
my forehead?

1633
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,438
Wasn't there
a General Sherman or somebody

1634
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:49,440
who once made
a vulgar comment on war?

1635
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:52,272
Yeah. He said ""war is hell.""
And what did he know about it?

1636
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:54,312
That eight-ball
never left the states.

1637
01:40:55,881 --> 01:40:57,974
Colonel, if we don't
get it in time,

1638
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,779
can't we postpone
h-hour?

1639
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:02,685
With 20,000 men
jumping off in 41 minutes?

1640
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,290
Anderson, I want
a crack at that Nip.

1641
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:08,292
- Get him out here.
- Aye, sir.

1642
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,452
Butterfield:
still not

1643
01:41:09,528 --> 01:41:10,552
gettin'
anywhere.

1644
01:41:10,629 --> 01:41:12,529
You're doing your best.
Stay with it.

1645
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:17,828
[Coughing]

1646
01:41:20,272 --> 01:41:21,864
Major Matsuoda.

1647
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:31,149
If you didn't want
to live,

1648
01:41:31,217 --> 01:41:33,481
you wouldn't be wearing
that disguise.

1649
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:38,990
Now, you're gonna answer
my questions, Major Matsuoda.

1650
01:41:41,227 --> 01:41:43,161
You will not find
rockets.

1651
01:41:43,229 --> 01:41:45,754
They will fall on you
like rain.

1652
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:49,062
You Americans do not learn
very good from Japan.

1653
01:41:49,135 --> 01:41:51,399
You should learn
to accept your fate

1654
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:52,937
to die well.

1655
01:41:53,005 --> 01:41:54,939
We die well.

1656
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:57,271
As Captain Makino said,
we all die well.

1657
01:41:57,309 --> 01:41:58,404
Wait a minute.

1658
01:41:58,537 --> 01:42:00,300
He's told us
something.

1659
01:42:00,373 --> 01:42:02,307
Die well...

1660
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:04,309
while I was talking
to Captain Makino,

1661
01:42:04,377 --> 01:42:05,810
there was something
he said.

1662
01:42:05,878 --> 01:42:07,812
I wish I could remember
his exact words.

1663
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,211
Dickerman,
you were there.

1664
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:11,306
Yeah. I got it right here.
Where do you want me to start?

1665
01:42:11,384 --> 01:42:13,045
Where he talked
about judo.

1666
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,053
"" Have you not studied
our philosophy,

1667
01:42:15,121 --> 01:42:17,646
""our military science,
our judo wrestling?

1668
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:20,658
"" Do you not remember
that we always take the obvious

1669
01:42:20,726 --> 01:42:22,990
and reverse it, so we reverse
the role of life--""

1670
01:42:23,062 --> 01:42:24,654
That's right. They
reverse the obvious.

1671
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,322
Don't you see,
theJaps thought

1672
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:28,333
that we'd figure
they'd put the rockets

1673
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:29,834
on the reverse slope.
So instead,

1674
01:42:29,902 --> 01:42:32,097
they dug a tunnel
to the forward slope.

1675
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:33,570
It's that easy.

1676
01:42:33,639 --> 01:42:35,072
Get him outta here.

1677
01:42:38,678 --> 01:42:39,667
Will it work?

1678
01:42:39,745 --> 01:42:41,474
I'll find out
in a hurry.

1679
01:42:50,856 --> 01:42:51,982
I've got it!

1680
01:42:52,058 --> 01:42:53,650
There are your
rockets, Colonel.

1681
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:56,627
Seal the mouth of the tunnel
on the forward slope,

1682
01:42:56,696 --> 01:42:58,254
and there'll be
no more rockets.

1683
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,298
Butterfield, get that stuff
over to my map.

1684
01:43:00,366 --> 01:43:02,425
Locate the exact position.
Get the air liaison officer

1685
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,799
and find out what planes
he's got to shellack those hills

1686
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,201
in the next 30 minutes.

1687
01:43:06,272 --> 01:43:08,832
Any planes at all-- Piper Cubs,
kiddy cars, slow boats to China.

1688
01:43:08,908 --> 01:43:10,535
The stinkin' time!

1689
01:43:19,752 --> 01:43:21,982
Dickerman. Anderson.

1690
01:43:22,054 --> 01:43:23,043
Yes, sir.

1691
01:43:23,122 --> 01:43:26,614
You people
have done...

1692
01:43:26,692 --> 01:43:28,091
Thanks.

1693
01:43:31,263 --> 01:43:34,164
Johnson, I told you
to get rid of that--

1694
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:37,668
Yeah, I remember.

1695
01:43:37,737 --> 01:43:39,932
That's the only way
you enjoy smoking.

1696
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:44,601
You see? Give him time.
He'll learn.

1697
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,110
Try and contact
second platoon,

1698
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,110
Baker Company.

1699
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,271
Yes, sir.

1700
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:50,281
Hey, uh,Johnson,
tell me something, will you?

1701
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,281
Yeah.

1702
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,784
How'd you ever get
to be a sergeant?

1703
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:55,787
Oh, straight from
civilian life, sir.

1704
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:58,289
Yeah, but how in the name
of green apples

1705
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,291
did they ever pass you
through boot camp?

1706
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:02,350
Pass me, sir?
I taught there.

1707
01:44:04,663 --> 01:44:06,790
[Coughing]

1708
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:11,469
Maybe you got an in
with the angels, too.

1709
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:13,801
So start prayin' those rockets
are stopped in time.

1710
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:14,805
Good luck,
Lieutenant.

1711
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:15,806
Right.

1712
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:16,807
Good luck, Dickerman.

1713
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:17,808
Good-bye.

1714
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:19,640
Oh, by the way,
for your book...

1715
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,236
it's, uh,
Randolph Johnson.

1716
01:44:21,313 --> 01:44:23,304
Second Platoon,
Baker Company ready, sir.

1717
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:24,314
Okay. Thank you.

1718
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:25,816
Lieutenant,
I'd like to go back

1719
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:27,318
to your platoon with
you for a while.

1720
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,479
Well, it's your book,
your neck. Hello, who's this?

1721
01:44:29,555 --> 01:44:32,456
Oh, Slattery, tell the men
we found the rockets.

1722
01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:35,426
Pass the word along they won't
have to start without me.

1723
01:44:35,494 --> 01:44:36,825
I'll be right there.
Let's go.

1724
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:37,885
Yes, sir.

1725
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:47,168
Why do you writers
take such chances?

1726
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:49,264
You could hang around
the officers' bars

1727
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:51,775
and pick up the greatest
stories of the war.

1728
01:44:51,844 --> 01:44:53,835
I got something that
Doc asked me to show--

1729
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,278
Lay off.

1730
01:44:55,347 --> 01:44:57,247
I don't want to talk
about Doc.

1731
01:44:57,316 --> 01:44:58,783
Lieutenant, I--

1732
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:00,785
Did you and Conroy
take care of Zelenko?

1733
01:45:00,853 --> 01:45:03,287
Yes, sir. They're going to fly
him out tonight. But, sir--

1734
01:45:03,355 --> 01:45:05,983
Okay. I want you to take
his place.

1735
01:45:06,058 --> 01:45:07,457
From now on,
you're a squad leader.

1736
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:09,460
And you will be as long
as you stay sober.

1737
01:45:09,528 --> 01:45:10,790
Yes, sir.

1738
01:45:10,863 --> 01:45:12,797
You take over the squad.
Conroy'll be your assistant.

1739
01:45:12,865 --> 01:45:14,799
You'll have to get me
another assistant.

1740
01:45:14,867 --> 01:45:16,835
Why, what's the matter?
Don't you like con--

1741
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:21,139
What's the matter?

1742
01:45:21,207 --> 01:45:22,538
What is it?

1743
01:45:23,843 --> 01:45:25,902
All the way, Lieutenant.
It's Conroy.

1744
01:45:32,651 --> 01:45:33,583
Conroy?

1745
01:45:34,753 --> 01:45:35,913
[Whispers]
Conroy?

1746
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:43,461
That hit him
6 feet deep.

1747
01:45:43,529 --> 01:45:44,723
I'll talk to him.

1748
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:45,821
Aw, let him alone.

1749
01:45:50,836 --> 01:45:52,064
Lieutenant?

1750
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:53,069
Beat it.

1751
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:55,231
I have a paper
addressed to you, sir.

1752
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:56,638
Tear it up.

1753
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:58,609
It's from Doc.

1754
01:45:58,677 --> 01:46:00,304
Yeah, Doc.

1755
01:46:00,379 --> 01:46:04,577
I told Doc I believed
in nothing but 7 guys.

1756
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:07,619
Now one's blind.
4 are dead.

1757
01:46:07,686 --> 01:46:10,655
And the rest of us
are gonna get it, too.

1758
01:46:10,723 --> 01:46:14,489
TheJaps have got
the right idea...

1759
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,120
kill yourself.

1760
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:19,096
His last words
to me were...

1761
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:20,927
""I put down on paper
something I've been

1762
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,763
""trying to tell
