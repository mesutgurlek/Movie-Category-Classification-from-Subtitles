00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,840
I see trees.

459
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,849
Get in the current.

460
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,854
Back paddle.

461
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:39,011
What day do you make it,
according to your reckoning?

462
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,016
I'm not sure.
Maybe Monday, maybe Tuesday.

463
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,018
I don't know.

464
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,554
Why? Does it make any difference?

465
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,625
Well, I got a funny feeling...

466
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,695
when we were out there
on the raft...

467
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:56,163
somehow I... lost a day.

468
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,667
Tell me. Was I delirious?

469
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,399
A bit.

470
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,805
- How long?
- About a day.

471
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,708
We were all a bit shaky.

472
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,407
So, I did lose a day.

473
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,379
What happened on that day?

474
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,887
- Oh, nothing much.
- No.

475
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,958
No, I want to know.

476
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,727
All right.

477
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,391
- You remember the seabird?
- Seabird? No.

478
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,901
I remember the storm,
or bits of it.

479
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm wondering
why I wasn't washed overboard.

480
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,400
The answer to that is that, uh...

481
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,034
Number Four hung on to you
for several hours.

482
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:46,548
- Oh?
- If it were not for him,
you would have been a goner.

483
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,380
Just lay across you
and hang on, that's all.

484
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,488
I see.

485
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,149
Well, I'm very much obliged
to you, Purser.

486
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:59,456
You are very welcome. I'm sure you
would have done the same thing for me.

487
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,497
<i>But</i> I'm <i>afraid</i>
I'm <i>not a purser any longer.</i>

488
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,567
You see, I've lost my situation.

489
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:10,200
You know, even I am able
to grasp that fact.

490
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,639
And what do you suppose
you are now?

491
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,767
Just one of the party.

492
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,883
Well, Bulldog, I feel fit enough now
for a very short...

493
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,952
very gentle exploratory potter.

494
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,953
- What about you?
- I'm game.

495
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,523
- Where's Sea Wife?
- Collecting shellfish.

496
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,149
- Number Four, if you'll get some coconuts-
- Yes, I'll do that.

497
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,228
Okay. We won't be long.

498
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:13,095
- [Groans]
- I'm very disappointed in this place.

499
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,297
In every respectable desert island
that I've read about...

500
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:20,137
they have everything
except electricity and main drainage.

501
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,872
Here, we have
coconuts and water, period.

502
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,005
With all that bamboo around...

503
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,584
we could make a raft.

504
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,313
If only we had something
to cut it with.

505
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,788
Well, it's no use
worrying about that.

506
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,349
Better get on with this hut for Sea Wife.
Pity she didn't see it before it collapsed.

507
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,498
Sea Wife...

508
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,836
what's your name?

509
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,910
My name is Sea Wife.

510
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,978
I mean your real name.

511
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,741
I'm not a real person here.
None of us are.

512
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,945
I think it's better
if we keep the names we have.

513
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:14,615
I don't agree.
My name is Michael Cannon.

514
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:18,057
You'll find me any time propping up the bar
at the St. George's Club, London.

515
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,129
I'll remember that, Biscuit.

516
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,198
- Michael.
- Biscuit.

517
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,662
Sea Wife,
what's your Christian name?

518
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,939
Why?

519
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,499
So that I have something to call you by
that- that others haven't.

520
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,786
I don't understand you.

521
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,652
So calm, so removed.

522
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:50,385
Don't you have any feelings,
any emotions?

523
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,791
Of course I do.

524
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,865
But don't ask me to explain...

525
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,568
because I can't.

526
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,336
All right. I won't ask you.

527
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,636
But I promise you one thing-

528
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,679
If ever we get out of this place,
I will ask you.

529
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,546
And if necessary,
I'll wait till doomsday for an answer.

530
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,119
Never mind about
what will happen after.

531
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,188
The main thing is to get out.

532
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,554
- I suppose we could hang on
here for a while longer-
- No, not for much longer.

533
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,594
Why not?
We've got coconuts, water, fish.

534
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,163
Yes, but there's no faith anymore...

535
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,994
and we can't live without that.

536
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,568
It's as though the springs
have dried up.

537
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,968
You mean Bulldog and Number Four?

538
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,774
- It's not only them.
- You mean us, Sea Wife?

539
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,346
I mean-

540
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,915
We must go
before it's too late.

541
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:50,144
You can't escape me, you know.
There's no way off this island.

542
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,221
A way will come.

543
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,134
[Snoring]

544
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,871
[Snoring Continues]

545
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,805
- Hello.
- Hello.

546
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,312
Sea Wife thinks we ought to be
leaving pretty soon.

547
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,382
What time's the next train?

548
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,043
Where does it go to anyway?

549
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,677
You know,
if this is one of the Nicobars...

550
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,780
there ought to be land
pretty near through the north.

551
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,349
As a matter of fact, I thought I saw some
the other day when the haze lifted.

552
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,657
How far?

553
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,494
<i>About</i> 1 <i>0 or</i> 15 <i>miles,</i>
<i>if it was land.</i>

554
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,966
The currents are all dead north
and pretty strong.

555
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,969
<i>[Rustling]</i>

556
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,437
Hey, what have you
got there?

557
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,306
A useful discovery, huh?

558
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:52,074
- What is it?
- A machete.

559
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,149
Where the devil did you get it?

560
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,844
Along the shore, buried in the sand.

561
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,514
Let's have a look at it.

562
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,959
I said,
let's have a look at it!

563
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,358
I should prefer
to clean, sharpen...

564
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,556
and entirely renovate it first,
Mr. Bulldog.

565
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:18,407
What price your raft now,
now that we have something to cut with?

566
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,136
Should be a piece of cake.

567
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:25,874
You don't really believe he's thinking of
using that for peaceful purposes, do you?

568
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,749
Are you happy with your knife?

569
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,554
- Yes, it's like silver.
- Let me look at it.

570
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,561
No.

571
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,631
Give me the knife, Number Four.

572
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:46,031
No, I'm sorry, Sea Wife.
I need it.

573
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:50,037
The knife belongs to all of us.
We all need it.

574
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,575
- What for?
- If we have the knife, then we can build a raft.

575
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,644
Then we can leave the island.

576
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,681
- Leave?
- There are some islands not far from here.

577
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,615
Please, give me the knife.

578
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,619
Pardon me. I cannot.

579
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,621
The knife is now sharp.

580
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,783
I wouldn't want anyone
to... cut themselves.

581
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,555
Then will you show me
how to make a fire?

582
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,563
- Will you?
- Certainly.

583
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:19,362
With steel it is easy.
But I keep the knife.

584
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,402
What's wrong, Number Four?

585
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,406
What's happened to you?

586
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,477
No, Sea Wife.
What's happened to you?

587
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,547
L- I don't know
what you mean.

588
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,947
Why don't you tell him
that you are a nun?

589
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,020
I've already told you
the reason.

590
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,589
Perhaps there is
another reason.

591
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,823
What other reason?

592
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,827
Biscuit.

593
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,621
No, no. That is all wrong!

594
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,731
Kindly leave it to me.

595
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,302
Shall I go and cut
some more bamboo?

596
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,566
No, thank you.
I will both cut and build.

597
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:36,444
Then perhaps when the raft is ready,
you'll select me captain.

598
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,106
Captain? Rapid promotion.

599
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,877
You think that's a good idea?

600
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,713
I think it's a very good idea.

601
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,315
After all, he's the only sailor
amongst us.

602
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,394
He's <i>making the thing.</i>

603
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,963
<i>Of course</i>
<i>he should be captain.</i>

604
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,567
- Thank you, Mr. Bulldog.
- You certainly earned it.

605
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,037
Uh, when do you think the raft
will be ready to leave the shipyard?

606
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,338
If we work very hard, I shall
have it ready by the next full moon.

607
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,327
You worked like a demon
this morning, Number Four.

608
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,496
How much longer
before the raft's ready?

609
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,508
Only two more days.
It must be ready by full moon.

610
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,578
The tide is best then.

611
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,314
I think the weather's going to play.

612
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,282
The main thing is to catch
that big northward current.

613
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,819
I reckon it runs at five or six knots.

614
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,485
Are you ready? One, two, three!

615
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,529
<i>Heave.! And again.</i>

616
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,031
<i>Heave.!</i>

617
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:12,436
<i>Once more.! Heave.!</i>

618
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,702
- Well done, Captain.
- <i>[Number Four] Do you like it?</i>

619
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:42,703
Well done.

620
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,211
May God bless this raft
and all who sail on her.

621
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,788
Father, Son, the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

622
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,700
<i>[Biscuit]</i>
<i>Hello.</i>

623
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,208
Would you like to hear
another lecture on the nebulas?

624
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,073
I'm afraid the last one
was a little disjointed.

625
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,477
No, I don't want to
hear about them.

626
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,606
I just want to
look at them.

627
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,947
Sea Wife...

628
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,352
listen to me.

629
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,925
I know I promised
I wouldn't ask you this again...

630
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,654
but why are you running
away from things?

631
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,754
- Tell me that.
- I'm not running away.

632
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,834
Yes, you are. You're running away
from life, from yourself.

633
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,770
There are voices talking to you,
aren't there, Sea Wife?

634
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:54,138
- You can hear them, can't you?
- No.

635
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:57,974
Listen to them, Sea Wife.
Listen to them.

636
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,208
Oh, don't touch me.
Please, don't touch me.

637
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,342
Sea Wife.

638
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,012
[Sighs]
Oh, don't.

639
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,647
Listen to those voices,
Sea Wife.

640
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,454
They're the only real voices-
the voices of life.

641
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,561
I love you, Sea Wife.

642
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,688
Oh, no, don't.
You mustn't say that.

643
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,132
Why not? It's true.
And why shouldn't I love you?

644
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,534
You're young and brave
and beautiful and good.

645
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,629
When I was sick, you nursed me.

646
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,268
If ever we get out of this island alive,
it's because you've held us together.

647
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,846
All this time,
I've been so near you.

648
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,643
All this time...

649
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,514
so near you.

650
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,521
Why shouldn't I love you?

651
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,523
Because-

652
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,361
Because l-
I've given my word...

653
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,794
to someone else.

654
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,356
But when you gave your word, you weren't
to know that this would happen.

655
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,595
Neither was he.

656
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,603
No.

657
01:07:56,705 --> 01:08:00,072
Not this case.

658
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:03,043
You see, I didn't make
any conditions...

659
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:06,239
when I promised.

660
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,714
I can't start
making them now.

661
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,468
What time is it?

662
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,597
8:00. High tide in two hours.

663
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:35,165
Half an hour after that,
we'll be all aboard.

664
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,575
Are you sorry to be leaving,
Sea Wife?

665
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,342
Oh, I don't know.

666
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,349
Why? Are you?

667
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,911
If Bulldog and Number Four sailed away
and left us here together, would you be sorry?

668
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:51,482
I begged you last night
not to ask questions like that.

669
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:54,586
If you think I'm sorry about last night,
you're mistaken.

670
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,756
When we get back-

671
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,857
if we get back-

672
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,129
I shall ask you again.

673
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,764
And I shall keep on asking
until I get an answer...

674
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,842
and a truthful one.

675
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,353
- Have you looked on the raft?
- No, it's not on the raft.

676
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,015
- I have looked.
- I thought I saw you drop it.

677
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,584
- Over!
- What's the trouble?

678
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,061
His knife- He's lost it.

679
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,134
Do you need it so badly?
It's served its purpose now.

680
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,202
I need it more than ever.

681
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,168
I must have it.
It's not on the raft!

682
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,971
Look back there,
where you were cutting the bamboos.

683
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,722
No, I don't like
the look of this trim.

684
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,260
I think it's all right.

685
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:05,299
Yes, but how's it going to be
when we all come on board, huh?

686
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,598
Come on. Come on board.
Let's try it.

687
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,604
All right.

688
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,304
It'll be all right
with Number Four up front.

689
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:23,181
Yes, but what's going to happen
when the wind catches the sail?

690
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,185
- Steady on, old man.
- What?

691
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:29,053
Have us all in the current.
Be impossible to get back.

692
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,184
How far out do you reckon
we have to go...

693
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,592
before we catch
the current?

694
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,861
I don't know.
About 30 yards.

695
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,993
Right.

696
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:44,436
- [Grunts] Here we go.
- Steady, old man.

697
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,441
- Can't you see what he's doing?
He's leaving behind Number Four!
- Hey, Bulldog.

698
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,443
- Stop him!
- Oh, shut up!

699
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,513
Cut it out!

700
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,444
Are you crazy?
You've killed him.

701
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,786
Killed him?
I've saved his life and yours.

702
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,220
Number Four! Number Four!

703
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,638
Too late, Captain.
The boat's sailed.

704
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,642
But, Sea Wife,
I am one of the party!

705
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,803
Wait!

706
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,712
- Bulldog, please.
- I'm sorry, but somebody's got to be sane.

707
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,943
- Sane?
- Yes, sane.

708
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,854
And it's not sane to sail on a raft...

709
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:32,286
And it's not sane to sail on a raft...

710
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,913
with you, a Negro and a knife.

711
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,492
Any two together,
but not all three.

712
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,130
If you don't turn back, I'll go-

713

We can't! We're in the current.
Sea Wife!

714

- Go back, Number Four!

It was his own fault.
It was his own fault, I tell you.

01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,685
It's over now...

773
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,183
so you'll never come
and look for me.

774
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,221
You'll never know.

775
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,100
God forgive us all.

776
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,600
God be merciful to me...

777
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,542
a sinner.

778
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,647
<i>[Squawking Sound]</i>

779
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,217
<i>[Squawking]</i>

780
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,128
Biscuit!

781
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:52,328
Biscuit.

782
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,375
[Seagull Squawking]

783
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:09,506
<i>[Biscuit] It was several months before</i>
I <i>discovered that</i> we'd <i>been saved by a boat...</i>

784
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,143
<i>and</i> I'd <i>been taken ashore</i>
<i>at the nearest port.</i>

785
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,848
I would like your assurance...

786
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:18,153
that you'll forget
the whole matter.

787
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,228
I'm afraid I can't promise you that.

788
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,853
Ah, that's the trouble
with you, Biscuit.

789
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:25,762
You're conceited.
You don't know what you're up against.

790
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,335
You think every woman
must be in love with you.

791
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,564
I love her.
Do you understand?

792
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,799
I love Sea Wife.
I must find her.

793
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,876
Please help me to find her.

794
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:38,002
She's alive, isn't she?
Tell me where she is.

795
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,708
Uh-Yes, we're all alive
in a way.

796
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:46,083
- She and I and the other-
- [Sighs]

797
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,656
And all dead.

798
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,519
For practical purposes, Biscuit,
you should consider yourself...

799
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,427
<i>the only survivor.</i>

800
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,432
What do you mean?

801
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,004
She's dead.

802
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:07,337
<i>Sea Wife is dead.</i>

803
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,608
<i>She died on the ship.</i>

804
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,079
<i>Her last thoughts</i>
<i>were of you.</i>

805
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:17,049
She said...

806
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:21,521
"Tell Biscuit that I loved him."

807
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:35,366
She said that you were always
to think of her...

808
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,495
as she was on the island.

809
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,160
What's wrong, Sister Therese?

810
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:37,089
Just someone I once knew.

811
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,008
He didn't seem to recognize you.

812
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,777
No one ever looks at the face of a nun.
