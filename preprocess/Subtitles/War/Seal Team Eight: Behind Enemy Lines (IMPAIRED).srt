That's right.

We knew Tonga
was receiving weapons,

316
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,967
but what we didn't know
is that he wasn't buying them.

317
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:12,404
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.

318
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,939
- Shit.
- He's working <i>for</i> Malin...

319
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,009
who's been stockpiling yellowcake
uranium for a major sale.

(BUBBA) Sir.

321
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:22,047
According to this, there's been a major
influx of activity around the mine.

322
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:27,184
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.

323
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,888
And how would you
know that exactly?

324

340
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,917
Uranium's legally
mined in that region...

341
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,753

10 international agencies...

Ricks has probably
initiated rescue measures.

00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:22,798
But without visual confirmation or a request
from us, he cannot send another team.

629
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,504
He'll be looking for the most visible
concentration of enemy hostiles.

the hostiles from the rescue perimeter...

we can positively I.D. the individuals

this remains an official

No sign of Zoe. No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.

- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?

routed to us from Little Creek.

812

They sent an e-mail

An e-mail?
That's brilliant.

815
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,733
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.

Figure it out.

Where is this Malin anyway,

I don't know.

820

Soldiers for hire don't fight like
that to protect an empty nest.

821
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,219
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.

822
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:46,955
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?

823
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,193
So Malin pays Tonga
to secure the area...

824
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:54,430
<i>so he can quietly stockpile</i>
<i>yellowcake for a huge sale.</i>

825
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:57,366
But there's a problem when you
pay an army for protection.

826
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,503
Yeah, like who's gonna
protect you from the army?

827
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:00,836
Exactly.

828

<i>So Tonga realizes that the shit</i>
<i>he's paid to protect...</i>

<i>he's being paid to protect it.</i>

830
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,677
<i>He becomes a threat. Malin has

Who pushed over the first domino?

833
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,390
We took out Tonga's camp based
on intel from the local asset...

834
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,459
Zoe Jelani.

835
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,394
<i>(JAY)</i>
<i>She got caught on purpose.</i>

No, she didn't.

837
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,800
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.

838
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:34,703
She's a proven
local asset doing what?

839
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:37,672
<i>Ratting out her competition.</i>

840
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,276
<i>So she's got a perfect record...</i>

841
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,745
because all she has to do is point
to Tonga's training camp...

842
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:44,813
and scream "Al-Qaeda"
and we just vaporize it.

843
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,983
Yep. And physical
confirmation is needed now.

844
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:51,187
(CASE)
And she gets caught somehow...

845
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,788
by Tonga...

846
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,356
the one person that can ID her.

847
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:58,561
(CHUCKLES) He was about to
tell us exactly who she was.

848
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,695
So she offs him.

849
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,699
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.

850
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,968
Then she tells us
about the yellowcake...

851
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:08,404
convinces us to walk her
through the gauntlet...

852
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:11,339
so she doesn't miss her sale.
