as to defy slander.

00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,126
...in my profession
we hear many such stories.

319
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,042
Yours is the most intriguing and touching
I've heard in weeks.

320
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:28,172
Nevertheless,
I cannot grant your request.

321
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,764
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

322
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:33,686
FEENEY: I'll allow you to keep
those fine boots...

...which normally I would have
for myself.

The next town is only five miles away.

325
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:42,202
And I suggest you now start walking.

326
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:44,329
Mightn't I keep my horse?

327
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,325
I would like to oblige you...

328
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:50,731
...but, people like us must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

...who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...

...the chance to earn distinction
in the European wars...

into a proper young soldier.

The Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...

387

...by the arrival of other troops...

I couldn't tell her.

...that she had to console herself
with a husband.

He recovered from his wound.

414
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:03,450
The shot you hit him with could not
hurt him. It was made of tow.

1,500 a year out of the family.

The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

419
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:24,125
...from fear of you.

you certainly did, me lad.

With a fine thick plugget of tow.

He was so frightened,
it took him an hour to come to.

wished to pass.

...I'm a British Officer.

642
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,681
You're a liar and an imposter.

643
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:29,332
You're a deserter.

644
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:34,652
POTZDORF: I suspected you this morning.
Your lies and folly have confirmed this.

645
01:01:35,613 --> 01:01:39,572
You pretend to carry despatches
to a General, dead these ten months.

646
01:01:40,293 --> 01:01:42,363
You say the British Ambassador in Berlin...

647
01:01:42,453 --> 01:01:45,604
...is your uncle,
with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.

648
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:50,883
Now, will you join and take the bounty,
or be given up?

649
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:56,681
I volunteer.

[Military march music, background]

651
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:04,002
NARRATOR: The Prussian Service
was worse than the English.

652
01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:08,483
The life of a Private Soldier
was frightful.

653
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:14,732
Punishment was incessant.
Every Officer had the right to inflict it.

654
01:02:17,253 --> 01:02:20,882
The gauntlet was a common penalty
for minor offences.

655
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:26,211
More serious ones were punishable
by mutilation or death.

656
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:37,925

the army...

657
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:42,851
...renowned for its disciplined valour,
was officered by native Prussians.

658
01:02:44,413 --> 01:02:46,449
But it was mostly composed...

659
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:49,772
...of men from the lowest levels
of humanity...

660
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,483
...hired or stolen
from every nation in Europe.

661
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:59,372
Thus, Barry fell
into the worst company...

662
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:05,211

the science of every kind of misconduct.

...with the conduct of the Regiment

You're a gallant soldier,
and evidently of good stock...

685
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:07,688
...but you're idle and unprincipled.

686

I hope the Colonel is mistaken.

I have fallen into bad company,
but I've only done as other soldiers do.

690
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:28,772
I've never had a friend
or protector before...

691
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:31,572
...to show that I was worthy
of better things.

692
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:35,890
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:39,331
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

01:08:39,853 --> 01:08:41,844
We shall get you out of the Army...

...appoint you to the Police Bureau,
and, in time...

...we'll allow you to move
in a better sphere.

Thank you, Captain.

710
01:08:56,133 --> 01:09:00,524
Your Ioyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

711
01:09:02,853 --> 01:09:06,289
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

If you succeed...

713

...your reward will be secure.

714

I'll do my best, sir.

715
01:09:25,213 --> 01:09:29,729
There is a gentleman in Berlin
in the service of the Empress of Austria.

716
01:09:30,653 --> 01:09:33,565
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

717
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:37,248
He appears to be a professional gambler.

718
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:40,649
POTZDORF: He's a libertine:

719
01:09:40,773 --> 01:09:42,923
Fond of women, of good food...

720
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:45,326
...polished, obliging.

721
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:50,168
He speaks French and German indifferently.

722
01:09:51,293 --> 01:09:54,763
But we have reason to fancy
that Monsieur de Balibari...

723

...is a native of your country of Ireland.

724
01:10:00,293 --> 01:10:03,012
And that he has come here as a spy.

725
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:15,804
Your knowledge of English...

726
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:19,443
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

727
01:10:20,413 --> 01:10:22,927
...and find out whether or not
he is a spy.

Does this assignment interest you?

729

Minister, I'm interested in anything
that can be of service to you...

say you are Hungarian.

You served in the war.

748
01:12:39,893 --> 01:12:42,771
...but when Barry saw
the Chevalier's splendour...

...of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.

My name is Redmond Barry.

I was abducted into the Prussian Army.

...at thus finding one
of his countrymen.

He is very religious
and attends church regularly.

After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

He then takes an airing in his carriage.

777

NARRATOR: Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.

The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.

He was instructed to tell the truth...

780

...as much as his story
would possibly bear.

781
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:19,092
The information he gave
was very minute and accurate...

should keep his character of valet.

That, before strangers,
he should not know a word of English.

And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.

01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:06,651
...and a natural aptitude...

792
01:16:07,613 --> 01:16:11,049
...he was able to give his dear patron
much assistance...

793
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,006
...against his opponents
at the green table.

794
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:18,565
Lf, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...

795
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:21,521
...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.

796
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:25,682
If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.

797
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:29,083
If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...

798
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,329
...Hearts were meant, and so forth.

[Soft classical melody continues,

800
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:44,605
NARRATOR: The Prince of Tübingen...

801
01:16:44,693 --> 01:16:48,208
...who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...

802
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:53,123
...was passionately fond of play
as were the gentlemen...

803
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,688
...of almost all the Courts of Europe.

804
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:58,691
[In German] You owe
15,500 frederick d'or.

[Soft classical melody continues,
background]

806
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:33,202
Chevalier...

807
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:38,884
...though I cannot say how...

808
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:42,563
...I believe you have cheated me.

809
01:17:50,373 --> 01:17:52,364
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

810
01:17:53,133 --> 01:17:55,806
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

811
01:17:58,253 --> 01:17:59,368
I don't know.

812
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:02,005
But I believe I have been.

813
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:07,881
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

814
01:18:09,093 --> 01:18:11,004
...which I have honourably won.

815
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:14,242
Chevalier...

816
01:18:16,773 --> 01:18:20,163
...if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

817
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:23,891
If you will be patient...

818
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:27,647
...maybe I will pay you something
another time.

819
01:18:31,493 --> 01:18:35,930
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

820
01:18:36,653 --> 01:18:39,884
...then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

821
01:18:41,853 --> 01:18:43,923
I have said all there is to be said.

822
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:48,444
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

823
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:51,808
Good night.

824
01:19:13,173 --> 01:19:14,845
Was the Prince cheated?

825
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,848
BARRY: In as far as I am able
to tell, Herr Minister, no.

826
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:23,323
I believe he won the money fairly.

827
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:30,042
POTZDORF: What are
the Chevalier's intentions?

828
01:19:30,893 --> 01:19:32,246
BARRY: I'm not sure.

829
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:36,851
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

830
01:19:40,253 --> 01:19:43,051
MINISTER: A meeting
with the Prince is impossible.

831
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:49,122
The Prince has left him no other choice.

832
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:01,691
[Inaudible whispering]

833
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:19,206
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

834
01:20:20,973 --> 01:20:23,646
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

835
01:20:23,933 --> 01:20:28,165
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me what he owes?

836
01:20:29,733 --> 01:20:32,725
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

837
01:20:33,813 --> 01:20:35,849
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

838
01:20:36,413 --> 01:20:40,201
They cannot harm me,
the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

839
01:20:40,853 --> 01:20:44,971
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

840
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:49,086
If they should, don't worry...

841
01:20:49,973 --> 01:20:51,884
...you shall not be left behind.

842
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:54,012
Have no fear of that.

843
01:20:56,093 --> 01:20:59,722
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

844
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:03,008
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

845
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,885
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

846
01:21:09,013 --> 01:21:10,332
...possibly today.

847
01:21:11,293 --> 01:21:13,409
MINISTER: Then this
must be done tomorrow.

848
01:21:13,693 --> 01:21:15,809
POTZDORF:
All the arrangements are made.

849
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:24,252
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

850
01:21:25,533 --> 01:21:26,488
Yes, sir.

851
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:30,730
Is there any reason he should do
any different tomorrow?

852
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,008
No, sir.

853
01:21:33,693 --> 01:21:34,603
Good.

854
01:21:36,293 --> 01:21:39,285
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

855
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:42,730
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

856
01:21:43,613 --> 01:21:45,922
POTZDORF: His baggage
will be sent after him.

857
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:47,082
Excellent.

858
01:21:58,853 --> 01:22:01,242
NARRATOR: At ten o'clock
the next morning...

859
01:22:01,693 --> 01:22:03,729
...the Chevalier de Balibari...

860
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:06,966
...went out for his regular morning drive.

861

Where's my servant, Lazlo?

862
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:20,608
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.

864
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,686
Please get inside.

Am I under arrest?

866
01:22:38,213 --> 01:22:40,488
1ST OFFICER: We're driving
to the frontier.

867
01:22:41,133 --> 01:22:44,648
Frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

868

to escort you to the frontier...

...and see you safely across the border.

870
01:22:50,773 --> 01:22:52,525
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

871
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:56,526
I have very important business
at the Austrian Ambassador's house.

872
01:22:56,853 --> 01:22:59,242
1ST OFFICER: My orders are
to take Your Honour...

873
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,688
...to the frontier
by any means necessary.

874
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:03,092
If you come willingly...

875

...I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...

876

...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

BARRY: All Europe shall hear
of this.

878
01:23:25,813 --> 01:23:29,283
NARRATOR: And so,
without papers or passport...

879
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:33,046
...and under the eyes
of two Prussian Officers...

880
01:23:33,373 --> 01:23:37,810
...Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.

881

crossed the frontier the night before.

[Soft classical melody, background]

NARRATOR: By these wonderful
circumstances, Barry was free again...

884
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:03,767
...and began his professional work
as a gamester...

885
01:24:04,613 --> 01:24:09,243
...resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.

888
01:24:14,093 --> 01:24:18,291
NARRATOR: Soon he and the Chevalier
were received in all the Courts of Europe...

889
01:24:19,173 --> 01:24:20,526
...and were speedily...

890
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:23,923
...in the very best society
where play was patronized...

891

always welcome.

[In French] I would like dinner.
Shall we?

917
01:26:18,813 --> 01:26:20,565
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

918

BARRY: If you don't mind.

919
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:25,528
Not at all.

920
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:32,683
NARRATOR: They always played on credit
with anyone of honour or noble lineage.

921
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:35,764
They never pressed for their winnings...

922
01:26:36,013 --> 01:26:38,811
...or declined to receive
promissory notes.

923
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:43,484
But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.

924
01:26:44,253 --> 01:26:47,245
Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.

925
01:26:47,893 --> 01:26:49,531
There were few bad debts.

FRENCH REFEREE:
[In French] Saluez.

927
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:54,922
NARRATOR: It was Barry's skill with
the sword, and readiness to use it...

928
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:58,290
...that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.

I will pay you today, sir.

931
01:27:51,093 --> 01:27:53,368
NARRATOR: Thus,
it will be seen, their life...

932
01:27:53,453 --> 01:27:57,366
...for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...

933
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,212
...requiring talent and determination
for success.

934
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:05,643
And required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.

935
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:11,452
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...

936
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:15,972
...and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...

937
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:18,727
...but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.

938

[Classical instrumental melody,
background]

939
01:28:31,135 --> 01:28:35,811
NARRATOR: Five years in the Army,
and considerable experience of the world...

940
01:28:36,575 --> 01:28:40,614
...had dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...

941
01:28:41,335 --> 01:28:43,405
...with which Barry commenced life.

942
01:28:44,055 --> 01:28:48,014
And he had it in mind,
as many gentlemen had done before him...

943
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:51,652
...to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.

944
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:55,084
And, as such things so often happen...

945
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:59,573
...these thoughts coincided
with his setting sight upon a lady...

1101
01:47:29,215 --> 01:47:32,685
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

I'm sorry.

with silver thread.

has ever been woven...

better anywhere.

LADY LYNDON: Pardon me, gentlemen.

1109
01:48:56,775 --> 01:48:58,493
Good morning, dearest.

1110
01:48:59,775 --> 01:49:03,529
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

1111

BARRY: Have a nice time.
I'll see you then.

1112
01:49:06,055 --> 01:49:07,773
Goodbye, little Bryan.

1113

BARRY: Lord Bullingdon.

1114
01:49:15,735 --> 01:49:17,566
Take good care of your mother.

1115
01:49:23,055 --> 01:49:25,569
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.

LADY LYNDON: Lord Bullingdon...

1117
01:49:38,015 --> 01:49:40,688
...is that the way to behave
to your father?

1118

Lord Bullingdon,
have you lost your tongue?

1119
01:49:49,335 --> 01:49:53,726
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

1120
01:49:55,735 --> 01:49:58,408
Lord Bullingdon,
you have insulted your father!

1121

Madam, you have insulted my father.

1122
01:50:07,055 --> 01:50:11,173
Dearest, would you excuse us?
We have something to discuss in private.

...I have always been willing
to live with you on friendly terms.

1134
01:51:01,935 --> 01:51:03,766
But be clear about one thing:

1135
01:51:05,055 --> 01:51:07,046
As men serve me, I serve them.

1136
01:51:08,695 --> 01:51:11,209
I never laid a cane on the back
of a Lord before...

speedily become used to the practice.

No.

NARRATOR: Barry believed, and not
without some reason, that it had been...

...a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...

...and that the evil consequences
that ensued...

NARRATOR: As Bullingdon grew up
to be a man...

1149
01:51:55,735 --> 01:51:58,693
...his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...

over my green silk handkerchief...

a magic flower. I wonder if we can?

as many Artillery men's heads...

I stepped forward.

1187
01:54:11,095 --> 01:54:13,563
"How many heads was it
that you cut off? " He says.

"Nineteen," says I,
"besides wounding several."

1189

Well, I'll be blessed,
if he didn't burst into tears.

BARRY: "Noble, noble fellow,"
he said.

"Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut off."

No, they always become
the property of the King.

I'll tell you one tomorrow.

Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

01:58:37,175 --> 01:58:41,009
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

1254
01:58:41,775 --> 01:58:43,413
...should have a peerage.

And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

1257
01:58:51,255 --> 01:58:53,485
I looked at him, and he said to me:

1258
01:58:53,895 --> 01:58:58,605
"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

NARRATOR: The striving
after this peerage...

1263
01:59:09,095 --> 01:59:11,609
...was one of Barry's
most unlucky dealings.

1264
01:59:13,175 --> 01:59:15,735
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.

1265
01:59:16,935 --> 01:59:19,654
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.

1266
01:59:21,175 --> 01:59:23,643
He bought lands
at ten times their value...

1267
01:59:23,935 --> 01:59:27,974
...purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.

1268
01:59:29,335 --> 01:59:32,805
He gave entertainments
to those friends to his claim...

1269
01:59:33,495 --> 01:59:37,090
...all, being about the Royal person,
were likely to advance it.

1270
01:59:38,495 --> 01:59:43,285
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.

that you would be astonished to know...

to receive his loans.

Your Majesty, may I present
Mr. Barry Lyndon.

Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond

clever enough at gaining a fortune...

...but incapable of keeping one.

For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...

...are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.

1307

Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...

1308
02:02:06,495 --> 02:02:09,612
...which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.

1309
02:02:10,655 --> 02:02:11,929
And his life now...

1310

...seemed to consist mostly of drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...

It means "an effort requiring strength."

Lord Bullingdon...

...Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...

1412

...that now followed him
in town and country.

to his stepson.

on him together.

All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...

...and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.

1418
02:13:17,535 --> 02:13:19,253
Their amount was frightful.

1419
02:13:20,815 --> 02:13:24,774
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...

1420

...of mortgages and insurances,
and all the evils attendant upon them.

that he was not a good and tender father.

He loved his son with a blind partiality.

He denied him nothing.

1439

It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...

1440

...and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...

...as to his future success
and figure in the world.

1442

But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...

1443
02:15:28,055 --> 02:15:30,046
...that he should finish his life...

Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1716
02:41:27,895 --> 02:41:30,250
SIR RICHARD: Is your pistol cocked,
Mr. Lyndon?

1717
02:41:33,055 --> 02:41:33,965
Yes.

1718
02:41:39,055 --> 02:41:40,488
Then prepare to fire.

1719
02:41:46,895 --> 02:41:47,964

Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

1723
02:42:07,255 --> 02:42:10,406
...do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

[Dramatic instrumental beat

1725

SIR RICHARD: Mr. Lyndon,
are you ready?

1727
02:43:10,015 --> 02:43:11,130
[Whispers] Yes.

1728
02:43:13,455 --> 02:43:15,207
SIR RICHARD: Lord Bullingdon...

1729
02:43:15,695 --> 02:43:18,050
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

[Barry gasps]

1738
02:44:40,415 --> 02:44:43,248
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

1739
02:44:44,375 --> 02:44:46,650
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

1740
02:44:47,455 --> 02:44:49,207
...most likely below the knee.

1741
02:44:57,775 --> 02:44:59,003
Lose the leg?

1742
02:45:00,655 --> 02:45:01,610
What for?

1743
02:45:03,775 --> 02:45:06,164
The simple answer is to save your life.

1744
02:45:07,535 --> 02:45:11,494
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1745
02:45:12,775 --> 02:45:15,767
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1746
02:45:15,855 --> 02:45:17,527
...and stop the hemorrhage.

Yes, My Lord?

1751
02:45:50,855 --> 02:45:55,292
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1752
02:45:56,175 --> 02:45:58,325
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1753
02:45:58,615 --> 02:46:02,403
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

1754
02:46:03,215 --> 02:46:04,933
She will want to go to him.

1755
02:46:05,535 --> 02:46:09,528
See that she is out of the house and
on her way to London as soon as possible.

1756
02:46:09,775 --> 02:46:10,810
And in no event...

1757
02:46:10,895 --> 02:46:13,409
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...

1758
02:46:13,655 --> 02:46:16,806
...or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

1764
02:47:30,735 --> 02:47:33,169
MRS. BARRY: How nice
to see you, Graham. Come in.

1765
02:47:33,255 --> 02:47:34,290
Thank you.

1766
02:47:35,895 --> 02:47:38,250
You... received my note?

1767
02:47:38,935 --> 02:47:40,448
Yes, we were expecting you.

1768
02:47:40,535 --> 02:47:43,174
Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

1769
02:47:44,415 --> 02:47:46,406
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

1770
02:47:48,255 --> 02:47:50,815
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1771
02:47:52,095 --> 02:47:53,289
Won't you sit down?

1772
02:47:53,375 --> 02:47:54,888
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

Would you like some tea?

1774

Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.

How's the world treating you, Graham?

1777
02:48:20,095 --> 02:48:22,006
GRAHAM: Are you comfortable here?

1778
02:48:22,095 --> 02:48:23,448
Most comfortable.

1779
02:48:23,535 --> 02:48:24,729
Good, good!

1780
02:48:38,495 --> 02:48:40,963
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1781
02:48:42,855 --> 02:48:44,004
By all means.

GRAHAM: Mr. Lyndon...

1783
02:48:54,375 --> 02:48:57,094
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1784
02:48:57,895 --> 02:49:00,853
...to offer you an annuity...

1785
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:05,324
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

1786
02:49:07,655 --> 02:49:10,647
Specifically on the condition of your...

1787
02:49:12,535 --> 02:49:14,093
...leaving England...

1788
02:49:14,695 --> 02:49:17,255
...and to be stopped...

...the instant of your return.

1790
02:49:23,415 --> 02:49:27,328
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

1791
02:49:28,935 --> 02:49:31,449
...that should you decide to remain here...

1792
02:49:32,135 --> 02:49:35,730
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...

1793
02:49:37,375 --> 02:49:39,172
...into jail.

1794
02:49:40,775 --> 02:49:45,246
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

1795
02:49:46,215 --> 02:49:49,252
...innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

1796
02:49:49,695 --> 02:49:51,731
...debts long-outstanding...

1797
02:49:52,935 --> 02:49:55,495
...and your credit is so blown that...

1798
02:49:56,935 --> 02:49:58,527
...you could not hope...

1799

NARRATOR: Utterly baffled
and beaten...

1802
02:50:33,895 --> 02:50:36,728
...what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?

1803
02:50:38,615 --> 02:50:42,210
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...

1804
02:50:42,855 --> 02:50:44,129
...to complete his recovery.

1805
02:50:45,895 --> 02:50:48,284
Sometime later he travelled abroad.

His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.

1807
02:50:54,855 --> 02:50:58,245
He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...

1808
02:50:58,375 --> 02:51:00,252
...without his former success.

1809
02:51:01,695 --> 02:51:03,651
He never saw Lady Lyndon again.
