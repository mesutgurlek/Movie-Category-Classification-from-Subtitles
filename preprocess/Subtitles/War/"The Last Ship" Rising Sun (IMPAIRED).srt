You have to understand, Mr. President,

a certain way to survive.

329

Now you want to change all that.

330
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:51,797
These ration cards are becoming
a very inflammatory issue.

331
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,932
I know it's an adjustment, but
if you've learned one thing

332
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,034
from all this, it's that the
American people are resilient.

BEATTY: They are resilient. (SIGHS)

335

- is coming to an end.
- The people support him.

336
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,341
People have a very short memory,

337

and you got to know that
out there on the street,

338
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:08,779
it's Chandler and Dr.
Scott who get the credit.

CASTILLO: My wife was
at the market today.

Guy comes into the store,

341
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,251
wants to buy six boxes of cereal.

342
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:15,820
He's got enough money,

343
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:17,387
but his rations for the week
say he can only have one.

344
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,723
Then he looks up on the shelves

345
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,725
and sees 300 boxes sitting there.

346
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:23,093
Half that cereal's going to go stale.

348

by their own grit and
mettle for almost a year.

350

From where they sit,

there instead of here,

one of them would be calling
the shots right now.

353
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,205
That's preposterous.

354
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,507
Beatty was a senator,

355
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,308
and Castillo owned a limousine company.

356
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,443

Approved by Congress, which
makes him the president.

He's unelected.

MICHENER: I know your constituents
don't want to hear it,

but it's an issue of
hoarding versus sharing.

362
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,222
If this guy has more than he needs,

363
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,458
he needs to be sending it to
places<i> without</i> the resources.

we can, Mr. President,

We cannot raise them, either.

Stay on them.

30 knots? That's no fishing vessel.

They're headed for Cat Ba Pass.
That's too narrow for us.

If we come around this island here,

we might be able to cut
them off at daybreak.

00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:16,790
SOP says they'll be within a
20-mile radius of Hai Phong.

650
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,191
We got to be within radio range by now.

651
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:20,959
Don't bother. It's busted.

652
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:27,666
Suitable extraction points
would be here, here, and here,

653
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:30,936
but it's gonna take at least 20
minutes to close the distance.

654
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,139
Hey, Burky, where the hell are they?

655
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,041
They should be closer to shore.

656
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:45,683
New surface contact bearing
0-4-0 at one nautical mile

657
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,885
heading 2-4-5 at 35 knots.

658
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,219
Bridge, TAO.

659
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,421
AIS signals confirmed.

660
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,323
Hostile vessel is back.

661
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:55,406
All fire stations manned,
ready to engage on your mark.

Birds with five inch, sir.

663
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,509
Negative, TAO. We do not fire.

664
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,986
There could be hostages onboard.

665
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:01,883
Recommend adjusting course to intercept.

666
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,600
Cut them off before
they get to our people.

667
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,396
Agreed. OOD, make course 0-2-0.

668
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,273
- All engines ahead flank.
- OOD: Aye, sir.

669
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,206
- Helm, right standard rudder.
- They're going towards those islands,

670
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,541
closing in on our people.

671
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,975
CCS, override all safeties.

672
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:15,277
Enable battle short. We'll cut them off.

673
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,645
(ALARM BLARING)

674
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:18,246
Time to rethink your travel plans.

675
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,248
Tell me your radar works, at least.

676
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,750
- Don't touch that.
- Sasha.

677
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,519
Your ship will identify us as Chinese.

678
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,087
They'll think we're
trying to attack them.

679
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:26,655
You don't think I know that?

680
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:29,491
- There has to be another way.
- One problem at a time.

681
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:31,359
Are you two sleeping together?

682
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,394
Turn it on.

683
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:36,030
Unknown aircraft approaching from 0-8-0.

684
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,532
110 knots.

685
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,766
Sir, we have incoming.

686
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,300
Appears to be a Chinese helo.

687
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:43,872
We got the<i> James.</i>

688
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:46,273
She's 10 miles out, due west-southwest.

689
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:48,308
SASHA: What are you doing?

690
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:49,476
Saying hello.

691
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,712
Aircraft just changed her squawk.

692
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:58,870
1-2-0-9. 1-2-0-9?

693
00:35:58,871 --> 00:35:59,926
Does that mean something to you?

694
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:00,954
- ALISHA: No, no. That can't be.
- What is it?

695
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:02,455
I-It's the CNO.

696
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:03,756
That's his birthday... December 9th.

697
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:05,424
He'd sometimes use that as his ID tag.

698
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:08,460
CNO? Here? On a Chinese helicopter?

699
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,195
30 seconds before we lose the contact.

700
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,764
Hail our guys on that boat.

701
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:13,899
Let them know they got trouble.

704
00:36:17,938 --> 00:36:20,871
We're almost home.

705
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:25,376
Distress warning, 1:00.

706
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:28,647
I'm guessing red's not good.

707
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:31,215
No.

708
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:34,553
Looks like two of our boys
down there on a speedboat.

709
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:36,888
They're being pursued!
We need to help. Keep moving.

710
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:39,629
We're running on fumes. We need to land.

711
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,370
I said keep going!

712
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:43,961
Oh, heads up!

713
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:45,360
Heads up!

714
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:51,333
Get us in closer.
