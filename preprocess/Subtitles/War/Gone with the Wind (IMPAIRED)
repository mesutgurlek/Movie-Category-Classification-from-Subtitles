BRENT:
What do we care if we were expelled?

2
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,873
The war's gonna start,
so we would've left anyhow.

3
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,834
War! Isn’t it exciting, Scarlett?

4
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,586
-Those fool Yankees want a war.
BRENT: We'll show them!

5
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,506
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!

6
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,592
This war talk's spoiling
all the fun at every party.

00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,178
I get so bored I could scream.

8

Besides, there isn't
going to be any war.

9
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,767
BRENT: Not gonna be any war?
-Of course there'll be a war.

10
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,478
If either of you boys
says "war" once again...

11
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,021
...I'll go in the house.

12
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,316
-But, Scarlett!
-Don't you want us to have a war?

13
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,486
BRENT: Wait a minute, honey, please!
STUART: We're sorry.

SCARLETT:
Well....

15
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,619
But remember, I warned you.

16
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,204
I've got an idea!

17
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,874
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

18
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,543
You're eating barbecue with us,
aren't you?

19
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,754
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

20
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,089
We want all your waltzes.

then Brent, and so on.

-Promise?
-Why, I'd just love to.

23
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,390
If only I didn't have every one
of them taken already.

24
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,393
-You can't do that to us!
-We'll tell you a secret.

25
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,769
A secret? Who by?

26
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,646
You know Melanie Hamilton?

27
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,316
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting--

28
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,277
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?

29
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,029
Anyway, we heard-- They say--

30
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,323
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.

31
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,160
-Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
STUART: Do we get those waltzes?

32
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,828
Of course.

-What's gotten into her?
-Suppose we made her mad?

How come you didn't ask them
gentlemen to supper?

You got no more manners
than a field hand.

GERALD: Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
so you've been spying on me.

55
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,033
Like your sister, you'll tell
your mother that I was jumping again.

56
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,410
You know I'm no tattletale
like Suellen.

57
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,080
But after you broke your knee
last year jumping that fence--

I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.

It's my own neck, so it is.

60
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,714
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.

-How are they at Twelve Oaks?
-The Wilkeses?

In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue
and talking nothing but war.

Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?

64
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,935
Their cousin Melanie
and her brother, Charles.

65
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,564
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,
mealy-mouthed ninny!

66
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,191
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.

What's your interest
in Ashley and Miss Melanie?

00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,659
Nothing. Let's go into the house.

70
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,162
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

-No.
-Nor will he.

tomorrow night at the ball.

Have you been running after a man
who's not in love with you?

When you might have any other?

I haven't been running after him,
it's just a surprise.

Now, don't be jerking
your chin at me!

83

If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.

I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

I would! I would!

86

What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.

And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.

...that land doesn't mean
anything to you?

Land is the only thing in the
world worth working for...

92
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,886
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.

-It's the only thing that lasts!
-You talk like an Irishman.

94

...that you're half Irish too.

of Irish blood in them...

is like their mother.

this love of the land.

00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,519
Just hold on and suck in!

154
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,022
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.

155
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,775
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.

156
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes'm, you is!

157
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,528
You's gonna eat every mouthful.

158
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,449
No, I'm not!

159
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,411
Put on the dress.
We're late already.

160
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,330
-What my lamb gonna wear?
-That.

161
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,459
No, you ain't! You can't show
your bosom before 3:00!

162
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,586
I'm gonna speak to your ma!

163
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,923
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.

164
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,719
Well....

165
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,188
Keep your shawl on. I ain't
aiming for you to get freckled...

166
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,901
...after the buttermilk I done put
on you, bleaching them freckles.

167
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,745
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on
and be good and eat just a little, honey.

168
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,791
No! I'm going to have a good time
today and eat at the barbecue.

169
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,794
If you don't care
what folks says, I does!

170
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:50,133
You can always tell a lady by how
she eats in front of folks like a bird.

171
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,637
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!

172
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,347
Fiddle-dee-dee!

173
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,892
Ashley told me he likes
girls with a healthy appetite.

174
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,812
MAMMY: What gentlemens says
and thinks is different things.

175
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,024
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking for to marry you.

176
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,753
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
a having it come right back up again.

177
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,591
Why is it a girl has to be
so silly to catch a husband?

178
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,720
GERALD: Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not
down here by the time I count 10...

179
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,056
-...we'll go without you!
-I'm coming, Pa!

180
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,436
GERALD:
One, two, three, four, five....

181
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,147
Oh, dear!

182
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,735
My stays are so tight, I'll never
get through the day without belching!

183
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,427
GERALD:
Well, John Wilkes.

184
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,931
-It's a grand day for the barbecue.
-So it seems, Gerald.

185
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,808
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

186
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,603
She's settling accounts with the overseer,
but she'll be along tonight.

187
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,482
-Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
-Thank you kindly, India.

188
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,819
Your daughter's getting
prettier every day, John.

189
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,905
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

190
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,367
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.

191
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,244
That's your brother's business.

192
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,913
You must remember
your duties as hostess.

193
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,666
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.

194
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,709
Good morning, Scarlett.

195
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,046
India Wilkes,
what a lovely dress!

196
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,966
I just can't take my eyes off it.

197
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,468
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.

198
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,222
You look mighty fine
this morning, Miss Scarlett.

199
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,601
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.

200
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,564
Ashley!

201
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,152
Scarlett, my dear!

202
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,654
I've been looking for you everywhere.

203
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,616
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?

204
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,412
Yes, I'd like to, but I have
something to tell you too.

205
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,249
Something I hope
you'll be glad to hear.

206
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,626
Come say hello
to my cousin Melanie first.

207
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,503
Oh, do we have to?

208
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,507
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again. Melanie!

209
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,429
ASHLEY: Here's Scarlett.
-Scarlett!

210
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,015
I'm so glad to see you again.

211
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,934
Melanie, what a surprise
to run into you here.

212
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,395
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.

213
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,107
I hope I shall stay long enough
for us to become real friends.

214
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,110
-I do want us to be.
-We'll keep her here, won't we?

215
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,030
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!

216
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,033
If anybody can give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.

217
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,536
Our good times must seem silly
to you. You're so serious.

218
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,497
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

219
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,834
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.

220
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,879
You mustn't flatter me
and say things you don't mean.

221
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,674
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

222
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,927
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?

223
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,429
He never means a word
he says to any girl.

224
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,391
Why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

225
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,060
But, Miss O'Hara, I--

226
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,148
Was it kind to bring your good-looking
brother here to break my poor heart?

227
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,653
Now that Charles is your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

228
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,197
Charles, I want to eat
barbecue with you.

229
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,034
Don't go philandering with any other girl,
because I'm mighty jealous.

230
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,621
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!

231
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,917
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look
dashing with those new whiskers.

232
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,544
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

233
00:20:56,004 --> 00:21:01,092
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with
them, but I told them I promised you.

234
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,137
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.

235
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,307
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

236
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,559
I'll see what I can do.

237
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,312
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?

238
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,399
As if I couldn't do better
than that old maid in britches.

239
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,026
SCARLETT: Brent and Stuart,
you handsome old things!

240
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,446
-I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
-What have we done?

241
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,242
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.

242
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,286
I was counting on eating with you.

243
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,205
-You are, Scarlett.
-Of course you are, honey.

244
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,959
I never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest.

245
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,587
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.

246
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,381
Oh, shucks!

247
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,595
-Cathleen, who's that?
-Who?

248
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,973
That man looking at us and smiling.

249
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,349
The nasty dark one.

250
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,520
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.

251
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,273
He has a most terrible reputation.

252
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,614
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy.

253
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,367
My dear, he isn't received.

254
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,496
He spends his time up North
because his folks won't speak to him.

255
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,999
He was expelled
from West Point, he's so fast.

256
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,252
And there's that business
about the girl he wouldn't marry.

257
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,587
Tell, tell!

258
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:24,842
He took her out buggy-riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon...

259
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,137
...and then he refused to marry her!

260
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,185
No, but she was ruined just the same.

261
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,358
Ashley....

262
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,569
-Happy?
-So happy.

263
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,697
ASHLEY:
You seem to belong here...

264
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,617
...as if it had all been
imagined for you.

265
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,245
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

266
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,374
-You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
-Yes, Ashley.

267
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,252
I love it as more than a house.

268
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,215
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

269
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,302
It's so unaware
that it may not last forever.

270
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,722
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes?

271
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,892
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

272
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,396
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

273
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,732
Whatever comes, I'll love you...

274
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,112
...just as I do now, until I die.

275
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,951
Isn’t this better than a table?

276
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,079
A girl hasn't got but two sides
to her at a table.

277
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,998
-I'll get her dessert.
-She said me!

278
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,458
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?

279
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,838
I think....

280
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,798
Hmm....

281
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,843
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

282
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,140
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!

283
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,393
STUART: Go get it, boy!
Isn’t he the luckiest....

284
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,777
Miss O'Hara...

285
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,280
...I love you.

286
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,033
I don't guess I'm as hungry
as I thought.

287
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,914
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.

288
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,375
Well-brought-up ladies
takes naps at parties.

289
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,254
It's time you behave and act
like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

290
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,425
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.

291
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,887
And you won't see no Yankee
girls at the ball, neither.

292
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,555
How was Ashley today?

293
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,266
He didn't pay much attention to you.

294
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,976
You mind your own business!

295
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,604
You'll be lucky you don't lose
whisker-face Kennedy.

296
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,357
You're sweet on Ashley, and his
engagement's being announced tonight.

297
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,443
That's as much as you know.

298
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:52,281
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!

299
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,326
If you's old enough for parties,
you should act like ladies!

300
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,119
Who cares?

301
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,464
GERALD: We've borne enough insults
from the Yankees.

302
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,802
We'll keep our slaves
with or without their approval.

303
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,597
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.

304
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,600
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

305
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,980
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.

306
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,399
-There's no other way.
MAN 1: That's right!

307
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,526
MAN 1:
Let the Yankees ask for peace.

308
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:15,114
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

309
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,992
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.

310
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,079
BRENT: One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
STUART: We'll beat them in one battle.

311
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,665
Gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble.

312

Gentlemen always fight better.

GERALD: What does the captain
of our Troop say?

314
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,215
Well, gentlemen,
if Georgia fights, I go with her.

315
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,510
I hope the Yankees let us
leave the Union in peace.

316

BRENT:
Ashley, they've insulted us!

317

STUART:
You can't mean you don't want war?

318
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,684
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

319
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,814
And when the wars were over,
no one ever knew what they were about.

320
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,527
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's
been up North, I hear.

321
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,154
Don't you agree with us?

322
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,866
I think it's hard winning
a war with words.

323
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,326
What do you mean, sir?

324
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,078
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

325
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,289
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

326
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,459
It'll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

327
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,420
Are you hinting
that the Yankees can lick us?

328
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,796
No, I'm not hinting.

329
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,758
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

330
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,177
They've got factories,
shipyards, coal mines...

331
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,138
...and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us.

332
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,933
All we've got is cotton and slaves,
and arrogance.

333
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,853
I refuse to listen
to any renegade talk!

334
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,399
-I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
-Apologies aren't enough, sir.

335
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,235
I hear you were turned out
of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.

336
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,072
And you aren't received in
any family in Charleston.

337
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,490
Not even your own!

338
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,623
I apologize again
for all my shortcomings.

339
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,585
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?

340
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,172

brandy and cigars...

from somebody like Rhett Butler.

GERALD:
You did everything but call him out.

344
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,814
-He refused to fight.
-Not quite there, Charles.

345
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,733
-He refused to take advantage of you.
-Take advantage of me?

346
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,028
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved many times.

347
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,906
-He's got steadier hands than yours.
-Well, I'll show him!

348
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,617
Please. Don't go tweaking
his nose anymore.

349
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,829
You may be needed for more
important fighting.

350
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,331
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.

351
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,834
I think I'll just show him around.

Isn’t it enough that you gathered
every other man's heart today?

You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

Don't tease me now.

Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!

You mustn't say such things.

368
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,027
You'll hate me for hearing them.

369
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,906
I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

Yes, I care.

Don't you--?
Don't you want to marry me?

I'm going to marry Melanie.

But you can't!
Not if you care for me!

Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,725
How can I make you understand?

You're so young, you don't
know what marriage means.

I know I love you,

You don't love Melanie.

She's like me, Scarlett.

She's my blood
and we understand each other.

How could I help loving you?

You have all the passion
for life that I lack.

That kind of love isn't enough
for two people as different as we are.

Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

You'd marry that fool

Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...

02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:09,010
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:23,918
Miss Scarlett!

1514
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:25,337
Don't spoil it.

1515
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:28,423
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!

1516
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,717
He's her husband, ain't he?

1517
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:44,939
-Miss Scarlett?
-High time you got back.

1518
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:48,193
-Did you get the horse shod?
-Yes'm, he's shod.

1519
02:02:48,402 --> 02:02:50,779
Fine thing, horses
get shoes and humans can't.

1520
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,655
Here, stir this soap.

1521
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,074
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?

1522
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:57,535
I gotta know how much money
have you got left. In gold.

1523
02:02:57,745 --> 02:02:59,746
Ten dollars. Why?

1524
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:01,748
That won't be enough.

1525
02:03:01,957 --> 02:03:03,708
What are you talking about?

1526
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:08,171
Well, I see'd that old no-count
white-trash Wilkerson...

1527
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:10,965
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

1528
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:14,719
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...

1529
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:19,933
...that his Carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

1530
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:24,729
-How much more we got to pay?
-I hear the taxman say $300.

1531
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:26,398
Three hundred--!

1532
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:31,820
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

1533
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,739
Yes'm. How?

1534
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:40,161
-I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
-He ain't got no $300.

1535
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:43,081
Well, I can ask him
if I want to, can't I?

1536
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:47,168
Asking ain't getting.

1537
02:03:56,178 --> 02:03:57,720
Ashley....

1538
02:03:58,722 --> 02:04:01,850
They say Abe Lincoln
got his start splitting rails.

1539
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:05,019
Just think what heights I may
climb to, once I get the knack.

1540
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:09,524
Ashley, the Yankees
want $300 more in taxes.

1541
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:12,277
What shall we do?

1542
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:14,988
Ashley, what's to become of us?

1543
02:04:15,197 --> 02:04:18,741
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

1544
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:21,661
Those with brains and courage
come through all right.

1545
02:04:21,871 --> 02:04:23,538
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

1546
02:04:23,789 --> 02:04:25,039
For heaven's sake...

1547
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:28,751
...don't talk nonsense
when it's us being winnowed out!

1548
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:33,548
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am
talking tommyrot about civilization...

1549
02:04:33,799 --> 02:04:35,884
...while your Tara is in danger.

1550
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:38,970
You've come to me for help,
and I've none to give.

1551
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:43,141
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.

1552
02:04:43,517 --> 02:04:45,643
You, Ashley? A coward?

1553
02:04:46,228 --> 02:04:47,770
What are you afraid of?

1554
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:52,525
Mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

1555
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:55,278
Not that I mind splitting rails.

1556
02:04:55,654 --> 02:05:00,408
But I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.

1557
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:07,081
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

1558
02:05:07,374 --> 02:05:08,583
But the war did come.

1559
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:11,753
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

1560
02:05:12,004 --> 02:05:15,089
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

1561
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:20,512
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

1562
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:22,931
A world in which there's
no place for me.

1563
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,811
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.

1564
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:31,731
You never mind facing realities.

1565
02:05:32,441 --> 02:05:34,943
You never want to escape
from them as I do.

1566
02:05:37,613 --> 02:05:39,239
Escape?

1567
02:05:40,324 --> 02:05:44,452
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.

1568
02:05:44,745 --> 02:05:49,457
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

1569
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:53,211
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton
till I can't stand it.

1570
02:05:53,462 --> 02:05:55,755
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!

1571
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:59,884
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us.

1572
02:06:02,137 --> 02:06:03,596
Oh, Ashley....

1573
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:07,100
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.

1574
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:10,311
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.

1575
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:12,605
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!

1576
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:16,276
You don't love Melanie. You said
you loved me at Twelve Oaks.

1577
02:06:16,485 --> 02:06:18,653
And anyway, Melanie can't--

1578
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:22,657
Dr. Meade said she can't have
more children. I could give you--

1579
02:06:22,908 --> 02:06:24,492
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?

1580
02:06:24,785 --> 02:06:26,995
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?

1581
02:06:27,288 --> 02:06:30,331
Can you honestly say
you don't love me?

1582
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,418
-No, I don't love you.
-It's a lie!

1583
02:06:33,627 --> 02:06:36,588
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?

1584
02:06:36,797 --> 02:06:39,507
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

1585
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,093
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!

1586
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,972
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

1587
02:06:47,182 --> 02:06:49,267
You've carried the load
for all of us.

1588
02:06:49,476 --> 02:06:52,520
From now on, I'll be more help
to you. I promise.

1589
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:54,689
There's only one way you can help me.

1590
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:59,110
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.

1591
02:06:59,987 --> 02:07:01,404
Nothing?

1592
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:05,158
Nothing except honor.

1593
02:07:17,713 --> 02:07:21,466
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.

1594
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:26,429
You mustn't. Please,
my brave dear, you mustn't.

1595
02:07:38,525 --> 02:07:41,235
SCARLETT:
You do love me! You do love me!

1596
02:07:41,445 --> 02:07:43,738
-No, don't, don't.
-You love me.

1597
02:07:44,031 --> 02:07:46,199
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!

1598
02:07:46,408 --> 02:07:49,202
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.

1599
02:07:49,453 --> 02:07:52,080
-Say it. You love me.
-All right, I'll say it.

1600
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:56,417
I love your courage and stubbornness
so much that I could forget...

1601
02:07:56,585 --> 02:08:01,255
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!

1602
02:08:10,432 --> 02:08:12,934
Then there's nothing left for me.

1603
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,062
Nothing to fight for.

1604
02:08:16,772 --> 02:08:18,981
Nothing to live for.

1605
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,569
Yes, there is something.

1606
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:26,864
Something you love better than me...

1607
02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:28,991
...though you may not know it.

1608
02:08:34,998 --> 02:08:36,499
Tara.

1609
02:08:39,878 --> 02:08:41,212
Yes.

1610
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:45,258
I still have this.

1611
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:51,514
You needn't go.

1612
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:56,310
I won't have you all starve, simply
because I threw myself at your head.

1613
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,230
It won't happen again.

1614
02:09:26,842 --> 02:09:28,009
SCARLETT:
It's Emmie Slattery.

1615
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:29,469
-Yes'm, it's me.
SCARLETT: Stop!

1616
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:33,639
You haven't forgotten
your old overseer, have you?

1617
02:09:34,349 --> 02:09:36,350
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

1618
02:09:36,602 --> 02:09:39,187
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!

1619
02:09:39,646 --> 02:09:41,355
You can't speak that way to my wife.

1620
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:43,649
Wife? High time
you made her your wife.

1621
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:46,277
Who baptized your brats
after you killed my mother?

1622
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,488
We came out here to pay a call.

1623
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:51,699
A friendly call, and talk business
with old friends.

1624
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:54,368
Friends? When were we ever friends?

1625
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:57,705
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

1626
02:09:57,956 --> 02:09:59,332
Your father's turned idiot.

1627
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:03,461
You can't pay your taxes, and I come
to offer to buy the place from you.

1628
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:07,089
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.

1629
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:09,300
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!

1630
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:14,138
WILKERSON: You'll see who's running
things when you're sold out for taxes.

1631
02:10:14,389 --> 02:10:16,682
I'll buy this place
and I'll live in it!

1632
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,519
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.

1633
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:22,230
SCARLETT:
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

1634
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,358
You'll be sorry for that.

1635
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,243
WILKERSON:
We'll be back!

1636
02:10:35,494 --> 02:10:38,079
I'll show you who
the owner of Tara is!

1637
02:10:43,377 --> 02:10:44,919
SCARLETT:
Pa, come back!

1638
02:10:47,923 --> 02:10:49,757
Pa, come back!

1639
02:10:51,885 --> 02:10:53,386
Yankee coward!

1640
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,353
SCARLETT:
Pa!

1641
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,877
PORK: Lordy, Miss Scarlett,
that's Mr. Gerald's watch!

1642
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:29,088
SCARLETT: You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

1643
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:32,550
You ain't got no business
parting from this watch now.

1644
02:11:32,801 --> 02:11:36,095
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

1645
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:38,973
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?

1646
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:41,976
And don't cry.

1647
02:11:42,185 --> 02:11:44,812
I can stand everybody's
tears but yours.

1648
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:51,068
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

1649
02:11:56,325 --> 02:12:00,703
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.

1650
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:04,832
-Think about your Pa like he used to be.
-I can't think about Pa.

1651
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:07,251
I can't think of anything
but that $300.

1652
02:12:07,502 --> 02:12:11,923
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.

1653
02:12:12,215 --> 02:12:16,302
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags
got that much money now.

1654
02:12:17,804 --> 02:12:18,846
Rhett.

1655
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:21,724
MAMMY:
Who that? A Yankee?

1656
02:12:25,979 --> 02:12:29,607
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...

1657
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:32,151
...and I haven't any clothes.

1658
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:44,246
Go and get Ma's old box
of dress patterns.

1659
02:12:44,498 --> 02:12:47,208
-What you up to?
-You'll make me a new dress.

1660
02:12:47,459 --> 02:12:49,877
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!

1661
02:12:50,128 --> 02:12:52,838
Great balls of fire!
They're my portières now.

1662
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:56,759
I'm going to Atlanta for $300,
and I've got to look like a queen.

1663
02:12:56,969 --> 02:12:58,761
-Who's going with you?
-I'll go alone.

1664
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:03,057
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.

1665
02:13:03,308 --> 02:13:06,060
-Mammy, darling.
-No use to try to sweet talk me.

1666
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:08,771
I knows you since I put
diapers on you.

1667
02:13:09,022 --> 02:13:12,066
I said I's going with you,
and going I is!

1668
02:13:12,275 --> 02:13:15,486
RHETT: Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.

1669
02:13:16,196 --> 02:13:18,489
It's a pity the war
wasn't a poker game.

1670
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:21,575
You'd done better than Grant,
with far less effort.

1671
02:13:21,743 --> 02:13:22,785
What is it?

1672
02:13:23,036 --> 02:13:26,580
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.

1673
02:13:26,873 --> 02:13:28,416
Another sister?

1674
02:13:28,667 --> 02:13:30,918
MAJOR:
This is a jail not a harem, captain.

1675
02:13:31,211 --> 02:13:34,588
CORPORAL: No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.

1676
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:37,425
She has?

1677
02:13:38,051 --> 02:13:41,595
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.

1678
02:13:42,806 --> 02:13:46,600
Let's see, my losses for
the afternoon come to what?

1679
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,520
Three hundred and forty?

1680
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:52,523
My debts do mount up,
don't they, major?

1681
02:13:52,733 --> 02:13:57,528
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.

1682
02:13:57,738 --> 02:14:00,781
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1683
02:14:05,037 --> 02:14:09,707
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

1684
02:14:10,625 --> 02:14:13,127
-Rhett!
-Scarlett!

1685
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:16,422
My dear little sister!

1686
02:14:16,798 --> 02:14:21,427
It's all right, corporal. My sister
has brought me no files or saws.

1687
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,641
Can I really kiss you?

1688
02:14:27,934 --> 02:14:29,810
On the forehead, like a good brother.

1689
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:33,314
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope
for better things.

1690
02:14:33,565 --> 02:14:36,484
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.

1691
02:14:36,735 --> 02:14:40,654
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?

1692
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:42,490
Would you be sorry?

1693
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,408
-Oh, Rhett.
-Well, don't worry yet.

1694
02:14:44,659 --> 02:14:47,745
They trumped up a charge,
but they really want my money.

1695
02:14:47,996 --> 02:14:50,664
They think I made off
with the Confederate treasury.

1696
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,459
-Well, did you?
-What a leading question.

1697
02:14:53,668 --> 02:14:55,878
Let's not talk about things
like money.

1698
02:14:56,129 --> 02:14:59,507
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!

1699
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:02,510
How you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

1700
02:15:02,803 --> 02:15:07,306
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.

1701
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:10,351
You look good enough to eat,
and prosperous.

1702
02:15:10,602 --> 02:15:14,021
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...

1703
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:17,775
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

1704
02:15:18,026 --> 02:15:20,528
You're heartless,
but that's part of your charm.

1705
02:15:20,695 --> 02:15:22,863
You've got more charm
than the law allows.

1706
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,449
I didn't come to talk
silliness about me.

1707
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:28,536
I was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble.

1708
02:15:28,787 --> 02:15:31,705
I was mad at you when
you left me on the road to Tara.

1709
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:34,875
-And I still haven't forgiven you.
-Don't say that.

1710
02:15:35,127 --> 02:15:39,046
Well, I must admit I might not be
alive now, only for you.

1711
02:15:39,297 --> 02:15:43,050
When I think of myself
with anything I could possibly hope for...

1712
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:47,138
...not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail.

1713
02:15:47,347 --> 02:15:51,058
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!

1714
02:15:51,726 --> 02:15:54,145
Listen to me trying to make jokes...

1715
02:15:54,354 --> 02:15:56,063
...when I really want to cry.

1716
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:58,315
In a minute I shall cry.

1717
02:16:01,736 --> 02:16:03,028
Scarlett....

1718
02:16:03,363 --> 02:16:04,905
Can it be possible that--?

1719
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:06,949
Can what be possible, Rhett?

1720
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:10,703
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.

1721
02:16:10,954 --> 02:16:14,039
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

1722
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:19,170
It's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

1723
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:22,756
It's well worth it.

1724
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:29,597
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolia.

1725
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:33,767
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?

1726
02:16:34,102 --> 02:16:39,190
-I went riding without my gloves--
-You've been working like a field hand!

1727
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:41,567
Why did you lie,
and what are you up to?

1728
02:16:41,776 --> 02:16:44,904
-I almost believed you cared.
-But I do care!

1729
02:16:45,113 --> 02:16:48,240
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...

1730
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:50,576
...to put on quite a
show in your velvets.

1731
02:16:50,785 --> 02:16:53,204
What is it? Money?

1732
02:16:53,413 --> 02:16:55,998
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

1733
02:16:56,249 --> 02:16:58,709
I lied when I said
everything was all right.

1734
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:03,464
Things are as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions.

1735
02:17:04,466 --> 02:17:06,050
What collateral do you have?

1736
02:17:06,259 --> 02:17:07,760
-My earbobs.
-Not interested.

1737
02:17:07,969 --> 02:17:10,262
-Mortgage on Tara.
-What would I do with a farm?

1738
02:17:10,472 --> 02:17:14,892
-I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
-Not good enough.

1739
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:19,813
You once said you loved me.

1740
02:17:20,023 --> 02:17:21,482
If you still love me....

1741
02:17:22,275 --> 02:17:24,652
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.

1742
02:17:25,528 --> 02:17:28,280
No, I haven't forgotten.

1743
02:17:33,536 --> 02:17:35,663
You're not worth $300.

1744
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:38,791
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

1745
02:17:39,251 --> 02:17:42,086
SCARLETT: I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

1746
02:17:42,337 --> 02:17:46,006
I won't let Tara go! I can't while
there's a breath left in my body.

1747
02:17:46,174 --> 02:17:49,843
Oh, Rhett, won't you please
give me the money?

1748
02:17:50,136 --> 02:17:52,179
I couldn't if I wanted to.

1749
02:17:52,430 --> 02:17:54,348
My funds are in Liverpool,
not Atlanta.

1750
02:17:54,599 --> 02:17:58,352
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me
like a duck on a June bug.

1751
02:17:58,603 --> 02:18:02,356
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

1752
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:09,280
Here, here. Stop it! You want
the Yankees to see you like this?

1753
02:18:09,531 --> 02:18:13,617
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.

1754
02:18:13,868 --> 02:18:17,037
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and you let me go on!

1755
02:18:17,205 --> 02:18:19,957
I enjoyed hearing
what you had to say. Cheer up.

1756
02:18:20,166 --> 02:18:22,376
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.

1757
02:18:22,627 --> 02:18:24,378
I'll come to your hanging!

1758
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:28,632
I'm just afraid they won't hang you
in time to pay the taxes on Tara!

1759
02:18:35,181 --> 02:18:36,724
BELLE:
Tell him Belle Watling.

1760
02:18:36,891 --> 02:18:39,893
Where you been? I thought
you deserted Captain Butler.

1761
02:18:40,186 --> 02:18:42,813
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.

1762
02:18:51,531 --> 02:18:55,409
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.

1763
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:57,202
You know a dyed-haired woman?

1764
02:18:57,412 --> 02:19:00,581
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.

1765
02:19:02,667 --> 02:19:04,543
Whatever they done
to you in there...

1766
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:08,714
...they didn't do no more than you
deserve for visiting white trash.

1767
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,848
MAN 1: Fresh and green.
MAN 2: Right off the farm.

1768
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:21,769
MAN 3: What you doing tonight, Susie?
MAN 4: That's a Georgia peach!

1769
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:23,687
MAN 5:
Nothing like that in Ohio.

1770
02:19:23,855 --> 02:19:25,272
CARPETBAGGER:
You know what we'll do?

1771
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,482
MAN 6:
What?

1772
02:19:26,649 --> 02:19:29,526
We're gonna give every one of you
40 acres and a mule.

1773
02:19:29,778 --> 02:19:32,529
MAN 7: And a mule?
-Forty acres and a mule!

1774
02:19:32,697 --> 02:19:35,115
MAN 7: Gee!
-Because we're your friend.

1775
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:39,661
And you're gonna become voters
and vote like your friends do!

1776
02:19:41,581 --> 02:19:44,041
MAN 8: What's your hurry?
MAMMY: What's come over this town?

1777
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:47,961
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.

1778
02:19:50,131 --> 02:19:51,965
MAMMY:
Out of our way, trash!

1779
02:19:52,258 --> 02:19:54,885
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.

1780
02:20:03,186 --> 02:20:04,686
FRANK:
It can't be Miss Scarlett!

1781
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:06,605
SCARLETT: Frank Kennedy!
FRANK: And Mammy.

1782
02:20:06,815 --> 02:20:08,690
MAMMY:
It's good to see home folks.

1783
02:20:08,942 --> 02:20:11,777
FRANK: I didn't know you were here.
SCARLETT: I didn't know you were.

1784
02:20:11,986 --> 02:20:14,279
Didn't Suellen tell you
about my store?

1785
02:20:14,489 --> 02:20:17,408
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

1786
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:21,161
-This?
-Won't you come in, look around a bit?

1787
02:20:29,337 --> 02:20:31,839
I don't suppose
it looks like much to a lady...

1788
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:34,341
...but I can't help being proud of it.

1789
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:37,428
-You're not making money?
-Well, I can't complain.

1790
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:39,346
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

1791
02:20:39,597 --> 02:20:42,015
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.

1792
02:20:42,308 --> 02:20:45,185
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.

1793
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:48,730
-Are you doing as well as all that?
-Yes, I am.

1794
02:20:48,982 --> 02:20:50,607
I'm no millionaire yet...

1795
02:20:50,859 --> 02:20:53,277
...but I've cleared $1000 already.

1796
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:54,987
SCARLETT:
And lumber too.

1797
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:59,366
-That's only a sideline.
-A sideline, Frank?

1798
02:20:59,534 --> 02:21:03,454
With all the good Georgia pine
around Atlanta, and all this building?

1799
02:21:03,663 --> 02:21:06,373
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...

1800
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:08,959
...and I gotta think
about buying a home.

1801
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:10,544
Why would you want a home?

1802
02:21:10,795 --> 02:21:13,046
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.

1803
02:21:13,506 --> 02:21:14,965
Here in Atlanta.

1804
02:21:15,175 --> 02:21:17,468
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.

1805
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,387
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

1806
02:21:21,264 --> 02:21:23,182
I don't know what you mean.

1807
02:21:24,058 --> 02:21:25,809
I don't mean a thing.

1808
02:21:26,478 --> 02:21:29,313
How'd you like to drive me
to my Aunt Pitty's?

1809
02:21:29,647 --> 02:21:31,982
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.

1810
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:33,775
You better stay to supper.

1811
02:21:34,027 --> 02:21:37,196
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,
and I'd like a long visit.

1812
02:21:37,405 --> 02:21:40,908
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

1813
02:21:41,242 --> 02:21:43,285
And will you tell me all the news...

1814
02:21:43,536 --> 02:21:44,912
...of Miss Suellen?

1815
02:21:48,082 --> 02:21:51,168
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

1816
02:21:51,669 --> 02:21:55,172
Oh, no, no. I thought
surely she had written you.

1817
02:21:55,381 --> 02:21:58,592
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.

1818
02:21:58,843 --> 02:22:01,094
How awful to have such a mean sister.

1819
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:03,180
You must tell me.

1820
02:22:03,431 --> 02:22:05,390
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

1821
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,936
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

1822
02:22:10,021 --> 02:22:13,690
She got tired of waiting,
was afraid she'd be an old maid and....

1823
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:16,818
Oh, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.

1824
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:19,947
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.

1825
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,450
Would you mind if I put my hand
in your pocket?

1826
02:22:39,467 --> 02:22:42,302
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done!

1827
02:22:42,554 --> 02:22:44,972
She's gone and married
my Mr. Kennedy!

1828
02:22:45,223 --> 02:22:47,266
He's my beau and she's married him!

1829
02:22:47,475 --> 02:22:50,727
-She did it to save Tara.
-I hate Tara!

1830
02:22:50,979 --> 02:22:54,565
SUELLEN: I hate Scarlett! She's
the only thing I hate worse than Tara!

1831
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,612
It's all my fault.

1832
02:23:01,447 --> 02:23:04,616
I should've committed robbery
to get that tax money for you.

1833
02:23:04,867 --> 02:23:07,119
I couldn't let you do
anything like that.

1834
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:08,787
Anyway, it's done now.

1835
02:23:08,997 --> 02:23:11,164
Yes, it's done now.

1836
02:23:11,374 --> 02:23:13,500
You won't let me do
anything dishonorable...

1837
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:16,837
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

1838
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:19,840
You won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

1839
02:23:21,509 --> 02:23:22,926
What do you mean?

1840
02:23:23,177 --> 02:23:25,012
ASHLEY:
I'm going to New York.

1841
02:23:26,264 --> 02:23:27,973
I've arranged
for a position in a bank.

1842
02:23:28,182 --> 02:23:30,183
But you can't do that.

1843
02:23:32,395 --> 02:23:35,814
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and....

1844
02:23:35,982 --> 02:23:37,024
I counted on you.

1845
02:23:37,275 --> 02:23:40,027
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.

1846
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,696
You know as much as you do
about banking...

1847
02:23:42,989 --> 02:23:45,699
...and I'd give you half the business.

1848
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:48,493
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

1849
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,454
But it isn't that.

1850
02:23:50,663 --> 02:23:53,540
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

1851
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:56,209
...I'd bury any hope
of ever standing alone.

1852
02:23:56,461 --> 02:23:57,794
SCARLETT:
Oh, is that all?

1853
02:23:58,004 --> 02:24:02,716
You could gradually buy the business,
and then it would be your own and--

1854
02:24:03,384 --> 02:24:04,843
No, Scarlett.

1855
02:24:07,472 --> 02:24:09,848
Oh! Ashley!

1856
02:24:10,558 --> 02:24:11,933
[FEIGNS CRYING]

1857
02:24:17,315 --> 02:24:18,899
Ashley!

1858
02:24:26,366 --> 02:24:27,449
Scarlett?

1859
02:24:28,826 --> 02:24:30,077
Scarlett, what is it?

1860
02:24:30,328 --> 02:24:32,704
SCARLETT:
Ashley's so mean and hateful!

1861
02:24:32,955 --> 02:24:34,665
MELANIE:
What have you done?

1862
02:24:35,375 --> 02:24:37,918
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

1863
02:24:38,503 --> 02:24:42,172
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!

1864
02:24:42,757 --> 02:24:44,549
How unchivalrous of you.

1865
02:24:44,759 --> 02:24:46,760
Why, think, Ashley, think!

1866
02:24:47,011 --> 02:24:50,097
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...

1867
02:24:50,264 --> 02:24:52,766
...and maybe we wouldn't have
little Beau.

1868
02:24:52,975 --> 02:24:55,435
When I think of her picking cotton
and plowing...

1869
02:24:55,687 --> 02:24:58,230
...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just--

1870
02:24:58,439 --> 02:25:00,524
Oh, my darling.

1871
02:25:04,570 --> 02:25:07,280
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.

1872
02:25:09,492 --> 02:25:11,410
I can't fight you both.

1873
02:25:26,259 --> 02:25:28,260
GALLEGHER:
Come on, lift them feet!

1874
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:33,515
There's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.

1875
02:25:33,766 --> 02:25:36,810
The pick of all the best jails
in Georgia.

1876
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:40,313
SCARLETT: They look thin and weak.
GALLEGHER: Halt!

1877
02:25:42,942 --> 02:25:44,317
They're the best you can lease.

1878
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:47,279
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher
a free hand...

1879
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,740
...you'll get what you want
out of them.

1880
02:25:49,949 --> 02:25:51,825
All right, you're the foreman.

1881
02:25:52,076 --> 02:25:55,412
Just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.

1882
02:25:55,663 --> 02:25:58,498
GALLEGHER: Johnnie Gallegher's
your man, miss. But remember...

1883
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,293
...no questions and no interference.

1884
02:26:01,669 --> 02:26:04,129
SCARLETT: That's a bargain.
Start in the morning.

1885
02:26:04,338 --> 02:26:06,298
GALLEGHER:
Come on, get a move on there!

1886
02:26:06,507 --> 02:26:11,261
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman--

1887
02:26:11,471 --> 02:26:12,679
Why do you complain?

1888
02:26:12,972 --> 02:26:15,182
You wouldn't own a mill
if I didn't take over.

1889
02:26:15,349 --> 02:26:17,058
But I didn't want the mill.

1890
02:26:17,268 --> 02:26:20,937
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't
pressed our friends for their debts.

1891
02:26:21,105 --> 02:26:22,272
Isn’t that right, Ashley?

1892
02:26:22,482 --> 02:26:24,566
Are you running
a charitable institution?

1893
02:26:24,817 --> 02:26:28,195
Go back to the store, and go home
and take your medicine.

1894
02:26:28,488 --> 02:26:30,030
Sugar, don't you think--?

1895
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:33,950
Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar."

1896
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:37,621
All right. All right.
Good night, Ashley.

1897
02:26:38,206 --> 02:26:39,706
My, my!

1898
02:26:39,957 --> 02:26:43,126
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

1899
02:26:44,462 --> 02:26:46,296
I don't like to interfere...

1900
02:26:46,506 --> 02:26:49,841
...but I wish you'd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts.

1901
02:26:50,092 --> 02:26:51,218
We could do better.

1902
02:26:51,511 --> 02:26:54,221
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.

1903
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:56,181
If we give Gallegher a free hand--

1904
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:59,643
A free hand? That means
he'll starve and whip them.

1905
02:26:59,894 --> 02:27:01,895
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.

1906
02:27:02,104 --> 02:27:03,480
How you do run on.

1907
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:06,316
If I let you alone,
you'd give them chicken...

1908
02:27:06,567 --> 02:27:08,610
...and tuck them in with quilts.

1909
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:12,572
I won't make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others.

1910
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:14,324
You didn't mind owning slaves.

1911
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:17,160
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

1912
02:27:17,411 --> 02:27:19,412
I'd have freed them
when father died...

1913
02:27:19,705 --> 02:27:21,832
...if the war hadn't
already freed them.

1914
02:27:22,083 --> 02:27:23,583
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

1915
02:27:23,751 --> 02:27:26,002
Do you forget what it's like
without money?

1916
02:27:26,254 --> 02:27:29,005
Money is the most
important thing in the world.

1917
02:27:29,215 --> 02:27:31,341
I don't intend to be without it again.

1918
02:27:31,592 --> 02:27:35,887
I'll make enough the only way I know
how so the Yankees can't take Tara.

1919
02:27:36,138 --> 02:27:38,515
We're not the only Southerners
who've suffered.

1920
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:42,394
Look at all our friends. They're
keeping their honor and kindness.

1921
02:27:42,645 --> 02:27:46,147
And they're starving. I've no use
for fools who won't help themselves.

1922
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:48,608
I know what they say about me.
I don't care.

1923
02:27:48,776 --> 02:27:51,570
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game.

1924
02:27:51,779 --> 02:27:53,655
And you'll beat them with me.

1925
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:59,369
SCARLETT: That's it. Pull it
a little over to that side.

1926
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:02,163
-Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
-Good afternoon.

1927
02:28:02,415 --> 02:28:05,041
-Business is certainly growing.
-It certainly is.

1928
02:28:06,752 --> 02:28:08,879
You're doing business
with the people...

1929
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:12,090
...who robbed us, tortured us
and left us to starve.

1930
02:28:12,258 --> 02:28:13,300
All that's past.

1931
02:28:13,593 --> 02:28:17,178
I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.

1932
02:28:19,807 --> 02:28:22,976
And do you know that Dr. Meade
actually saw her...

1933
02:28:23,227 --> 02:28:26,563
-...peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
-That isn't all.

1934
02:28:26,772 --> 02:28:29,482
It's shocking what she's doing
to my brother.

1935
02:28:29,692 --> 02:28:32,611
She's even taken to driving
her own buggy.

1936
02:28:40,119 --> 02:28:43,496
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!

1937
02:28:43,706 --> 02:28:45,999
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me!

1938
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:49,920
You could've had my millions
if you'd just waited a while.

1939
02:28:50,171 --> 02:28:51,588
Oh, how fickle is woman!

1940
02:28:51,839 --> 02:28:54,090
What is it you want?
I have things to do.

1941
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:58,261
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me?

1942
02:28:58,471 --> 02:28:59,679
Well, what is it?

1943
02:29:00,222 --> 02:29:04,309
Tell me, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?

1944
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:07,854
How'd you get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?

1945
02:29:08,356 --> 02:29:11,608
Oh, that! There's nothing much
that money won't buy.

1946
02:29:11,817 --> 02:29:15,153
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

1947
02:29:15,446 --> 02:29:19,366
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.

1948
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:24,329
You still think you're the belle of the
county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.

1949
02:29:24,538 --> 02:29:27,666
-That every man is in love with you.
-Let me by.

1950
02:29:28,542 --> 02:29:31,628
Don't be angry.
Tell me, where are you going?

1951
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:34,965
-I'm going out to the mill.
-Through Shantytown alone?

1952
02:29:35,216 --> 02:29:38,510
It's dangerous to drive alone

to show me up in front of my wife?

Well, Rhett, I had no idea.

they were with you tonight at Belle's?

2109

Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.

Will you give me your word,

2112
02:40:23,405 --> 02:40:25,406
Why, certainly, Tom.

02:40:27,367 --> 02:40:31,162
Well, if I've made a mistake,
I'm sorry.

I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.

Well, I say I'm sorry.

Well, I am sorry.

It's only in the shoulder.

Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.

2123
02:41:02,235 --> 02:41:04,195

What did it look like?

plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,

I was too late.

2134
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:37,561
When I got to the Sullivan place,
there had already been a skirmish.

2135
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:40,690
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2136
02:41:40,899 --> 02:41:45,069
I had to prove they'd been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2137
02:41:45,362 --> 02:41:48,447
-So I took them to Belle's.
-And she took them in?

2138
02:41:48,699 --> 02:41:51,242
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.

2139
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:53,202
Oh, I'm sorry--

a more dignified alibi.

This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster.

2142
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:07,383
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.

2143
02:42:08,885 --> 02:42:12,805
And now I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.

become of your own husband?

to Belle Watling's?

02:42:39,583 --> 02:42:41,584
...shot through the head.

2152

How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?

2159
02:43:16,995 --> 02:43:19,997
I got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me.

2160
02:43:20,207 --> 02:43:23,375
Why, Mrs. Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.

2161
02:43:23,668 --> 02:43:27,671
I came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustn't think of any such thing.

It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husband's life?

Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been
a lady nice to me like you was.

for the hospital.

I thought about you being widowed
with a little boy...

...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.

Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.

I ain't seen him since he was little.

as you did to the jail.

-So I see I shall have to marry you.
-I never heard of such bad taste.

Would you be convinced
if I fell to my knees?

Turn me loose and get out.

Forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments...

2259

...my dear Scarlett--
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

But you must have noticed
that for some time...

2261

...the friendship I've felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2262
02:50:22,003 --> 02:50:26,215
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred....

2263
02:50:26,424 --> 02:50:28,550
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...

...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

You're coarse and you're conceited.

gone far enough.

Besides, I shall never marry again.

Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.

Do you want them to hear you?

2279

You've been married
to a boy and an old man.

Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

You're a fool, Rhett Butler...

You don't want to take it back?

No.

Look at me,
and try to tell me the truth.

2294

Did you say yes because of my money?

Well, yes, partly.

Partly?

Well, you know, Rhett,

-And, of course, I am fond of you.
-Fond of me?

A diamond ring,

You'll have the biggest

I'll take you to New Orleans

-That'd be heavenly.
-I'll buy your trousseau for you too.

Won't you kiss me goodbye?

You've had enough kissing
for one afternoon.

You're impossible. You can go.

I'm thinking about how rich we are.

I can keep the lumber business too?

2318

Yes, of course you can,
if it amuses you.

2319

Now that you're so rich, you can tell
everybody to go to the devil.

something for Mammy.

Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

Mules? Why mules?

and get slicked up like racehorses...

...but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn't fool anybody.

...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it'd stand by itself...

it's made of angels' wings.

02:58:11,222 --> 02:58:13,264
Yea, Lordy!

2404
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:21,106
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.

2405
02:58:21,482 --> 02:58:23,733
Yes, sir. Too long.

2406
02:58:23,943 --> 02:58:25,944
No more mule in horse's harness?

2407
02:58:26,195 --> 02:58:29,197
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett
was bad telling you about that.

2408
02:58:29,448 --> 02:58:32,075
You ain't holding that
against old Mammy, is you?

2409
02:58:32,493 --> 02:58:33,993
I don't hold it against you.

2410
02:58:34,245 --> 02:58:36,454
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass.

2411
02:58:36,622 --> 02:58:38,123
Here, take the whole bottle.

2412
02:58:38,290 --> 02:58:41,459
Dr. Meade says you can go in now,
Captain Butler.

2413
02:58:44,630 --> 02:58:46,715
This sure is a happy day to me.

2414
02:58:46,966 --> 02:58:50,009
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls.

2415
02:58:50,219 --> 02:58:52,137
And it sure is a happy day.

2416
02:58:52,388 --> 02:58:57,308
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days
are when babies come. I wish--

2417
02:58:57,643 --> 02:59:00,812
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?

2418
02:59:01,105 --> 02:59:03,148
Miss Scarlett done told me
if it was a girl...

2419
02:59:03,441 --> 02:59:07,318
...she was going to name it
Eugenia Victoria.

2420
02:59:07,486 --> 02:59:11,114
RHETT:
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.

2421
02:59:11,323 --> 02:59:13,825
The most beautiful baby ever.

2422
02:59:14,410 --> 02:59:16,119
Yes....

2423
02:59:16,287 --> 02:59:17,412
[CLICKS TONGUE]

2424
02:59:17,580 --> 02:59:20,290
Do you know that this is
your birthday?

2425
02:59:20,541 --> 02:59:23,001
That you're a week old today?

2426
02:59:23,294 --> 02:59:27,046
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony,
the likes of which...

2427
02:59:27,256 --> 02:59:29,007
...this town has never seen.

2428
02:59:29,258 --> 02:59:32,761
Yes, I'm going to send her to
the best schools in Charleston.

2429
02:59:33,012 --> 02:59:37,557
Yes, and her will be received by
the best families in the South.

2430
02:59:37,767 --> 02:59:40,059
And when it comes time
for her to marry...

2431
02:59:40,311 --> 02:59:43,855
...well, she'll be a little princess.

2432
02:59:44,106 --> 02:59:46,149
Certainly making a fool of yourself.

2433
02:59:46,358 --> 02:59:47,567
Why shouldn't I?

2434
02:59:48,694 --> 02:59:52,572
She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.

2435
02:59:53,032 --> 02:59:54,574
Great balls of fire!

2436
02:59:54,825 --> 02:59:56,659
I had the baby, didn't I?

2437
02:59:57,203 --> 02:59:59,704
MELANIE: It's Melanie. May I come in?
-Come in.

2438
03:00:00,039 --> 03:00:04,459
Yes, come in and look at
my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.

2439
03:00:05,795 --> 03:00:08,379
Most babies have blue eyes
when they're born.

2440
03:00:08,672 --> 03:00:11,466
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

2441
03:00:11,675 --> 03:00:14,803
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they'll stay blue.

2442
03:00:15,054 --> 03:00:17,597
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.

2443
03:00:17,973 --> 03:00:19,974
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.

2444
03:00:20,476 --> 03:00:22,393
"Bonnie Blue Butler."

2445
03:00:30,402 --> 03:00:32,195
Try again, Mammy.

2446
03:00:39,703 --> 03:00:40,995
Twenty inches.

2447
03:00:41,247 --> 03:00:44,707
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

2448
03:00:44,917 --> 03:00:47,252
You simply gotta make it 18 1/2 again.

2449
03:00:47,503 --> 03:00:48,878
You done had a baby.

2450
03:00:49,129 --> 03:00:51,923
And you ain't never gonna be
no 18 1/2 inches again.

2451
03:00:52,174 --> 03:00:54,092
There ain't nothing to do about it.

2452
03:00:55,177 --> 03:00:57,053
There is something to do about it.

2453
03:00:57,263 --> 03:01:00,557
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

2454
03:01:01,058 --> 03:01:03,434
I just won't have any more babies.

2455
03:01:03,936 --> 03:01:07,438
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'd be wanting a son next year.

2456
03:01:07,731 --> 03:01:10,400
Tell Captain Butler I decided
not to go out.

2457
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:12,443
I'll have supper in my room.

2458
03:01:33,048 --> 03:01:34,757
I got your message.

2459
03:01:34,967 --> 03:01:37,677
I'll have them bring
my supper up here too.

2460
03:01:43,684 --> 03:01:45,393
No objections to that, I hope?

2461
03:01:45,603 --> 03:01:46,811
No.

2462
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,981
Yes. Uh....

2463
03:01:51,066 --> 03:01:53,943
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

2464
03:01:55,988 --> 03:01:57,113
Rhett....

2465
03:01:57,948 --> 03:02:00,408
RHETT: Yes?
-You see....

2466
03:02:00,618 --> 03:02:02,827
Well, I've decided....

2467
03:02:04,496 --> 03:02:07,415
Well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

2468
03:02:19,637 --> 03:02:23,181
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

2469
03:02:23,432 --> 03:02:26,309
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20.

2470
03:02:26,518 --> 03:02:28,353
No, but you know what I....

2471
03:02:28,812 --> 03:02:30,229
Do you know what I mean?

2472
03:02:30,481 --> 03:02:34,359
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

2473
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:36,861
You're low enough to think of that.

2474
03:02:37,154 --> 03:02:39,656
If you had any chivalry in you,
or were nice....

2475
03:02:39,865 --> 03:02:44,202
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't
have any more children and he....

2476
03:02:45,829 --> 03:02:48,373
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon.

2477
03:02:48,624 --> 03:02:50,458
What has that got to do with it?

2478
03:02:51,877 --> 03:02:55,254
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.

2479
03:02:55,506 --> 03:02:58,383
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

2480
03:02:58,884 --> 03:03:02,053
-You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
-Sorry for me?

2481
03:03:02,304 --> 03:03:05,515
Yes, sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands...

2482
03:03:05,683 --> 03:03:08,226
...and reach out for something
that'll never make you happy.

2483
03:03:08,394 --> 03:03:10,019
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2484
03:03:10,187 --> 03:03:14,482
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious Ashley...

2485
03:03:14,733 --> 03:03:16,734
...do you think you'd be happy?

2486
03:03:17,319 --> 03:03:20,905
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

2487
03:03:21,156 --> 03:03:23,992
...any more than you understand
anything, except money.

2488
03:03:24,493 --> 03:03:26,077
Never mind about that. I want--

2489
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:30,498
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.

2490
03:03:30,749 --> 03:03:32,000
You don't care?

2491
03:03:32,376 --> 03:03:34,585
The world is full
of many things and people...

2492
03:03:34,837 --> 03:03:38,423
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.

2493
03:03:38,674 --> 03:03:39,882
Well, that's fine.

2494
03:03:40,092 --> 03:03:43,678
But I warn you, in case you change
your mind, I intend to lock my door.

2495
03:03:43,887 --> 03:03:45,013
Why bother?

2496
03:03:45,264 --> 03:03:48,433
If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out.

2497
03:04:05,951 --> 03:04:07,618
I knew most women were cheats...

2498
03:04:07,911 --> 03:04:10,121
...hypocritical and hard,
but this one....

2499
03:04:10,414 --> 03:04:12,623
-It ain't no use.
-What do you mean?

2500
03:04:12,916 --> 03:04:14,751
I mean you're poisoned with her.

2501
03:04:14,960 --> 03:04:18,463
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.

2502
03:04:18,714 --> 03:04:23,051
-It pleasures me none to say it.
-Maybe so, but I'm through with her.

2503
03:04:23,302 --> 03:04:27,221
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.

2504
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:34,979
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.

2505
03:04:35,147 --> 03:04:36,981
And a very nice one.

2506
03:04:37,983 --> 03:04:38,983
Yes, Rhett?

2507
03:04:39,234 --> 03:04:42,653
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and....

2508
03:04:42,863 --> 03:04:45,656
You're both hardheaded businesswomen,
and successful.

2509
03:04:46,366 --> 03:04:48,493
But you've got a heart, Belle.

2510
03:04:49,995 --> 03:04:51,829
And you're honest.

2511
03:04:54,083 --> 03:04:55,249
Goodbye, Rhett.

2512
03:04:56,794 --> 03:04:58,086
Goodbye, Belle.

2513
03:05:13,685 --> 03:05:16,020
RHETT:
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.

2514
03:05:16,188 --> 03:05:18,189
Look at those hands. And that seat!

2515
03:05:18,482 --> 03:05:19,816
SCARLETT:
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

2516
03:05:20,025 --> 03:05:22,693
Why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants--

2517
03:05:22,903 --> 03:05:25,863
-Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
MERRIWETHER: Captain Butler.

2518
03:05:26,031 --> 03:05:27,156
Good morning, Scarlett.

2519
03:05:27,324 --> 03:05:30,034
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes.

2520
03:05:30,285 --> 03:05:32,829
If you'd thought of your position,
you wouldn't have to.

2521
03:05:33,038 --> 03:05:38,126
But as it is, we're going to cultivate
every female dragon of the Old Guard--

2522
03:05:38,335 --> 03:05:41,462
-Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
WHITING: Captain Butler.

2523
03:05:41,713 --> 03:05:43,673
Good morning, Scarlett.

2524
03:05:43,924 --> 03:05:47,051
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable.

2525
03:05:47,302 --> 03:05:49,387
Money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

2526
03:05:49,638 --> 03:05:51,722
I'll admit I've been at fault too.

2527
03:05:51,974 --> 03:05:54,058
Bonnie will have a place
among decent people.

2528
03:05:54,351 --> 03:05:58,563
Even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat--

2529
03:05:58,856 --> 03:06:00,648
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

2530
03:06:00,858 --> 03:06:04,402
MRS. MEADE: Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

2531
03:06:09,825 --> 03:06:12,743
RHETT: Mrs. Merriwether, I have
great regard for your knowledge.

2532
03:06:13,036 --> 03:06:15,580
-Could you give me some advice?
-Why, certainly.

2533
03:06:15,747 --> 03:06:17,999
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.

2534
03:06:18,250 --> 03:06:20,918
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

2535
03:06:21,086 --> 03:06:23,838
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.

2536
03:06:24,089 --> 03:06:26,591
-I tried putting soap on her nails.
MERRIWETHER: Soap? Bah!

2537
03:06:26,842 --> 03:06:30,386
Put quinine on her thumb and
she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

2538
03:06:30,596 --> 03:06:33,222
Quinine! I never would have
thought of it.

2539
03:06:33,473 --> 03:06:35,391
I can't thank you enough.

2540
03:06:35,601 --> 03:06:38,102
You've taken a great load off my mind.

2541
03:06:38,353 --> 03:06:39,604
Good morning.

2542
03:06:42,441 --> 03:06:45,401
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

2543
03:06:45,611 --> 03:06:48,279
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...

2544
03:06:48,572 --> 03:06:52,575
...there's a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much.

2545
03:06:52,784 --> 03:06:54,785
But of course there is.

2546
03:06:55,037 --> 03:06:59,248
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...

2547
03:06:59,458 --> 03:07:03,252
...that he was honored for his
services at the Battle of Franklin.

2548
03:07:03,503 --> 03:07:05,963
No, and did I tell you
that Captain Butler made...

2549
03:07:06,215 --> 03:07:10,509
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...

2550
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:13,012
-...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
-No!

2551
03:07:14,139 --> 03:07:17,808
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,

I was crazy with jealousy.

2851
03:28:29,413 --> 03:28:33,374
She's never cared for me. I tried
to make her care, but I couldn't.

2852
03:28:34,919 --> 03:28:36,252
You're so wrong.

2853
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:40,882
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.

2854
03:28:41,425 --> 03:28:45,428
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.

2855
03:28:45,596 --> 03:28:49,599
She will. You must be patient.

2856
03:28:51,060 --> 03:28:56,189
No, it's not possible. If you
only knew who she really loved--

2857
03:28:57,316 --> 03:28:59,025
You wouldn't believe it.

2858
03:29:01,946 --> 03:29:04,364
Surely you haven't
listened to idle gossip.

2859
03:29:04,615 --> 03:29:08,201
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.

2860
03:29:09,119 --> 03:29:13,831
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,
and there can be other babies.

2861
03:29:14,708 --> 03:29:17,377
She couldn't even if she wanted to.

2862
03:29:17,628 --> 03:29:21,256
But of course she could!
I'm going to.

2863
03:29:24,552 --> 03:29:27,845
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

2864
03:29:28,097 --> 03:29:31,057
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.

2865
03:29:31,308 --> 03:29:36,145
And when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.

2866
03:29:37,898 --> 03:29:41,568
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

2867
03:29:41,819 --> 03:29:44,737
I pray God things go well
with you, Miss Melly.

2868
03:29:44,989 --> 03:29:49,284
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

2869
03:29:49,994 --> 03:29:52,161
From my heart, I thank you.

2870
03:29:58,627 --> 03:30:01,963
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

2871
03:30:02,172 --> 03:30:03,673
Thank you, Mammy.

2872
03:30:10,764 --> 03:30:12,849
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

2873
03:30:13,017 --> 03:30:15,685
...hoping our life together
has another chance.

2874
03:30:15,936 --> 03:30:19,939
Our life together? When did we
ever have a life together?

2875
03:30:21,191 --> 03:30:22,984
Yes, you're right.

2876
03:30:23,193 --> 03:30:27,030
But I'm sure if we could only
try again, we could be happy.

2877
03:30:27,323 --> 03:30:29,198
What is there
to make us happy now?

2878
03:30:30,534 --> 03:30:33,494
Well, there's Bonnie...

2879
03:30:33,912 --> 03:30:35,705
...and I love you, Scarlett.

2880
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:37,707
When did you discover that?

2881
03:30:37,958 --> 03:30:42,045
I've always loved you, but you've
never given me a chance to show it.

2882
03:30:43,922 --> 03:30:46,215
And just what do you want me to do?

2883
03:30:47,301 --> 03:30:51,220
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.

2884
03:30:51,472 --> 03:30:53,556
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.

2885
03:30:53,807 --> 03:30:56,476
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.

2886
03:30:56,727 --> 03:30:59,228
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.

2887
03:30:59,730 --> 03:31:03,232
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.

2888
03:31:03,484 --> 03:31:06,027
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!

2889
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:08,237
I am thinking of you.

2890
03:31:08,822 --> 03:31:11,532
And I'm thinking that, well...

2891
03:31:12,076 --> 03:31:15,161
...maybe the mill's taking you
away from me and Bonnie.

2892
03:31:15,913 --> 03:31:18,539
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.

2893
03:31:18,749 --> 03:31:21,501
-You're taking her away from me.
-But she loves you.

2894
03:31:21,752 --> 03:31:25,421
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that--

2895
03:31:25,589 --> 03:31:28,591
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.

SCARLETT:
We're watching, darling.

You're mighty pretty, precious.

2898
03:31:32,596 --> 03:31:34,097
So are you.

2899
03:31:34,348 --> 03:31:37,266
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.

2900
03:31:37,518 --> 03:31:40,228
I don't think you ought
to do much jumping yet.

2901
03:31:40,437 --> 03:31:42,480
You just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

2902
03:31:42,940 --> 03:31:44,190
I will so jump.

2903
03:31:44,400 --> 03:31:47,110
I can jump better than ever,
because I've grown.

2904
03:31:47,403 --> 03:31:48,778
I moved the bar higher.

2905
03:31:49,029 --> 03:31:50,571
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

2906

No, Bonnie, you can't.

If you fall off,
don't cry and blame me!

She's just like Pa.

Miss Melly, this here's
done broke her heart.

I didn't fetch you
on Miss Scarlett's account.

Lord give her strength to stand.

It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

2924
03:33:09,109 --> 03:33:11,778
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

2925
03:33:12,029 --> 03:33:13,446
Oh, no, Mammy, no.

2926
03:33:13,697 --> 03:33:18,201
I ain't never seen no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

2927

When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...

2928
03:33:20,954 --> 03:33:25,333
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony.

2929
03:33:25,584 --> 03:33:28,836
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.

2930
03:33:29,087 --> 03:33:30,630
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

2931
03:33:30,881 --> 03:33:35,510
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump.

2932
03:33:35,719 --> 03:33:38,554
She said, "You give me my baby
what you killed."

And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.

It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

2935
03:33:47,231 --> 03:33:50,107
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

2936
03:33:52,653 --> 03:33:54,487
And then that night...

2937
03:33:55,572 --> 03:33:59,242
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.

2938
03:34:00,369 --> 03:34:03,746
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.

2939
03:34:04,039 --> 03:34:06,207
And that's where he's been
for two whole days.

Oh, Mammy!

2941
03:34:08,752 --> 03:34:12,421
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted
through the door and said:

"The funeral's set for tomorrow."

2943
03:34:14,675 --> 03:34:17,343
He says, "You try that,
and I kills you tomorrow.

2944
03:34:17,719 --> 03:34:22,723
Do you think I's gonna put my child
in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

that child. You gotta help us.

03:38:30,597 --> 03:38:32,264
I will, Melly.

3001
03:38:33,141 --> 03:38:35,184
Look after him...

3002
03:38:35,644 --> 03:38:39,522
...but never let him know.

3003
03:38:48,615 --> 03:38:50,407
Good night.

3004
03:38:51,535 --> 03:38:53,994
Promise?

3005
03:38:54,204 --> 03:38:56,288
What else, Melly?

3006
03:38:56,540 --> 03:38:58,707
Captain Butler.

3007
03:38:59,709 --> 03:39:03,212
-Be kind to him.
-Rhett?

3008
03:39:03,839 --> 03:39:06,882
He loves you so.

3009
03:39:09,970 --> 03:39:11,887
Yes, Melly.

3010
03:39:13,974 --> 03:39:15,850
Goodbye.

3011
03:39:16,643 --> 03:39:17,935
Goodbye.

3012
03:39:33,869 --> 03:39:36,078
You ladies may come in now.

3013
03:39:38,582 --> 03:39:39,874
Rhett....

3014
03:39:41,459 --> 03:39:42,751
Ashley!

3015
03:39:43,587 --> 03:39:46,922
I don't know where
the mate to this is.

3016
03:39:47,090 --> 03:39:49,592
She must've put it away.

3017
03:39:50,552 --> 03:39:55,097
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!

3018
03:39:56,766 --> 03:39:59,226
I'm so frightened!

3019
03:40:03,481 --> 03:40:07,776
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her. I can't!

3020
03:40:08,862 --> 03:40:12,990
Everything I ever had
is going with her.

3021
03:40:13,533 --> 03:40:15,117
Oh, Ashley....

3022
03:40:16,203 --> 03:40:18,787
You really love her, don't you?

3023
03:40:19,039 --> 03:40:24,126
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.

3024
03:40:24,544 --> 03:40:27,796
Dreams. Always dreams with you.
Never common sense.

3025
03:40:28,089 --> 03:40:31,300
Scarlett, if you knew what
I've gone through!

3026
03:40:31,968 --> 03:40:35,971
Ashley, you should've told me years
ago that you loved her and not me.

3027
03:40:36,223 --> 03:40:39,266
And not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.

3028
03:40:39,476 --> 03:40:43,229
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...

3029
03:40:43,438 --> 03:40:46,774
...to show me that I could never
mean any more to you...

3030
03:40:47,025 --> 03:40:49,485
...than this Watling woman
does to Rhett.

3031
03:40:51,446 --> 03:40:56,325
And I've loved something
that doesn't really exist.

3032
03:40:58,536 --> 03:41:00,120
But somehow...

3033
03:41:01,164 --> 03:41:02,831
...I don't care.

3034
03:41:04,084 --> 03:41:06,168
Somehow, it doesn't matter.

3035
03:41:07,921 --> 03:41:10,339
It doesn't matter one bit.

3036
03:41:13,051 --> 03:41:14,343
Oh, Ashley....

3037
03:41:14,594 --> 03:41:16,428
Ashley, forgive me.

3038
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:20,182
Don't cry. She mustn't see
you've been crying.

3039
03:41:20,433 --> 03:41:21,558
Ashley!

3040
03:41:24,938 --> 03:41:26,188
ASHLEY:
Melly!

3041
03:41:28,149 --> 03:41:29,566
Melly!

3042
03:41:33,989 --> 03:41:36,532
Rhett! Rhett!

3043
03:41:39,369 --> 03:41:41,203
Rhett, where are you?

3044
03:41:45,166 --> 03:41:47,209
Rhett, wait for me!

3045
03:41:51,715 --> 03:41:53,716
Rhett, wait for me!

3046
03:41:56,011 --> 03:41:57,136
Rhett!

3047
03:41:59,139 --> 03:42:00,472
Rhett!

3048
03:42:02,100 --> 03:42:03,892
Rhett!

3049
03:42:07,897 --> 03:42:09,064
Rhett!

3050
03:42:09,482 --> 03:42:10,607
Rhett!

3051
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:13,736
Rhett!

3052
03:42:17,032 --> 03:42:18,240
Rhett!

3053
03:42:20,493 --> 03:42:21,618
Rhett!

3054
03:42:24,831 --> 03:42:26,248
Come in.

3055
03:42:33,923 --> 03:42:35,257
Rhett....

3056
03:42:35,633 --> 03:42:38,135
Melanie, she's...?

3057
03:42:40,930 --> 03:42:42,514
Well, God rest her.

3058
03:42:42,932 --> 03:42:46,268
She was the only completely
kind person I ever knew.

3059
03:42:46,728 --> 03:42:50,439
A great lady. A very great lady.

3060
03:42:52,776 --> 03:42:56,695
So she's dead. That makes it
nice for you, doesn't it?

3061
03:42:56,946 --> 03:43:01,700
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.

3062
03:43:01,951 --> 03:43:04,036
No, I don't know that I do.

3063
03:43:04,287 --> 03:43:06,955
It's to your credit that
you could appreciate her.

3064
03:43:07,207 --> 03:43:11,710
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

3065
03:43:11,920 --> 03:43:16,131
-Why, her last words were about you.
-What did she say?

3066
03:43:16,383 --> 03:43:19,676
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...

3067
03:43:19,928 --> 03:43:21,929
...he loves you so."

3068
03:43:26,768 --> 03:43:29,645
RHETT: Did she say anything else?
SCARLETT: She said....

3069
03:43:30,063 --> 03:43:33,399
She asked me to look after Ashley too.

3070
03:43:34,734 --> 03:43:38,195
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

3071
03:43:40,281 --> 03:43:41,949
What do you mean?

3072
03:43:44,327 --> 03:43:45,953
What are you doing?

3073
03:43:46,162 --> 03:43:47,788
I'm leaving you, my dear.

3074
03:43:47,997 --> 03:43:53,001
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

3075
03:43:54,963 --> 03:43:57,005
Oh, no!

3076
03:43:57,257 --> 03:43:59,508
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.

3077
03:43:59,801 --> 03:44:00,968
I don't want a divorce.

3078
03:44:01,219 --> 03:44:04,263
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,
when I knew I loved you...

3079
03:44:04,514 --> 03:44:07,349
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!

3080
03:44:07,642 --> 03:44:09,017
Please don't go on with this.

3081
03:44:09,269 --> 03:44:12,938
Leave us some dignity out
of our marriage. Spare us this last.

3082
03:44:13,189 --> 03:44:17,734
This last? Do listen to me! I must
have loved you for years, only...

3083
03:44:17,986 --> 03:44:19,862
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.

3084
03:44:20,155 --> 03:44:24,700
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.

3085
03:44:24,951 --> 03:44:28,120
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?

3086
03:44:28,705 --> 03:44:31,165
I never really loved Ashley.

3087
03:44:31,374 --> 03:44:34,877
You certainly gave a good imitation
of it, up to this morning.

3088
03:44:36,004 --> 03:44:38,464
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.

3089
03:44:38,673 --> 03:44:41,633
If you'd met me halfway, even
when I came back from London.

3090
03:44:41,885 --> 03:44:45,387
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

3091
03:44:45,638 --> 03:44:48,515
Then when you were sick,
and it was all my fault.

3092
03:44:48,766 --> 03:44:51,393
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.

3093
03:44:51,686 --> 03:44:54,646
I wanted you. I wanted you
desperately...

3094
03:44:54,856 --> 03:44:57,065
...but I didn't think you wanted me.

3095
03:44:57,317 --> 03:45:00,152
It seems we've been
at cross purposes, doesn't it?

3096
03:45:00,403 --> 03:45:02,237
But it's no use now.

3097
03:45:02,489 --> 03:45:05,908
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3098
03:45:06,159 --> 03:45:09,244
I liked to think that Bonnie
was you, a little girl again.

3099
03:45:09,496 --> 03:45:12,247
Before the war and poverty
had done things to you.

3100
03:45:12,499 --> 03:45:14,166
She was so like you.

3101
03:45:14,375 --> 03:45:17,586
And I could pet her and spoil her,
as I wanted to spoil you.

3102
03:45:19,297 --> 03:45:22,049
But when she went, she took everything.

3103
03:45:23,176 --> 03:45:26,345
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.

3104
03:45:26,596 --> 03:45:29,348
I'm so sorry for everything.

3105
03:45:30,016 --> 03:45:32,267
My darling, you're such a child.

3106
03:45:32,519 --> 03:45:37,439
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3107
03:45:39,234 --> 03:45:41,610
Here, take my handkerchief.

3108
03:45:41,861 --> 03:45:46,240
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.

3109
03:45:50,370 --> 03:45:52,913
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?

3110
03:45:53,122 --> 03:45:55,624
I'm going to Charleston,
back where I belong.

3111
03:45:55,917 --> 03:45:58,126
Please. Please take me with you.

3112
03:45:58,336 --> 03:46:01,213
No. I'm through
with everything here.

3113
03:46:01,756 --> 03:46:04,132
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...

3114
03:46:04,425 --> 03:46:08,136
...there isn't something left
in life of charm and grace.

3115
03:46:08,388 --> 03:46:10,138
-You know what I'm talking about?
-No!

3116
03:46:10,390 --> 03:46:14,309
-I only know that I love you!
-That's your misfortune.

3117
03:46:14,644 --> 03:46:16,270
Oh, Rhett!

3118
03:46:20,984 --> 03:46:22,401
Rhett!

3119
03:46:24,654 --> 03:46:26,071
Rhett! Rhett!

3120
03:46:28,408 --> 03:46:33,370
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3121
03:46:33,621 --> 03:46:36,665
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

3122
03:46:49,929 --> 03:46:52,973
I can't let him go. I can't!

3123
03:46:53,266 --> 03:46:56,310
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3124
03:46:57,520 --> 03:47:02,524
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.

3125
03:47:03,484 --> 03:47:05,861
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3126
03:47:20,043 --> 03:47:22,836
But I must think about it!

3127
03:47:23,046 --> 03:47:25,297
I must think about it.

3128
03:47:26,007 --> 03:47:28,216
What is there to do?

3129
03:47:29,135 --> 03:47:31,553
What is there that matters?

3130
03:47:34,057 --> 03:47:38,143
GERALD: You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?

3131
03:47:38,394 --> 03:47:42,814
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.

3132
03:47:43,066 --> 03:47:46,693
ASHLEY: Something you love more than
me, though you may not know it. Tara.

3133
03:47:46,944 --> 03:47:50,364
RHETT: It's this from which you get
your strength, the red earth of Tara.

3134
03:47:50,573 --> 03:47:54,242
GERALD: Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.

3135
03:47:54,535 --> 03:47:57,579
ASHLEY: Something you love more
than me, though you may not know it.

3136
03:47:57,872 --> 03:48:00,248
RHETT: --from which you get
your strength. Tara.

3137
03:48:00,458 --> 03:48:02,376
GERALD:
Land's the only thing that matters.

3138
03:48:02,543 --> 03:48:03,752
ASHLEY:
Something you love more.

3139
03:48:04,003 --> 03:48:06,088
RHETT: --the red earth of Tara.
GERALD: Tara!

3140
03:48:06,255 --> 03:48:07,756
ASHLEY: Tara!
RHETT: Tara!

3141
03:48:10,218 --> 03:48:11,760
Tara!

3142
03:48:12,762 --> 03:48:14,262
Home.

3143
03:48:15,181 --> 03:48:17,015
I'll go home.

3144
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:20,602
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.

3145
03:48:20,853 --> 03:48:25,982
After all, tomorrow is another day!
