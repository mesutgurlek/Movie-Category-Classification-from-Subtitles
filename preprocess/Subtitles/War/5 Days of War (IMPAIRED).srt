1
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,553
Based on actual events

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,553
Based on actual events

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,755
More than 500 war reporters
were killed in the last decade.

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,632
This film is dedicated
to their memory.

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,152
Iraq - 2007

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,635
(Woman) He can't talk,
so he just films things.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,954
(Man) Yeah, basically.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,913
He's even named his camera Dave,
which I find kind of sad.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,031
(Man 2) And we're taping.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,355
Anders. Miriam.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,959
Say hello to the folks at home.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,310
Say, "Greetings from hell."
Come on, guys.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,829
What are you doing back there?
Planning a date?

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,999
We're speculating about al-Safi's
motives on giving us this interview.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,671
Yeah. Let's talk about something
that really interests people.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,028
Like sex.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,754
(Sighs) Sebastian, you are
such a fucking pervert!

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,917
Why don't you turn that off, and
save the battery for the real stuff?

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,600
- Yeah, stop filming us!
- This is the real stuff.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,756
People don't care
about boring old war.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,634
They need something juicy
to break away from "American Idol".

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,478
Like emergency sex
among reporters.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,512
Anders, would you care to explain
that concept to TV audiences?

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,915
(Laughs) Why don't you explain it?

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,349
You can explain the emergency
sex you have at night,

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,040
alone with the internet, you know.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,118
Cos we don't want our sex lives
on your emergency sex show.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,434
(Sebastian laughs)

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,472
Whoa there, missy!
Did you just say, "Our sex lives"?

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,034
Ah, does that mean you guys
are finally doing it?

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,832
When we get home
we're gonna have a talk

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,155
about your lack
of journalistic standards, OK?

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,679
You'll be severely disciplined.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,836
(Driver) I see something.
(Sebastian) Where?

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,235
- I see someone on the road!
- I don't see anything!

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,351
(Gunshots and screaming)

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,630
(Sebastian) Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,194
Fuck! Jesus! Shut the door!

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,833
(Screams)

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,153
- (Sebastian) Is everyone all right?
- Yeah! Get down!

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,635
(Sebastian) Get this car in reverse!

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,354
Back off! Get us out of here! Press!

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,513
Press!

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,471
Put the car in reverse!

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,478
Move it, motherfucker,
or we're all dead!

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,352
Get us the fuck out of here!

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,799
(Screams)

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,354
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I think the vest caught it.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,879
(Gunshots)

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,479
(Screams)

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
(Sebastian) Is she OK? Is it bad?

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,158
She's been hit through the side!
She's bleeding pretty bad!

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,669
Stay with me! You stay with me!

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,190
You keep listening to me! You keep
listening to me! Say my name!

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,512
(Gunfire)

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,317
- Oh, shit!
- You're gonna be OK. I got you.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,112
Get us the fuck out of here!

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,628
We're gonna get you out of here, OK?
Just stay with me!

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,917
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,555
(Anders) Don't you go...
Don't you go anywhere! Miriam!

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,398
(Speaking Arabic)

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,192
(Gunfire)

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,439
Fuck!

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,669
Miriam!

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,313
(Speaking Arabic)

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,431
(Gunfire)

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,473
(Gunfire continues)

68
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,439
Defensive positions!

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,953
Hey, you have to help her first, OK?

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,310
Call for medevac! Two urgent surgicals!

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,237
Let's go! Come on!

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,153
- Where are you guys from?
- Georgia! Coalition forces!

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,560
Look out! RPG at 12 o'clock!

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,118
This saved my life once.

75
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,192
Los Angeles - One year later

76
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,472
(On laptop) 'These days,

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,672
'violence in the conflict zone
has continued to escalate,

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,998
'and now represents a clear threat
to peace in our region.

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,318
'This is the Caucasus,
where violence harms everyone.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,118
'I plead to the separatists,
the Russian Federation,

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,276
'and the people of Georgia,

82
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,755
'let's return
to the negotiating table.

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,314
(Reporter) 'That was Georgian
President, Mikheil Saakashvili,

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,908
'who is struggling to move
his country closer to the West.

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,474
'This former Soviet republic
has already sent troops

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,989
'to assist NATO's missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,556
'and would like full membership
in both NATO and the EU.

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,797
'Not surprisingly, Georgia's
aspiration to integrate with the West

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,117
'is in direct conflict with
Russia's desire to regain influence

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,232
'over territory lost in the break-up
of the Soviet Union,

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,351
'which according
to Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin,

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,552
'was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century.'

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,198
(Anders) So, what's going on?

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,710
'This place is about to blow, man.
There's no one here.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,877
'There's no one in Georgia,
but me Zoe and Stilton.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,197
'Just today there was
a police truck, got lit up.

97
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,554
'The peacekeepers have come
under fire on the border.'

98
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,193
Whoa. That's the border...

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,550
'The administrative border
with South Ossetia.

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,319
'Lt's one of two breakaway provinces
backed by the Russians.

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,351
'Both sides have had
peacekeepers here

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,550
'since war broke out here
in the early 90s.'

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,432
No one'll fucking insure me.
I can't.

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,155
I got a special reputation
after Iraq and...

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,350
Apparently,
I was a loose cannon before.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,789
- 'You are a loose cannon.'
- Thanks.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,150
'Listen, I don't care what you do.

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,510
'Get onto a doc, get your papers
and get over here.'

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,074
I know Sebastian's ready
to rock and roll.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,632
'I will dance for you!'

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,309
Tbilisi, Georgia - August 6, 2008

112
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,756
(Church bells peal)

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,632
(Laughter)

114
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,918
(Sebastian) It looks nice.

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,918
Then again most places do
before war tears 'em up.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,272
In the end they all look the same.
And the world barely blinks.

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,709
There's that cheer I was missing (!)

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,239
I'm just laying out the facts.

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,875
There could be genocides
on five continents,

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,797
people don't give a fuck.

121
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,036
God forbid
their cable goes out, though.

122
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,196
So what's Russia's
big beef here, then?

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,436
They just don't want
to see this place go west?

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,313
It may have more to do
with the oil pipeline here.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,194
It goes direct to Europe which makes
the Russian pipe irrelevant.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,756
They're also playing tug-of-war
with a couple of Georgian provinces.

127
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,998
- Welcome to Cold War, the sequel.
- Exactly!

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Wanna give Dutchman a call?
See where the others are at.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,949
Yeah.

130
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:03,321
And with Wolf Blitzer,

131
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,354
I think you should mention
the shelling of the villages...

132
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,801
(Phone rings)

133
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,116
(Speaks Georgian)

134
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,996
Mr President,
your cabinet members are here.

135
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,192
- Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

136
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,995
Gentlemen, you all know Chris,
my US press adviser.

137
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:21,919
- Hello.
- Yes, please come in.

138
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,761
- Good morning.
- Come in. Tell me news.

139
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,077
Mr President, the latest intelligence

140
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:30,399
indicates the separatists are firing
from the Russian positions,

141
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,194
using their peacekeepers as shields.

142
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,517
That can only mean
willing cooperation.

143
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:37,634
That could be another attempt
to draw us into wider hostilities.

144
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,401
- Just like in '04.
- We believe this to be different.

145
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:43,559
Russian fighter planes and tanks
are moving towards the conflict zone.

146
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,116
A Russian fleet in the Black Sea
is also on the move.

147
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:49,393
So you all believe war is certain?

148
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,558
We... we pray not.

149
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:56,197
But the Ossetians, they are refusing
all our efforts in diplomacy.

150
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,836
Our troops are
at their lowest level of readiness.

151
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:01,556
Several ministers
are also out of the country.

152
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,161
We have no contingency plan...

153
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:05,750
We'll call them back.
Yes, call them back. Everyone.

154
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:10,194
And I want no response yet
to these provocations. Understood?

155
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:15,471
The question is what do you wipe
your arse with in Tajikistan?

156
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:18,639
There is no toilet paper anywhere.
Ever.

157
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,072
There's no newspaper, no leaves
on the trees. I had the runs!

158
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,433
I had to slide along the grass,
wipe my arse like a dog.

159
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,352
That's a lovely visual, Stilton.

160
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,438
That's why I drink whisky, my dear.

161
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,714
Whatever it is, tummy bugs,
even memories, this kills it.

162
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,514
- (Dutchman) Cheers.
- Cheers.

163
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,881
Whoa!

164
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:45,358
This stuff has put more experienced
drinkers than you in a coma.

165
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,995
Don't worry about this man, Zoe.

166
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,841
He can drink anyone under the table.
Yours truly excepted.

167
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,953
You got pretty fucked up in Bosnia.

168
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,834
- Me? Never!
- Most definitely.

169
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,272
- Never! You were in Bosnia, too?
- See what I mean?

170
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,472
- (Stilton) What were you? 12?
- 19.

171
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,073
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

172
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,796
Speaking from personal experience,
are you, Stilton?

173
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,116
(Laughter)

174
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,914
(Dutchman)
Hmm. Bosnia's pretty fucked up.

175
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,272
Not as bad as Rwanda, though.

176
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:15,394
Families hacked and stacked
in churches.

177
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:19,276
Imagine the attention that would
have got if they'd had oil there.

178
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,711
Yeah, war is like
an old toothless whore.

179
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,241
(Laughter)

180
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:26,274
- (Anders) Dutchman!
- Disgusting mainly. But then...

181
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,836
Every now and again...

182
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,520
(Growls quietly)

183
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:33,315
...she gives it to you
like nobody's business.

184
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,561
I mean, special.

185
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:37,910
(Chuckles)

186
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,714
The old whore!

187
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,639
Oh, yes, Mommy!

188
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:45,956
(Laughs)

189
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,598
- So, you guys got a... a plan yet?
- We're trying to get hold of Rezo.

190
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,316
Captain Avaliani.
You know, my guy from Iraq?

191
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,433
Thought he might have some leads.

192
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,792
But so far all we know
is his unit's back.

193
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,072
Well, let me know.
I got a guy in Variani.

194
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,591
He can hook you up with a guy
if you need it.

195
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,031
- Where you headed?
- Tskhinvali.

196
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:08,279
- (Stilton) What?
- What?

197
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:12,441
My dear chaps,
that's the separatists' capital.

198
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,838
I just go where the man tells me,
and point the camera.

199
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:20,797
'I have no fear of heights

(Sebastian) OK. All set.

207
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,758
Dutchmars guy will meet us
near the village square at midnight.

208
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,713
Oh, God!

209
00:12:57,682 --> 00:13:02,039
What do they put in this shit here?
Maybe I'm just getting old.

210
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,232
Roll down your window, will you?

211
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,471
It's no good, mate.
You're gonna have to pull over.

212
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,280
Really?

213
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,712
You all set? Lightweight.

214
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,072
(Groans) Yeah.

215
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,512
Actually, I feel kind of hungry now.

216
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,712
- Have we got any snacks?
- No!

217
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:33,601
And if we have to stop
every five minutes for you to puke,

218
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,031
we are never making it to the border.

219
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,675
Fuck you!

220
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,032
(Rumbling)

221
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:46,599
(Anders) Sounds like shelling.
(Sebastian) Things are heating up.

222
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,714
(Minister) Attacks are growing.

223
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,039
Both villages and peacekeepers
are under fire now.

224
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:20,353
We have casualties.
Dead and wounded.

225
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,272
- We must respond.
- I agree.

226
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,233
If we respond, we are at war.

227
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,190
We cannot risk it.

228
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:32,201
Mr President,
if our troops cannot return fire,

229
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,233
they cannot evacuate the wounded.

230
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,752
We will maintain ceasefire
as long as we can.

231
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:40,555
(Chris) Mr President,
there is visual confirmation

232
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,754
of Russian tanks
amassing for an invasion.

233
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,077
I must address country
and world press tonight.

234
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,762
I think that would be
a good idea, Mr President.

235
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,440
- OK, let's do it.
- OK.

236
00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:00,154
(Door shuts)

237
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,636
There's local colour.

238
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,993
Besides, we've got time to kill
before Dutchman's guy shows up.

- Hello.

We have to hide the car

A lot of troops are on the move,

00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:57,921
'Whereas the government in Tbilisi
claims their troops...'

316
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:02,797
...fired at Russian tanks entering
illegally into Georgian territory.

317
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,594
(Stilton) Sovereign Georgia.

318
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:05,916
(Camera shutter clicks)

319
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,600
Both sides have a dramatically...

320
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,121
(Camera shutter clicks)

321
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:13,360
...different account
of this escalation.

322
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:16,474
This is Thomas Anders,
reporting in Geor...

323
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:20,832
This is Thomas Anders
reporting in Gori, Georgia.

324
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,471
(Sebastian) OK.

325
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:25,241
Well, that might get us on CNN.

326
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:28,320
We can rock and roll that.
I'm gonna call our producer.

327
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:31,957
'This is Michael Stilton
reporting from Gori, Georgia.'

328
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:35,750
Very gory it is, too. I need a drink.

329
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,157
Karin?

330
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,273
Independent News Center New York
August 8, 2008

331
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,313
- 'I can't hear you.'
- No bites. I'm sorry.

332
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,592
The networks are
all covering the Olympics.

333
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,553
The opening ceremony started today.

334
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,479
Did you mention a war started here?

335
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,241
'Of course. But everyone's
taking the Kremlin line.'

336
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,557
Medvedev is saying
the Georgians fired first,

337
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:58,116
and their troops
are just protecting their citizens.

338
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,597
'Apparently, 98 % of the people
in South Ossetia

339
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:02,519
'suddenly have Russian passports.'

340
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,236
Protecting them
by cluster-bombing villages

341
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,159
miles outside the conflict zone!

342
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:10,479
I know, Anders. I'm on your side.
You know what these people are like.

343
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,674
They barely find the time
to cover the war we're in.

344
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:16,441
You need to just... Hold on.

345
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:19,120
Putin's on from Beijing.

346
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:21,517
(Translator)
'There is no secret about it.

347
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,394
'We had considered all scenarios,

348
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:26,241
'including direct aggression
by the Georgian leadership.

349
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,398
'We had to think beforehand
about how to provide

350

they can come and kill us,

such a policy will have for them.'

356
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,078
- (Anders indistinct)
- What?

357
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:50,080
I said I wonder
what that will look like!

358
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:53,672
- Yeah.
- 'Wait. That's it?'

359
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:56,760
Where's the Georgian side?
No questions even?

360
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,436
Fucking unbelievable! Karin?

361
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,673
(Shouting)

362
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:12,995
(Sebastian) The networks
want something more personal?

363
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:30,793
Hey, Tatia! Hey, hey!
Everyone make it out OK?

364
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,958
I can't reach Sofi or my father.

365
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:34,879
The phones
are not working in Variani.

366
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:37,391
- Look, I mean...
- Hey.

367
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:43,119
I think you need to take five.
Come on. Let's get some air.

368
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,271
Thank you.

369
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:14,160
- So, you studied in the States?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:17,241
Where?

371
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,922
New York. Political science.

372
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,761
Thought about staying,
but came back here to teach.

373
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:29,553
What is this? An interview now?

374
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:35,590
OK.

375
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,038
Where's the US?

376
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,313
We were there for you with Iraq,
and you're nowhere to be seen.

377
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:44,876
No. I... I agree with you.

378
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,401
(Mobile rings)

379
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,673
(Speaks Georgian)

380
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:03,952
My aunt and her husband got out OK
before the army closed the roads.

381
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:07,995
She said everybody else had to go
to nearby villages for shelter, so...

382
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:10,113
I gotta get back up there.

383
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:13,800
- We're going back north.
- Really?

384
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:16,595
Thanks for the offer.

385
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:19,912
I'm gonna go to my cousirs
and see my aunt.

386
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,435
Call us later.

387
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,793
What the hell was that?

388
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:36,121
Seriously, man, you mind
fucking consulting me next time?

389
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,358
I don't want her coming north.
For her own good.

390
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,950
We need her. She needs us.

391
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,721
This is exactly the kind of story
the networks care about.

392
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:46,640
Missing family, reunion.

393
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,992
I don't want someone along
I gotta protect.

394
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,390
What, you believe
in your own reputation now?

395
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:55,400
Why? Because of Miriam? Giorgi?

396
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:58,673
Hey, check out this living hotness.

397
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,236
You've been the best
life insurance policy I ever got.

398
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,672
You are also a crazy motherfucker,
but we always come out OK.

399
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:06,554
And that's the way I like it.

400
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:09,196
I don't want complications
and entanglements.

401
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,358
Tatia is not Miriam.

402
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,393
Anders, you've gotta let that go.

403
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:22,276
We came here to cover a war.

404
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:26,031
If we don't get a story,
this will all unfold unseen.

405
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:32,472
Yeah? OK.

406
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:40,111
You really think this is gonna work?

407
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,960
I've seen her work bigger miracles.

408
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:48,077
Thank you. You know what?

409
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,477
I'm going to write you down
my numbers, OK?

410
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:55,480
(Wolf-whistling)

411
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,678
Thank you. See you guys.

412
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:06,997
(Cheering)

413
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:15,757
So, guys, mission accomplished.

414
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,442
He's gonna get in touch
with Avaliani's unit.

415
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:19,961
They're headed this way.

416
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,721
You're gonna need to ride with them,
or you won't get far.

417
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:26,073
The main roads are still shut down.
Checkpoints every single mile or so.

418
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,999
You're amazing!

419
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,239
You know what they say.
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

420
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:37,472
Heard you guys had
a rough night last night. Sorry.

421
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:39,240
Where did you end up?

422
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,240
Stilton sent me to the capital
to get some... government shit.

423
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:46,435
20 seconds away from the Russians

424
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,473
bombing an airstrip
20 clicks from here.

425
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,277
Sometimes
that toothless whore is...

426
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:55,081
...unkind.

427
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,635
(Man) Give me the cash!

428
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,117
My name's Sebastian Ganz.

429
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:01,710
I'm trying to get a hold
of Captain Rezo Avaliani.

430
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,833
Up in the mountains.
Entertain us all.

431
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:05,953
Like a crazy sexy Santa Claus.

432
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,595
(Chuckles)

433
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:11,158
Listen, I just wanted to say
thank you for taking me up north.

434
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:13,999
And I'm sorry
I snapped at you earlier.

435
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:17,432
It's just this is all... really hard.

436
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:21,714
Sofi's wedding was supposed
to be a new beginning for all of us.

437
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:22,991
What do you mean?

438
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,278
My father and I
have never really gotten along,

439
00:29:26,402 --> 00:29:29,155
and my going to America
was just one of many things.

440
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,359
His side of the family is Ossetian,

441
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:37,395
and we've had...
more fights about politics

442
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:39,001
than I care to remember.

443
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:41,636
No, listen, we're trying
to get to Variani,

444
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:45,038
and we wondered if we might be able
to hitch a ride along with you guys.

445
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,278
We haven't spoken
to each other in years.

446
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:52,513
How about your family?
They must be worried sick.

447
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:54,951
No, no. I don't have one.

448
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,037
Sorry.

449
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:01,598
(Clears throat)
OK. Finally connected with Avaliani.

450
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,680
His convoy will pass here
at first light,

451
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,919
and we can ride with them
to about a mile from Variani.

452
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,441
But then we're on our own.

453
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:12,520
Great. Thank you. Both of you.

454
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,837
Hey, guys! The president's back on!

455
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:20,195
'My fellow citizens
and world leaders.

456
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,882

'May God save Georgia and all of us.'

467
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:14,756
Sit down.

468
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:19,590
- Think the world heard me?
- I hope so.

469
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:21,875
You hope so?

470
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:24,436
The Americans?
Bryza at the State Department?

471
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:29,511
Mr Bush has make it very clear
that they will not intervene. Can't.

472
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:31,200
Not militarily, anyway.

473
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,711
That's just what the Russians want.

474
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,037
The Americans must know
that I had no choice.

475
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,881
If I'd stood by, the Russians
would be here by now,

476
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:42,597
and my whole country would be lost!
Another Chechenya!

477
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,873
If the Americans won't help,
then Europe must come to our aid!

478
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:48,197
But someone. Someone has to come.

479
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,318
That's gonna be tough, Mr President.

480
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,991
Medvedev is already playing this
as a Russian 9/11.

481
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,316
Oh, please! Oh!

482
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:59,400
He's having press conferences
accusing your soldiers

483
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:01,672
of killing innocent civilians
in Tskhinvali.

484
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:04,396
- He's calling this Kosovo!
- But it's outrageous!

485
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,320
We did everything we could
to minimise civilian casualties

486
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:08,716
while defending ourselves!

487
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:14,639
(Sebastian) Let's try
and keep this car in one piece, eh?

488
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:17,754
Otherwise Hertz will never
rent me anything ever again.

489
00:32:26,482 --> 00:32:28,438
It's good to see you, my friend.

490
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:31,679
You, too, Rezo. I wish it were
under better circumstances.

491
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:34,077
- Sebastian explained everything?
- Yes.

492
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,193
- Do you mind if we film?
- No.

493
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:38,671
OK.

494
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:41,191
Captain, this is Tatia,
whose family is missing.

495
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:43,631
(Speaks Georgian)
Thanks for the escort.

496
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,480
Yeah, I hope they are safe.

497
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:48,714
Anders, you ride with us.

498
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,515
Sebastian, you will follow.

499
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,394
So, what's the situation
at the front?

500
00:32:57,522 --> 00:33:02,312
Our intelligence indicates that
not only the Russians are coming,

501
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,910
but volunteer militia and mercenaries

502
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:08,079
to help the Russians
cleanse the villages.

503
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:13,433
You see men with white armbands
and black masks,

504
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:15,678
you don't take pictures.

505
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:19,033
You don't try to hide. You run.

506
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:21,073
Understand?

507
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:30,232
(Tatia) Your friend, Anders,
is pretty cold.

508
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:33,274
Listen, he doesn't mean it.

509
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,996
He just has a hard time
relating to people.

510
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:39,319
You know, he's been through
some really bad shit.

511
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,194
Iraq and before.

512
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,999
But he's a good guy.

513
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,682
He cares about you and your family.

514
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,794
He just wants to keep you safe.

515
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,521
(Speaks Georgian)

516
00:33:57,842 --> 00:34:00,879
- What's that?
- It means "God willing".

517
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,913
(Speaks broken Georgian)

518
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,592
Yes! That's good!

519
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:10,521
That's nice.

520
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:16,681
You know, Rezo, thank you
so much for this, but...

521
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:19,680
...I think I should
give it back to you.

522
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:23,397
No. I give to you for reason.

523
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:28,232
Do you know the story of St George?

524
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:30,958
Uh... the patron saint of soldiers.

525
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:34,552
Yes. His image is in all churches.

526
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:37,116
He was a Roman soldier

527
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:41,440
martyred for refusing
to abandon the truth.

528
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:45,601
You were trying
to tell the truth in Iraq.

529
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:50,437
(Speaks Georgian)

530
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:56,876
This is as far as we can take you.
God be with you, my friend.

531
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:02,121
Thank you.

532
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,073
(Speaks Georgian)

533
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:48,956
No?

534
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,151
(Sighs)

535
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,115
This is the fifth village.
How are we supposed to find them?

536
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:56,473
(Speaks Georgian)

537
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:57,830
What's she saying?

538
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,760
She thinks she can help us.
She wants to see the pictures.

539
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,873
(Speaks Georgian)

540
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:07,477
(Sighs)

541
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,718
What are they saying?
What did they say?

542
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:13,801
Her cousin owns an inn in Avnevi,
5km from here,

543
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,073
and he took in a bride
seeking shelter.

544
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,033
A bride and her father.

545
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,396
(Speaks Georgian)

546
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,993
(Anders)
Let's check the registration.

547
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:51,875
Sofi!

548
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:57,552
(Sobbing)

549
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,521
(Father speaks Georgian)

550
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,390
Hey.

551
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:18,395
(Grunts)

552
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:21,914
Hey.

553
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:25,159
(Sobs)

554
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,238
(Whirring)

555
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,561
(Speaks Georgian)

556
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,116
- What's he saying?
- Jets! Jets!

557
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,793
(Baby cries)

558
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:06,194
(Radar beeping)

559
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:12,516
Guys, we need
to get to a shelter. Now!

560
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:24,194
We do not have much down here,

561
00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:26,199
but you are welcome to have it.

562
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,479
You must be hungry.

563
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:29,796
(Rumbling)

564
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,041
(Switches radio on)

565
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:47,918
Russian tanks are crossing
into undisputed Georgian territory.

566
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:51,835
The air force is bombing airfields
all across the country.

567
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,680
(Explosion)

568
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:57,192
Battleships are moving in
to block our ports.

569
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,916
- My God.
- (Anders) We leave at first light.

570
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:03,352
Avaliani told me volunteer militia
are coming with the Russians.

571
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,233
We should try to get some rest.

572
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,916

Sebastian? Sebastian, wake up!
Quickly! We've gotta go! Come on!

578
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,713
We can't. There's choppers.
Tatia, hiding places!

(Screaming)

583
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:33,601
- We have to go another way!
- We have to see this.

584
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,111
Come on. This way.
The river. Come on.

What did he say?

591
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:18,280
He said he wants
the chief of police and the mayor.

No! We have to do something!

597
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,914
There's nothing we can do.

598
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,158
They'll kill us all!

the fuck out of here, Sebastian.

604
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,511
Just one sec.

605

Clear them out!

00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:33,599
(Baby cries)

637
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:39,954
Please have pity.

638
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,953
In the name of God.

639
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:47,201
Shh.

640
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:06,953
(Soldiers shouting)

641
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:15,920
It's all clear.

642
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,158
(Baby cries)

643
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:21,761
You idiot!

644
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:26,152
Come out or we'll kill you all!

645
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,950
Stop, stop, stop! All right, stop!

646
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,642
Press, press!

647
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:39,191
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

648
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:41,199
We're Ossetian!

649
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:43,358
We are friends!

650
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:45,359
- Don't!
- Don't touch her, you fuck!

651
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:47,473
(Grunts)

652
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:48,751
OK, OK!

653
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:51,954
(Speaks Georgian)

654
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,554
This is all they had on them.

655
00:49:16,682 --> 00:49:19,150
We found a second camera in the car.

656
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:25,873
(Gunfire)

657
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:33,200
What are you doing in Avnevi,
Mr Anders and Mr Ganz?

658
00:49:33,322 --> 00:49:37,315
We were filming
in a neighbouring village

659
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,239
when the fighting broke out.

660
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:42,001
Filming her wedding.

661
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:45,353
And are Georgian weddings
a common passion for war reporters?

662
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,158
(Snorts)

663
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,911
This is amazing,
what a simple Google search can find.

664
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,239
Look. You are Thomas Anders
and Sebastian Ganz.

665
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:01,401
Ambushed by Shiite militants
on the road to Samarra.

666
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:07,150
Miriam Eisner, American reporter,
was killed.

667
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:19,711
The memory card is security coded.
Give me the code, please.

668
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,757
7676.

669
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:26,312
7676.

670
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:31,633
(Voices in Georgian)

671
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:39,552
- Nice wedding.
- Mm-hm.

672
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,951
I can make the women talk.

673
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:48,232
You will not touch my daughters!

674
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:51,957
They are Ossetians like me.

675
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,642
We are like you.

676
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,673
I am a Cossack, old man.

677
00:50:57,362 --> 00:51:01,321
And the next time
you raise your voice at me,

678
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:04,479
I will cut you open
while your daughters watch.

679
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:07,321
Daniil. Daniil...

680
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,000
Take the father first.

681
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:10,714
No, you can't do this!

682
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,430
(Speaks Georgian)

683
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:19,873
If there is a video recording,
we have to find it.

684
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:24,518
We don't need a PR nightmare
like the Americans in Iraq.

685
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:26,633
Don't worry, we'll find it.

686
00:51:26,762 --> 00:51:30,437
Sir, we just received word that
the second invasion front has launched.

687
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:31,836
Good.

688
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:36,433
(Minister) Mr President, we now face
a massive assault on two fronts.

689
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:39,793
We estimate the total size
of the Russian force at 40,000 men.

690
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:41,719
More than three times
than our own army.

691
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:46,472
- How long can they hold?
- We cannot fight a two-front war.

692
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:51,232
Our troops in Abkhazia must retreat,
or they will be wiped out.

693
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:54,590
(President) Pull them back.

694
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,274
What's the news, Christopher?

695
00:51:57,402 --> 00:52:01,190
Any news from the Americans
on our ceasefire proposal?

696
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:07,397
I was told that President Bush spoke
to Medvedev and Putin personally.

697
00:52:09,562 --> 00:52:11,598
They're not interested.

698
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:15,874
Putin left Beijing yesterday and said
he would command this personally.

699
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:19,677
He told Sarkozy he would not quit
until I am hanged by my balls!

700
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:23,440
There is some good news.

701
00:52:23,562 --> 00:52:26,440
The EU ministers have agreed
to an emergency meeting.

702
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:30,237
Oh, thank you, EU (!)
An emergency meeting! Oh!

703
00:52:30,362 --> 00:52:33,991
Oh, let's bring cocktails!
Champagne! Let's celebrate (!)

704
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:37,831
Meetings. More meetings! And
more meetings. No more meetings!

705
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:41,716
Every time some people sit
in meetings, more of our people die!

706
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:45,873
The EU representatives
have to come here!

707
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,560
They have to stand with us!

708
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:55,518
What did you do with the real card?

709
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:58,110
It's in the ground where you fell
after that guy hit you.

710
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,597
I buried it
when I came over to help you.

711
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:06,854
I swapped the cards in the orchard.
We have to get that footage out.

712
00:53:09,424 --> 00:53:12,018
Papa, are you alright?
Did they hurt you?

713
00:53:12,144 --> 00:53:14,135
I'm alright, I'm alright.

714
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,980
(Daniil speaks Georgian)

715
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:35,893
(Door slams and locks shut)

716
00:53:41,464 --> 00:53:42,817
Hey! Anders!

717
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:45,219
Hey, where are you taking him?
Sebastian!

718
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:50,782
Beautiful church.

719
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:56,099
Do you know that Georgia has some
of the oldest churches in the world?

720
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,734
At least they will be left
when this is over.

721
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,902
My leaders in Moscow
have decided they don't want to risk

722
00:54:09,024 --> 00:54:11,857
the church's condemnation
of this project.

723
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,303
Do you play?

724
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:41,142
(Tatia) In English.

725
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:43,095
Are you sure they didn't hurt you?

726
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,454
Yes, yes.

727
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:48,223
So, what did they do to you?
You were gone a long time.

728
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:54,661
You didn't tell them anything,
did you?

729
00:54:54,784 --> 00:54:57,093
Oh, Christ!

730
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:03,254
This board was a gift from my son,
Sasha. He died in Afghanistan.

731
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:30,573
Not bad, Mr Anders. Not bad.

732
00:55:33,224 --> 00:55:36,375
My Sasha was only 21
when he was killed.

733
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,973
He was captured by enemy soldiers.

734
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:43,096
You can imagine the things
they did to him.

735
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,863
That doesn't excuse
what you did here.

736
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:49,139
Of course it doesn't.

737
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:53,257
I just say so...
you know I understand.

738
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,739
Understand what?

739
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:57,934
That look in your eyes.

740
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,578
The emptiness that comes
from burying your family.

741
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:32,661
You lost your parents.
Car accident, wasn't it?

742
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:35,696
Drunk driver. Head-on collision.

743
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,503
You know what is interesting?

744
00:56:41,824 --> 00:56:47,057
That we both asked for combat
after family death.

745
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,813
And if people asked us,

746
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:56,495
I'm sure we'd give them many reasons
for why we did it.

747
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:00,096
But if we are honest...

748
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:10,814
...I think we just sought noise,

749
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:13,981
to drown out all other thoughts.

750
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,380
To forget.

751
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:21,463
Then after a while, in that noise,

752
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,940
you start to feel... immune.

753
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:29,143
Am I right?

754
00:57:29,264 --> 00:57:35,703
Unfortunately, such an attitude
makes one prone to taking risks.

755
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:37,974
Really careless sometimes.

756
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:44,696
Like accepting
a Shiite cleric's invitation

757
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:48,533
for an interview,
driving straight into a deadly trap.

758
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:51,701
- You shut your mouth.
- What?

759
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:55,656
You feel your privacy
has been invaded?

760
00:57:57,584 --> 00:57:59,814
But isn't that what you do?

761
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:03,141
Capture people
at their most vulnerable?

762
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:05,814
Enough!

763
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:11,177
(Daniil) Russia hires us, because
their own army is not motivated.

764
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:16,579
They pay us well for... special jobs.

765
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,778
Like, we catch deserters sometimes.

766
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:30,902
The lucky ones would get trial.

767
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:34,661
But the worst men...

768
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:41,303
...they give to me.

769
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,261
How could you have told them?

770
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:46,454
They will kill them now! All of us!

771
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:50,141
They already know everything.

772
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:52,141
Where is the recording? Tell me!

773
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:55,817
I don't know!

774
00:58:55,944 --> 00:58:58,412
Tatia, do not play games with me!

775
00:58:58,544 --> 00:59:01,581
These men may be Ossetians,

776
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,138
but they will not wait forever.

777
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:07,981
Tell me the location
of the memory card,

778
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:10,060
and I will let you all go.

779
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:11,742
You have my word.

780
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:14,298
I don't know
what you're talking about.

781
00:59:14,424 --> 00:59:17,257
(Chuckles) Let's not do that.

782
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:19,659
Your friend doesn't have
that kind of time.

783
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,615
What are you doing to him?

784
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:29,904
May I begin, Colonel?

785
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,616
Hold on.

786
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,416
We must think of ourselves now.

787
00:59:37,544 --> 00:59:39,421
Not two strangers!

788
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:44,057
You think they wouldn't leave us?
They will abandon us like the world has!

789
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:48,496
Tatia, tell me where the recording is?

790
00:59:49,144 --> 00:59:51,533
You Americans!

791
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:54,303
Saakashvili started this war!

792
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,699
You understand?

793
00:59:56,824 --> 01:00:00,419
We are here just to protect
our people in South Ossetia!

794
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:03,661
I can't give a fuck who you think
you're trying to protect!

795
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:08,699
But I would love to know how shooting
an old woman helps you to do it.

796
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:14,572
I'm only a soldier.
I have my orders.

797
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,662
Georgia already lost this war.

798
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:24,573
(Gunshots)

799
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:31,816
(Soldier speaking Georgian)

800
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,495
(Speaks Georgian)

801
01:00:40,624 --> 01:00:42,137
(Shouting)

802
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:46,344
- You didn't listen to me.
- How the hell did you...?

803
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:49,501
We had to fall back.
Then we heard the attack here.

804
01:00:49,624 --> 01:00:51,933
- They got Sebastian.
- Yes. We are on it.

805
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:54,737
And they got Tatia and her family.

806
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,458
- Which way?
- The jail in the basement.

807
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,303
(Soldiers shouting in Georgian)

808
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:03,656
(Gunshots)

809
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:29,937
(Speaks Georgian)

810
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:33,576
(Speaks Georgian)

811
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:36,059
- Are you all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

812
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:37,173
Yeah?

813
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:40,812
(Gunshots)

814
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,935
We can use them as shields!

815
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:48,937
Keys!

816
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:53,733
You came back!

817
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,183
- Yeah. You hurt?
- No.

818
01:01:55,304 --> 01:01:56,532
OK. Let's go.

819
01:01:56,664 --> 01:01:57,460
Tatia!

820
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,973
No, I can't trust you.

821
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:03,982
Tatia, I'm your father...

822
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:06,572
They need my help.

823
01:02:09,344 --> 01:02:12,814
No. You'll be safer with your friends.

824
01:02:15,784 --> 01:02:16,978
(Groans)

825
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,383
Medic!

826
01:02:21,024 --> 01:02:24,460
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing... just my arm.

827
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:26,222
Medic I said!

828
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:29,177
Get them!

829
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,417
You stay close to me.

830
01:02:58,504 --> 01:03:00,495
Get the vehicles started!

831
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:13,859
(Grunts)

832
01:03:13,984 --> 01:03:15,975
(Gunshots)

833
01:03:16,104 --> 01:03:17,935
(Shouting in Georgian)

834
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:22,663
(Speaks in Georgian)

835
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:27,140
We need to get the memory card!

836
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,298
I know!

837
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,338
Cover us!

838
01:03:38,344 --> 01:03:39,743
Come on! Get in!

839
01:03:39,864 --> 01:03:40,660
(Grunts)

840
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,376
Get in! Quickly!

841
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,416
Tank coming, Captain!

842
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,142
- Captain!
- I know!

843
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:09,012
(Engine revving)

844
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:53,782
Stay down!

845
01:05:00,784 --> 01:05:03,901
I have to get out!
We have evidence of a war crime!

846
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:06,299
Meet you where the road
comes around the orchard!

847
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:08,176
(Avaliani mutters)

848
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,420
(Grunts)

849
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,382
That guy's crazy.

850
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:34,697
(Shouting)

851
01:05:38,104 --> 01:05:39,378
(Grunts)

852
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:01,538
(Tatia screams)

853
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,383
Slow down! Slow down!

854
01:06:28,224 --> 01:06:29,213
Come on! Come on!

855
01:06:29,344 --> 01:06:31,016
- Did you get the memory card?
- Yeah.

856
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:36,181
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

857
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:37,976
We're almost out.

858
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,183
Papa!

859
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,419
Get down!

860
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:49,454
(Grunts)

861
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,976
(Gunshot)

862
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:32,735
(Gunshots and cheering)

863
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:22,537
Medvedev has refused
new peace proposals.

864
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:24,461
Which parts?

865
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,017
All of them.

866
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,739
He told Sarkozy that
they have their own demands.

867
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:33,823
- What possible demands?
- They're sending them over tomorrow.

868
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:37,823
I am reinstating
unilateral ceasefire.

869
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:40,936
- Mr President...
- All our troops, ceasefire.

870
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,015
Fall back to Tbilisi.
We must defend our capital.

871
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:49,422
If the world does not respond
to this gesture, it is suicide!

872
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:52,104
It is the only chance
we have for survival.

873
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:07,098
(Avaliani)
We should reach Gori by noon.

874
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:09,579
It is the nearest city
with broadcast centre.

875
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:14,663
Isn't there a faster route?
We need to get this footage out now.

876
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,978
No. We must stay off road.

877
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:16,699
I'm... sorry for your loss.

878
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:21,973
I don't mean to offend. It's...

879
01:10:23,224 --> 01:10:27,740
It's just I've lost
many people in my life.

880
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:35,980
But I believe that
all the trials that we face...

881
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:39,982
...lead us to our purpose.

882
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:44,863
Thank you.

883
01:10:52,784 --> 01:10:54,740
What do you believe, Anders?

884
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,343
I don't know.

885
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:04,739
You're abandoning your post?

886
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:06,775
By order of the President.

887
01:12:06,904 --> 01:12:08,815
All troops are to fall back

888
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:12,141
and report to defend Tbilisi.

889
01:12:13,184 --> 01:12:14,776
Gori is going to fall.

890
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:18,453
I'm sorry. I have my orders.

891
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,381
What did he say?

892
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:24,099
- They're abandoning the city.
- We've got to get in there!

893
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:26,692
- What do you wanna do?
- I will not run.

894
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,582
I will not lose my country!

895
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:32,582
I've fought in too many wars
to keep Georgia free.

896
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,260
(Helicopter whirring drowns speech)

897
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:16,618
(Speaks Georgian)

898
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:42,059
- Which way to the broadcast centre?
- That way! East!

899
01:13:57,824 --> 01:14:00,338
I'm sorry. We must leave you here.

900
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:04,059
I need to attempt a defence. As soon
as you can, you must leave the city.

901
01:14:04,184 --> 01:14:07,494
It will become very dangerous.

902
01:14:07,624 --> 01:14:10,502
- Take care, Rezo.
- God be with you.

903
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:18,261
- (Anders) You got the card?
- Yeah.

904
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:20,375
First, we need an upload code

905
01:14:20,504 --> 01:14:22,574
from a network willing
to accept the footage.

906
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:26,977
Shit! They've gone!

907
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:31,816
(Sighs)

908
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:36,733
- What do we do now?
- We need a phone.

909
01:14:42,864 --> 01:14:45,822
- 'International operator.'
- A collect call to the USA.

910
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,423
I need to eat something.

911
01:14:48,704 --> 01:14:51,423
Hey! I got water!

912
01:14:51,544 --> 01:14:53,057
- Hey, Karin.
- 'Thank God!'

913
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:56,221
- You guys all right?
- 'Yeah. We're in Gori.'

914
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:58,337
Gori? It's been bombed!

915
01:14:58,464 --> 01:15:00,534
- I know.
- 'You need to get out.'

916
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:01,653
Got coins!

917
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:04,856
No. We have something we need
to upload. I need a network!

918
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:07,942
- The Russians are likely to take...
- 'Karin, I know! Listen to me!'

919
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:10,737
We witnessed something.
Killings. Executions in a village.

920
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:13,094
Sebastian got it all on tape.
We have to get it out.

921
01:15:13,224 --> 01:15:15,784
- 'Now.'
- Yeah, but how?

922
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:20,341
There's a media centre building here
with a satellite upload capability.

923
01:15:20,464 --> 01:15:23,740
We can get in,
but we need for a network

924
01:15:23,864 --> 01:15:26,936
to accept the feed
and give us... an access code.

925
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,862
She'd better hurry!
The bombing's winding down.

926
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,544
Which means the ground troops
are getting ready.

927
01:15:32,664 --> 01:15:34,382
- You hear that?
- 'Yeah, but Anders...'

928
01:15:34,504 --> 01:15:38,053
I have already tried everyone.
No one cares.

929
01:15:38,184 --> 01:15:42,541
'But I'll try Roger McTierney.
If anyone can get it on, it's him.'

930
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:44,256
Yeah, yeah. OK.

931
01:15:46,944 --> 01:15:48,343
Here.

932
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:52,059
Give me those coins.
Let's try the Dutchman.

933
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:53,253
Yeah.

934
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,698
Friendlies!

935
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:17,863
Hold your fire!

936
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,575
Have you seen ground troops?

937
01:16:27,704 --> 01:16:29,615
Hear that?

938
01:16:33,224 --> 01:16:34,976
The bombing's stopped.

939
01:16:36,104 --> 01:16:37,981
Defensive positions!

940
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:39,503
Move out!

941
01:16:40,504 --> 01:16:41,334
(Phone rings)

942
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:43,819
- Karin?
- 'He won't do it.'

943
01:16:43,944 --> 01:16:44,933
Fuck!

944
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,300
All right. Thanks for trying, anyway.

945
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:52,133
- 'What are you gonna do now?'
- I don't know.

946
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:54,175
(Explosion)

947
01:16:54,304 --> 01:16:55,737
Fuck!

948
01:16:55,864 --> 01:16:58,139
We're OK. I'll call you once... Karin?

949
01:16:58,264 --> 01:16:59,856
(Phone line buzzing)

950
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:06,093
- (Sebastian) Now what?
- We've gotta leave town. Come on.

951
01:17:10,704 --> 01:17:12,695
(Explosions in the distance)

952
01:17:20,104 --> 01:17:21,423
Whoa!

953
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:24,217
Jesus!

954
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:27,376
Let's go! Come on!

955
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:36,181
They're doing a final sweep.

956
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:41,458
We've got to find shelter
before the ground troops get here!

957
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:49,453
Fuck!

958
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:53,816
(Laughs)
Hey! So glad you guys didn't die!

959
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:55,377
How are you?

960
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,142
Hey! How did you find us?

961
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:59,539
Your message.
I tried calling you back.

962
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:01,495
- You still need a SAT upload?
- Yeah.

963
01:18:01,624 --> 01:18:04,092
I got one. Stilton and I have
an upload vehicle. Come on.

964
01:18:04,224 --> 01:18:06,943
I would've driven it here,
but I didn't feel like blowing up.

965
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:10,739
Listen, I need you
to sit this one out, OK?

966
01:18:10,864 --> 01:18:14,413
- Anders, I can take care of myself.
- Well, we can't risk this. Please!

967
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:16,296
Where am I gonna be safer?

968
01:18:16,424 --> 01:18:18,221
My station will take yours. Come on!

969
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:20,062
Hold on. We've got to make a detour.

970
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:22,379
Demidov told me
they spared the churches, so...

971
01:18:22,504 --> 01:18:24,540
Everybody, get close. Get close.

972
01:18:24,664 --> 01:18:26,495
- Now be happy.
- For fuck's sake!

973
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:29,092
It's only a war.

974
01:18:38,304 --> 01:18:39,578
(Speaks Georgian)

975
01:18:55,304 --> 01:18:58,455
Anders... I don't like this at all.

976
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:03,182
Would you do it for me?

977
01:19:03,304 --> 01:19:07,456
We'll come right back and then
we can all leave the city together.

978
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:08,903
Fine.

979
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:10,742
Thank you.

980
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:13,503
How do I get in touch with you
if something happens?

981
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:26,659
That's Dutchman's cell. Tell these...

982
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:30,458
Ask these people
if anybody has a cell phone.

983
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:34,294
(Speaks Georgian)

984
01:19:43,464 --> 01:19:45,261
OK. What's the number?

985
01:19:45,384 --> 01:19:47,454
There.

986
01:19:47,584 --> 01:19:50,735
I'll call you on this phone
as soon as the upload is done, OK?

987
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:52,661
OK.

988
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:56,102
You know, I hope...

989
01:19:56,944 --> 01:19:59,219
- Anders, come on! Let's go!
- Come on!

990
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:20,216
(Camera shutter clicks)

991
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:26,335
(Gunshots)

992
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:34,096
I can't reach Stilton.
The signal keeps coming in and out.

993
01:20:41,664 --> 01:20:43,939
Stilton!

994
01:20:45,024 --> 01:20:47,060
- What's up?
- Zoe's with him.

995
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:51,223
She knows what she's doing.

996
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:54,895
(Dutchman) Align the dish!

997
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:57,413
Link us back up! Hurry!

998
01:20:57,544 --> 01:20:59,262
(Anders) Wake up, Romeo!

999
01:20:59,384 --> 01:21:02,342
It's all we got. The people have got
to see this footage! Now!

1000
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,658
Here.

1001
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:06,577
Hope it still works.

1002
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:08,376
(Gunshots)

1003
01:21:08,504 --> 01:21:10,813
- Data's intact.
- Oh, yes!

1004
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:13,378
How long for the uplink?

1005
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:15,893
- Come on.
- About two minutes to transmit.

1006
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,743
- Can I offer you a drink?
- I'll wait till the footage is out.

1007
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:21,503
But I will take a cigarette.

1008
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,100
(Beeping)

1009
01:21:57,544 --> 01:21:59,774
They've targeted us!
Get under cover! Go!

1010
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:01,781
Go, go, go!

1011
01:22:01,904 --> 01:22:04,134
- What are you doing?
- Saving our footage. Go!

1012
01:22:09,064 --> 01:22:11,419
- (Sebastian) Almost there!
- Gotta go!

1013
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:13,341
(Anders) Come on!

1014
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,783
Come on!

1015
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:18,543
- Get out!
- Come on! Come on!

1016
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,416
- We're not gonna make it!
- Get out!

1017
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:32,098
Get up now! Come on!

1018
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:46,692
(Speaks Georgian)

1019
01:23:09,304 --> 01:23:11,340
(Cheering)

1020
01:23:22,744 --> 01:23:24,575
(Anders) Dutchman? Stilton?

1021
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,142
Sebastian!

1022
01:23:32,504 --> 01:23:34,062
It's bad, isn't it?

1023
01:23:34,184 --> 01:23:35,902
I can't feel shit!

1024
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:37,457
You're OK.

1025
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:38,812
Hey.

1026
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,052
(Chuckles)

1027
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,453
(Gunshots)

1028
01:23:43,584 --> 01:23:46,257
Oh, fuck. Shit.

1029
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:49,421
- Go, go.
- I'm not leaving you.

1030
01:23:49,544 --> 01:23:51,136
- You have to go.
- I can help you.

1031
01:23:51,264 --> 01:23:54,893
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You need to go. Now.

1032
01:23:55,024 --> 01:23:58,937
- I'm not fucking leaving you!
- Shut the fuck up, OK?

1033
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:00,975
I can't move.

1034
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,860
You have to get our footage out.

1035
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:08,499
Go back to that church.
Hide the card until it's safe.

1036
01:24:08,624 --> 01:24:10,501
I'll be fine.

1037
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,536
Life insurance policy. Remember?

1038
01:24:18,904 --> 01:24:20,735
Listen, you have to do this for me.

1039
01:24:21,704 --> 01:24:24,502
Promise me. Promise me
you'll get the footage out.

1040
01:24:24,624 --> 01:24:26,182
- Promise me!
- I promise!

1041
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:28,181
(Gunshots)

1042
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:33,696
Here. Take this.

1043
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:36,903
I'm coming right back.

1044
01:24:37,024 --> 01:24:38,423
Go!

1045
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:52,181
Tatia?

1046
01:24:53,144 --> 01:24:55,817
Tatia? Where is the girl I was with?

1047
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,575
Come on, guys. Somebody must know.
Where is the girl I was with?

1048
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:02,415
Where's the girl?
There was a girl with me.

1049
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:05,661
I don't need a phone this time.
I need the girl I was with.

1050
01:25:05,784 --> 01:25:06,978
Remember the girl?

1051
01:25:09,664 --> 01:25:10,858
Oh, Jesus.

1052
01:25:13,664 --> 01:25:15,063
(Mobile rings)

1053
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:20,016
- 'If you have hurt her...'
- Come to the Stalin Square.

1054
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,616
Bring the memory card.

1055
01:26:03,384 --> 01:26:05,534
I need you to do something
very important for me.

1056
01:26:05,664 --> 01:26:08,132
Do you understand? OK.

1057
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:56,900
Did you bring what I wanted?

1058
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,183
Let her go.

1059
01:27:17,824 --> 01:27:19,098
Thank God!

1060
01:27:19,224 --> 01:27:21,180
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1061
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:23,579
I thought I'd never see you again.

1062
01:27:26,344 --> 01:27:28,983
Did you make the broadcast?

1063
01:27:29,104 --> 01:27:30,583
No.

1064
01:27:32,104 --> 01:27:33,298
Sebastian?

1065
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:36,938
(Sighs) No.

1066
01:27:38,304 --> 01:27:39,532
(Sobs)

1067
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:41,495
Everything will be OK.

1068
01:27:47,064 --> 01:27:49,180
I would have liked
to know you better.

1069
01:27:50,424 --> 01:27:52,460
I don't understand.

1070
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:55,260
Now I need you to run.

1071
01:27:56,584 --> 01:27:59,894
- Anders...
- Go. Go.

1072
01:28:07,864 --> 01:28:09,377
Go!

1073
01:28:37,784 --> 01:28:40,742
The code is 1216.

1074
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:49,220
You missed a card
when you searched me Avnevi.

1075
01:28:49,344 --> 01:28:51,539
The real one's on its way
to a human rights group,

1076
01:28:51,664 --> 01:28:54,098
courtesy of a brave little girl.

1077
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,622
It's over.

1078
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:05,300
And how did you think
you could survive this?

1079
01:29:06,264 --> 01:29:07,697
I didn't.

1080
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:30,463
(Gunshot)

1081
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:03,339
I thought I told you to run!

1082
01:30:39,904 --> 01:30:42,259
I wanna see him
one last time, OK?

1083
01:31:09,304 --> 01:31:10,942
This...

1084
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,575
This is where I left him.

1085
01:31:14,664 --> 01:31:16,461
I fucking left him.

1086
01:31:44,184 --> 01:31:46,254
(Shouting)

1087
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:48,340
Anders!

1088
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:56,180
- Hey, Rezo!
- We need your help.

1089
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:57,498
- OK.
- Right.

1090
01:31:57,624 --> 01:32:00,013
- Anders.
- Sebastian?

1091
01:32:01,024 --> 01:32:04,175
Sebastian! What the fuck?

1092
01:32:04,304 --> 01:32:07,137
- I played dead.
- Are you OK?

1093
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:09,821
- Can we move you?
- Yeah.

1094
01:32:09,944 --> 01:32:11,616
Let's get him out of here.

1095
01:32:11,744 --> 01:32:12,779
(Speaks Georgian)

1096
01:32:18,184 --> 01:32:19,981
- You all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

1097
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:43,535
Hold on, we gotta stop.
Put him down.

1098
01:32:55,184 --> 01:32:58,062
Don't resist, Captain.

1099
01:33:18,064 --> 01:33:20,339
- Anders?
- There's nowhere to run.

1100
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:22,455
Even if we could.

1101
01:33:44,944 --> 01:33:46,855
Sir, they're not resisting.

1102
01:34:05,424 --> 01:34:07,813
(Speaks Georgian)

1103
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:31,297
Get away from here!

1104
01:34:35,064 --> 01:34:36,053
Go!

1105
01:34:39,824 --> 01:34:42,258
There's been enough killing.

1106
01:35:03,784 --> 01:35:05,775
(Cheering and applause)

1107
01:35:24,544 --> 01:35:29,095
Today the forces of occupation
have gathered at our gates.

1108
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,215
(Jeering and booing)

1109
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:37,540
And we know that this empire
is very powerful.

1110
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:40,542
They have lots of tanks.
They have lots of planes.

1111
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:45,533
But we have something
that is more precious.

1112
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:49,259
We have the love for freedom, and
we have the love for independence!

1113
01:35:49,384 --> 01:35:51,375
(Cheering)

1114
01:35:51,504 --> 01:35:54,860
We stand here today
as one proud independent nation.

1115
01:35:54,984 --> 01:35:57,452
Just like the Finns,
just like the Czechs,

1116
01:35:57,584 --> 01:35:59,939
and just like
the Hungarians before us.

1117
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:05,500
And we tell them today,
in front of the whole world,

1118
01:36:05,624 --> 01:36:09,094
that freedom will not retreat,
freedom will not surrender!

1119
01:36:10,544 --> 01:36:13,581
We may be besieged,
but we are not alone.

1120
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:18,380
Standing with us here tonight
are six European presidents

1121
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,813
who have travelled
thousands of miles

1122
01:36:20,944 --> 01:36:22,935
in defiance of fear and threats!

1123
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:26,741
These six men are here

1124
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,094
because they know
the issue of independence

1125
01:36:29,224 --> 01:36:31,454
is being decided here tonight!

1126
01:36:31,584 --> 01:36:33,575
(Cheering)

1127
01:36:35,224 --> 01:36:40,423
May God bless the Georgian people!
Long live a free Georgia!

1128
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,535
(Cheering)

1129
01:36:47,544 --> 01:36:50,456
Georgia! Georgia! Georgia!

1130
01:36:55,264 --> 01:36:57,255
(Chanting continues)

1131
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,419
(Church bells ringing)

1132
01:37:12,544 --> 01:37:14,694
They say you're gonna
make a full recovery.

1133
01:37:14,824 --> 01:37:18,658
Yeah? Six months!

1134
01:37:18,784 --> 01:37:22,572
And... our footage?

1135
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:25,776
It's out. Human Rights Watch has it.

1136
01:37:25,904 --> 01:37:29,260
It's getting a lot of hits and
people are starting to pay attention.

1137
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,700
Not bad for a loose cannon.

1138
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:35,136
Thanks, bucko.

1139
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:38,415
'Despite the ceasefire
and pledges to withdraw,

1140
01:37:38,544 --> 01:37:41,502
'the Russian troops and tanks
remain in Gori,

1141
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:43,854

'and nothing but stories
of violence, looting and killings.

1146
01:37:53,344 --> 01:37:55,335
The war lasted five days.

1147

'More than 100,000 people
have lost their homes...

1148
01:37:58,064 --> 01:38:00,055
Several hundred people were killed,
including five reporters.

1149

'...since this war began
just nine days ago.

'People keep asking me
how can this still be happening...'

1151
01:38:06,344 --> 01:38:09,256
An estimated 50,000 people
were made homeless,

1152
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,376
their villages permanently
destroyed or occupied.

1153
01:38:12,504 --> 01:38:17,532
Many still live in refugee camps.

1154
01:38:19,424 --> 01:38:21,984
Despite demands from Europe
and the United States to withdraw,

1155
01:38:22,104 --> 01:38:24,698
the regions of South Ossetia
and Abkhazia remain occupied

1156
01:38:24,824 --> 01:38:26,735
by Russian forces.

1157
01:38:26,864 --> 01:38:28,855
This nation is right now
fighting for its survival.

1158
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:33,739
Georgia continues its quest
to integrate with the West.

'This is Thomas Anders
reporting in Georgia.'

My husband, Mikheil Taboshvili.
Killed in Eredvi village.

1161
01:38:47,584 --> 01:38:49,176
My father.

My mother, Natalia Okropiridze.

1164
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,022
As my parents were being evacuated
and they were crossing the road,

1165
01:39:04,184 --> 01:39:10,054
a mine exploded in front of their car and
shrapnel hit her straight in the temple.

1166
01:39:10,184 --> 01:39:12,823
She died on the spot.

Our grandmother.

1170

My parents were tortured.
Their throats were slit.

1171
01:39:27,304 --> 01:39:32,014
They were buried in our backyard,
and that's all we know.

1172
01:39:33,784 --> 01:39:36,457
This is Nodar Otiashvili, my father.

1173
01:39:37,744 --> 01:39:41,657
We used to live
in Kvemo Achabeti village.

1174
01:39:44,024 --> 01:39:46,140
I am the son of Socrate Gogidze.

1175
01:39:47,704 --> 01:39:52,175
I was told by the Red Cross

1176
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:54,454
that he was buried in our garden.

1177
01:39:57,504 --> 01:39:59,301
He had been hanged.

I am Marina Kakhbiashvili.
I used to live in Kehvi village.

On August 8th, we left.

1180
01:40:11,664 --> 01:40:15,179
My husband stayed there.
My son and my husband.

1181
01:40:15,304 --> 01:40:19,217
My son left that night.
My husband stayed in the house.

Ekaterine Papelishvili, my grandmother.
