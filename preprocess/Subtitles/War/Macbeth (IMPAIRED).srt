00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,124
Upon the battlefield,
there to meet with Macbeth.

Good sir,

why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair?

55

My noble partner
you greet with present grace

Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.

Say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence

melted as breath into the wind.

Were such things here
as we do speak about?

Or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner?

and poured them down before him.

from our royal master thanks.

call thee Thane of Cawdor.

the Thane of Cawdor to me

cannot be ill,

whose horrid image doth unfix my hair

109
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,583
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs

not bear the knife myself.

Besides, this Duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek,

hath been so clear in his great office,

as thou art in desire?

Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem'st the ornament of life

and live a coward in thy own esteem,

Prithee, peace.

231
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,124

What beast was't, then,

00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,041
that made you break this enterprise to me?

235
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,833
When you durst do it, then you were a man.

236
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,124
And to be more than what you were,

237
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,624
you would be so much more the man.

238

I have given suck

239
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:03,041
and know how tender 'tis
to love the babe that milks me.

240
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:07,833
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

241
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,874
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

242
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,333
and dashed the brains out

243
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:16,041
had I so sworn, as you have done, to this.

244

245
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,166
We fail.

upon the unguarded Duncan?

254
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,333
What not put upon his spongy officers

00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,208
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

Merciful powers,

restrain in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

Or art thou but a dagger of the mind?

A false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain.

272

Thou marshall'st me
the way that I was going

273
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,374
and such an instrument I was to use.

There's no such thing.

It is the bloody business

00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,041
- The King, is he stirring?
- Not yet.

327
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,791
He did command me to call timely on him.

328
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,666
I have almost slipped the hour.

329
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,583
I'll bring you to him.

330
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:56,708
I'll make so bold to call.

331
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,249
- Goes the King hence today?
- He does; he did appoint so.

332
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,666
LENNOX: The night has been unruly.

333
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:20,374
Where we lay, our temples were blown down

334
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,916
and, as they say,

335
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:27,749
lamentings heard in the air,

336
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,791
strange screams of death.

337
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,333

the Lord's anointed temple

342
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:03,666
and stole thence the life of the building.

343
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,249
The life?

00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,916
MACDUFF: Bid me not speak. You see.

346
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,041
Speak yourselves.

Our royal master, he's murdered.

- LADY MACBETH: Murdered?
- MACDUFF: Murdered!

Those of his chamber,

their hands were all badged with blood.

Hm?

Who could refrain that had a heart to love

and in that heart
courage to make love known?

(BELLS RING)

370
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,166
How it does grieve Macbeth.

371

Did he not straight, in pious rage,

372
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,958
the two delinquents tear

373
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,999
that were the slaves of drink?

374
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,624
Was this not nobly done?

375

Let Your Highness command upon me

My Lord, I will not.

465
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:03,208
We hear our bloody cousin
is bestowed in England,

not confessing his cruel parricide,

467
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,749
filling his hearers with strange invention.

468
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,666
But of that tomorrow.

00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:42,666
Ay, my good Lord.
Our time does call upon's.

Farewell.

Within this hour, at most,

475
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,874
I will advise you
where to plant yourselves,

476

o' the time the moment on't,

whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's,

483
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:54,416
must embrace the fate of that dark hour.

Sit down. At first and last,
the hearty welcome.

491
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,666
Our hostess keeps her state

492
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:05,833
but in best time
we will require her welcome.

493
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:10,541
Pronounce it for me, sir,
to all our friends,

494
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,666
for my heart speaks they are welcome.

495
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,958
Your Majesty.

496
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,416
Be large in mirth, anon,

497
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,208
we'll drink a measure the table round.

498
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:29,374
There's blood upon thy face.

499
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,208
'Tis Banquo's then.

500
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,749
Is he dispatched?

501
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,791
My Lord, his throat is cut.

502
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:39,791
He's good that did the like for Fleance.

503
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,874
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

504
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,749
Most royal sir, Fleance is scaped.

505
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,124
Then comes my fit again.

506
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,291
I had else been perfect,

507
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:04,041
whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

508
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,458
as broad and general as the casing air.

509
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,583
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined,

510
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,499
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

511
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:15,124
My royal Lord, you do not give the cheer.

512
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,291
Thanks for that.

513
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:25,166
Sweet remembrancer!

514
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:29,666
Now, good digestion wait on appetite

515
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,999
and health on both.

516
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,083
Here had we now
our country's honour roofed,

517
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,249
were the graced person
of our Banquo present,

518
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,083
who may I rather challenge for unkindness

519
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:46,083
than pity for mischance.

520
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:49,999
His absence, sir,
lays blame upon his promise.

521
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,999
What is't that moves Your Highness?

522
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:09,958
- Which of you have done this?
- LENNOX: What, my good Lord?

523
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:15,249
Thou canst not say that I did it.

524
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:20,624
His Highness is not well.

525
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,083
Sit, worthy friends.

526
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,624
Pray you, keep seat.

527
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,833
The fit is momentary.

528
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,083
Upon a thought he will again be well.

529
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:33,458
If much you note him, you shall offend him

530
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:36,124
and extend his passion.

531
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,083
Feed and regard him not.

532
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:43,916
Are you a man?

533
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:50,624
Ay, and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil.

534
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,958
LADY MACBETH: O proper stuff!

535
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:55,833
Prithee, see there.

536
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,666
Behold.

537
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,416
Look, lo! How say you?

538
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:04,999
This is the very painting of your fear.

539
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:08,583
This is the air-drawn dagger
which you said led you to Duncan.

540
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,708
Why do you make such faces?

541
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:18,416
If I stand here, I saw him.

542
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:24,166
My worthy Lord,
your noble friends do lack you.

543
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,708
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

544
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:30,083
The time has been that,
when the brains were out,

545
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:32,249
the man would die

546
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,999
and there an end.

547
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,541
But now they rise again
and push us from our stools.

548
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,791
This is more strange
than such a murder is.

549
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:51,958
I do forget.

550
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,416
Come.

551
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,333
Love and health to all.

552
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:06,374
ALL: Our duties and the pledge.

553
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:17,249
Avaunt and quit my sight.

554
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:21,541
Let the earth hide thee.

555
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,749
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

556
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:29,749
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
which thou dost glare with.

557
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,624
LADY MACBETH: Think of this, good peers...

558
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,041
...but as a thing of custom.

559
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,999
'Tis no other.

560
01:05:43,084 --> 01:05:45,208
I pray you, sit still.

(DOOR CLOSES)

563
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:02,249
You make me strange,

564
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,458
even to the disposition that I owe

565
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,499
when now I think
you can behold such sights

566
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:19,624
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanched with fear.

567
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:24,458
- What sights, my Lord?
- I pray you, speak not.

568
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:29,499
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.

569
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:32,874
Stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once.

570
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,208
Good night,
and better health attend His Majesty.

571
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:38,374
A kind good-night to all.

572
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:48,291
It will have blood.

573
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:53,333
They say blood will have blood.

574
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,541
What is the night?

575
01:07:08,584 --> 01:07:11,666
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

576
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,291
How say'st thou
that Macduff denies his person

577
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:21,583
at our great bidding?

578
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,416
You lack the season of all natures.

579
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:28,874
Sleep.

who frets, or where conspirers are.

Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

But yet I'll make assurance double sure

01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:47,999
The spirits that know
all mortal consequence

654
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,708
have pronounced me thus:

655
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,708
"Fear not, Macbeth.

656
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:57,583
"No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

657
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,166
Then fly, false thanes,

658
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,374
and mingle with the English epicures.

659
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,458
Why are you silent?

660
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,791
LADY MACDUFF: This tyrant,

661
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,124
whose sole name blisters our tongues,

662
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:31,333
was once thought honest.

663
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:12,124
Now is the time of help.

664
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,999
Your eye in Scotland

665
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,583
would create soldiers,

666
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:24,374
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses.

667
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,999
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.

668
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:33,208
I have words

669
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:36,333
that would be howled in the desert air

670
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,166
where hearing should not latch them.

671
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,416
My ever gentle cousin.

672
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,791
Stands Scotland where it did?

673
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,999
Alas, poor country,

674
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,166
it's almost afraid to know itself.

675
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,999
It cannot be called our mother
but our graves.

676
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,249
What's our newest grief?

677
01:18:08,459 --> 01:18:12,124
Let not your ears despise my tongue
which shall possess them

678
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,124
with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard.

679
01:18:20,417 --> 01:18:22,499
How does my wife?

680
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:27,249
Your castle is surprised,

681
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:33,999

682
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,124
What man, hm?

683
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,374
What man?

684
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:55,999
My children too?

685
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:05,166
Wife, children, servants,

686
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:06,916
all that could be found.

687

689

and their dam,

690
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,458
in one fell swoop?

691
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,791
Dispute it like a man.

692
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,749
Oh...

693
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,791
Oh, I will do so.

694
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,333
But I will also feel it as a man.

695
01:20:05,209 --> 01:20:07,208
Sinful Macduff!

696
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:12,083
They were all struck for thee.

Be this the whetstone of your sword.

Blunt not the heart, enrage it.

700

Gracious England hath lent us
ten thousand men.

701

702

this fiend of Scotland and myself,

705
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:46,374
and within my sword's length you set him.

706
01:20:53,959 --> 01:20:56,416
If he scape,

707
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:58,374

728

Yet who would have thought

01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:22,208
the old man to have had
so much blood in him?

730

cast the water of my land,

I have lived long enough.

822
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:44,083
My way of life is fallen into the sere,

823
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:49,749
the yellow leaf.

824
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:54,291
And that which should
accompany old age as...

825
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:59,291
...honour,

826
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:00,833
love,

827
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,541
obedience,

828
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:05,291
troops of friends,

829
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,958
I must not look to have,

830
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,458
but, in their stead,

831
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:19,416
curses,

832
01:33:23,209 --> 01:33:25,124
not loud,

833
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:29,041
but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

834
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:35,916
which the poor heart would fain deny
and dare not.

835
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,749
Seyton.

836
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:45,333
All is confirmed, my Lord,
which was reported.

837
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:50,624
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

838
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,749
- Give me my armour.
- 'Tis not needed yet.

839
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,458
I'll put it on!

840
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:48,958
And now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.

841
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,708
Ring the alarum bell.

842
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:03,624
Arm, arm, and out!

843
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:13,499
Tyrant, show thy face!

844
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:24,291
MACBETH: There is nor flying hence
nor tarrying here.

845
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:27,749
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun

846
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:30,416
and wish the estate o' the world
were now undone.

847
01:35:31,209 --> 01:35:32,833
Blow, wind.

848
01:35:32,959 --> 01:35:35,708
Come, wrack.

849
01:35:36,709 --> 01:35:39,374
At least we'll die
with harness on our back.

850
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,833
'They have tied me to a stake.

851
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:48,499
'I cannot fly.

852
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:51,624
'But, bear-like, I must fight the course.

853
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,583
'What's he that was not born of woman?

854
01:35:57,375 --> 01:36:00,333
'Such a one am I to fear, or none.

855
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:04,666
'Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword?'

856
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:09,208
Whiles I see lives,
the gashes do better upon them.

857
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,083
Turn, hellhound.

858
01:36:12,209 --> 01:36:13,499
Turn.

859
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:22,749
Of all men else I have avoided thee.

860
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,458
But get thee back.

861
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,083
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

862
01:36:29,209 --> 01:36:30,916
I have no words.

863
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,624
My voice is in my sword.

864
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:57,416
Thou losest labour.

865
01:36:57,542 --> 01:37:02,041
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress

866
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,374
as make me bleed.

867
01:37:29,084 --> 01:37:30,708
(ROARS)

868
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:28,958
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.

869
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:32,749
I bear a charmed life

870
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:36,124
which must not yield to one of woman born.

871
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,833
Despair thy charm

872
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,499
and let the angel
whom thou still hast served tell thee

873
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:49,874
Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

874
01:39:06,084 --> 01:39:08,499
Accursed be the tongue that tells me so,

875
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,166
for it hath cowed my better part of man.

876
01:39:26,084 --> 01:39:27,749
I'll not fight with thee.

877
01:40:14,334 --> 01:40:16,374
MACDUFF: Then yield thee, coward,

878
01:40:18,209 --> 01:40:21,541
and live to be
the show and gaze of the time.

879
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:29,833
I will have thee,
as our rarer monsters are,

880
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:36,416
painted upon a pole,

881
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:40,499
and underwrit:

882
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:45,208
"Here may you see the tyrant,

883
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,041
"Macbeth."

884
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:01,208
(GROANS)

885
01:41:06,042 --> 01:41:07,541
I will not yield

886
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:11,874
to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet

887
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,041
and to be baited with the rabble's curse.

888
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:25,499
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane

889
01:41:26,709 --> 01:41:28,874
and thou opposed,

890
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,249
being of no woman born,

891
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,124
yet I will try the last.

892
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:49,541
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.

893
01:41:56,209 --> 01:41:57,916
Lay on, Macduff.

894
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:06,333
And damned be him that first cries,

895
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:11,124
"Hold, enough!"

896
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:48,583
He's worth more sorrow,
and that I'll spend for him.

897
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:52,041
He's worth no more.

898
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,999
Hail,

899
01:44:01,584 --> 01:44:04,333
King of Scotland!

900
01:44:06,917 --> 01:44:10,583
Hail, King of Scotland!

901
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,666
SOLDIERS: Hail, King of Scotland!
