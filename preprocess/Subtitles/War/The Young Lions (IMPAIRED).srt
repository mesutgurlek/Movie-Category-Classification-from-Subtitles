Thank you, no.
I'm fine.

That's all right.
I was listening to the music.

He has?
Y-Yes.

No, I meant, I only met him this
morning at the draft board.

You met Michael at the draft board?
Yes.

Fine, thanks, and you?

Hi, Hope. Hi, Mike. How are you?

Fine. How are you? I want
you to meet somebody. Good.

Oh? Friend of yours?
Yes.

Hello.
How do you do?

332
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,040
See if you can cheer him up. I
don't think he likes my music.

I'm not being drafted.
Mr. Ackerman says you are.

339

Mr. Ackerman doesn't know what rabbits can

Oh, Michael,
what's the matter with you?

343
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,922
You think I hate you
for trying to get out of it?

344
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,925
I don't.
Really, I don't.

345
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,847
Anything you do is okay with me, but
you start to feel guilty about it,

346
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,644
then we start having fights, and you
take it out on me. I don't feel guilty!

347
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:31,231
It's just that I'm against war and this whole
drummed-up, superpatriotic atmosphere.

348
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,152
You just don't want to get shot.
Nobody wants to get shot.

349
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,489
So stop trying
to convince yourself.

350
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,991
Forget it.

351
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,871
I got a sick show on my hands!
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

352

Look, Michael,
this is me, Margaret.

353
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,252
I understand you.

354
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,465
You're a heel, but you're
not that big a heel.

355
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,425
And then, too,

357
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,722
I was told that.

358
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,893
I like your tie.
You do?

359
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,105
I just saw it, and I bought it.

You do?
Mm-hmm.

363

You wanna walk?
All right.

364
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,998
Let's walk.
Okay.

Well, maybe so.

369
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,602
New York City must be quite frightening
to a girl from the country.

370

Oh, no, it isn't.

371
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,315
The truth is it puts on
an act of sophistication,

372
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,236
but at heart
it's strictly provincial.

373
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,447
I don't think it's provincial.

374

Anyway, not after Vermont.

Mm-hmm.

Does have some beautiful women.

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,752
Flashy, some of them.

378
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,504
You know,
I'm told European women...

379
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,549
are more mature emotionally.

380
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,011
They are?
Oh.

381
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,264
As a matter of fact,
friends of mine have told me‒

382
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,561
Well, anyway.
What time is it?

383
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,565
It's late. We better be getting back.
No. I'd like to go home.

00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,138
Well, at last.

Now we take the bus.

Don't be angry with me.
Why not?

You have been very charming.

394
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,889
You have not been
understanding.

395
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,268
In fact, you haven't even been
conversational all evening long.

I'm sorry, Margaret.
Really, I am.

But lately it seems we can't
talk without arguing.

what's bothering me.

Look, why don't we just sit and be quiet?
And then what?

404
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,013
Then you kiss me.

reconstructed cheekbones.

1249
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:17,610
I have written to Gretchen
in this kind of detail...

1250
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,821
to prepare her for it.

1251
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:24,325
And she has assured me
she is proud of me,

1252
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,536
and it will make no difference.

1253
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,372
Gretchen is
the name of my wife.

1254
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:33,042
Yes, I know.

1255
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,794
How do you know?

1256
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:41,467
Oh, yes. You delivered
a package for me.

1257
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,138
She's quite handsome,
isn't she?

1258
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:49,433
Yes, sir.
She's quite handsome.

1259
01:50:49,517 --> 01:50:51,435
She will be very useful
to my career.

1260
01:50:53,396 --> 01:50:56,148
What I would like
for you to do for me is...

1261
01:50:56,232 --> 01:51:00,569
visit her again...
to reassure her.

1262
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,658
I know it's
a great deal to ask,

1263
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:10,829
to speak for a man to his wife
under these circumstances,

1264
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:15,167
but I want her to hear
from a third party that I am...

1265
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,211
salvageable.

1266
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:22,341
Yes, I-I-I will be
glad to do that.

1267
01:51:22,425 --> 01:51:26,053
Thank you.
Thank you, Diestl.

1268
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:31,433
Now, come closer.

1269
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,899
Yes, sir.

1270
01:51:40,443 --> 01:51:42,903
Are we alone?

1271
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:48,492
Yes, except for...
Yes, it's all right.

1272
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:53,247
I have one more favor
to ask of you.

1273
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:56,458
I want you to bring me
a bayonet.

1274
01:51:58,169 --> 01:52:01,964
A bayonet? Yes, yes. A bayonet.

1275
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:08,053
Well, I think, uh‒ Wh-What
is the matter with you?

1276
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:10,264
Not for me.

1277
01:52:10,348 --> 01:52:12,307
For him.

1278
01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:17,563
He has no hands left...
or anything left.

1279
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,565
He wants to die.

1280
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,443
I've promised him.

1281
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:26,238
[ Whispering ] He whispers to me...
when we are alone.

1282
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:28,240
And he can hear.

1283
01:52:32,912 --> 01:52:36,165
He's a watchmaker...
in Nuremberg.

1284
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:38,751
He specializes in stopwatches.

1285
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:42,755
He has three children,
and he wants to die.

1286
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:04,109
Where is my hand?

1287
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,154
Approximately over his heart.

1288
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:09,239
Good.

1289
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:12,534
That's where I will place
the bayonet.

1290
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:16,997
We have practiced it
every night for a week.

1291
01:53:17,081 --> 01:53:19,708
Come back tonight
with the bayonet.

1292
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:36,683
Diestl, will you bring me
the bayonet?

1293
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:40,562
Yes, sir.

1294
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,402
Good-bye, Diestl.

1295
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,454
Good-bye, sir.

1296
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:45,145
[ Gretchen ] Yes? It's
Christian Diestl.

1297
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:49,358
Who?

1298
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:52,361
Christian Diestl.

1299
01:55:58,534 --> 01:56:02,996
Hello?
Oh, the lieutenant.

1300
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:05,916
Yes.
Come in.

1301
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:13,840
How are you?

1302
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:17,469
I'm all right.
And you?

1303
01:56:17,553 --> 01:56:19,471
Forgive me, Lieutenant.
I must look awful,

1304
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:21,682
but I haven't slept
for so many weeks.

1305
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:24,643
We've had so many air raids.
Mmm.

1306
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:29,314
Come in.
Excuse me.

1307
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,150
They come over
two or three times a night.

1308
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:34,987
You can't imagine
what it's like.

1309
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:37,990
The soldiers at the front would
strike under such conditions.

1310
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:41,326
I mean it.

1311
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:43,829
There's no heat, no light.

1312
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:56,341
Oh, yes.
I remember.

1313
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,927
Sit down.

1314
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:00,929
Thank you.

1315
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:08,895
Did you bring any food
from Russia?

1316
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:13,316
Africa.
Of course.

1317
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,610
My husband's company.
Yeah.

1318
01:57:16,988 --> 01:57:20,365
All I have left is some kümmel.

1319
01:57:22,076 --> 01:57:24,453
No, thanks.

1320
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:27,664
Do you hear from your husband?

1321
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:31,043
He killed himself.

1322
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:39,843
- He what?
- He killed himself with a bayonet.

1323
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,638
I have the letter somewhere.

1324
01:58:01,407 --> 01:58:04,034
He asked me to come here
and speak to you for him.

1325
01:58:06,704 --> 01:58:09,331
Perhaps it's just as well.

1326
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:15,128
He wanted to come back here.

1327
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,340
Naturally,
I didn't encourage him.

1328
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:22,094
I spent a whole night
composing a most tactful letter.

1329
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:27,182
I told him, of course, he would be better
off in some permanent veteran's hospital.

1330
01:58:30,853 --> 01:58:33,063
What are you doing now?

1331
01:58:33,147 --> 01:58:36,775
For heaven's sake, Christian,
be a little realistic.

1332
01:58:36,859 --> 01:58:39,569
You people are getting
stranger and stranger.

1333
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:47,244
Stay a little while.

1334
01:58:47,328 --> 01:58:50,539
Maybe I can find some vodka.

1335
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:59,339
I make myself pretty for you.

1336
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,403
[ Brandt ] Christian?

1337
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:25,824
Christian!

1338
01:59:25,908 --> 01:59:28,076
Brandt.

1339
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:31,246
Christian, how wonderful
to see you again.

1340
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:34,249
It's good to see you, Brandt.

1341
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:37,002
[ Chuckles ] Oh, no.
I can't believe it.

1342
01:59:37,086 --> 01:59:39,462
[ Laughing ]

1343
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:44,926
Oh, it was bad, huh?

1344
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:49,014
No. They moved us around a
little bit, but you know, it's‒

1345
01:59:49,098 --> 01:59:51,016
Listen now, uh,

1346
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,602
what's the matter with you,
being so near the front?

1347
01:59:53,686 --> 01:59:57,689
Well, you know me.
It was a mistake in the orders.

1348
01:59:57,773 --> 01:59:59,691
But you, what are you doing here?
Are you stationed here?

1349
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:03,019
No, as a matter of fact, I'm
waiting for transportation.

1350
02:00:03,045 --> 02:00:04,638
I'm trying to get to Paris.

1351
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,532
Let's go someplace where we can talk.
I'll buy you a drink for old-time's sake.

1352
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,534
Brandt, I see you are
a captain from taking pictures.

1353
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:12,996
It's an outrage.
I should be a major.

1354
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:17,167
You have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

1355
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:20,545
I'll take that.
Bring us some glasses.

1356
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:24,174
I've been hanging around here for two
days waiting for somebody to go to Paris.

1357
02:00:24,258 --> 02:00:26,760
Listen. What are you
doing in Paris, Brandt?

1358
02:00:26,786 --> 02:00:28,620
Well, my headquarters are there.

1359
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:32,724
This is your headquarters with the
blond hair who likes goose liver?

1360
02:00:32,808 --> 02:00:35,769
[ Laughing ] Yeah, yeah.
That's the one.

1361
02:00:35,853 --> 02:00:38,188
In other words,
you have no orders whatsoever.

1362
02:00:38,272 --> 02:00:40,190
Only a desire.
Yeah, yeah.

1363
02:00:40,274 --> 02:00:44,736
Look, Christian, I have also managed to
acquire a little French car all my own.

1364
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:46,738
Well, this follows, naturally.
Yes, but look.

1365
02:00:46,822 --> 02:00:50,575
A poor, old photographer. I wouldn't last
an hour before somebody requisitioned it.

1366
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:55,705
But you have combat orders. With you,
there would be no questions asked.

1367
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:57,916
You have this car here
with you?

1368
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,585
Yeah, just near here
in a little stable.

1369
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,088
Why don't we go now? We'll take the car.
All right. Let's go.

1370
02:01:03,172 --> 02:01:06,132
Good. Good.

1371
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:21,690
Why don't you have dinner with
Simone and me tonight, huh?

1372
02:01:21,774 --> 02:01:25,443
Well, that would be very nice,
but I think I must report.

1373
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:28,863
Oh, report in the morning.
You need some rest.

1374
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,825
Brandt, do you ever
see Françoise?

1375
02:01:31,909 --> 02:01:35,161
Why, of course.
She is living with Simone now.

1376
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:39,040
She is living with Simone?

1377
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,043
Yeah, sure. She has been
for more than a month.

1378
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:48,591
Brandt, would you like to have dinner
with Françoise and me tonight?

1379
02:01:48,676 --> 02:01:51,553
Very nice.
We'd be delighted.

1380
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:21,124

Simone?

1381
02:02:22,209 --> 02:02:24,961
Simone! Wha‒

1382
02:02:25,046 --> 02:02:27,922
Simone. Darling.

1383
02:02:31,218 --> 02:02:33,345
It's been forever, ja?

1384
02:02:36,098 --> 02:02:38,975
Forever, hmm?
[ Simone Speaking French ]

1385
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:07,253
Hello, Françoise.

1386
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:11,007
Hello.

1387
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,178
Come in.

[ Laughter ]

1389

Oh, my wonderful friends, I want to
thank you for this beautiful night.

1390
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:26,439
I love you for it.

1391
02:03:26,524 --> 02:03:29,567
And now I'd like to make
a little toast, huh?

1392
02:03:29,652 --> 02:03:34,072
Farewell, Captain Brandt of
the Army of the Third Reich.

1393
02:03:34,156 --> 02:03:36,074
You're drunk, darling.

1394
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:39,786
Say good night to everyone. No, no, no.
Christian understands me.

1395
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:42,455
Good night, Captain Brandt.

1396
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:45,500
Tomorrow you'll awaken
to your new life‒

Monsieur Brandt,
citizen of the world.

1398
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:52,048
Isn't he funny?
He has such ideas.

1399
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:55,552
Sit down, Simone.
Sit down for a minute.

1400

Christian, I-I know
you don't approve,

1401

but listen to me for a minute.

02:34:57,621 --> 02:35:00,707
I'm here alone, and I have
no personnel left!

1712
02:35:05,379 --> 02:35:08,756
You know what this is,
this phone call?

1713
02:35:08,841 --> 02:35:13,386
They want me to kill every man, woman and child
in the camp before the Americans get here.

1714
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:15,388
6,000 people.

1715
02:35:20,561 --> 02:35:24,439
And the man who asked me to do this‒ this
same man‒ will walk the streets free.

1716
02:35:24,523 --> 02:35:27,984
And they will come to him,
the Americans, the Russians,

1717
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:32,322
and he will say, "I've never
heard of concentration camps."

1718
02:35:32,406 --> 02:35:36,826
He will say there never was a national
policy to kill 12 million people.

1719
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:38,828
The SS invented it.

1720
02:35:38,912 --> 02:35:43,082
Nobody in the government
ever heard of it.

1721
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:47,420
And I'll be here trying to
explain to the Americans.

1722
02:35:47,504 --> 02:35:52,717
Do you know, the Americans may not
understand what they see here.

1723
02:35:52,801 --> 02:35:55,928
They may not know that the German
officer‒ our kind of officer‒

1724
02:35:56,013 --> 02:35:58,723
does what he's ordered to do.

1725
02:36:05,606 --> 02:36:08,941
Well, we at least know...

1726
02:36:09,026 --> 02:36:10,943
what is important...

1727
02:36:11,028 --> 02:36:14,072
The courage to stay
and face the enemy...

1728
02:36:14,156 --> 02:36:18,868
and the honor to be able to say, "I
have done my duty for the fatherland."

1729
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:29,837
What's the matter?

1730
02:37:54,214 --> 02:37:56,132
My God.

1731
02:38:03,307 --> 02:38:07,143
[ Man ] Captain, this is the mayor of the
town we just came through on our way up here.

1732
02:38:07,227 --> 02:38:09,812
He says he can send a gang
of civilians in to help us.

1733
02:38:09,897 --> 02:38:11,814
As I was telling
the sergeant, Captain,

1734
02:38:11,899 --> 02:38:16,861
we have heard some of your most important generals
and newspapermen are on their way up here.

1735
02:38:16,945 --> 02:38:19,947
I can provide you with a
number of my townspeople...

1736
02:38:20,032 --> 02:38:23,201
who will help you to clean
up this place‒ Yes?

1737
02:38:23,285 --> 02:38:26,537
Excuse me.

1738
02:38:26,622 --> 02:38:29,999
My name is Joseph Silverson.
I am a rabbi.

1739
02:38:30,083 --> 02:38:32,502
Yes.

1740
02:38:32,586 --> 02:38:38,090
I do not wish to annoy the officer,
but I have a request to make.

1741
02:38:38,175 --> 02:38:40,092
Yes, what is it?

1742
02:38:41,887 --> 02:38:44,180
Thousands have died here.

1743
02:38:44,264 --> 02:38:46,766
More will die tonight,
tomorrow.

1744
02:38:48,435 --> 02:38:51,270
Sorry, Rabbi.
We're doing all we can.

1745
02:38:51,355 --> 02:38:55,024
Of course. I know that.

1746
02:38:55,108 --> 02:38:57,777
But there's nothing
to be done for them.

1747
02:38:57,861 --> 02:39:01,239
Nothing material.
We understand that.

1748
02:39:01,323 --> 02:39:03,866
All efforts must be
for the living.

1749
02:39:05,661 --> 02:39:09,789
What I am asking for
is a luxury.

1750
02:39:12,251 --> 02:39:15,169
Yes?

1751
02:39:15,254 --> 02:39:17,922
I ask to be permitted
to collect all of us,

1752
02:39:18,006 --> 02:39:22,218
the living
and those without hope,

1753
02:39:22,302 --> 02:39:24,512
and hold a religious service‒

1754
02:39:24,596 --> 02:39:28,849
a service for the dead
who have come to their end here.

1755
02:39:32,312 --> 02:39:36,065
There has never been a religious
service for us in this place.

1756
02:39:36,149 --> 02:39:38,693
Permit me, Captain.
I don't like to intrude.

1757
02:39:38,777 --> 02:39:41,445
I understand why the rabbi
has made this request,

1758
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:43,948
but this is
not the time for it.

1759
02:39:44,032 --> 02:39:48,494
I'm a European. I understand things
perhaps the captain doesn't understand.

1760
02:39:48,579 --> 02:39:53,457
If you allow this gentleman to hold the
services, I'm obliged to warn you.

1761
02:39:53,542 --> 02:39:58,921
There will be riots. The other prisoners
will not stand for it, and...

1762
02:39:59,006 --> 02:40:02,383
the generals who are coming
will not like what they see.

1763
02:40:09,224 --> 02:40:14,270
The, uh, other prisoners will not stand
for it and the generals will not like it?

1764
02:40:14,354 --> 02:40:16,856
That's a fact.
I guarantee it.

1765
02:40:28,493 --> 02:40:32,580
I'm gonna guarantee
something myself.

1766
02:40:32,664 --> 02:40:36,000
I'm gonna guarantee that you‒
you'll hold your services.

1767
02:40:36,084 --> 02:40:39,378
I'm also gonna guarantee that
machine guns will be set up...

1768
02:40:39,463 --> 02:40:41,797
on the roofs of the buildings.

1769
02:40:41,882 --> 02:40:45,718
And further, I will guarantee that anyone who
attempts to interfere with those services...

1770
02:40:45,802 --> 02:40:47,970
will be fired upon
by those machine guns.

1771
02:40:50,223 --> 02:40:53,976
And further, I guarantee that if you
ever try to come into this place again,

1772
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:56,187
I will personally break
your neck.

1773
02:40:56,271 --> 02:40:58,230
That is all.

1774
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:09,033
Thank you very much, sir.

1775
02:41:27,511 --> 02:41:31,430
Ackerman, you're not needed around here.
Go take a walk outside the camp.

1776
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:36,268
Thank you, sir.

1778
02:42:03,588 --> 02:42:05,881
How do you feel?

1779
02:42:05,966 --> 02:42:07,925
Fine, fine.

1780
02:42:09,761 --> 02:42:13,139
I never‒ Did you ever imagine
it could be like that?

1781
02:42:13,223 --> 02:42:15,141
Nope.

1782
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,145
My father's brother
died in one of those.

1783
02:42:20,772 --> 02:42:23,399
Did you see them?
The ovens?

1784
02:42:23,483 --> 02:42:25,401
Yeah, yeah.

1785
02:42:27,529 --> 02:42:30,865
Did I ever tell you
about my father? No.

1786
02:42:35,662 --> 02:42:39,165
When that guy started
to talk to Green...

1787
02:42:39,249 --> 02:42:41,321
I could've gone outside
and blown my brains out.

1788
02:42:41,347 --> 02:42:42,234
I felt the same way.

1789
02:42:42,294 --> 02:42:47,256
And then Green said, "I guarantee.
I guarantee."

1790
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:50,050
I don't know. I got a lot
of hope for Captain Green.

1791
02:42:51,344 --> 02:42:54,597
You know what?
When this war's over,

1792
02:42:54,681 --> 02:42:57,516
Green is gonna be
running the world.

1793
02:42:57,601 --> 02:43:02,438
There are millions of him. Millions!
They're human beings.

1794
02:43:02,522 --> 02:43:05,733
There are millions, millions of them!
They're gonna run the world!
