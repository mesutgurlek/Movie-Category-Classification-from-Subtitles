1
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:14,097
"we have shared the incommunicable
experience of war.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,350
"we have felt, we still feel,

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,603
the passion of life to its top."

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,026
our hearts were touched with fire."

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,194
oliver wendell holmes.

6
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,785
[explosions]

7
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,404
By the summer of 1861,

8
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,572
wilmer mclean had had enough.

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,207
[explosion]

10
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,411
two great armies were
converging on his farm,

11
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,495
and what would be

12
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,130
the first major battle
of the civil war--

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,299
bull run, or manassas,

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,917
as the confederates
called it--

15
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,721
would soon rage across
the aging virginian's farm,

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,339
a union shell going so far

17
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,059
as to explode
in the summer kitchen.

18
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,481
now mclean moved his family
away from manassas,

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,649
far south and west
of richmond,

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,268
out of harm's way,
he prayed,

21
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,437
to a dusty
little crossroads

22
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,156
called appomattox courthouse.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,859
and it was there
in his living room,

24
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,494
3 1/2 years later,

25
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,196
that lee
surrendered to grant.

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,000
and wilmer mclean
could rightfully say,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,169
"the war began
in my front yard

28
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,872
and ended
in my front parlor."

29
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,859
the civil war was fought
in 10,000 places

30
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,477
from valverde,
new mexico,

31
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,646
and tullahoma, tennessee,

32
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,281
to st. albans, vermont,

33
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,534
and fernandina on
the florida coast.

34
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,873
more than 3 million
americans fought in it,

35
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,660
and over 600,000 men,
2% of the population,

36
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,829
died in it.

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,251
american homes
became headquarters.

38
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,420
american churches
and schoolhouses

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,673
sheltered the dying...

40
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:48,011
and huge foraging armies
swept across american farms

41
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,264
and burned
american towns.

42
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,653
americans slaughtered
one another wholesale here,

43
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,355
in america,
in their own corn fields

44
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,990
and peach orchards,

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,941
along familiar roads,

46
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:06,279
and by waters with
old american names.

47
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,282
in two days at shiloh,

48
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,451
on the banks
of the tennessee,

49
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,620
more american men fell

50
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,873
than in all previous
american wars combined.

51
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,543
at cold harbor,

52
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:25,431
7,000 americans fell
in 20 minutes.

53
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,641
men who had
never strayed 20 miles

54
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,276
from their
own front doors

55
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,529
now found themselves
soldiers in great armies,

56
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,316
fighting epic battles
hundreds of miles from home.

57
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,204
they knew
they were making history,

58
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,457
and it was the greatest
adventure of their lives.

59
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,498
the war made some rich,
ruined others,

60
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,133
and changed forever

61
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,386
the lives of all
who lived through it...

62
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,089
a lackluster clerk
from galena, illinois,

63
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,808
a failure in everything
except marriage and war,

64
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,061
who, in 3 years, would
be head of the union army

65
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,848
and in 7, president
of the united states;

66
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,102
an eccentric student of
theology and military tactics,

67
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,186
a hypochondriac

68
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,905
who rode into battle
with one hand raised

69
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,243
"to keep," he said,
"the blood balanced;"

70
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,412
a college professor
from maine,

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,581
who, on a little hill
in pennsylvania,

72
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,283
ordered an unlikely
textbook maneuver

73
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,368
that saved the union army

74
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,621
and possibly
the union itself...

75
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,341
two ordinary soldiers--

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,594
one from providence,
rhode island,

77
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,713
the other from
columbia, tennessee,

78
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,348
who each served 4 years

79
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,050
and together seemed to
have been everywhere

80
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,854
during the war and lived
to tell the tale...

81
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:59,192
the courtly,
unknowable aristocrat,

82
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,894
who disapproved
of secession and slavery,

83
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,529
yet went on
to defend them both

84
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,698
at the head of one
of the greatest armies

85
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,867
of all time;

86
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,120
the runaway boy who
"stole himself" from slavery,

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,823
recruited two regiments
of black soldiers,

88
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,992
and helped transform
the civil war

89
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:19,796
into a struggle for
the freedom for all americans.

90
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,667
and then there was
the rough man from illinois,

91
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,836
who would rise to be
the greatest president

92
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,005
the country has ever seen.

93
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,977
between 1861 and 1865,

94
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,596
americans made war
on each other

95
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
and killed each other
in great numbers,

96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,568
if only to become
the kind of country

97
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,187
that could
no longer conceive

98
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,355
how that was possible.

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,609
what began
as a bitter dispute

100
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,328
over union
and states' rights

101
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,946
ended as a struggle

102
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,666
over the meaning
of freedom in america.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,453
at gettysburg in 1863,

104
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,257
abraham lincoln said
perhaps more than he knew.

105
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,594
the war was about
"a new birth of freedom."

106
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:21,057
man: 1938--
75th anniversary of
the battle of gettysburg.

107
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,776
spoke to the remaining
few civil war veterans.

108
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:28,114
veterans of the blue
and the gray...

109
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,536
on behalf of the people
of the united states,

110
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,789
i accept this monument

111
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,576
in the spirit of
brotherhood and peace.

112
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,830
year after year,
the nation remembered.

113
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,914
in 1930, veterans
of the union army

114
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,633
marched in
cincinnati, ohio,

115
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,802
4 years later,
in new york city.

116
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,055
they and the surviving
veterans of the confederacy

117
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,224
were the last link

118
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,927
with the terrible conflict
that tore america apart

119
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:01,180
from 1861 to 1865.

120
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,433
the last civil war veteran
would die in 1959,

121
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:07,153
of long-ago battles,

122
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,940
only history and legends.

123
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,656
any understanding
of this nation

124
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,274
has to be based,
and i mean really based,

125
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,443
on an understanding
of the civil war.

126
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,527
i believe that firmly.

127
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,612
it defined us.

128
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,865
the revolution
did what it did.

129
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,500
our involvement
in european wars,

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,584
beginning with
the first world war,

131
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,203
did what it did,

132
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:44,006
but the civil war
defined us as what we are,

133
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:48,344
and it opened us
to being what we became,

134
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:51,047
uh, good and bad things.

135
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,216
and it--
it is very necessary

136
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:56,469
if you're
going to understand
the american character

137
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,104
in the 20th century

138
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,273
to learn about this
enormous catastrophe

139
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,975
of the mid-19th century.

140
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,695
it was the--
the crossroads
of our being,

141
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,397
and it was a hell
of a crossroads.

142
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:12,168
for me, the picture
of the civil war

143
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:15,972
as a historic
phenomenon...

144
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,674
is not
on the battlefield.

145
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,309
it's not about weapons.

146
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,928
it's not about soldiers,

147
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,563
except to the extent

148
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,731
that weapons
and soldiers

149
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,434
at that crucial moment

150
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,603
joined a discussion
about something higher,

151
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,856
about humanity,
about human dignity,

152
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,025
about human freedom.

153
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,583
"whence shall we expect
the approach of danger?

154
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,336
"shall some transatlantic
giant step the earth

155
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,590
"and crush us at a blow?

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,674
"never.

157
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,361
"all the armies
of europe and asia

158
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,496
"could not by force
take a drink

159
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,081
"from the ohio river

160
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,217
"or make a track
on the blue ridge

161
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:04,420
"in the trial of
a thousand years.

162
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,022
"if destruction

00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,892
taught the south
how to make slavery pay.

325
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:32,611
whitney's engine,
or gin,

326
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,949
made it easier to separate
cotton from its seed.

327
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,820
where before it had taken
one slave 10 hours

328
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,540
to produce a single
pound of lint,

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,877
the cotton gin could crank out
a thousand pounds a day.

330
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,749
production soared...

331
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,468
and with it,
the demand for slaves.

332
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,721
by 1860,
the last year of peace,

333
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,890
one out of every 7 americans

334
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,059
belonged to another
american.

335
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,931
4 million men, women,
and children were slaves.

[horn blowing]

337
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,197
in boston in 1831,

338
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,450
claiming "that which
is not just is not law,"

339
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,619
william lloyd garrison
began publishing

340
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,957
a militant, antislavery
newspaper,the liberator.

341
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:38,760
he called for complete
and immediate abolition.

342
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,463
"i am in earnest.

343
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,632
"i will not equivocate.

"i will not excuse.

"i will not retreat
a single inch,

346
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,476
and i will be heard."

347
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,645
he was heard,

348
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,814
and his message
was clear--

349
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,983
slavery was sin...

350
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,320
and those who maintained it,
criminals.

351
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,377
the abolition movement grew,

352
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,080
inspired by
passionate leaders--

353
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,799
harriet tubman,
called "moses" by the slaves

354
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,968
who followed her north
to freedom;

wendell phillips,

356
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:26,475
named "the golden trumpet"
of abolitionism for his oratory;

357
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,093
and frederick douglass,

358
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,346
the son of a slave
and a white man.

359
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,431
"i appear
this evening

360
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,150
"as a thief
and robber.

"i stole this head,

"this body
from my master

363
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,741
and ran off
with them."

364
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,994
douglass was so eloquent
that skeptics charged

365
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,163
he could never
have been a slave.

366
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,781
in part
to prove them wrong,

367
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,950
he wrote an autobiography,

368
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,288
purchased his freedom with $600
obtained from english admirers,

369
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,007
and returned
to the struggle.

370
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,710
"the abolitionists
would raise the negroes

371

"to a social
and political equality
with the whites.

we would soon see

"the present condition
of the two races reversed.

374

"they and their
northern allies
would be the masters,

john c. calhoun.

377
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,483
southerners worried
about the growing political

378
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,202
as well as economic
power of the north.

379
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:31,540
northerners were increasingly
hostile to slavery.

380
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,793
still, most southerners
refused to acknowledge

381
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,665
even the possibility
of changing their way of life.

382

"on the north bank
of the ohio,

on the clear, moonlit night
of november 7, 1837,

396
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,041
a mob surrounded a warehouse
at alton, illinois,

397
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,845
intent on destroying
an antislavery newspaper

398
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,098
run by the reverend
elijah p. lovejoy.

399
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:33,885
when one of the mob moved
to set the building on fire,

400
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,520
lovejoy,
armed with a pistol,

401
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,605
came out to stop him.

[gunshot]

403
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,942
the slavery men
shot him dead

404
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,196
and dumped his printing press
into the mississippi.

405
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,533
the news stunned
the nation--

406
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,787
a white man had been killed
over black slavery.

407
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,124
protest meetings were held
throughout the north.

408
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,743
one abolitionist wrote that

409

"thousands
of our citizens

nothing to do with slavery

their error."

412
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,587
in hudson, ohio,

413
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,306
a clergyman told
a church gathering,

414
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,924
"the question
now before us

415
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,178
"is no longer,
can slaves be made free,

"but, arewefree,

or are we slaves
under mob law?"

418
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,853
in the back of the church,
a strange, gaunt man

419
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:29,191
rose to his feet
and raised his right hand.

john brown.

424
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,683
in 1846, a lawyer
from springfield, illinois,

425
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,385
was elected to congress.

426
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:00,639
he was born in kentucky,
the son of a farmer

427
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,358
who could barely
sign his name.

428
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,611
he became a legislator at 24,
a prosperous attorney,

429
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,780
and after
a turbulent courtship,

430
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,483
the husband
of miss mary todd,

431
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:15,821
the daughter of a slave-holding
kentucky banker.

432
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,456
for abraham lincoln,

433
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,624
the declaration
of independence

434
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,793
was to be taken literally--

435
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,628
all men had
the right to rise

436
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,231
as far as talent
would take them,

437
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,343
just as he had.

438
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,171
but he called
for its restriction,

439
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,641
not immediate abolition.

440
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,812
by mid-century,
the country was deeply divided.

441
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,515
southerners feared the north
might forbid slavery.

442
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,319
northerners feared slavery
might move west.

443
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,522
as each new state
was added to the union,

444
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,157
it threatened to upset

445
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,410
the delicate
equilibrium of power.

446
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,832
"there are
grave doubts

447

of the land,

448

"and whether
one government

can comprehend
the whole."

451
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,548
now events accelerated.

452

in 1852,
harriet beecher stowe

453

published
uncle tom's cabin.

454
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,605
its portrayal
of slavery's cruelty

455
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,858
moved readers
as nothing else had.

456
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,561
queen victoria
wept over it.

457
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,280
more than
1.5 million copies

458
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,449
were in print worldwide.

459
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,236
in 1854,
congress allowed settlers

460
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,405
in the kansas
and nebraska territories

461
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,040
to decide for themselves

462
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,743
whether or not
to permit slavery.

463
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,378
kansas exploded.

464
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,131
5,000 proslavery men
invaded the territory.

465
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,300
in the next 3 months,

466
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,469
200 men died
in "bleeding kansas."

467
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,256
the killing would not stop
for 10 years.

468
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:02,060
in 1857,
the supreme court

469
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,763
refused to free a slave,
dred scott,

470
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,398
even though he had lived
for many years

471
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,567
on free soil.

472
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,186
chief justice
roger b. taney said

473
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,821
a black man
had no rights

474
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:16,074
a white man
was bound to respect.

475
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,861
"as a nation, we
began by declaring

the floor

493

of the united states senate,

494
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,620
where congressman
preston brooks

495
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,704
of south carolina

496
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,957
savagely beat abolitionist
senator charles sumner

497
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,126
with his cane.

498
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,464
southern sympathizers
sent brooks new canes.

499
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,633
members began carrying
knives and pistols

500
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,801
into the chamber.

501
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,055
meanwhile, the nation's
chief executive,

502
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,757
james buchanan,
did nothing.

503
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,681
"a house divided
against itself
cannot stand.

504
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,934
"i believe
this government
cannot endure,

505

"permanently

"i do not expect

"it will become
all one thing

511
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:05,350
on sunday evening,
october 16, 1859,

512
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,968
the radical abolitionist
john brown

513
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,688
led 5 blacks
and 13 whites

514
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,390
into harpers ferry,
virginia.

515
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,559
he brought along
a wagonload of guns

516
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,643
to arm the slaves

517
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:18,363
he was sure
would rally to him.

518
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,616
once they had, he planned
to lead them southward

519
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,785
along the crest
of the appalachians

520
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,488
and destroy slavery.

521
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,207
brown was an inept
businessman

522
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,910
who had failed 20 times
in 6 states

523
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,545
and defaulted
on his debts.

524
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,882
yet he believed himself
god's agent on earth.

525
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,136
in 1856,
at pottawatomie creek

526
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:42,754
in kansas,

527
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,389
he and his sons

528
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,092
had hacked 5
proslavery men to death

529
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,727
with broadswords,

530
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,811
all in the name

531
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,598
of defeating satan
and his legions.

532
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:00,021
quietly seized the armory,
arsenal, and engine house,

533
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,656
and took up hostages,

534
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,909
including george washington's
great grandnephew.

535
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,163
after that,
nothing went right.

536
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,781
the first person killed

537
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,950
was the town
baggage master,

538
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,034
a free black.

539
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,669
the slaves
did not rise up;

540
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,372
angry townspeople did.

541
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,176
the first of brown's
followers to fall

542
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,794
was dangerfield newby,

543
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,878
a former slave.

544
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:26,047
someone in the crowd

545
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,767
cut off his ears
as souvenirs.

546
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,020
on tuesday morning,

547
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,189
federal troops arrived
from washington,

548
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,357
led by a u.s. army colonel,

549
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,060
robert e. lee.

550
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,695
lee's men stormed
the engine house,

551
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,398
and 9 more
of brown's men were killed,

552
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:46,117
including two of his sons.

553
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,735
brown, severely wounded,

554
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,370
was turned over
to virginia

555
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,073
to be tried for treason.

556
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,961
"in firing his gun,

557
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,130

559

and sentenced him
to death.

among the troops
at the scene of his hanging

566
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,690
were cadets from
the virginia military institute

led by
an eccentric professor,

thomas j. jackson.

569

also there was a private

"no man ever more

brown had said nothing
from the gallows,

one of his guards a note.

the single most
important factor,

in my opinion,
in bringing on the war.

603
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,147
the militia system
in the south,

604

which had been
a joke before this,
before them,

605
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,484
becomes
a viable instrument,

606
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:38,373
as the southern militias
begin to take a true form

607
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,075
and the south
begins to worry
about northerners

608
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:45,964
agitating the blacks
to murder them
in their beds.

in the presidential
election of 1860,

619

buchanan happily
stepped aside,

620
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,510
but not before his ruling
democratic party

621
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,297
was fatally split
over the issue of slavery.

the republicans,
a new party,

623

and nominated
abraham lincoln,

625
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,141
his platform pledged only

626
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,861
to halt slavery's
further spread.

627

"on that point,
hold firm

cannot long retain it."

633
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,633
radical abolitionists
in the north complained

634
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,252
that lincoln's
opposition to slavery

635
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,971
did not go far enough.

636
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,589
but to most people
in the south,

637
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,758
the prospect
of lincoln's election

638
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,927
posed a lethal threat.

639
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,815
the 1860 campaign
had become a referendum

640
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,518
on the southern
way of life.

641
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,491
on november 6, 1860,

00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,659
abraham lincoln
won the presidency

643
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,913
with only 40%
of the vote.

644
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,615
he did not even appear
on the ballot

645
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,335
in 10 southern states.

646
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,037
"the election
of mr. lincoln

647
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:52,206
"is undoubtedly
the greatest evil

648
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,926
"that has ever
befallen this country.

649
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,095
"but the mischief
is done.

650
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,797
"and the only relief
for the american people

651
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,432
"is to shorten sail,

652
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,050
"send down the top masts,

653
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,770
and prepare
for a hurricane."

654
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,939
richmond whig.

655
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,557
in the south,

656
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,192
lincoln was burned
in effigy.

657
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:14,445
now the south carolina
legislature

658
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,530
called for a convention

659
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,232
to consider seceding
from the union.

660
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,036
southerners
would have told you

661
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,739
they were fighting
for self-government.

662
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,543
they believed
the gathering
of power in washington

663
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,711
was against them.

664
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,965
when they entered
into that federation,

665
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,134
they certainly would never
have entered into it

666
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,752
if they hadn't believed
it would be possible
to get out.

667
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:41,005
and when the time came
that they wanted
to get out,

668
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,174
they thought
they had every right.

669
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,596
the southerners saw
the election of lincoln

670
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:50,765
as a sign
that the union

671
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,934
was about to be
radicalized

672
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:56,187
and that they
were about to be
taken in directions

673
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,356
they did not care to go.

674
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,075
the abolitionist
aspect of it
was very strong,

675
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,778
and they figured
they were about to lose

676
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,947
what they called
their property

677
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:08,115
and faced ruin.

678
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,453
yet many southerners

679
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:15,173
thought secession
was madness.

680
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,791
"south carolina,"

681
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,426
one southern
politician wrote,

682
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,128
"is too small
for a republic

683
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:24,382
and too large
for an insane asylum."

684

"november 19, 1860.

were no less explosive,

and george templeton strong,

692
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,207
a conservative lawyer
who distrusted lincoln,

693
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,460
began to keep track
of events in his diary.

694

"the bird of our country
is a debilitated chicken,

"we have never

ready to fall apart

serious shock."

699
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,344
when abraham lincoln
was elected president,

700
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,513
there were 33 states
in the union,

701
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:16,851
and a 34th, free kansas,
was about to join.

702
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:19,570
by the time
of his inauguration
5 months later,

703
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,357
just 27 states
would remain.

704
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:24,992
the suddenness
of secession

705
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,695
took everyone
by surprise.

706

[bell tolling]

707
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,836

in texas,
governor sam houston

714
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,947
was deposed when he tried
to stop his state

715
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,116
from joining
the confederacy.

seceded,

still stationed

withdrew to fort sumter,

their commander,
major robert anderson,

said he
had moved his men

in order to prevent
the effusion of blood.

752

they were quickly surrounded

on february 18,
a few minutes after noon,

jefferson davis
stood on the steps

of the alabama statehouse
at montgomery

760
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,577
and took the oath of office
as president

00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:18,449
of the provisional
confederate states of america.

a minstrel tune written
by a northerner.

766
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,962
he was brittle, nervous,

767
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,597
often unable to sleep,

768
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,682
and partly blind
in one eye.

769
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,935
accustomed
to being obeyed,

770
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,553
he scorned the bargaining

771
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:41,722
that made
democratic government work.

772
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:44,975
sam houston said
he was as cold as a lizard

773
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,229
and ambitious
as lucifer.

774
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,566
like lincoln,
he was a kentuckian,

775
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,735
the son
of an itinerant farmer.

776
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,904
but he had been
educated at west point,

777
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:57,988
fought in mexico,

778
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,242
and served
as secretary of war.

779
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,877
as senator
from mississippi,

780
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,130
he resisted secession
as long as he could.

781
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,748
but when his state
withdrew from the union,

782
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:11,001
he headed home
to his plantation, brierfield,

783
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,170
south of vicksburg.

784
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,339
he and his wife varina
were there,

785
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,508
clipping roses
in the garden,

786
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,846
when word came that
he had been elected president.

787
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,649
"reading that telegram,
he looked so grieved

788
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,987
"that i feared some evil
had befallen our family.

789
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,240
"after a few minutes,
he told me,

790
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,578
as a man might speak
of a sentence of death."

791
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:43,534
"upon my head
were showered smiles,
plaudits, and flowers,

792
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,338
but beyond them,
i saw troubles
innumerable."

793
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,507
jefferson davis.

794
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,294
the confederate constitution
was almost identical

795
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:56,013
to the united states
constitution,

796
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,182
but it gave the president
a line-item veto,

797
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,885
a 6-year term,

798
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,638
and it outlawed
international slave trading.

799
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,864
the confederate cabinet
met for the first time

where he graduated
at the bottom of his class,

1029
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,179
stopped in new york
to have himself fitted out

with a splendid
new uniform...

have joined earlier,

begged him to stay home.

after two weeks
of drilling,

the 2nd rhode island
moved out.

he put his uniform back on

1112
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:17,837
the odds against a southern
victory were long.

1113
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,259
tennessee
joined the confederacy.

1114
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,512
so did arkansas
and north carolina.

1115
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,300
in memphis,
nathan bedford forrest,

1116
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,019
a blacksmith's son who had
made himself a millionaire

1117
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:35,188
selling land,
cotton, and slaves,

1118
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,357
put up posters

1119
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:40,059
calling on anyone
who wanted to kill yankees

1120
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:42,779
to come and ride with him.

1121
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:46,032
the clinch rifles
from augusta, georgia,

1122
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:49,819
started out in may 1861.

1123
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,538
only the drummer boy
would survive.

1124
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:00,663
there were nearly
21 million people

1125
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:02,832
in the north,

1126
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,551
just 9 million
in the confederacy,

1127
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:08,254
and 4 million of them
were slaves,

1128
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:11,507
whom their masters
did not dare arm.

1129
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,312
the value of all
the manufactured goods

1130
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,481
produced in
all the confederate states

1131
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,650
added up to less than 1/4

1132
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,437
of those produced
in new york state alone.

1133
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:26,606
but none of this mattered

1134
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,325
to the men who joined
the tallapoosa thrashers

1135
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,494
and chickasaw desperados

1136
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,197
and cherokee
lincoln killers.

1137
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:42,338
"the histories
of the lost cause

1138

sam watkins.

one of the first
to answer the southern call

1144
01:00:55,885 --> 01:01:00,223
was 21-year-old sam watkins
of columbia, tenssee.

1145
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,307
he joined company "h"

1146
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:04,027
of the 1st tennessee
at nashville.

1147
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:08,898
like most rebel soldiers,
he owned no slaves.

robert e. lee.

1172
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:26,359
the most promising officer
in the regular army

1173
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:29,061
was robert e. lee
of virginia.

1174
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,781
on april 18,
4 days after sumter,

1175
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,484
lee was summoned
to blair house

1176
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,119
at lincoln's behest

1177
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,372
and offered field command
of the entire union army.

1178
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:42,074
lee said he would
think about it.

1179
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:45,878
virginia had voted to secede
the day before.

1180
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:49,132
that night,
he paced anxiously

1181
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,300
in the gardens around
his arlington mansion

1182
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,469
across the potomac.

1183
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:56,172
at midnight,
saturday the 20th,

1184
01:02:56,722 --> 01:02:57,807
lee wrote his letter

1185
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:01,594
of resignation
from the united states army.

1186
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:04,313
on the 21st,
the governor of virginia

1187
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:08,651
asked lee to take command
of the state militia.

1188
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,939
when lee had to choose
between the nation
and virginia,

1189
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:16,192
there was never any doubt
about what his choice
would be.

1190
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,276
he went with his state,
and he said,

1191
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,530
"i can't draw my sword
against my native state"--

1192
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,698
or, as he often said,
"my country."

1193
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:26,502
lincoln had lost
his best soldier.

"not by one word

both sides thought
it would be a 90-day war,

and both sides

1204

agreed it was to be
a white man's fight.

01:07:58,057 --> 01:08:00,226
the confederates
in virginia,

1265
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,479
but he did not yet
want to fight.

1266
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:07,283
"this is not an army,"
he warned the president.

1267
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,985
"you are green, it is true,"
lincoln answered,

1268
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,154
"but they are green also.

1269
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:14,874
you are all green alike."

1270
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,127
to preserve
the constitution,

1271
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,380
lincoln had for 3 months
gone beyond it--

1272
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,633
waging war without
congressional consent,

1273
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,336
seizing northern
telegraph offices,

1274
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,589
suspending
habeas corpus.

1275
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:32,224
to keep the border states
from seceding,

1276
01:08:32,758 --> 01:08:35,478
lincoln sent troops
to occupy baltimore

1277
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,265
and clapped the mayor
and 19 secessionist legislators

1278
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:42,518
in jail without trial.

1279
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,687
chief justice taney ruled
that the president

1280
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,322
had exceeded his power.

1281
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,406
lincoln simply
ignored him.

1282
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,575
"more rogues
than honest men

1283
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:53,362
find shelter under
habeas corpus," he said,

1284
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:58,167
and even contemplated
arresting the chief justice.

1285
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:01,420
a very mysterious man,

1286
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:05,207
he's got
so many sides to him.

1287
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:08,460
the curious thing
about lincoln to me

1288
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,714
is that he could
remove himself
from himself

1289
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,433
as if he were looking
at himself.

1290
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:17,686
it's a very strange,
very eerie thing

1291
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,305
and highly intelligent.

1292
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:21,473
such a simple thing
to say,

1293
01:09:21,473 --> 01:09:25,811
but lincoln's been
so smothered with stories
of his compassion,

1294
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:29,064
that people forget
what a highly
intelligent man he was,

1295
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,233
and almost
everything he did--

1296
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:36,655
almost everything he did
was calculated for effect.

1297

1302
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:54,006
"for the attempt
to abolish this government

1303

of slavery."

1309
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:12,942
from the start of the war,

1310
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,110
slaves fled
their plantations

1311
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,745
for the union lines,

1312
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,914
but lincoln's policy
was clear.

1313
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,617
despite pressure
from the abolitionists,

1314
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,336
he insisted he was
making war on secession,

1315
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:25,421
not slavery,

1316
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,039
and ordered the army

1317
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,843
to return fugitives
to their owners.

1318
01:10:30,843 --> 01:10:35,681
but now, an unlikely figure
helped to change men's minds.

1319
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:38,934
general benjamin butler
was a massachusetts politician

1320
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,637
with crossed eyes
and mixed motives

1321
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,272
who had once backed
jefferson davis

1322
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,525
for president
of the united states.

1323
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:48,694
"returning slaves only
aided the enemy,"

1324
01:10:48,694 --> 01:10:50,312
butler argued,

1325
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:53,032
and he got permission
to hold fugitive slaves

1326
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:54,650
as contraband of war

1327
01:10:54,650 --> 01:11:00,623
and employ them as laborers
in the union army.

1328

"major cary

general benjamin butler.

the trickle of runaways
coming into northern lines

now swelled to a flood.

one ex-slave who had
recently bought his freedom

"if i had known you gun men

01:11:56,462 --> 01:12:00,799
war was breaking out
all across the country.

there were engagements
at big bethel, virginia,

a young union general
george mcclellan

01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,785
won a small,
highly publicized victory

over a tiny
confederate force.

1353

of 37,000 men

their aim--to cut
the railroad at manassas,

22,000 confederate troops

had alerted him.

made his headquarters

in wilmer mclean's
farmhouse.

1388
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,219
the confederates formed
a meandering 8-mile line

along one side
of bull run creek.

1390

they were less than
25 miles from washington,

01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,428
and there they waited.

1392

hundreds of washingtonians
in holiday mood

1393

rode out to manassas

1394

hoping to see
a real battle.

1395

was astonishment

1419
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,973
"at the peculiar
whir of the bullets,

1420
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,591
"and that the regiment
immediately laid down

1421
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,811
without waiting
for orders."

1422
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,851
"we fired
a volley and saw
the rebels running.

1423
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:15,571
"the boys were
saying constantly
in great glee,

1424
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,189
"we've
whipped them.

1425
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:19,908
"we'll hang
jeff davis to
a sour apple tree.

1426
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,077
they're running.
the war's over."

1427
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,499
an onlooker remembered that
the advancing union army

1428
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,202
looked like
a bristling monster

1429
01:16:30,202 --> 01:16:32,921
lifting himself
by a slow, wavy motion

1430
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,090
up the laborious ascent.

1431
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,259
union victory
seemed so sure

1432
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,962
that on one part
of the battlefield

1433
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,681
men stopped
to gather souvenirs.

1434
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:44,850
but holding a hill

1435
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,468
at the center
of the southern line

1436
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:51,356
was a virginia brigade led
by general thomas jackson.

1437
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,525
while other southern
commands wavered,

1438
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,694
jackson's held firm.

1439
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,778
one confederate officer,

1440
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,032
trying to rally
his own frightened men,

1441
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,285
shouted, "look! there's jackson
with his virginians,

1442
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,454
standing like
a stone wall."

1443
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,707
the name stuck.

1444
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,876
he had
the strange combination

1445
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:15,747
of religious fanaticism
and a glory in battle.

1446
01:17:15,747 --> 01:17:17,382
he loved battle.

1447
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:19,551
his eyes would
light up.

1448
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,804
because of the way
his eyes would
light up in battle.

1449
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,423
he was totally fearless,

1450
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:26,591
had no thought
whatsoever of danger

1451
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,760
at any time
when the battle was on,

1452
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,480
and he could define
what he wanted to do.

1453
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,014
he said, "once you
get them running,

1454
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,182
"you stay right
on top of them,

1455
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,267
"and that way
a small force

1456
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:37,986
can defeat a large one
every time."

1457
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:41,773
he knew
perfectly well that
a reputation for victory

1458
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:45,027
would roll and build.

1459
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:48,280
it was the turning point.

1460
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,533
at 4:00, beauregard
ordered a counterattack.

1461
01:17:53,151 --> 01:17:57,489
jackson urged his men
to yell like furies.

1462
01:17:57,489 --> 01:18:00,192
the rebel yell
first heard that day

1463
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,445
would echo
from 1,000 battlefields.

1464
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,384
confederate reinforcements
began to arrive.

1465
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:11,019
the first cane
on horseback.

1466
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,272
more arrived by train,
something new in war.

1467
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:17,526
the northern army
fell apart.

1468
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,279
the retreat
soon became a rout,

1469
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,898
as union guns
became entangled

1470
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:26,151
with the carriages
of fleeing spectators.

1471
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:29,404
"we tried to tell them
that there was no danger,

1472
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,657
"called on them to stop,
implored them to stand.

1473

heavy revolvers

who said there would
be no war,

5 days after
the disaster at bull run,

a new general took over
the army of the potomac.

george brinton mcclellan,
only 34,

1604
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,072
seemed just
what the north needed.

1605
01:25:28,072 --> 01:25:30,708
he brought with him
to the demoralized capital

1606
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,327
what one aide called

1607

"an indescribable air
of success."

1608
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,918
he replaced inept officers
with regulars.

1609
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,171
he laid out tidy camps
around washington

1610
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,340
to accommodate
the 10,000 new volunteers

arriving each week,

drilled them
8 hours a day,

1613
01:25:49,594 --> 01:25:53,398
and staged grand reviews
to boost morale.

"all the attention
was upon the young general

self-denial."

1632

the newspapers called him
young napoleon,

1633
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:46,985
and he could not help seeing
the resemblance himself.

1634
01:26:46,985 --> 01:26:49,153
but 100,000
untrained volunteers

1635
01:26:49,153 --> 01:26:51,322
had become an army.

1636
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:52,957
mcclellan's army.

1637
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:55,126
his men, who loved him

1638
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,744
for have made them
proud of themselves,

1639
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,913
called him little mac.

1640
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:03,801
his specialty
is preparing
troops to fight,

1641
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,504
and he did that superbly.

1642
01:27:06,504 --> 01:27:07,589
mcclellan
trained that army.

1643
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:11,392
whatever the army
of the potomac did
in the after years

1644
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:14,646
is largely due
to the training
mcclellan gave them

1645
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,348
in that first year.

1646
01:27:17,348 --> 01:27:19,517
with lincoln,
mcclellan and his staff

1647
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,321
devised a 3-pronged attack
on the confederacy.

1648
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,490
one army would
drive into virginia

1649
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,192
and take richmond.

1650
01:27:28,192 --> 01:27:30,361
another would secure
kentucky and tennessee,

1651
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:33,615
then push into the heartland
of the confederacy

1652
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:36,334
and occupy mississippi,
alabama, and georgia.

1653
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:39,587
meanwhile, the navy would
clear the mississippi,

1654
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,756
surround
the confederacy by sea,

1655
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,925
and choke off supplies.

1656
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:49,347
the war would be fought
along a 1,000-mile front.

1657
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,050
that fall,
lincoln elevated mcclellan

1658
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:53,685
to general in chief,

1659
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,387
replacing the aging
winfield scott.

1660
01:27:56,387 --> 01:27:59,641
"i can do it all,"
mcclellan said.

1661
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:01,276
but he did nothing.

1662
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:02,894
as summer
turned to autumn,

1663
01:28:02,894 --> 01:28:05,063
it became
increasingly clear

1664
01:28:05,063 --> 01:28:07,782
that having made
a magnificent army,

1665
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,485
george mcclellan had
no immediate plans

1666
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,654
to lead it anywhere.

1667
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,244
"as we approached
the brow of the hill,

1668
01:28:20,244 --> 01:28:22,964
"my heart kept getting
higher and higher,

1669
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:26,217
"until it felt
it was in my throat.

1670
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,386
"i would have given
anything then

1671
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,555
"to have been back
in illinois,

1672
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,173
"but i kept right on.

1673
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:37,061
"when the valley below
was in full view, i halted.

1674
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:40,315
"the enemy's troops
were gone.

1675
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:44,068
"my heart
resumed its place,

1676
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,237
"and it occurred
to me at once

1677
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:49,490
"that he had been
as much afraid of me

1678
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,659
"as i of him.

1679
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:55,446
"this was a view
of the question
i had never taken before,

1680
01:28:55,446 --> 01:28:59,784
but it was one
i never forgot afterwards."

1681
01:28:59,784 --> 01:29:02,503
general ulysses s. grant.

1682
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:07,375
in september,
ulysses s. grant

1683
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,010
took paducah, kentucky,

1684
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,263
a strategic city
at the mouth of the tennessee,

1685
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,432
but two months later,
his undisciplined recruits

1686
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:15,516
were almost destroyed,

1687
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,219
looting a captured
rebel camp

1688
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:21,472
instead of preparing
for a counterattack.

1689
01:29:21,472 --> 01:29:24,192
grant was returned
to desk duty.

1690
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:29,480
in november,
william tecumseh sherman

1691
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,649
was relieved as
union commander in kentucky

1692
01:29:31,649 --> 01:29:35,453
when he insisted that
at least 200,000 men
would be needed

1693
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:39,240
to suppress the rebellion
in the west.

1694
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,409
no one believed him.

1695
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,578
he grew melancholic,

1696
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,831
prone to fits
of anxiety and rage.

1697
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:50,084
"sherman," mcclellan said,
"is gone in the head."

1698
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,422
december found him at home
in the care of his wife,

1699
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:57,141
contemplating suicide.

1700
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,310
no. no one thought
it would last long.

1701
01:29:59,844 --> 01:30:01,479
no one on either side
thought it would last long.

1702
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:05,266
those few individuals
who said that it would,

1703
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,435
tecumseh sherman,
for instance,

1704
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,604
were actually judged
to be insane

1705
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:13,941
for making predictions
about casualties,
which were actually low.

1706
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:16,661
in november,
a union warship

1707
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,864
stopped a british steamer
at gunpoint

1708
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:23,668
and arrested two confederate
diplomats found on board.

1709
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,370
britain's prime minister,
lord palmerston,

1710
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,624
was outraged, demanded
their immediate release,

1711
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:33,428
and dispatched
11,000 troops to canada.

1712
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,547
"one war at a time,"
lincoln said,

1713
01:30:36,547 --> 01:30:39,801
and quietly let
the two confederates go.

1714
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,639
by december,

1715
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,358
optimists on both sides
were disappointed.

1716
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:51,145
the confederacy showed
no signs of imminent collapse.

1717
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:54,398
the north would not
abandon its efforts

1718
01:30:54,398 --> 01:30:57,118
to reunite
the nation by force.

1719
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,202
by the end of the year,

1720
01:30:58,736 --> 01:31:01,456
there were 700,000 men
in the union army.

1721
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:05,243
no one knew how many
confederates there were.

1722
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,300
"december 31st.

1723
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,002
"poor old 1861 just going.
