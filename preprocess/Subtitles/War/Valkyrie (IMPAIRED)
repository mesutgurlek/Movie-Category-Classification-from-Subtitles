1
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.432
The promises of the Fuhrer about
peace and prosperity are destroyed,

2
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.432
and left nothing but destruction.

3
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.432
The nastiness Hitler brought with his S.S.
are a shame to the German army.

4
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.232
In the officers choir
there is widespread disgust,

5
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.536
about the atrocities of the Nazis.

6
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.632
The murder of civilians,

7
00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:22.618
The torture and starvation
of prisoners.

8
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:26.319
The mass execution of Jews.

9
00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:31.084
My duty as an officer,
is no longer to save my country,

10
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.682
but to save human lives.

11
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:40.022
I cannot find one general in a position
to confront Hitler with the courage to do it.

12
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.078
Von Stauffenberg, sir,
the General will be here in 4 hours.

13
00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.740
Thank you.
I'll need to see him when he arrives.

14
00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:55.142
I found myself surrounded by men
unwilling -- or unable -- to face the truth:

15
00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.923
Hiltler is not only the arch-enemy
of the whole world,

16
00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.876
but the arch-enemy of Germany.

17
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:06.680
A change must be made.

18
00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:13.492
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it -- that what we'll do.

19
00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:16.169
The British are moving-up from the south,
Patton is closing-in on the coast,

20
00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:20.461
you know we should've left two days ago.
- No, Colonel, we keep fighting.

21
00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:22.391
Until the final victory.

22
00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:26.092
North Africa is lost, and you're gonna need those men
a year from now to defend Berlin.

23
00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.581
We can save Germany,
or the Fuhrer, not both.

24
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.542
It's just that sort of talk,
that had you sent here, Colonel.

25
00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.747
What I said was much worse.

26
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.252
General,

27
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.977
I'm just trying to get these men
out of here alive.

28
00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:55.506
What would you have me doing?

29
00:03:55.782 --> 00:04:00.389
You tell Command we're low on water.
We have to reroute [...] with the 21st Panzer.

30
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:03.263
At least then we'll have a chance.

31
00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.791
And records will show we didn't have
enough water to reach Sidi Mansour?

32
00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:09.996
I can guarantee it.

33
00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.022
See it as done.

34
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.463
General.

35
00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:06.568
Sit.

36
00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:27.674
Hitler's leaving!
- Now?  - Yes! The fuse...

37
00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:02.718
Colonel Brandt.

38
00:09:04.451 --> 00:09:06.577
On regards to Colonel Stieff.

39
00:09:07.758 --> 00:09:13.192
Thank you.
So we do not get thirsty on the way.

40
00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.192
This is Tresckow.

41
00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.151
He has landed.

42
00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:02.176
This is General Tresckow.
Connect me with Operations, Colonel Brandt.

43
00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.704
Colonel, Tresckow.

44
00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:08.870
I'm glad you arrived safely.

45
00:10:09.106 --> 00:10:13.438
I'm hate to trouble you, but it seems
you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff.

46
00:10:14.383 --> 00:10:16.273
You do still have the package?

47
00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:23.556
Oh, no, as it happens I've been called
to Berlin unexpectedly.

48
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.156
I can be at your office first-thing
tomorrow's morning to pick it up.

49
00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:29.700
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.
Yes, thank you.

50
00:10:32.417 --> 00:10:33.992
Do you think he knows?

51
00:10:35.528 --> 00:10:37.575
There is only one way to find out.

52
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.672
We've been discovered.
- What makes you think that?

53
00:10:51.908 --> 00:10:54.428
Oster has been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him last night.

54
00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:56.397
The Gestapo could've arrested
him for anything.

55
00:10:56.673 --> 00:10:59.390
What do you think went wrong?
- We don't know.

56
00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:04.115
The fuse, temperature, altitude, who knows.
The damn thing didn't go off.

57
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:16.479
General Tresckow to see
Colonel Brandt.

58
00:11:16.754 --> 00:11:18.487
The Colonel is expecting you, sir.

59
00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:30.024
At ease.

60
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.042
You'll forgive me, General. This round-up is
having me writing reports all day.

61
00:11:44.672 --> 00:11:45.932
Round-up?

62
00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:50.421
Dissidents.
Another plot against the Fuhrer.

63
00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:53.020
Who are these people?

64
00:11:55.697 --> 00:11:57.509
You'd be surprised.

65
00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:05.896
Is this what you've come for?

66
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:15.346
Perhaps we should open it.

67
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.630
I beg your pardon?

68
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.552
Well, you have come a long way,
you must be thirsty.

69
00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.292
You know, I wonder how the Fuhrer,
who does not partaked,

70
00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:33.992
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

71
00:12:40.822 --> 00:12:42.752
Colonel Brandt.

72
00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:46.650
I took you for an honest soldier, General.

73
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.233
And I, you.

74
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.786
We are still in business.

75
00:13:01.534 --> 00:13:03.149
Find a replacement for Oster.

76
00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.236
There's no one we can trust,
not in Berlin.

77
00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:07.953
Then stop looking in Berlin.

78
00:13:34.138 --> 00:13:35.516
Frau von Stauffenberg.

79
00:13:36.973 --> 00:13:39.887
Perhaps, before you go in, we could
have a word together in my office.

80
00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:42.052
I will see my husband now.

81
00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:52.054
His right hand has been
amputated above the wrist.

82
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.046
He's missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand.

83
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:58.000
We couldn't save the left eye.

84
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.040
Colonel.

85
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.308
Are you ready, sir?

86
00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:42.819
I'm a soldier, I serve my country.

87
00:15:44.118 --> 00:15:46.323
But this is not my country.

88
00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.198
When I was lying there,
bleeding to death, thinking:

89
00:15:49.434 --> 00:15:53.671
If I die now, I leave nothing
to my children, but shame.

90
00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:59.750
I know now there's only
one way to serve Germany.

91
00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:03.924
And doing so,
I'll be a traitor.

92
00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:06.011
I accept that.

93
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.618
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

94
00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:16.131
We need to reorganize,
reconsider our strategy,

95
00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:18.100
recruit new men.

96
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.092
That's why we want you.

97
00:16:22.707 --> 00:16:25.659
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children

98
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.259
if these men can't see it through?

99
00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:34.598
Come and hear what
they have to say.

100
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.537
You know where to find us.

101
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.487
Enough. I'm not gonna listen to another word
of this. You had your chance, you failed.

102
00:17:19.763 --> 00:17:23.425
Your so-called simple solution
didn't work.

103
00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:26.023
Our only option now is
to confront Hilter openly.

104
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.874
It's a military operation.

105
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.315
It's not a military operation!
it's a political organization,

106
00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:32.914
and one that's giving it's military-arm
too much control.

107
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.513
In any military exercise, you have
to expect a certain measure of deviation.

108
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:39.136
A "measure"?
What about total, complete, utter failure?

109
00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:41.498
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we face the fact, that...

110
00:17:41.774 --> 00:17:45.633
The allies are coming, sooner or later.
I say, we sit back,

111
00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:47.326
and let them wipe-out the Nazis.

112
00:17:47.562 --> 00:17:50.200
And ask every living soul in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

113
00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:53.823
Carl, please.
- I'm sorry, Ludwig. I've held my tounge too long.

114
00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:57.012
We must confront Hitler now.
Force him out!

115
00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:58.509
And then what?

116
00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:01.816
I beg your pardon?

117
00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:04.848
When Hilter is gone, then what?

118
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.573
I'm sorry, who is this man?

119
00:18:09.731 --> 00:18:12.212
Colonel Stauffenberg is Oster's replacement.

120
00:18:12.448 --> 00:18:15.283
He's been transferred to my office,
at the War Ministry.

121
00:18:16.543 --> 00:18:20.166
How is your uncle?
- He's well, sir. He sends his regards.

122
00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:23.316
Speaks very highly of you.
- And of you, General.

123
00:18:23.513 --> 00:18:25.838
'Cause on of the things that made Oster
such a great organizer,

124
00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:28.238
was that he kept his opinions
to himself.

125
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.002
I'm simply asking what you intend to do
when Hitler is gone.

126
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.625
You don't really believe you could
just walk into the Reichskanzlerei,

127
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:38.869
and command the Army to end the war?

128
00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:40.759
Yes, we do.

129
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:49.343
You're in presence of men who would've
been Hitler's inner circle.

130
00:18:50.052 --> 00:18:52.415
Instead, we refused, Colonel.

131
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:55.604
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

132
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.006
We have the respect of the people...

133
00:18:58.282 --> 00:18:59.660
... and the army.

134
00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:03.440
Then you don't need me.

135
00:19:05.487 --> 00:19:07.220
Gentlemen.

136
00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:12.142
Those men are confusing respect
with popularity.

137
00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:16.670
The Army sworn an oath,
an oath that won't just die with Hitler.

138
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.608
What are you gonna do? How are you gonna deal
with Goebbels, Himmler and the S.S.?

139
00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:22.774
They will wipe you out!
- It doesn't matter!

140
00:19:25.569 --> 00:19:29.704
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

141
00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:34.271
Otherwise, this will always
be Hitler's Germany,

142
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.375
And we have to show the world,
that not all of us were like him.

143
00:19:40.611 --> 00:19:42.580
That is not enough for me.

144
00:19:43.879 --> 00:19:46.557
There has to be a chance of success.

145
00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:49.589
Then find a way.

146
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.534
Papa! Papa! Papa is home!
Papa is here!

147
00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:11.521
I thought we agreed I'd come see you
in Bamberg.

148
00:20:11.797 --> 00:20:13.844
The children couldn't wait.

149
00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:16.128
The children?

150
00:22:38.945 --> 00:22:40.284
Valkyrie.

151
00:22:40.638 --> 00:22:42.332
We have already considered Valkyrie,
it isn't suitable.

152
00:22:42.607 --> 00:22:45.403
Not as it's currently written, but the Colonel has
an idea I think we should consider.

153
00:22:45.639 --> 00:22:48.829
Excuse me, what is Valkyrie?
- Operation Valkyrie.

154
00:22:49.025 --> 00:22:51.782
The reserve army has thousands of men,
all over Berlin.

155
00:22:51.979 --> 00:22:56.664
Valkyrie is Hitler's contingency plan to
mobilize those men during a national emergency.

156
00:22:56.901 --> 00:23:00.484
The sole purpose of the order is to protect
Hitler's government if he is cut-off or killed.

157
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.335
And what use is this to us?

158
00:23:02.571 --> 00:23:05.603
Valkyrie is designed to contain
civil unrest.

159
00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:09.147
But what if the S.S. was staging a coup?

160
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.746
State Security is trying to overthrow Hitler,
how would High Command respond?

161
00:23:16.943 --> 00:23:19.188
We would have no choice -
we will declare a military state of emergency.

162
00:23:19.463 --> 00:23:23.598
Exactly - and initiate Valkyrie.
- Hitler's own reserve army using Hitler's own plan.

163
00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:26.354
We will have no choice but
to cease power in Berlin,

164
00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:28.953
to prevent the S.S. take-over.

165
00:23:29.977 --> 00:23:33.087
They'll think they're fighting for Hilter government,
not against it.

166
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:36.474
While we quietly put
a new government in place.

167
00:23:37.655 --> 00:23:39.348
But only if he's dead.

168
00:23:40.529 --> 00:23:41.829
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

169
00:23:42.065 --> 00:23:45.136
How else you're gonna convince people
the S.S. are trying to seize power?

170
00:23:45.766 --> 00:23:49.350
We have to kill Hitler.
- I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.

171
00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:53.130
I thought a man of your background would
suggest a more honorable approach.

172
00:23:53.602 --> 00:23:56.831
Your plan has a few minor obstacles, Colonel.

173
00:23:57.264 --> 00:24:00.099
Firstly, Valkyrie would've to be rewritten
to exclude the S.S.!

174
00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:03.013
And I'll need your help
to get a copy.

175
00:24:03.958 --> 00:24:05.848
Rewriting an order is one thing.

176
00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:09.431
Distributing it is another.

177
00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:14.393
In this case, we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

178
00:24:14.629 --> 00:24:16.834
Evidence requiring Hitler's signature.

179
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:24.749
Well, we can all draw straws
for the job.

180
00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:28.489
And what about Fromm?
- Fromm? Who is Fromm?

181
00:24:28.726 --> 00:24:30.025
He's the commander of the reserve army.

182
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:34.042
I can put the reserve troops on alert,
but only Fromm can initiate Valkyrie.

183
00:24:37.585 --> 00:24:39.436
Can you get to him?

184
00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:45.146
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

185
00:24:45.461 --> 00:24:46.996
He is a careerist pig.

186
00:24:47.233 --> 00:24:49.083
But one who has gone as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

187
00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:51.367
There's no secret
he's not happy about it.

188
00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:54.123
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

189
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.880
Make him see the light.

190
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.180
Reich War Ministry - Berlin

191
00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:12.473
Colonel Stauffenberg for General Fromm.

192
00:25:13.063 --> 00:25:16.961
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. Welcome back to the
War Ministry. It's an honor, sir.

193
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:23.577
I'd send you to the front, whether I didn't think
you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore!

194
00:25:29.129 --> 00:25:30.940
The General will see you now.

195
00:25:44.997 --> 00:25:46.848
What is it you want?

196
00:25:47.478 --> 00:25:51.416
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

197
00:25:52.872 --> 00:25:54.684
Ah! From Africa!

198
00:25:55.432 --> 00:26:00.078
I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

199
00:26:00.315 --> 00:26:03.661
I'd say the General has lost more
important things this morning.

200
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.466
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

201
00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:17.601
Please sit, Colonel.
And you, Olbricht, if you must.

202
00:26:29.374 --> 00:26:33.981
They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel,
not that you don't seem to have good reasons.

203
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:36.226
I am critical of indecision, General.

204
00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:38.116
In the field?
- In Berlin.

205
00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:43.195
So that's why you're here, I take it...

206
00:26:43.431 --> 00:26:46.148
to make decisions.
- I've already made my decision.

207
00:26:46.345 --> 00:26:48.826
I'm here to help others make theirs.

208
00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:58.512
They say when there's no clear option,
the best thing is to do nothing.

209
00:26:58.749 --> 00:27:01.781
We're at war, we must act.

210
00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:03.986
Sometimes rushingly.

211
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.593
And what rush action
did you have in mind, Colonel?

212
00:27:10.207 --> 00:27:15.287
That would be a decision for
the supreme military commander, sir.

213
00:27:15.562 --> 00:27:18.397
A supreme commander?

214
00:27:20.642 --> 00:27:22.650
Second only to the Chancellor.

215
00:27:27.651 --> 00:27:29.935
If I was that man...

216
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:34.305
... this war would be going quite differently.

217
00:27:35.172 --> 00:27:37.062
Well, we were thinking the same thing.

218
00:27:45.882 --> 00:27:56.316
I don't need to remind you
that we've all sworn an oath to the Fuhrer.

219
00:28:04.034 --> 00:28:06.987
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

220
00:28:07.224 --> 00:28:09.704
In the strict understanding that such talk

221
00:28:09.941 --> 00:28:12.879
never occurs again under this roof.
Is that clear? - Yes, sir.

222
00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:17.186
You can tell your friends, Colonel,
that I always come down on the right side.

223
00:28:17.422 --> 00:28:22.620
And as long as the Fuhrer is alive,
you know what side that is.

224
00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:32.520
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

225
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.158
You realize how close
I am to Hitler?

226
00:29:32.394 --> 00:29:35.072
With one word, I can
make you disappear.

227
00:29:36.253 --> 00:29:38.655
My associates don't know we've been talking,
if that's what you're afraid of.

228
00:29:38.931 --> 00:29:42.789
When the S.S. catch you, they will
pull you apart, like warm bread.

229
00:29:43.026 --> 00:29:45.625
It'll be a crime just to
have known you then.

230
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.507
I warn you, don't try
to contact me again.

231
00:29:50.704 --> 00:29:56.414
Maybe, if you [...] when I first approached you,
you might have been keeping your oath.

232
00:29:56.571 --> 00:30:00.666
Now you're just as guilty as me.
- And you think that makes me a sympathizer?

233
00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:03.423
Give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his Fuhrer,

234
00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:05.667
and you think his actions 
will show you his heart?

235
00:30:05.903 --> 00:30:08.581
It is not that simple.
- Yes. Yes it is.

236
00:30:08.856 --> 00:30:12.046
For the last time,
don't push me to make a decision.

237
00:30:12.282 --> 00:30:14.172
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

238
00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:19.409
Without you, there is no hope of success.

239
00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:22.520
You nothing but rats,
jumping from a sinking ship!

240
00:30:22.796 --> 00:30:25.001
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

241
00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:26.733
What makes you think
you're stronger than the people?

242
00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:31.813
The Reich? The very momentum of history?
- This is going to happen. Action is inevitable,

243
00:30:32.049 --> 00:30:33.506
as are the consequences.

244
00:30:33.781 --> 00:30:36.585
When they'll come for me, I'll do everything
I can to hide what you knew and when you knew it.

245
00:30:36.822 --> 00:30:37.941
But don't delude yourself.

246
00:30:38.122 --> 00:30:42.641
You were invloved in a crime against
your country long before you met me.

247
00:30:44.374 --> 00:30:47.091
And there may still be time
to redeem yourself.

248
00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:52.839
Only God can judge us now.

249
00:30:59.297 --> 00:31:04.062
Hitler had Operation Valkyrie designed to
completely secure his government in 6 hours.

250
00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:07.802
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize control
of the government in 3.

251
00:31:08.393 --> 00:31:12.331
As written, your order spreads reserve troops
across all of Germany's 19 military districts,

252
00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:16.859
including occupied cities like
Paris, Vienna and Prague. 

253
00:31:17.095 --> 00:31:19.655
This is a waste of resources,
since all these districts

254
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:25.443
follow orders from Berlin without question.
If you take Berlin, you take Germany.

255
00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:31.467
I'm rewriting Valkyrie to direct the majority of our
strongest units to focus entirely on Berlin.

256
00:31:32.334 --> 00:31:35.169
We'll surround the government quarter,
occupy all S.S. and police barracks.

257
00:31:35.366 --> 00:31:39.776
Once we have control of the government,
we'll shut-down all concentration camps.

258
00:31:40.012 --> 00:31:42.493
Any officers who resist will be arrested,
or shot.

259
00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:45.722
I've been transferred to the front.

260
00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:52.101
It doesn't matter.
You knew these orders better than anyone.

261
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:55.251
That's why I'm putting you in-charge
of the military wing of the operation.

262
00:31:55.566 --> 00:31:58.676
Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

263
00:31:58.913 --> 00:32:01.984
No, it's your plan.
It's you.

264
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.827
One more thing: you need to be absolutely certain
no conflicting orders get out after the flash.

265
00:32:07.063 --> 00:32:08.599
It is not enough to kill Hitler.

266
00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:13.403
You need to isolate his chain of command 
and cut them off from the outside world immediately.

267
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:15.529
Yes, I've already considered that, I...

268
00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:19.191
think I have just the man who can help.
- Who is he?

269
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:22.341
Perhaps it's better I don't say.

270
00:32:26.082 --> 00:32:28.957
You know, God promised to Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

271
00:32:29.193 --> 00:32:31.319
if he could find just
10 righteous men.

272
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.162
I have a feeling that for Germany,
it may come down to one.

273
00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:43.368
Let us begin.

274
00:32:43.998 --> 00:32:47.542
The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler,

275
00:32:49.826 --> 00:32:51.558
is dead.

276
00:32:57.898 --> 00:32:59.434
Heil Hiltler, General.

277
00:33:02.308 --> 00:33:04.198
Would you excuse us, please?

278
00:33:12.428 --> 00:33:17.074
You play the part of bureaucrat beautifully.
- It's the only time I get to relax.

279
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.854
You've been promoted Chief of Staff
for the reserve army.

280
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:24.910
Excuse me?
- Congratulations.

281
00:33:26.052 --> 00:33:28.257
I am busy with other things.

282
00:33:28.493 --> 00:33:32.195
Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't
count as service to the Reich.

283
00:33:32.588 --> 00:33:35.069
I'll refuse the promotion.
- You'll do no such thing.

284
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:39.794
Tresckow may have left you incharge of the operation,
but in this world I still outrank you.

285
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.920
You will accept the promotion.

286
00:33:42.432 --> 00:33:46.252
You'll have real access to Hitler,
his advisers, his schedule.

287
00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:48.024
We need this.

288
00:33:49.678 --> 00:33:52.828
I've looked through your changes to Valkyrie.

289
00:33:53.733 --> 00:33:57.592
I approve.
I'll need you to get Hitler to sign it.

290
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.971
Now, there's a man here,
to interview as your adjutant.

291
00:34:04.207 --> 00:34:06.176
He comes highly recommended.

292
00:34:12.673 --> 00:34:14.288
Close the door.

293
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:19.525
Be seated.

294
00:34:23.305 --> 00:34:26.100
Do you know how this war
will end, Lieutenant?

295
00:34:26.337 --> 00:34:32.007
The portrait will be un-hung,
and the man will be hung.

296
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.756
I'm engaged in high treason,
with all means available to me.

297
00:34:43.032 --> 00:34:44.568
Can I count you in?

298
00:34:51.459 --> 00:34:54.609
For anything, sir. Anything at all.

299
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.067
Come, children.

300
00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:03.084
Colonel Brandt, operations.

301
00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:06.943
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review
your presentation to the Fuhrer.

302
00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:09.463
Strictly routine.

303
00:36:09.738 --> 00:36:11.904
Sir, the contents of the Colonel's bag
are for the Fuhrer's eyes only.

304
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.991
I am the Fuhrer's eyes, Lieutenant.

305
00:36:14.227 --> 00:36:17.928
The Colonel is a member of my staff at the
War Ministry. He doesn't answer to you.

306
00:36:19.858 --> 00:36:21.236
They're waiting.

307
00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:23.599
This way.

308
00:36:58.407 --> 00:37:03.723
My Fuhrer, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg,
our new chief of staff for the reserve army.

309
00:37:04.904 --> 00:37:06.164
Heil, My Fuhrer.

310
00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:18.961
[...] an honor it is to meet an officer who has
sacrificed so much for Germany.

311
00:37:24.553 --> 00:37:27.034
And if only more of my men
were like you.

312
00:37:29.042 --> 00:37:34.239
Let this man stand as an example to all of you.
He is the ideal German officer.

313
00:37:36.208 --> 00:37:37.468
My Fuhrer...

314
00:37:37.783 --> 00:37:40.473
Colonel Stauffenberg was asked
to come here today to brief us

315
00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:45.501
on mobilizing troops of the reserve army,
to repel the invasion.

316
00:37:47.312 --> 00:37:48.966
Invasion?

317
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.982
Normandy, my Fuhrer.

318
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.739
Oh, yes.

319
00:37:56.959 --> 00:37:58.692
Normandy.

320
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:01.566
That will not be necessary.

321
00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:07.315
Reich-Marshall Goering assures me
that everything completely under control.

322
00:38:09.953 --> 00:38:11.292
Thank you Colonel.

323
00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:21.569
My Fuhrer, if I may, I have an amended copy
of Operation Valkyrie for your approval.

324
00:39:10.868 --> 00:39:13.625
You know your Wagner, Colonel.

325
00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:23.351
The Valkyrie, handmaidens of the gods.

326
00:39:23.626 --> 00:39:26.304
Choosing who will live
and who will die.

327
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.249
Sparing the most heroic
from an agonizing death.

328
00:39:37.329 --> 00:39:40.361
One cannot understand National-Socialism,

329
00:39:42.094 --> 00:39:44.417
if one does not understand Wagner.

330
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.672
I am sure, whatever changes
you've made, are for the best.

331
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:12.019
You're dismissed. Send your men home.
And Fromm...

332
00:40:12.295 --> 00:40:14.815
Have some fresh tea
brought in, will you?

333
00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:28.951
I don't know what you're brewing up,
and I don't want to know,

334
00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:34.818
But when the music stops,
I'd be [...] if Keitel found himself without a chair.

335
00:40:47.694 --> 00:40:49.505
Any problem on Earth
can be solved,

336
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.734
by the careful application
of high explosives.

337
00:40:53.246 --> 00:40:55.727
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

338
00:40:56.357 --> 00:41:01.436
Two 975 gram packs of plastic,
enough explosive to cripple a panzer.

339
00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:03.484
Your detonators,
your fuses.

340
00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:05.768
British time pencils.

341
00:41:06.004 --> 00:41:07.737
This acid capsule is your trigger.

342
00:41:07.973 --> 00:41:11.989
When you're ready to arm, attach the detonator
to the buttom of the time pencil...

343
00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:13.564
... like so.

344
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.384
Insert the entire device into either end
of the plastic,

345
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.573
crush the acid capsule,

346
00:41:20.849 --> 00:41:22.739
and you're live.

347
00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:27.705
When the acid eats through them while
holding back the firing pin...

348
00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:29.905
Well, you'll want to be very far away.

349
00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:36.205
For you.
- How much time will we have?

350
00:41:36.402 --> 00:41:38.765
Theoretically, there's a 30-minute delay,
but with the kind of heat

351
00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:42.348
you can expect at the Wolves' Lair,
I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.

352
00:41:42.584 --> 00:41:44.199
That's hardly precise...

353
00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.940
This is state-of-the-art. You can
have small, or precise, not both.

354
00:41:48.176 --> 00:41:50.045
Might this just be a little too small?

355
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:52.940
No. Hitler's bunker will magnify the blast.

356
00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:56.760
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

357
00:41:56.996 --> 00:42:00.461
The air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that

358
00:42:00.697 --> 00:42:04.399
will kill everyone instantly.
The second charge will be entirely redundant.

359
00:42:04.596 --> 00:42:07.588
If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive,
what then?

360
00:42:08.415 --> 00:42:12.943
We still initiate Valkyrie.
At that point, there'll be no turning back.

361
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.558
But we'll have an advantage.

362
00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.983
We have an inside-man
at the Wolf's Lair.

363
00:42:18.692 --> 00:42:21.409
After the flash, he'll cut off
communication with the outside world.

364
00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:23.614
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup

365
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.725
we'll have the momentum we need
to seize control in Berlin.

366
00:42:28.497 --> 00:42:31.529
Himmler is expected to be in the
meeting as well. Don't proceed,

367
00:42:31.804 --> 00:42:33.419
unless you can get them both.

368
00:42:33.604 --> 00:42:34.419
What?

369
00:42:34.876 --> 00:42:38.577
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

370
00:42:45.192 --> 00:42:47.279
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

371
00:42:51.138 --> 00:42:52.438
Yeah, I'll hold off,

372
00:42:52.674 --> 00:42:55.824
if the decision is unanimous,
but I want another man on the committee.

373
00:42:56.454 --> 00:42:58.895
Not a politician.
- Who?

374
00:42:59.092 --> 00:43:00.392
Him.

375
00:43:00.392 --> 00:43:02.792
Him?
Him.

376
00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:09.556
Fine. But remember,
this is a military operation.

377
00:43:09.802 --> 00:43:12.204
Nothing ever goes
according to plan.

378
00:43:40.713 --> 00:43:43.469
I'll take the children to Bamberg.

379
00:43:50.163 --> 00:43:51.423
If I fail...

380
00:43:54.927 --> 00:43:56.266
... they'll come for you,

381
00:43:58.432 --> 00:43:59.928
all of you.

382
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.771
I know.

383
00:44:30.484 --> 00:44:32.098
Gentlemen, good morning.

384
00:44:32.374 --> 00:44:35.603
Hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today, at 1 o'clock.

385
00:44:36.194 --> 00:44:39.541
Stauffenberg will start once once everyone is present.
- They're here.

386
00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:43.754
Before arming the explosives,
Stauffenberg will call for authorization to proceed.

387
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.124
After the flash, his inside man
will sever all communications.

388
00:44:48.755 --> 00:44:52.456
Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,
Olbricht will take command

389
00:44:52.492 --> 00:44:55.212
of the reserve army,
and initiate Valkyrie.

390
00:44:55.448 --> 00:44:59.622
Then you'll notify all district commanders,
that the S.S. is attempting to seize power.

391
00:44:59.977 --> 00:45:03.836
The reserve army will arrest all S.S.,
Gestapo, and Nazi officials.

392
00:45:04.032 --> 00:45:08.246
By then, Stauffenberg would've return to Berlin
and taken command of the reserve army.

393
00:45:08.797 --> 00:45:11.593
Witzleben and I will assume the roles of
Commander of the Armed Forces

394
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:13.443
and Head of State.

395
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.011
With Berlin secured, Dr. Goerdeler
will address the nation as our new Chancellor.

396
00:45:18.444 --> 00:45:22.264
Then, God willing... we can negotiate
a truce with the Allies,

397
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.296
and save Europe from total destruction.

398
00:45:27.264 --> 00:45:33.840
This will identify you as a member of the operation.
Nobody gets in or out of the perimeter without one.

399
00:45:34.943 --> 00:45:36.242
Gentlemen.

400
00:45:36.872 --> 00:45:39.471
This is the most important day of your lives.

401
00:45:41.637 --> 00:45:43.842
Long live Sacred Germany.

402
00:46:20.019 --> 00:46:21.042
-Captain. 
- What is it?

403
00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:22.942
An order from General Olbricht's office.

404
00:46:23.218 --> 00:46:25.697
It's calling the reserve army
for some sort of a stand-by action

405
00:46:25.818 --> 00:46:28.297
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

406
00:46:29.242 --> 00:46:32.107
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it [...].

407
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.907
Sir.

408
00:46:57.593 --> 00:47:03.106
Stand-by action. What the hell for?
- The order doesn't say.

409
00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:05.547
Assemble the men.

410
00:47:06.059 --> 00:47:08.106
This better not be a drill.

411
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.006
Deutschland Guard Battalion - Berlin

412
00:48:44.972 --> 00:48:47.452
The men are assembled
and waiting for the orders.

413
00:48:48.004 --> 00:48:50.721
What do you suppose this
is really all about?

414
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:08.301
Your man?

415
00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:20.586
He is now.

416
00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:38.590
Colonel.

417
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:51.427
Attention!

418
00:53:02.964 --> 00:53:05.956
Gentlemen, our first order of business,

419
00:53:06.193 --> 00:53:10.170
General Fromm will present his plans
for the reallocation of troops,

420
00:53:10.642 --> 00:53:12.453
from the reserve army
in the Eastern front.

421
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.342
Fellas, as you know, last night
the Russians launched  a new offensive 

422
00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:19.029
against Army Group North Ukraine,
in the South Poland section.

423
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:24.896
General Harper was brought in to replace Model
and bring a swift end to this confrontation.

424
00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:26.904
Himmler is not here.

425
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.693
... transfer 3 divisions to fortify
General Harper's troops.

426
00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:37.182
Now, these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan

427
00:53:37.457 --> 00:53:39.668
rather then holding
any one particular...

428
00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:48.200
Operator.

429
00:53:48.286 --> 00:53:50.703
Direct me to War Ministry,
General Olbricht's office.

430
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.703
One moment, please.

431
00:53:57.027 --> 00:53:59.114
General Olbricht's office.
- Himmler's not at the briefing.

432
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.847
I'm ready to arm,
permission to proceed.

433
00:54:01.083 --> 00:54:02.343
Hold [...]

434
00:54:02.737 --> 00:54:06.281
Stauffenberg says Himmler is not at the briefing.
He wants to proceed.

435
00:54:06.517 --> 00:54:07.777
Call Beck.

436
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.408
- Beck.
- Himmler is not at the briefing.

437
00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.508
Himmler is not at the briefing.

438
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.708
... ready, diminished reserves.

439
00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.508
No.

440
00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:37.939
They say no.

441
00:54:40.735 --> 00:54:42.113
What do you say?

442
00:54:47.074 --> 00:54:48.452
I say do it.

443
00:54:49.074 --> 00:54:50.252
Attention!

444
00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:28.143
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

445
00:55:29.915 --> 00:55:32.396
Colonel, your bag.

446
00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:59.290
This had been a drill,
you're dismissed!

447
00:56:02.834 --> 00:56:05.944
How dare you put reserve army in stand-by
without my knowledge?

448
00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:07.520
[...] cost me my commission.

449
00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:10.276
And what, in God's name, made you think
you even had the authority?

450
00:56:10.552 --> 00:56:14.808
It was only a drill with an exercise.
- Oh, don't lie, Olbricht! Not to me.

451
00:56:15.355 --> 00:56:17.639
We both know it wasn't a drill.
- General, if I may...

452
00:56:17.915 --> 00:56:20.789
No, you may not, Colonel.
You may not do anything.

453
00:56:21.026 --> 00:56:22.945
Because not only have you proved
 to me you can't deliver,

454
00:56:23.026 --> 00:56:24.845
you've painted a target
on my back.

455
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:29.413
If I so much as sense you're trying
to move the reserve army again,

456
00:56:29.649 --> 00:56:31.696
I will personally
have you both arrested.

457
00:56:34.295 --> 00:56:38.091
Do I make myself abundantly clear?
- Yes, sir.

458
00:56:43.095 --> 00:56:44.991
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. 

459
00:56:47.289 --> 00:56:49.416
I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

460
00:56:58.089 --> 00:57:00.116
Heil Hitler!

461
00:57:09.694 --> 00:57:12.884
The point of replacing Hitler,
is to negotiate a truce with the Allies.

462
00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:15.404
The Allies, I suspect,
would be more amenable to a truce

463
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.200
if we offer it to them before
 they get to fucking Berlin!

464
00:57:18.436 --> 00:57:21.350
There's no point in killing Hitler 
unless you kill Himmler too.

465
00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:24.264
Why remove a madman,
just to have a lunatic take his place?

466
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.784
Today's failure had nothing to do
with Himmler, and you know it.

467
00:57:27.059 --> 00:57:30.391
This is a military operation in the hands
of a politician, nothing more.

468
00:57:30.467 --> 00:57:32.808
What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything!

469
00:57:33.044 --> 00:57:34.738
I'm stating the facts as I see them!

470
00:57:35.013 --> 00:57:37.912
You don't have the courage to kill Hitler,
so you're making the task impossible.

471
00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:40.445
Nothing seems to stop you and your henchmen
from trying it on your own.

472
00:57:40.581 --> 00:57:43.110
My only regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone!

473
00:57:43.007 --> 00:57:45.920
I don't think I'm alone when
I say your judgement is in question!

474
00:57:46.117 --> 00:57:47.910
I'd like to call a vote.
- Carl...

475
00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:52.299
I propose that we relieve
Colonel Stauffenberg.

476
00:57:52.929 --> 00:57:55.354
Carl, can I have a word
with you in private?

477
00:57:55.529 --> 00:57:57.854
No, but if you think you have
something to say, say it.

478
00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:01.553
Very well. I've heard from
the chief of police this evening...

479
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.191
... that Himmler has issued
a warrant for your arrest.

480
00:58:07.302 --> 00:58:09.231
You have to leave Germany,
tonight.

481
00:58:09.664 --> 00:58:12.437
When we succeed with
the central solution, 

482
00:58:12.964 --> 00:58:14.437
you'll return as Chancellor.

483
00:58:15.374 --> 00:58:19.666
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

484
00:58:33.487 --> 00:58:34.825
Good luck, Colonel.

485
00:58:41.716 --> 00:58:46.150
No more indecision. From now on,
Stauffenberg has full discretion.

486
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.725
I can't issue the alert again,
unless we follow through.

487
00:58:48.962 --> 00:58:52.466
I'll do my job.
You just take Berlin.

488
00:58:59.593 --> 00:59:03.058
Hold on, sir. I'm trying to connect you right no.
- Thank you.

489
00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:07.158
Hello.
- Hello? Hello?

490
00:59:09.493 --> 00:59:12.358
[...]
- Hello?

491
00:59:12.823 --> 00:59:17.076
I'm sorry, sir. There's bombing in Ebingen.
We've been disconnected.

492
00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:22.110
Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.
I'm sure your family is safe.

493
00:59:22.154 --> 00:59:23.054
Thank you.

494
01:00:58.194 --> 01:01:01.816
Welcome, Colonel.
- Do you have a place where I can change, Major?

495
01:01:03.352 --> 01:01:04.809
Please follow me.

496
01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:15.204
At least put the reserve army on stand-by alert.
- Not until I've heard from Stauffenberg,

497
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:16.976
Not until I'm sure...
- That's not what he...

498
01:01:17.212 --> 01:01:19.142
Noted, Colonel, thank you.

499
01:01:30.837 --> 01:01:33.278
The meeting has been
moved up to 12:30.

500
01:01:33.514 --> 01:01:36.297
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

501
01:01:36.314 --> 01:01:38.397
The Fuhrer wants to have lunch with him.
- Yes, sir.

502
01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:40.641
Will Mussolini be joining us
at the briefing, sir?

503
01:01:41.862 --> 01:01:44.539
I only wish he were.
Then some ambitious officer

504
01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:47.847
might take the opportunity
to shoot that dago bastard!

505
01:01:49.698 --> 01:01:52.523
Excuse me, General. I'm expecting
an important call.

506
01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:54.423
Could you please have someone
come and get me?

507
01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:56.234
Even if I'm with the Fuhrer.

508
01:01:57.179 --> 01:01:59.817
Of course, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

509
01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:02.219
Colonel.

510
01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:35.728
Major Freyend speaking.

511
01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:46.793
Colonel?

512
01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:49.116
They insist you hurry.

513
01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:53.015
The briefing's about to begin.
- One moment please, Major.

514
01:02:59.669 --> 01:03:02.012
10 minutes: 2 for the walk,
1 for the checkpoint,

515
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:03.612
... 1 for the bunker,
6 to get out.

516
01:03:04.788 --> 01:03:06.284
Plenty of time.

517
01:03:10.261 --> 01:03:11.561
Excuse me, Colonel.

518
01:03:14.356 --> 01:03:16.522
Sir, the Fuhrer's at the briefing!

519
01:03:21.956 --> 01:03:24.622
The Colonel's changing, Major.

520
01:03:27.823 --> 01:03:31.327
You understand, this can be difficult.
- Of course.

521
01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.354
Plenty of time.

522
01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.200
Get the car.

523
01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:15.980
Sir?
- I have everything I need. Get the car.

524
01:04:43.901 --> 01:04:45.715
I can manage this.

525
01:04:57.876 --> 01:04:59.727
Where're they going?
- It's too hot.

526
01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:02.129
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

527
01:05:26.818 --> 01:05:29.106
Major, my injury has
left me hard of hearing.

528
01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:31.306
Would you place me as close to
the Fuhrer as possible?

529
01:05:31.503 --> 01:05:33.236
I'll see what I can do.

530
01:05:34.835 --> 01:05:36.745
Not only have they been
advancing from the east,

531
01:05:36.835 --> 01:05:40.245
but they're coming down on the
northern and the southern France as well.

532
01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:43.946
As you can see,
my Fuhrer,

533
01:05:44.182 --> 01:05:49.341
if the enemy continues at this rate, the
situation in the east Prussian sector is critical.

534
01:05:49.774 --> 01:05:52.569
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

535
01:05:52.806 --> 01:05:55.286
and reserves are severely depleated.

536
01:05:55.523 --> 01:05:57.807
My Fuhrer, you remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?

537
01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:10.958
As you're all aware, in the past 2 days alone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

538
01:06:11.431 --> 01:06:13.754
and the 14th Division
has been pushed out of [...].

539
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:18.046
Army Group Center has already
lost 28 of their 40 divisions.

540
01:06:18.676 --> 01:06:21.983
That is a total of
almost 350,000 men.

541
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:30.331
Since the Red Army first attacked,
nearly a month ago,

542
01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:34.033
our troops have already been
pushed back to the Polish border.

543
01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:36.333
Conference hut.

544
01:06:37.222 --> 01:06:41.263
... pounded with the loss of the 4th Army
in Minsk, threatens the entire eastern...

545
01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.492
Yes, sir.

546
01:06:43.522 --> 01:06:47.617
... from Army Group North Ukraine,
as well as the Romanian army...

547
01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:58.299
... further losses. Unless we can
quickly dispatch new blocking divisions,

548
01:06:58.399 --> 01:07:04.400
at vital points along the German right, Army Group...
- Colonel, there's a telephone call for you.

549
01:07:04.445 --> 01:07:05.558
... (can be swallowed by the enemy),
in less than a fortnight,

550
01:07:05.594 --> 01:07:11.400
and we run the risk of losing all the ground
we have managed to gain in the last 3 years.

551
01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:12.700
Our spear...

552
01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:16.047
General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent.

553
01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.087
Yes, General. This is Stauffenberg.

554
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.238
Russian air-activity has proven just as
impregnable as their ground force...

555
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.338
My Fuhrer...

556
01:07:38.216 --> 01:07:40.302
... In some areas they outnumber us...

557
01:07:44.004 --> 01:07:46.051
... the Italian front, I further propose...

558
01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:54.242
One thing is certain: the Red Army
will continue an aggressive push west,

559
01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:55.856
even at the expense of...

560
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.707
... In order to rebuild,
at this...

561
01:08:07.905 --> 01:08:12.300
... already southwest of Luneburg,
and closing on Army Group...

562
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.710
It will be a catastrophe...

563
01:08:38.815 --> 01:08:40.115
Get in.

564
01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:43.029
Drive.

565
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.549
I have orders from
the Fuhrer, drive.

566
01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:48.738
Drive, drive!

567
01:08:52.321 --> 01:08:53.699
Back to work!

568
01:09:23.862 --> 01:09:28.508
Give me the War Ministry, General Olbricht.
Olbricht! The call is urgent!

569
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:36.471
General Olbricht's office.
- They're calling from the Wolf's Lair...

570
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:42.171
... with an urgent ... General Olbricht...
- ... happened ... the Fuhrer...

571
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:49.259
Fellgiebel? Fellgiebel!
- Sever all communications!

572
01:09:49.535 --> 01:09:50.834
Sir?
- Just do it!

573
01:09:53.748 --> 01:09:58.355
What did he say?
- I can't be sure...

574
01:09:59.103 --> 01:10:00.481
Well, get him back on the line.

575
01:10:03.356 --> 01:10:05.828
Sir, the bomb did go off,
that much was clear.

576
01:10:05.864 --> 01:10:08.199
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

577
01:10:18.912 --> 01:10:21.863
Sorry, Colonel, no one gets in or out.
- We have an order from the Fuhrer.

578
01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:23.974
We have to get to the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

579
01:10:24.049 --> 01:10:28.045
Very sorry, sir, but my orders are...
- I just gave you an order, Sergeant!

580
01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:32.025
Sir. Sir!
Excuse me!

581
01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:41.078
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

582
01:10:47.536 --> 01:10:51.222
Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.
We initiate Valyrie, regardless...

583
01:10:51.238 --> 01:10:52.862
Only Fromm can initiate, you know that.

584
01:10:52.918 --> 01:10:55.600
Then tell him Hitler is dead,
or arrest him, but do it now!

585
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.458
Sir, you have to give the order
to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only...

586
01:10:59.494 --> 01:11:01.059
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel!

587
01:11:01.294 --> 01:11:02.859
Get him back
on the phone now.

588
01:11:02.696 --> 01:11:05.143
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost!

589
01:11:05.179 --> 01:11:06.279
The risk is too great.

590
01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:09.432
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

591
01:11:09.468 --> 01:11:12.146
He did his part, and now
you're abandoning him!

592
01:11:12.461 --> 01:11:15.138
Field Marshal, sir, Stauffenberg here.
A Sergeant...

593
01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:18.480
Kolbe, sir.
- What? - Kolbe.

594
01:11:18.643 --> 01:11:22.817
Kolbe, won't let me pass the main gate.
Yes, sir, I explained that.

595
01:11:23.453 --> 01:11:25.773
Perhaps you can make
him understand, sir.

596
01:11:30.771 --> 01:11:33.291
Everything's fine now, sir. Thank you.

597
01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.016
Open the gate!

598
01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:49.932
At least put the reserve army in alert!
- When Stauffenberg returns.

599
01:11:49.868 --> 01:11:54.278
When he gives me confirmation that Hiltler is dead.
Then we'll proceed.

600
01:11:59.594 --> 01:12:03.217
Where are you going?
- The same place as you are.

601
01:12:03.413 --> 01:12:04.713
Lunch.

602
01:13:41.696 --> 01:13:44.295
Another stand-by alert.

603
01:13:46.185 --> 01:13:49.138
Send it through,
and keep me informed.

604
01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:15.520
Sir,
another stand-by order.

605
01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:20.679
In ancient Greece you
would've been killed for this.

606
01:14:21.978 --> 01:14:24.695
Lucky for you,
we evolved.

607
01:14:27.648 --> 01:14:29.263
Assemble the men.

608
01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:18.246
Quiet, isn't it?

609
01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:21.711
I'll see where our driver is.

610
01:15:25.058 --> 01:15:28.957
This is von Haeften. The Colonel and I are at the airfield,
there's no car, there's no one here...

611
01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.052
You mean to tell me the alert
has only just gone out?!

612
01:15:34.469 --> 01:15:36.871
This is Stauffenberg.
Give me General Olbricht.

613
01:15:44.589 --> 01:15:46.558
What's this?

614
01:15:52.858 --> 01:15:55.145
Explain this!
- Someone had to do something, while you were...

615
01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:59.079
We don't know that Hitler is not alive!
- This is about Germany, for God's sake, not you!

616
01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:14.357
General Olbricht's office.
Colonel Stauffenberg. For you, sir.

617
01:16:20.815 --> 01:16:24.201
This is Olbricht. - It's been 3 hours Olbricht.
What, the hell, have you been doing?

618
01:16:24.438 --> 01:16:27.351
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

619
01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:28.451
Damn it!

620
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:30.895
I saw the explosion myself.

621
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:34.109
We are committed.
- Dear God...

622
01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:36.054
Now where is Fromm?
Is he with us?

623
01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:39.794
No one has spoken to him yet.

624
01:16:50.977 --> 01:16:52.415
You listen to me.

625
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.215
Nevermind Germany. Nevermind Europe.
Your life is at stake now,

626
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:59.876
and if you want to live to the night,
you'll do exactly as I say.

627
01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:02.790
The second you hang-up the phone,
initiate Valkyrie in Fromm's name.

628
01:17:03.026 --> 01:17:06.609
Give him the choice to join us or place him
under immidiate arrest, do you understand?

629
01:17:07.136 --> 01:17:10.389
Yes. - I'll be in Fromm's office in 15 minutes.
Be there when I arrive.

630
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:44.214
Call Beck and the others,
tell them it's time.

631
01:17:49.693 --> 01:17:51.459
Put me though to communications.

632
01:17:52.758 --> 01:17:56.420
This is General Olbricht,
calling on behalf of General Fromm,

633
01:17:56.656 --> 01:18:00.712
commander of the reserve army.
The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, is dead.

634
01:18:00.948 --> 01:18:04.256
A group of radicals in the S.S. are attempting
to seize control of the government.

635
01:18:04.492 --> 01:18:07.760
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

636
01:18:41.624 --> 01:18:44.892
You have the orders,
pass them along.

637
01:19:20.764 --> 01:19:22.339
Battalion.

638
01:19:22.772 --> 01:19:24.111
Attention!

639
01:19:28.872 --> 01:19:30.911
Fuhrer...

640
01:19:32.262 --> 01:19:35.963
Our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler...

641
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:40.176
is dead.

642
01:19:40.412 --> 01:19:42.027
Who told you
the Fuhrer was dead?

643
01:19:42.302 --> 01:19:44.862
General Fellgiebel,
at the Wolf's Lair.

644
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:50.138
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

645
01:19:50.335 --> 01:19:52.313
Yes, get me the Wolf's Lair.
- One moment, sir.

646
01:19:56.856 --> 01:20:01.045
Wolf's Lair. - Yes, General Fromm
for Field Marshal Keitel, urgent.

647
01:20:05.731 --> 01:20:08.784
Keitel.
- Yes, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

648
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:13.121
but I wonder if you could tell me what's happening?
Most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin.

649
01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:14.921
I don't know what you mean...

650
01:20:14.158 --> 01:20:17.465
There's a talk that the Fuhrer
has been assassinated.

651
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.608
Another failed attempt.
The Fuhrer was never in danger.

652
01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:27.782
By the way, where's your man
Stauffenberg?

653
01:20:28.018 --> 01:20:31.365
Stauffenberg? On his way
back to Berlin, I would think.

654
01:20:32.153 --> 01:20:35.657
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

655
01:20:42.508 --> 01:20:44.753
The Fuhrer's fine.
- That is a lie.

656
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:47.155
Adolf Hitler's dead,
Operation Valkyrie is in effect.

657
01:20:47.391 --> 01:20:50.502
Only I can initiate Valkyrie.
- You did.

658
01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:00.621
This is treason!

659
01:21:00.858 --> 01:21:03.342
Right now, the reserve army is
assuming control of Berlin.

660
01:21:03.378 --> 01:21:07.543
Are you with us or not?
- Do you realize what you've done?

661
01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.997
The Fuhrer is alive!

662
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.631
I delivered the bomb myself.
I saw the blast. he is dead.

663
01:21:14.561 --> 01:21:15.420
Are you with us?

664
01:21:15.461 --> 01:21:17.820
I don't believe this is happening.
This is some kind of...

665
01:21:17.856 --> 01:21:19.286
Are you with us or not?

666
01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:25.271
Colonel, if what you say is true,
you should shoot yourself immediately!

667
01:21:25.507 --> 01:21:28.682
The rest of you are under arrest!
- No, General. You are.

668
01:21:34.091 --> 01:21:36.808
I don't know where you
think this is going.

669
01:21:39.643 --> 01:21:40.943
Get me operations.

670
01:21:42.557 --> 01:21:46.298
This is Colonel Stauffenberg. Seal off
the War Ministry per Operation Valkyrie.

671
01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:50.393
No one gets in or out without autorization
from General Olbricht's office.

672
01:22:06.576 --> 01:22:07.876
General Beck...

673
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:11.347
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

674
01:22:11.423 --> 01:22:13.546
They should be see in us
a movement of the people.

675
01:22:19.531 --> 01:22:23.170
Colonel Stauffenberg?
- Yes...

676
01:22:27.131 --> 01:22:30.620
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of the Berlin police.

677
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.817
You will have no interference from my men.
You have my word.

678
01:22:39.692 --> 01:22:41.031
Thank you.

679
01:23:15.406 --> 01:23:18.874
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

680
01:23:24.069 --> 01:23:25.801
Thank you for coming.

681
01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:34.134
Gentlemen,
in 3 hours I want confirmation

682
01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.859
that the government quarter's ours,

683
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:38.759
and S.S. Command has been cleared
of every living soul.

684
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:41.237
You all know what must to be done.

685
01:23:42.654 --> 01:23:45.046
By night fall I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

686
01:23:45.054 --> 01:23:46.946
has seen his last sunrise.

687
01:24:17.502 --> 01:24:19.475
Yes, sir, all replacments
have been authorized.

688
01:24:19.502 --> 01:24:21.375
In fact, Field Marshal Witzleben
has been appointed

689
01:24:21.402 --> 01:24:22.975
commander in chief
of the armed forces.

690
01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:25.300
That's exactly why
he's been appointed...

691
01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:27.188
If he was a member of the party,
he'd be locked-up as a suspect.

692
01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:29.800
Yes, sir, I understand.
But this is an emergency.

693
01:24:29.825 --> 01:24:31.205
Commanding officer
at the 11th district...

694
01:24:31.502 --> 01:24:32.780
I need a decision, Major.

695
01:24:32.802 --> 01:24:35.261
Tell your men that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

696
01:24:35.897 --> 01:24:39.500
Could I speak with commanding officer in Hanover?
- We represent a different form of government...

697
01:24:39.516 --> 01:24:42.573
I'd be careful who you said that to. 
Loyalty to the party isn't what it used to be...

698
01:24:42.609 --> 01:24:43.805
Yes, Paris, France.

699
01:24:44.002 --> 01:24:45.813
Not since they murdered
the Fuhrer...

700
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:48.061
Thank you...
- You made the right decision.

701
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:51.168
District 13 is ours.

702
01:25:02.706 --> 01:25:06.683
By order of Field Marshal von Witzleben
you're under arrest for crimes against the state.

703
01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:18.523
This is Stauffenberg,
I'm trying to connect with Major General Todt.

704
01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.934
I've already spoken 413 battalion,
you'll have no trouble getting...

705
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:21.960
Yes, sir,
this is Colonel Stauffenberg...

706
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:23.472
... The order explaining everything
will be in your hands shortly...

707
01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.819
... No, these are you orders...
... Excellent!

708
01:25:27.631 --> 01:25:32.098
My wife is in Bamberg with my children.
Would you please try trace them with the phone?

709
01:25:32.195 --> 01:25:33.695
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

710
01:25:33.892 --> 01:25:36.805
General Schroedler has issued the Valkyrie orders
and had sealed our headquarters.

711
01:25:36.902 --> 01:25:40.431
Good. Check on the radio stations every 20 minutes,
until we have confirmation they're ours.

712
01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:55.115
With all due respect, sir,
you can't believe everything you hear...

713
01:25:55.391 --> 01:25:59.604
That is S.S. propaganda, he's dead. Only the commander
of the Home Army is authorized to give orders.

714
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.400
General.

715
01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:05.237
Hello, Christian...

716
01:26:05.259 --> 01:26:07.837
Our men in the Transport Office have secured
the railway communications network,

717
01:26:07.873 --> 01:26:10.653
But there are repeater stations, telephones...
- Yes, I give you my word.

718
01:26:10.673 --> 01:26:14.003
... Broadcast outposts... We need more men!
- Give my best to your family.

719
01:26:15.079 --> 01:26:16.772
He's with us.

720
01:26:17.323 --> 01:26:21.249
Mertz, call Potsdam, tell them place
all available units under our control.

721
01:26:21.255 --> 01:26:22.879
You have your men,
now get control on the radio. 

722
01:26:22.915 --> 01:26:24.569
We have control on
the government quarter!

723
01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:26.262
We don't have Berlin yet.

724
01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:51.502
What is it now, Sergeant?
- An arrest order, sir.

725
01:26:51.777 --> 01:26:53.589
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry,

726
01:26:53.864 --> 01:26:55.282
to arrest Reich Minister Goebbels,

727
01:26:55.991 --> 01:27:00.165
The other is from the Wolf's Lair,
to arrest Colonel Stauffenberg...

728
01:27:05.441 --> 01:27:06.977
Send them both through.

729
01:27:08.119 --> 01:27:13.365
Our job is not to interpret the orders.
Our job is to pass them along, regardless.

730
01:27:13.434 --> 01:27:15.994
Yes, but...
That will be all, Sergeant!

731
01:27:35.094 --> 01:27:38.794
... You are all going to pay for this!

732
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:55.340
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and Goebbels.

733
01:27:56.827 --> 01:27:58.914
Do we arrest them both?

734
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.143
I would hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

735
01:28:02.339 --> 01:28:03.914
Do you really think it's a coup?

736
01:28:04.387 --> 01:28:05.686
Of that I'm sure.

737
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.803
What I can't say, is
which side we are.

738
01:28:09.624 --> 01:28:10.884
Come with me.

739
01:28:11.624 --> 01:28:12.984
District 4: Dresden and Leipzig...

740
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.184
District 12: Wiesbaden...

741
01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:14.884
District 5...

742
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.184
... No trouble bringing reinforcements,
and I rely on you to see it gets started...

743
01:28:21.437 --> 01:28:23.509
I just spoke with Colonel [...],

744
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.910
they've arrested 1200 S.S.
and Gestapo officials in Paris.

745
01:28:27.186 --> 01:28:28.840
Not a single shot fired.

746
01:28:29.076 --> 01:28:32.501
Early reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on a word from Prague...

747
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.601
This is incredible...

748
01:29:06.404 --> 01:29:08.176
I am ready to be connected.

749
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.139
Minister Goebbels?

750
01:29:23.809 --> 01:29:25.265
What can I do for you, Major?

751
01:29:25.699 --> 01:29:28.572
My battalion has a order to block
every government quarter,

752
01:29:28.599 --> 01:29:31.172
and place you under arrest.

753
01:29:34.046 --> 01:29:36.645
Are you a dedicated
National Socialist, Major?

754
01:29:38.146 --> 01:29:39.445
Yes, sir.

755
01:29:53.065 --> 01:29:54.604
Major Remer here...

756
01:29:56.465 --> 01:29:57.904
Hello?

757
01:29:59.759 --> 01:30:02.358
Do you recognize my voice?

758
01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:07.083
Yes, my Fuhrer...
- Then listen to me very carefully.

759
01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:16.297
I want these traitors taken alive.
- Yes, my Fuhrer.

760
01:30:20.392 --> 01:30:24.763
You heard what he said.
The Fuhrer wants the traitors taken alive.

761
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.480
Yes, sir.

762
01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:53.529
It's a coup, alright.

763
01:30:54.334 --> 01:30:56.854
We can't afford to remain neutral
any longer.

764
01:31:00.422 --> 01:31:03.021
You have to make a decision.

765
01:31:04.493 --> 01:31:07.328
When it's over, we better wake-up
on the right side.

766
01:31:13.893 --> 01:31:15.228
Very well...

767
01:31:17.881 --> 01:31:19.853
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair,

768
01:31:19.889 --> 01:31:21.819
stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

769
01:31:28.355 --> 01:31:29.891
Release these men!

770
01:31:31.505 --> 01:31:33.080
But... they're part of the coup...

771
01:31:33.795 --> 01:31:35.732
I've just been on the phone
with Hiltler itself.

772
01:31:36.095 --> 01:31:39.032
We are the coup, you idiot!
We've been duped!

773
01:31:42.137 --> 01:31:44.184
We've lost contact with District 11.

774
01:31:47.649 --> 01:31:51.078
The switchboard is overloaded.
Give it 10 minutes and try again.

775
01:31:55.825 --> 01:31:58.305
Give me General Bieler, District 11.

776
01:31:58.502 --> 01:32:01.864
... We still need a... I don't want to leave any ...
- Keep trying.

777
01:32:04.069 --> 01:32:05.566
Where is General Fromm?

778
01:32:08.007 --> 01:32:10.488
General Fromm is no longer in command.
I am.

779
01:32:11.493 --> 01:32:14.131
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

780
01:32:14.193 --> 01:32:15.331
The Fuhrer is dead.

781
01:32:15.667 --> 01:32:18.560
The S.S. were staging a coup,
we've initiated Operation Valkyrie

782
01:32:18.896 --> 01:32:21.119
to crush the uprising
and save Hitler's Germany.

783
01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:23.442
You will present the order
to your troops.

784
01:32:24.584 --> 01:32:27.577
I will do no such thing,
until I speak to General Fromm.

785
01:32:27.774 --> 01:32:30.806
You will follow your orders,
or you're under arrest.

786
01:32:32.026 --> 01:32:33.759
This is treason.

787
01:32:34.704 --> 01:32:38.011
I will take no part.
The Fuhrer is not dead.

788
01:32:38.604 --> 01:32:42.811
The Fuhrer is not dead!
- Stop him!  - The Fuhrer is not dead...

789
01:32:44.304 --> 01:32:48.911
I sworn an oath! This is treason!
You all sworn an oath!

790
01:32:49.115 --> 01:32:53.880
Listen to what I have to say!
You are all making a terrible mistake!

791
01:32:54.416 --> 01:33:00.954
The Fuhrer is not dead!
The Fuhrer is not dead!

792
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.275
Please track my wife again...

793
01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.275
Bamberg, please...

794
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.675
Get your hands off!

795
01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.475
Sir...

796
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:44.475
"... Over 215 enemy tanks have been annahilated
in the past week alone."

797
01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:48.475
"The Airforce engaged a low-flying offensive
on enemy concentrations..."

798
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.023
Lieutenant! I can't get through
to General Goerlock.

799
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.023
Send a runner down to his office,
bring him here.

800
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:57.823
Yes, thank you.

801
01:33:59.566 --> 01:34:03.502
Yes, this is Stauffenberg. I was speaking
to the General 5 minutes ago.

802
01:34:03.566 --> 01:34:05.302
He told me he'll return my call...

803
01:34:05.938 --> 01:34:08.655
I trust everything in your district
is under control?

804
01:34:12.638 --> 01:34:14.209
And the General knows I'm waiting?

805
01:34:15.238 --> 01:34:17.509
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

806
01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:19.075
... the army gave their oath to a liar, Hans...
- Hello?

807
01:34:19.485 --> 01:34:22.975
... One who has broken his own oath to
the people a hundred times over...  - Hello?

808
01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:24.839
Hans, listen to me!..

809
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:54.059
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

810
01:34:58.781 --> 01:35:01.419
"Today, an attempt was made
on the Fuhrer's life."

811
01:35:02.174 --> 01:35:06.381
"The Fuhrer himself suffered no major injuries
beyond light burns and bruises."

812
01:35:06.617 --> 01:35:08.669
"He resumed his work immediately."

813
01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:14.369
"Those seriously wounded include General [...],
Colonel Brandt and staff-officer Berger..."

814
01:35:19.493 --> 01:35:22.800
Send the following orders to all
reserve army commanders:

815
01:35:22.893 --> 01:35:25.911
"Broadcast incorrect. The Fuhrer is dead..."

816
01:35:28.313 --> 01:35:30.600
"Operation Valkyrie is
still in effect."

817
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:35.600
"... Reich Marshal Goering, and has scheduled
to receive Mussolini..."

818
01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:41.800
"... Long live our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, whom
the Almighty God has so visibly blessed today."

819
01:35:45.127 --> 01:35:46.805
I saw the blast.

820
01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.617
I saw the blast...

821
01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:04.775
"Today, an attempt was made
on the Fuhrer's life."

822
01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:09.422
"The Fuhrer himself suffered no major injuries
beyond light burns and bruises."

823
01:36:09.551 --> 01:36:14.022
I'm sorry...
- "... resumed his work immediately. Those seriously..."

824
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:42.522
"Stay tuned for the Fuhrer's address
to the German people."

825
01:36:42.325 --> 01:36:47.186
My family?
- Our lines have been cut...

826
01:36:50.515 --> 01:36:51.954
I'm sorry...

827
01:36:53.529 --> 01:36:54.829
Go.

828
01:36:55.925 --> 01:36:58.012
It alright, go...

829
01:37:13.723 --> 01:37:16.755
General, sir, we have to
get you out of here.

830
01:38:39.923 --> 01:38:41.155
Get back.

831
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:43.722
Stop.
- Stand down!

832
01:38:43.758 --> 01:38:45.784
I said stop!
- I said stand down!

833
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:13.623
Hold your fire.

834
01:39:22.364 --> 01:39:24.333
Colonel Stauffenberg.

835
01:39:26.932 --> 01:39:29.885
By orders of the Fuhrer,
you're under arrest.

836
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.543
If you have any last messages to your
wives and children, I will hear them now.

837
01:39:59.372 --> 01:40:02.062
Very well.
A court-martial convened my me,

838
01:40:02.137 --> 01:40:04.000
in the Fuhrer absence,
will pronounce the sentence.

839
01:40:04.028 --> 01:40:05.524
Beck, you're under arrest.

840
01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:10.861
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

841
01:40:11.036 --> 01:40:14.623
and the Colonel, whose name I will not mention,
are condemned to death.

842
01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:17.003
General, my orders are
to take these men alive.

843
01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.400
Noted, Major.

844
01:40:19.932 --> 01:40:22.337
I'd like a pistol, please.

845
01:40:24.461 --> 01:40:26.626
for personal reasons.

846
01:40:43.576 --> 01:40:46.600
Get on with it.
- With all due respect, sir...

847
01:40:46.617 --> 01:40:47.817
That will be all, Major!

848
01:40:47.892 --> 01:40:49.883
Killing us won't hide
your involvement.

849
01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.181
My involvement? I don't know
what you're talking about.

850
01:40:52.975 --> 01:40:56.007
You knew, and did nothing.
- You're as guilty as any of us.

851
01:40:55.843 --> 01:40:57.778
Spare me, Lieutenant.

852
01:40:58.443 --> 01:41:00.178
No one will be spared.

853
01:41:14.886 --> 01:41:17.106
I thinking of earlier times...

854
01:41:22.671 --> 01:41:25.966
This is an outrage that
has never before been [...] ...

855
01:41:26.202 --> 01:41:31.009
A Field Marshal and a General declare,
that they could do things better

856
01:41:31.089 --> 01:41:33.251
than he, who is the Fuhrer of us all!

857
01:41:33.526 --> 01:41:36.164
You'll protest to having said this?

858
01:41:36.826 --> 01:41:38.164
Yes.

859
01:41:42.031 --> 01:41:46.717
"My fellow Germans:
I speak to you tonight for two reasons."

860
01:41:47.253 --> 01:41:51.782
"First, so that you can hear my voice,
and know that I am unhurt."

861
01:41:52.415 --> 01:41:56.089
"Second, so you may know
the details of a crime"

862
01:41:56.325 --> 01:41:58.648
"without parallel in German history."

863
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.815
"A small clique of ambitious, dishonorable officers
had conspired to eliminate me."

864
01:42:07.193 --> 01:42:09.795
"Expect for a few bruises and burns"

865
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:12.848
"I was completely untouched."

866
01:42:14.005 --> 01:42:16.840
"I see in this the hand of Providence"

867
01:42:17.864 --> 01:42:20.817
"directing me to complete my work."

868
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:31.452
Look to me in the eye...

869
01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.914
They'll remember you.

870
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:37.414
Olbricht!

871
01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:48.614
Men, ready!

872
01:43:03.289 --> 01:43:07.478
And we have to show the world,
that not all of us were like him.

873
01:43:12.289 --> 01:43:14.478
Safe! Stand.

874
01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.400
Fire! Stand.

875
01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.100
Stauffenberg!

876
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:49.570
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

877
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.659
Men, Ready!

878
01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:56.919
Aim!

879
01:44:12.533 --> 01:44:14.659
Safe! Stand.

880
01:44:20.638 --> 01:44:25.627
You may hand us over to the executioner,
but in 3-months time,

881
01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:29.130
the disgusted and [...] people
will bring you to book,

882
01:44:29.144 --> 01:44:34.111
and drag you alive through
the dirt in the streets.

883
01:44:34.144 --> 01:44:35.211
Take him away!

884
01:44:40.633 --> 01:44:42.813
Men, Ready!

885
01:44:44.997 --> 01:44:46.157
Aim!

886
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:49.489
Long live Sacred Germany!
- Fire!

887
01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:52.989
Stand.

888
01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.320
