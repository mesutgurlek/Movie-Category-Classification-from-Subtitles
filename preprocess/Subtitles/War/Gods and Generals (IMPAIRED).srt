PASTOR: "The Lord is my light.
My salvation. Whom shall l fear?

153
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:42,193
The Lord is the strength in my life.
Of whom shall l be afraid?

154
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,946
When the wicked, even mine
enemies and my foes...

155
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:51,869
...came upon me to eat up my flesh,
they stumbled and fell.

156
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,584
Though unhost should encamp against
me, my heart shall not fear.

157
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,922
Though war should rise up against me.

158

REVEREND JENKlNS:
Secession is inexcusable.

Southerners and Northerners
can still work together.

161
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,330
Slavery will eventually die
of natural causes.

162
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,959
But the breakup of the Union
will inaugurate wars. . .

163
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,212
. ..of a hundred generations in America...

164
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,467
. ..only to repeat the bloody
history of Europe.

165
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,846
lf Virginia adheres
to the United States, l adhere.

166
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:40,352
Her determination must control mine.
This is my understanding of patriotism.

167
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,357
And though l love the Union,
l love Virginia more.

168
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:53,365
Private Jenkins, because of the high
regard with which l hold your father...

169

return to his new home in Pennsylvania.

you'll be treated as a deserter.

172

HARMAN:
This train was on its way to Washington.

lts livestock's been requisitioned
by the Confederate government.

186
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,679
There's enough damn beef in here
to keep us fed for quite a while.

187
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:43,100
And as many steeds as would
damn well meet our current needs.

188

Mr. Harman, l fear you are a wicked man.

191

-This animal looks fit for the duty.
-Then he's yours, sir.

192
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,085
That small horse over there,
has he been assigned?

193
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:14,048
Well, it's a well-rounded sorrel, sir,
but too small for you.

194
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,258
You'll have your feet
dragging in the dust.

195
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,218
l was thinking of my wife, Anna.

196
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,220
He would make a fine present for her.

197
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,808
HARMAN: Well, that it would, sir.
Shall l arrange for the purchase?

198
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,147
Leave the bill of the sale
at my headquarters.

199
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,483

200
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,069
The Confederate Treasury is honored, sir.

201
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,446
And may you both sit well in the saddle.

202
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,323
What shall l call you?

203
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,582
-Good morning, sir.
-Reverend Pendleton.

204
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,878
-How goes it with the artillery today?
-You're just in time for a christening.

205
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:58,634
The men have decided to name the
howitzers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

206
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:04,098
l'm sure your men will spread the gospel
wherever they encounter the enemy.

207
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,475
Has my son proven a worthy adjutant?

208
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,605
l'm certain Captain Pendleton will prove
himself deserving of the family name.

209
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:21,115
ALL:
Break! Guard! Charge!

210
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,293
As if you could ever get close enough
to stick a man with this.

211
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,964
You can give me your bayonet
if you have no further use for it.

212
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,966
What you gonna do with two of them?

213
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,136
You never heard of spare parts?

214
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,682
Pogue, your only hope is that some Yank
puts you out of your misery.

215
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,979
Captain White.

216
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,398
How fare the scholars
of Washington College?

217
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,317
Are they making their transition
from books to bullets?

218
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,905
A few more days of drill, and my boys
will surpass the cadets of VMl .

219
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,034
Drill, Professor White, drill and drill.
Remember Alexander in Anatolia.

220
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,747
Caesar in Gaul. Napoleon in lberia.

221
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,625
We march by day,
and read Xenophon by night.

222
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:18,213
-We will be your Greek phalanx.
-Then you must begin with the bayonet.

223
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,342
The bayonet must be for a Virginian
what the sarissa was for a Macedonian.

224
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,680
lf the Yankees dare set foot in Virginia,
we must show them the bayonet.

225
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,184
Train with the bayonet
and we shall keep our freedom.

226

Yes, sir.

Sir.

228
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,038
Harman has a detachment ready to take
your sorrel to Mrs. Jackson in Lexington.

229
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,457
The horse you chose
is waiting at headquarters.

230
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,543
l've decided to keep
this little sorrel for myself.

231
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,004
l prefer his gait
to that of the larger horse.

232
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,883
Unlike the other, he has an even temper.

233
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,095
He will need it where we are going.
Yes, l will keep it.

234
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,973
And Mrs. Jackson?
What should we send her, sir?

to make another selection.

236
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,730
My complete admiration in his choice
of livestock, if not in his choice of words.

the destruction of our property.

We should meet the invader on

General?

459
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:18,879
How is it you can keep so serene. . .

460
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:24,426
. ..and stay so utterly insensible...

raining about your head?

Captain Smith...

. ..my religious belief teaches me
to feel as safe in battle as in bed.

God has fixed the time for my death,

whenever it may overtake me.

That is the way all men should live.

And if l may ask, sir, how's your hand?

471
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:24,153
Just a spent bullet. No more than
a scratch really, Mr. Pendleton.

by the distractions of this war.

Mm.
Then think "winter of our discontent."

Sometimes when l'm up on that stage...

. ..brandishing the prop sword
or threatening with the mock word...

hunting or fishing, l was reading books.. .

. ..learning Shakespeare sonnets by heart.

497
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,236
My daddy said art
was the hardest thing.

498
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,989
That everything else seems
more important at the time. . .

499
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,534
. ..but that we needed it more than air.

500

More than food, even.

501
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,665
So now it's politics instead of hunting.

502

Same old thing.

503
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:49,631

The Confederate Army's been reorganized

as the Army of Northern Virginia.

Although l am being transferred
to Winchester...

514

at Centreville.

Begging your pardon, sir. ..

516
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,746

remaining under your command.

517
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,790
That's right, sir.

518

Couldn't the entire brigade be transferred
with you to the Valley?

519

of public respect, confidence...

520
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:17,594
. ..as puts it in one's power to serve
his country must be accepted and prized.

But apart from that. . .

522
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,849
. ..promotion among men is only
a temptation and a trouble.

l should instantly have declined it. . .

. ..that a formal entreaty
to the authorities in Richmond. . .

lt may save your lives. Colonel.

Line of battle consists of two lines of men,
one behind the other. ..

784

the other reloads.

Behind them is a line of, uh, file closers.
Lieutenants and sergeants.

786
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,094
But two lines make a regiment
unwieldy on the move...

787
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,555
. ..so we need to switch to column of fours.

column of fours to line of battle. . .

into column of fours.

What is the status of your family?

1222
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:40,873
About half is free, half slave.

That's counting all the cousins and such.

1224

some officers in this Army. . .

1225
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:51,383
. ..who are of the opinion that...

1226
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:55,470
. ..we should be enlisting Negroes
as a condition for freedom.

1227
01:54:56,472 --> 01:54:58,849

one way or another.

That's all the fodder you get tonight.

1236

We's going to a country where there's
nothing more for an animal to eat...

1237

. ..than there is what's in the palm
of my hand. Ha, ha.

General Lee, fine day, sir.

1239
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:08,752
We got batteries all along that hill,
covering our front to the river.

1240
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,420
Strong anchor on the north.

1241
01:56:10,588 --> 01:56:13,840
Tomorrow, guns will be positioned
in those trees to the south.

1242
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:18,053
We'll be able to cover the entire
open ground, all of it.

General, they gonna come at us here?

1244
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,268
Colonel Alexander...

1245
01:56:25,436 --> 01:56:29,481
. ..Federal troops amassed across that river
are watching us prepare for them.

1246
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:32,317
lf l were General Burnside,
l wouldn't attack here.

1247
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:35,612
l'd move back upstream,
come across from above us.

1248
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:38,573
Burnside is not a man
with the luxury of flexibility.

1249
01:56:38,741 --> 01:56:42,119
He's being pushed from behind
by loud voices in Washington. . .

. ..by newspapers
who demand quick action.

But we're here,
and so he will attack us here.

1252
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:52,004
We got batteries pointing from all angles.

1253

They cross that canal,
that'll slow them down.

1254

We shall hit them from all sides.

General Jackson sends his respects. . .

to the south of this position. . .

He's 1 50 miles away.

1262

To General Jackson,
dawn begins the minute after midnight.

1263

General Hood, l've often wondered
how it is that.. .

in this Army of irascibles. . .

a Kentuckian.

General Gregg, have you settled your
differences with General Jackson?

No, sir.

Tell me, general...

We will be lining up those pontoon
bridges through a hail of lead.

Once across, the Rebs are sure
to make us pay for every block.

No, general, we'll meet them head on.

We'll march up to that hill there. ..

all the way across this field.

1314

at ourselves and say:

"We're good soldiers.
We did what we were told."

a good plan, but there were contingencies.

they died doing their duty.

The Rebs have fortified
the high ground up the river.

1320
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:07,736
And anyway, there are strong currents
and obstacles to a crossing there.

Well, General Jackson,
you are a most gallant sight this morning.

1381
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:29,964
Thank you, General Stuart,
your gift is much appreciated.

1382
02:11:30,132 --> 02:11:33,384
General Longstreet, show us
where your troops are positioned.

1383
02:11:33,552 --> 02:11:38,556
Yes, sir. We're anchored on the north
by Anderson's division...

1384
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:41,726
. ..up on the bend in the river
and Ransom's division...

1385
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,229
. ..along and below the ridge
of Marye's Heights...

1386
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:50,318
. ..with Cobb's brigade dug in down
on the road behind that stone wall.

1387
02:11:50,485 --> 02:11:53,487
Now, to their right, is General McLaws...

1388
02:11:53,655 --> 02:11:58,492
. ..and further down in the woods
and to the right, Pickett and Hood.

1389
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:00,828
General Hood is my right flank.

1390
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:06,500
He's connected in those heavy trees
over there with General Jackson's left.

1391
02:12:06,668 --> 02:12:09,754
Up here on the Heights,
we have the Washington artillery. ..

1392
02:12:09,922 --> 02:12:13,090
. ..Colonel Alexander's batteries
and support.

1393
02:12:13,258 --> 02:12:15,384
lt's a strong line, general.

1394
02:12:15,552 --> 02:12:16,594
Very well.

1395
02:12:17,095 --> 02:12:20,014
General Jackson, would you please extend
the line for us?

1396
02:12:20,182 --> 02:12:25,269
Um, General A.P. Hill is on the left,
adjoining General Hood.

1397
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:28,940
Position is supported by General Taliaferro
and General Early.

1398
02:12:29,107 --> 02:12:32,443
Now to the right flank and behind
is D.H. Hill.

1399
02:12:32,694 --> 02:12:36,030
We've built a road behind our lines
running the entire length.

1400
02:12:36,198 --> 02:12:38,908
We can move troops as is necessary.

1401
02:12:39,076 --> 02:12:42,286
lf the enemy penetrates our lines
at any point...

1402
02:12:42,454 --> 02:12:46,415
. ..the reserves, Taliaferro and Early,
can move rapidly to a new position.

1403

lf the enemy attempts to cut our center. ..

1404
02:12:49,002 --> 02:12:52,546
. ..or if General Pickett is pressed,
we can change positions, sir.

1405
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:54,632
Good, very good.

1406

for protecting. . .

STUART:
Oh, yes, sir.

1409
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:05,226
We're covering the enemy from the river,
as far out as our own lines.

1410
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:10,022
lf the Yankees move down river or
threaten to turn General Jackson's line. ..

1411
02:13:10,482 --> 02:13:13,317
. ..we can block their advance
until the line is moved.

1412
02:13:13,485 --> 02:13:18,739
Very well. Gentlemen,
these deployments are sound.

1413

ln the Roman civil war...

1416
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:38,884
...Julius Caesar knew he had
to march on Rome itself...

1417
02:13:39,052 --> 02:13:41,846
...which no legion was permitted to do.

1418
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:46,600
Marcus Lucanus left us a chronicle
of what happened.

1419
02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:51,689
How swiftly Caesar had surmounted
the icy Alps...

1420
02:13:51,857 --> 02:13:56,944
...and in his mind conceived
immense upheavals, coming war.

1421
02:13:57,112 --> 02:14:01,282
When he reached the little Rubicon,
clearly through the murky night...

1422
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:05,453
...appeared a mighty image
of his country in distress...

1423
02:14:06,288 --> 02:14:08,873
. ..grief in her face. ..

1424
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:13,127
. ..her white hair streaming
from her tower-crowned head.

1425
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:18,549
With tresses torn and shoulders bare,
she stood before him and sighing, said:

1426
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:23,471
"Where further do you march? Where
do you take my standards, warriors?

1427
02:14:23,638 --> 02:14:28,601
lf lawfully you come, if as citizens,
this far only is allowed."

1428
02:14:29,227 --> 02:14:32,730
Trembling struck his limbs.

1429
02:14:32,898 --> 02:14:37,318
And weakness checked his progress,
holding his feet at the river's edge.

1430
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:38,944
At last he speaks.

1431
02:14:39,321 --> 02:14:41,655
Oh, thunderer. . .

1432

from the Tarpeian rock.

Oh, Jupiter of Latium, seated
in lofty Alba and hearths of Vesta.

1436
02:14:58,173 --> 02:15:03,385
Oh, Rome, equal to the highest deity,
favor my plans.

The man who makes me your enemy,
it is he will be the guilty one.

He broke the barriers of war
and through the swollen river...

1443
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:31,372
...swiftly took his standards.

1444
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:35,209
When Caesar crossed the flood
and reached the opposite bank...

1445
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:40,089
...from Hesperia's forbidden fields,
he took his stand and said:

02:15:40,382 --> 02:15:44,802
"Here, l abandoned peace
and desecrated law.

General, from what we've observed. . .

maybe 70,000 men.

We're not in a position of strength here.

Give them to my captain to give to my
daddy when he gets back home.

2294

Here's my clothes and my blanket.
Anybody who wishes can have them.

-Mr. Smith.
-Sir.

Your instructions to the ranks: There is
to be no noise, l want no talking.

2298

Stragglers will be bayoneted,
let the men know.

2299
03:48:25,983 --> 03:48:30,445
No muskets are to be loaded until we
deploy for battle. Secrecy, Mr. Smith.

2300
03:48:30,613 --> 03:48:33,198
Everything depends upon
the element of surprise.

Sir, l'll convey the orders. No stragglers.

-Reverend.
-May we bow our heads.

2303

Dear Lord, heavenly Father,
you who know all things.

2304
03:48:51,384 --> 03:48:54,845
We face again a mighty
foe, a vast host.

2305
03:48:55,304 --> 03:48:58,223
An enemy more than twice our number.

2306
03:48:58,391 --> 03:49:02,978
But you have taught us
to fear not, to trust in you.

2307
03:49:03,312 --> 03:49:08,316
When the Philistines came before them,
the people of lsrael feared Goliath.

2308
03:49:08,484 --> 03:49:10,318
Their Army was in terror.

2309
03:49:10,486 --> 03:49:14,448
No one had the courage to stand
against the mighty warrior.

2310
03:49:14,615 --> 03:49:18,660
Then you brought forth David,
a mere boy.

2311
03:49:18,828 --> 03:49:21,788
And Saul armed David with his armor...

2312
03:49:21,956 --> 03:49:25,959
...and he put a helmet
of brass upon his head.

2313
03:49:26,127 --> 03:49:29,337
Also he armed him with a coat of mail.

2314
03:49:29,505 --> 03:49:35,761
And DaVid girded his sword upon
his armor and he assayed to go.

2315
03:50:01,245 --> 03:50:06,208
General Rodes, deploy your men on
either side of the turnpike, brigade front.

General Hill, you must keep the men
