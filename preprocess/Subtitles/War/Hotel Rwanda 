00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,078
<i>The latest ceasefire came too late</i>
<i>to save these villages...</i>

2
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:27,587
<i>Today President Clinton voiced concerns</i>
<i>at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...</i>

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,597
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,</i>
<i>why do I hate all the Tutsi,</i>

4
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,536
<i>I say, "Read our history."</i>

5
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,541
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators</i>
<i>for the Belgian colonists.</i>

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,601
<i>They stole our Hutu land,</i>
<i>they whipped us.</i>

7
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,772
<i>Now they have come back,</i>
<i>these Tutsi rebels.</i>

8
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,113
<i>They are cockroaches.</i>
<i>They are murderers.</i>

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,781
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.</i>
<i>We are the majority.</i>

10
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,383
<i>They are a minority of traitors</i>
<i>and invaders.</i>

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,296
<i>We will squash the infestation.</i>
<i>We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

12
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,858
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

13
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,030
<i>Stay alert.</i>
<i>Watch your neighbors.</i>

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,951
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

15
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,197
Thank you.

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,675
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

17
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,736
Wonderful. Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello.

18
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,946
Good to see you gentlemen.

19
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,101
That is a fine cigar, sir.

20
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,506
This is a Cohiba cigar.

21
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,515
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?

22
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,882
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

23
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,580
What do you mean, sir?

24
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,387
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

25
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,398
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

26
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,165
straight from Havana, Cuba...
Hey, that is style, Dube.

27
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,030
Style.

28
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,974
Cohiba... a fantastic cigar.

29
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,183
The best, eh?

30
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,916
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

31
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,824
I will try my best, George,

32
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,489
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

33
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,966
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

34
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,400
And money.

35
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,901
It's time for you
to join your people.

36
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,741
Thank you, George.

37
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,604
But time is also money.

38
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,783
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

39
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,683
along with the regular order.

40
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,486
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

41
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,692
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

42
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,031
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

43
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,869
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

44
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,643
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,481
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra.

46
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,542
Thank you.

47
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,620
A bargain buy from China...
ten cents each.

48
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,063
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

49
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,030
At least.

50
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,001
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

51
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,910
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

52
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,408
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

53
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,749
Their time is soon over.

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,788
Anyway, this is business.

55
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,391
- Oh, no. It's the Interhamwe.
- Do as they say. Pull over.

56
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,644
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

57
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,712
Smile, Dube. Don't attract
attention to yourself.

58
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,692
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,285
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

60
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,599
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

61
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,001
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,769
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power, Hutu power!

63
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,939
Okay. Yes!

64
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,580
Get out of here.

65
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,883
There's water coming from the box.

66
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,122
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

67
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,797
Gregoire, please help with this water.

68
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,300
Gregoire!

69
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,999
Deal with this right away.

70
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,201
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

71
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,143
Dube, this is the lobby.

72
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,842
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

73
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,883
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

74
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,486
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

75
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,190
All right.

76
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,997
But save the shells.

77
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,558
Fill them with...

78
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,667
...a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,506
- Cassava?
- And... the fish.

80
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,772
- And tipali.
- Yes.

81
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,612
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

82
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,672
Dube.

83
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,150
Style, sir.

84
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,686
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,620
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

86
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:13,893
that the Interhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

87
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,527
Colonel, the U.N. Need not worry
about the Interhamwe.

88
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,831
We will control them.

89
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,066
- General.
- Paul.

90
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,233
This scotch is exceptional.

91
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,075
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

92
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,011
Colonel Oliver,
it is a pleasure to see you, sir.

93
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,072
Good to see you, Paul.

94
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,676
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

95
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,722
It is spectacular...
straight off the plane.

96
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,690
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

97
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,748
Thank you.

98
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,728
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

99
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,230
Excuse me, gentlemen.

100
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,631
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

101
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,264
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

102
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,370
Good afternoon, ladies.

103
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,004
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,377
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,775
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,938
Hello, Mr. Paul.

113
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,147
Hello, Jeremiah.

114
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,818
Hello, sir.

115
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,290
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

116
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,525
See you soon.

117
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,564
So your brother
and the girls are here.

118
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,835
Yes.

119
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,067
One, two, three...

120
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,009
Oh, Carine!

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,648
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,148
One, two, three...

123
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,116
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

124
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,951
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

125
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,150
Hey, Papa, watch this.

126
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,625
Oh, my goodness. Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

127
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,393
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

128
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,561
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

129
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,764
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

130
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,101
Let's go in.

131
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,510
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,747
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

133
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,618
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc...

134
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,215
- What?
- There are soldiers.

135
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,852
- Where?
- On the street.

136
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,765
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

137
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,664
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

138
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,142
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

139
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,975
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

140
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,073
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any...

141
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,384
- What is it?
- Shut up!

142
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,115
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

143
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,157
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

144
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,086
No, Captain, you see...

145
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,290
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, Captain.

146
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,926
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

147
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,436
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi fuckers.

148
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,072
No! No!

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,471
We must do something.

150
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,236
- Do what?
- Call someone.

151
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,211
I'm not going. I'm not going.

152
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,303
No!

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,515
Get him in the truck. Now!

154
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,318
We must do something.

155
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,451
Please help him!

156
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,961
Oh, Victor!

157
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,519
Victor!

158
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,463
There is nothing we can do.

159
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,334
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

160
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,137
No!

161
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,036
Why would they arrest Victor?

162
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,146
He has no politics.

163
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,748
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

164
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,081
Who knows?

165
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,057
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

166
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,123
Happens all the time now.

167
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:44,093
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

168
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,361
It wouldn't help.

169
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,770
You could ask as a favor.

170
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,003
No, I could not.

171
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:58,146
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

172
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,085
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favors

173
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,782
so if there is a time
when <i>we</i> need help,

174
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,916
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

175
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,324
But Victor was a good neighbor.

176
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,695
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,565
Please, please,
leave these things to my good judgment.

178
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,686
This assignment is bullshit.

179
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,817
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

180
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,496
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Mille Collines.

181
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,795
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

182
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,699
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,965
Anything that you need,
please find me.

184
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,403
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

185
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,042
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

186
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,521
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

187
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,558
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

188
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,116
How?

189
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,527
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

190
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,656
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

191
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,258
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

192
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,667
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

193
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,002
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

194
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,337
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

195
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,206
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

196
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,611
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

197
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,979
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

198
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,052
So what are you, Paul?

199
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,952
I am Hutu.

200
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
Gentlemen.

201
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:53,656
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

202
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,031
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

203
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,539
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

204
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,441
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

205
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,511
They could be twins.

206
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,245
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

207
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,308
Okay.

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,590
I'm in room 22. I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

209
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,557
<i>Senior U.N. Officers claim that</i>
<i>the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

210
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,897
<i>and arming the Hutu militia</i>
<i>called the Interhamwe.</i>

211
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:34,406
<i>I put this claim to the head</i>
<i>of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.</i>

212
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,170
<i>No. No, we have not been</i>
<i>training the militia.</i>

213
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,235
<i>The U.N. Are mistaken</i>
<i>in this accusation.</i>

214
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,906
<i>Do you support your president's</i>
<i>agreement to make peace with the rebels?</i>

215
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>The president has</i>
<i>the full support of the army.</i>

216
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,510
<i>That peace agreement will</i>
<i>be signed today in Tanzania</i>

217
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,955
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces</i>
<i>and President Habyarimana.</i>

218
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,823
This is a great day for Rwanda

219
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,829
and for all of Africa.

220
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,559
Negotiation has replaced confrontation...

221
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,101
Paul, have a drink.

222
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,999
Friendship has replaced fear.

223
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,334
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

224
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,271
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

225
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,799
To our president.
May he find peace.

226
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,541
May we all find peace.

227
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:21,314
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

228
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,649
To peace!

229
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,847
Peace!

230
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,459
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

231
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,053
I am planning on returning there as...
Forgive me.

232
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,224
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

233
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,333
- Hello, Fedens.
- Paul.

234
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,599
Well, this is a surprise.

235
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,073
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

236
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,911
Yes, what's wrong?

237
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,811
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

238
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,007
Who?

239
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,917
Thank you, Sullivan.

240
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,586
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man.

241
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,717
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

242
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,328
Give me this man's name.

243
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,991
Please, Paul, even though
he is Interhamwe, he's a friend.

244
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,864
He wants your job, Thomas.

245
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,137
He said that
there is a signal.

246
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,835
It is "Cut the tall trees."

247
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,672
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

248
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,686
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

249
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,722
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

250
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,826
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

251
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,786
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

252
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,594
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

253
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,227
The world press are watching.

254
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,136
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work...

255
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,764
What was that?

256
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,343
Power cuts.

257
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,842
We are running on generators.

258
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,785
Fedens...

259
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,480
Please, don't worry.

260
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,392
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

261
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,791
All right?

262
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,491
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

263
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,293
Shit!

264
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,414
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

265
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,608
Everybody stay in your house!

266
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,441
Tatiana?

267
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,541
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

268
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,812
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

269
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,719
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

270
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,087
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

271
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,956
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

272
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,485
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

273
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,497
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

274
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,561
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

275
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,436
Odette, please.

276
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,940
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes. I told them to go home.

277
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,510
- Go and call them, Tatsi.
- I've tried. Our phones, they do not work.

278
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,883
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

279
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,553
You are a Tutsi.

280
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,928
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

281
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,072
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

282
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,975
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

283
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,005
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

284
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,346
Gone? Gone where?

285
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,115
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.
- Where has he gone, Elys?

286
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,314
He went next door.

287
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,055
Wait. Paul!

288
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,151
Tatiana, no. You have to
stay here with the children.

289
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,129
- Stay in the house. No!
- Please.

290
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,497
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

291
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,544
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,739
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

293
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,872
Paul?

294
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,677
Oh, Tatsi.

295
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,045
Odette, Odette!

296
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,112
Oh, no.

297
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,624
I'm okay.

298
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,092
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

299
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,391
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

300
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,864
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

301
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,626
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

302
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,266
Where is he hurt?

303
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,932
Look here, Odette, look here.

304
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,637
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

305
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,039
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

306
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,514
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

307
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,744
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

308
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,251
Roger, you're okay.

309
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,086
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

310
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,591
This is not his blood, Paul.

311
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,258
You are not hurt.

312
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,787
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

313
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,731
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

314
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,860
Come here, Elys.

315
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,428
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

316
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,275
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

317
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,073
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

318
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,841
It's okay.

319
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,075
I love you so much.
I love you.

320
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,231
Oh, son.

321
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,141
Paul.

322
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,739
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.</i>
<i>Terrible news...</i>

323
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,808
- It is true.
- <i>Horrible news...</i>

324
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,584
<i>Our great president</i>
<i>is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

325
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,646
Oh, my God!

326
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,559
<i>They tricked him to sign</i>
<i>their phony peace agreement.</i>

327
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,256
<i>Then they shot his plane</i>
<i>from the sky.</i>

328
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,601
<i>It is time to clear the brush,</i>
<i>good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

329
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,537
<i>We must cut the tall trees.</i>

330
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,041
<i>Cut the tall trees now!</i>

331
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,601
The soldiers are here!

332
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,648
- <i>Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.</i>
- No, no.

333
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,275
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

334
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,811
<i>Find these traitors.</i>
<i>Let none of them escape.</i>

335
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,453
Split up.
Everybody out.

336
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,029
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

337
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,132
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,376
I better go have a word with them.

339
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,440
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

340
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,538
Yes, sir!

341
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,311
Who's in charge here?

342
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,545
You.

343
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,393
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

344
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,363
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

345
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,491
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

346
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,659
Get out!

347
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,172
Get out of here!

348
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

349
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,233
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

350
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,575
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

351
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,080
I used to work at the Diplomat.

352
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,881
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

353
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,388
You must open it.
Let's go.

354
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,018
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

355
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,789
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

356
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,058
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

357
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,759
I cannot take all these people.

358
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,825
No, no, sir,
you do not have to.

359
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,700
We have our car
and our van.

360
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,468
- <i>Captain Kaliso, come on.</i>
- Roger.

361
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:41,002
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

362
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,377
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

363
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,149
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

364
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,987
Oh, Jesus, no!

365
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,423
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

366
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,699
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
Don't look, Tatiana.

367
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,004
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

368
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,714
Look at this. Beer.

369
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,129
I've got them.

370
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,304
Get down, all of you!

371
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:07,214
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

372
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,727
Traitor!

373
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,766
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

374
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,868
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

375
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,333
Shoot them.

376
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,937
Shoot them.

377
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,374
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

378
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,438
It's easy.

379
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,755
Shoot them, or you die first.

380
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,357
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

381
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,261
You wanna pay me?

382
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,732
Why not?
Look at them.

383
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,598
These are not rebels.

384
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:56,062
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

385
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,769
- How much?
- You name a price.

386
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,347
10,000 francs for each.

387
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,916
- Sir, I don't have that much.
- Okay.

388
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,958
Wait, wait! Here.

389
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,461
It's 1,000 U.S.
And here.

390
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,996
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

391
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,296
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

392
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,768
Go, go, go.

393
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,737
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

394
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,037
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

395
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,947
Sir, I have more money actually.

396
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,184
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

397
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,415
All right?

398
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,120
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

399
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,127
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

400
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,296
Here you are. See?

401
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,197
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

402
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,003
Sir...

403
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,512
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

404
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,452
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

405
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,511
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

406
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,057
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U.N.

407
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,789
Sir, I swear.
100,000 francs.

408
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,390
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

409
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,163
Please, sir. Please.

410
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,063
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

411
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,939
Come on now. Hurry.

412
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,455
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

413
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,861
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

414
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,266
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you...

415
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,980
Here's the money.

416
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,541
100,000 francs as promised.

417
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,587
Now please, let them go, sir.

418
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,885
Take the money.
We will get them later.

419
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,921
- You can go.
- Thank you.

420
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,124
Traitor.

421
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,998
Thank you, Paul.

422
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,343
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

423
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,779
- You must tell him when he comes...
- Here he is, sir.

424
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:56,344
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

425
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,390
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

426
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,583
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,424
<i>There were no survivors in last night's</i>
<i>plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

428
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,328
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

429
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,729
Come, Tatsi.

430
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,299
Andre, I need two suites.

431
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,669
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

432
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,938
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

433
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,975
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbors?

434
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,707
What will they do?

435
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,620
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

436
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:38,659
Please... put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

437
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,197
Right away, sir.

438
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,034
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

439
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,609
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

440
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,545
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

441
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,984
This mess is unacceptable.

442
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,114
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

443
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,423
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

444
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,622
Operator, I need a line.

445
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,567
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

446
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,535
You did not reach them?

447
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,805
No. No answer.

448
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,977
<i>It is a very tense situation,</i>
<i>and I just want to assure the families</i>

449
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,179
<i>of those who are there that we are</i>
<i>doing everything we possibly can</i>

450
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,814
<i>to try to ensure</i>
<i>the safety of our citizens there.</i>

451
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,120
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

452
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,888
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

453
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,522
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

454
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,497
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

455
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,898
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

456
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,170
Dube, where is Gregoire?

457
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,043
Sir, he has moved
into the Presidential Suite.

458
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,887
Mr. Manager.

459
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,855
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

460
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,297
Who is it?

461
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,501
It's okay, darling.

462
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,634
What do you want?

463
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,231
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

464
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,573
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

465
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,841
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

466
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:47,483
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

467
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,053
If I were to leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

468
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,321
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

469
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,298
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

470
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,503
Are you used to the smell?

471
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,407
Well, not me.

472
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,744
I need a clean room
to escape it.

473
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,786
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

474
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,155
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

475
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,818
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

476
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,125
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

477
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,031
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.

478
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,729
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

479
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,271
There are eight of us.

480
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,896
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

481
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,133
Yes, Madame Archer.

482
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,449
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

483
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,680
Okay, come on, let's go.

484
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,221
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

485
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,993
Come.

486
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,461
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

487
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,500
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly.

488
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,605
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

489
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,040
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

490
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,546
Madame Archer.

491
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,377
I have a favor to ask of you.

492
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,976
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St. Francis.

493
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,146
On O'Clare, 20.

494
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,214
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

495
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,316
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

496
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,024
Please, keep moving!

497
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,395
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,334
Please move into the hotel!

499
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,031
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

500
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,802
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

501
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,115
Has he spoken to you yet?

502
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,173
No.

503
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,957
Is your face still hurting?

504
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,162
It's all right.

505
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,439
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

506
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,241
I shouldn't have brought them here.

507
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,585
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

508
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,489
was to never, never lower
the tone of the hotel.

509
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,794
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul."

510
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,592
Soon all of this will be over.

511
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,266
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

512
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,302
Oh, my God!

513
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,573
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

514
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,601
Take care of them.

515
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,000
How, sir?

516
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,830
Bathe them, feed them.

517
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,574
Put them to bed.

518
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,341
I will send you some help.

519
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,949
Okay, babies.

520
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,553
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

521
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,116
Will the U.N. Intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

522
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,322
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

523
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,025
My orders are
not to intervene.

524
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,901
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

525
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,695
Here. Over here.

526
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,899
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

527
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,234
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

528
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,711
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

529
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,908
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

530
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,144
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

531
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,050
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

532
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:15,115
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

533
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,626
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

534
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,562
Let's go.

535
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,263
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

536
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,205
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

537
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,710
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

538
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,837
This is not a refugee camp.

539
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,108
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

540
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,447
No, I can't do that, Paul.
I'm sorry.

541
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,083
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

542
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,750
I'm under attack, constant attack.

543
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,727
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

544
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:59,364
<i>... and stop the Tutsi cockroaches</i>
<i>who try to run from justice.</i>

545
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,965
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge</i>
<i>called Makesa is hiding at 4...</i>

546
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,944
- <i>... Kabulla and his cockroaches...</i>
- Turn that radio off.

547
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,444
<i>Watch out for him. He</i>...

548
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,619
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

549
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,887
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

550
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,655
I am your boss!

551
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,068
<i>Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines</i>
<i>in Rwanda on line one.</i>

552
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,706
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

553
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,977
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

554
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,146
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr. Tillens.

555
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,986
Ah, yes. Paul, I remember.

556
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,821
How are things there?

557
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,191
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

558
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,727
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

559
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,826
until this unrest is over.

560
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,532
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

561
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:16,274
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

562
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,613
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

563
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,915
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

564
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,082
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

565
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,492
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

566
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,497
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

567
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,864
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

568
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,994
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

569
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,935
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

570
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,909
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

571
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,043
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

572
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,850
for you to perform your duties?

573
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,419
In fact, forget this letter.

574
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,558
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

575
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,401
Please, everyone, back to work.

576
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,241
Paul, thank you for coming.

577
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,845
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

578
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,786
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

579
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,055
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

580
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,620
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

581
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,132
Thank you, Paul.

582
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,699
You're an oasis in the desert.

583
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,266
<i>... the elements of</i>
<i>the government and army</i>

584
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,072
<i>are following the example of what</i>
<i>happened to the Americans in Somalia.</i>

585
00:41:54,144 --> 00:42:00,014
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,</i>
<i>try to attack us, and...</i>

586
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,713
<i>hope that the West</i>
<i>will pull all its troops out.</i>

587
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,187
- <i>Do you think they'll succeed?</i>
- <i>No, they won't.</i>

588
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,656
<i>The U.N.'s here to stay.</i>

589
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,386
<i>What about</i>
<i>the outbreak of violence</i>

590
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,428
<i>since the shooting down</i>
<i>of the president's plane?</i>

591
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,293
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

592
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,425
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

593
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,301
What is this?

594
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,235
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

595
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,635
Fred, it's David.

596
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,540
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

597
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,306
Dead bodies, machetes.

598
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,507
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

599
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,575
Yeah.

600
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,551
You have to lead with this.

601
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,852
I point at you, you do a shot.

602
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,921
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking...

603
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,024
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

604
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,862
Listen, sorry about earlier.

605
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,566
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have...

606
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:35,442
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

607
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,606
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

608
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:46,219
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

609
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,928
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

610
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,365
I think if people see this footage...

611
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,062
...they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

612
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,968
and then go on
eating their dinners.

613
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,873
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

614
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,609
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

615
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,913
Please enjoy your evening,
Mr. Daglish.

616
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,891
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

617
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,984
We've got trouble at the gate.

618
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,358
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

619
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,630
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

620
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,933
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

621
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,031
Benedict, what is happening?

622
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,043
They're killing everyone.
The lady...

623
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,875
The Interhamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

624
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,107
Come on!

625
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,640
Cover the road. Now.

626
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,077
Stand your ground.

627
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,047
Hold the line.

628
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,489
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

629
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,681
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,158
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

631
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:33,390
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. Soldiers.

632
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,898
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

633
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,093
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

634
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:43,098
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

635
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,663
They'll be here in a few days.

636
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,439
I understand that, Colonel, but there is
simply no place for me to put all of them.

637
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,877
What can I do?

638
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,314
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants.

639
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,550
- All right.
- All right.

640
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,416
I understand. Thank you.

641
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,493
Madame Archer.

642
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,859
Hello.

643
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,165
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

644
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,730
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

645
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,538
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

646
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,171
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

647
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,577
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

648
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,678
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

649
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,313
Okay.

650
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,153
But...

651
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:39,628
My brother and his wife...
did the old lady know of them?

652
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,769
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

653
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:50,364
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

654
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,935
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

655
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,743
I can't. There are
Interhamwe roadblocks everywhere.

656
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,477
When I reached the orphanage...

657
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,690
...the Interhamwe were there.

658
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,492
They'd already started
killing children.

659
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,890
They made me watch.

660
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,825
There was one girl,

661
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,530
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

662
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,503
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me.

663
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,005
"Please don't let them kill me.

664
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,946
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

665
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,784
Please, I can't.

666
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,328
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

667
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,906
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

668
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,440
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

669
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,612
We will get the orphans out then.

670
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,862
They're here!

671
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,608
They're here! We are safe!

672
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,008
Soldiers have arrived!

673
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,274
- Wow, look, it's the French!
- Yes!

674
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,179
Thank goodness!

675
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,619
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

676
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,847
Well done.

677
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,759
About time, gentlemen.

678
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,961
Thank you for saving our lives.

679
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,529
It's okay, Roger.

680
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,638
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

681
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,471
Yes, finally!

682
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,144
See, it's okay.

683
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,712
We can do nothing
from our side.

684
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,583
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

685
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,455
See? I told you. Yeah.

686
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,727
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

687
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,094
Something strong.

688
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,168
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

689
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,204
Congratulations, Colonel.

690
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,536
You have performed a minor miracle.

691
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,478
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

692
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,888
You should spit in my face.

693
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,285
Excuse me, Colonel?

694
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,157
You're dirt.

695
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,296
We think you're dirt, Paul.

696
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,299
Who is "we"?

697
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,669
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

698
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,971
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

699
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,568
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

700
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,943
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

701
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,780
You're the smartest man here.

702
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,812
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

703
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,790
You could own this freakin' hotel,
except for one thing...

704
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,190
you're black.

705
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,753
You're not even a nigger.

706
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,624
You're an African.

707
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,070
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

708
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,103
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

709
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:51,740
Please.

710
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,508
Got it.

711
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,678
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

712
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,623
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

713
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,091
What is it?

714
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,230
All the whites are leaving.

715
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,102
They are being evacuated.

716
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,041
But... what about us?

717
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,679
We have been abandoned.

718
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,739
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

719
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,251
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

720
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,550
I said all the whites are leaving...
the French, the Italians,

721
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,216
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

722
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,895
Who is left?

723
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,162
I don't know.

724
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:49,032
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. Peacekeepers for the whole country.

725
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,137
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

726
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,573
And they are not allowed to shoot.

727
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,251
I am a fool.

728
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,517
No. No, no.

729
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,260
They told me
I was one of them, and I...

730
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:18,524
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style...
I swallowed it.

731
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,866
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

732
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,240
And they handed me their shit.

733
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,704
I have no history.
I have no memory.

734
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,285
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

735
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,013
You are no fool.

736
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,654
I know who you are.

737
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,091
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

738
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,899
<i>A United Nations source reports</i>
<i>that the U.S. And British representatives</i>

739
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,599
<i>on the Security Council</i>
<i>will lobby for the removal</i>

740
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,268
<i>of all U.N. Peacekeepers</i>
<i>from Rwanda.</i>

741
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,765
Please, Jack.
Please don't go.

742
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,766
Wait, he's British.
Take out your passport.

743
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,500
Jack, please don't leave me.

744
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,635
Can we talk?
Just one second.

745
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,533
Please, Jack. Please.

746
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,205
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

747
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,816
Here. Now just take...

748
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,053
- Take this.
- No, no...

749
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,350
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

750
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,017
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

751
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,787
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

752
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,849
Paul.

753
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,359
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

754
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,424
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

755
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,833
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

756
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,838
We have to let him go.

757
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,014
Don't do that, please.

758
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,074
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

759
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,255
Wait! Wait!

760
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,801
Hold the buses!

761
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,066
Peter!

762
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,453
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

763
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,582
- No Rwandans.
- What?

764
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,492
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

765
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,156
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

766
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,722
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

767
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,631
Father, it is of no use.

768
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:09,035
These men are not here...
They are not here to help us.

769
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,766
Please, there is nothing we can do.

770
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,001
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

771
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,067
It is of no use, Father.
Please, hurry.

772
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,540
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

773
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,245
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

774
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,449
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

775
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,155
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

776
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,696
Go inside.

777
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,791
Go inside the hotel,
all of you.

778
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,200
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

779
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,102
Go into the hotel.

780
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,568
No!

781
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,446
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

782
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,696
Excuse me. Excuse me.

783
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,236
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

784
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,368
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

785
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,414
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

786
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,176
Paul.

787
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,925
I want you to go.

788
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,726
Go where?

789
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,530
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

790
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,764
- Your card says Hutu...
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,240
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

792
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,243
I want you to go.

793
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,972
No, Tatiana, no.

794
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,010
I will never leave you.

795
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,680
I will never leave you.

796
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,653
Oh, Tatsi.

797
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,831
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

798
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:06,945
Get up. Get up.

799
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,779
Get up, get up, get up.

800
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,416
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

801
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,123
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

802
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,389
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

803
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,760
It's an order.

804
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:27,259
I need some time...
20, 30 minutes... to take a shower.

805
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,936
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

806
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:38,007
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

807
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,141
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

808
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:44,209
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

809
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,483
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

810
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,584
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

811
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:52,821
Under the bed.

812
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,662
Roger. It's Papa.

813
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,633
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

814
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,999
Come, come. Come on.

815
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,570
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

816
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,908
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

817
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,504
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.
- The roof?

818
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,777
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now.

819
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,146
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

820
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,118
He is where?

821
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,249
No, that is unacceptable.

822
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,987
Who would order such a thing?

823
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,395
Yes, did you find the general?

824
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,301
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

825
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,963
Get me the guest list.

826
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,401
Yes, sir.

827
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,167
Yes?

828
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,182
<i>Sorry, sir, but I have a call</i>
<i>from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.</i>

829
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,184
Paul, are you all right?

830
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,776
<i>We have a big problem, sir.</i>

831
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:51,945
What?

832
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,148
The Hutu army have come.

833
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,783
They've ordered us...
all of us... out of the hotel.

834
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,622
Why are they doing this?

835
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,163
I think they will kill us all.

836
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,219
Kill?

837
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:07,529
What do you mean... all?
How many?

838
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:12,473
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

839
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,533
- 800?!
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

840
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,808
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi</i>
<i>and Hutu refugees.</i>

841
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,440
I do not have much time left, sir.

842
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,085
I want to thank you

843
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,453
<i>for everything that you</i>
<i>have done for me and my family,</i>

844
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,652
<i>and please thank all</i>
<i>of my friends at Sabena.</i>

845
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,720
Paul, wait.

846
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,062
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

847
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,000
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

848
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:45,370
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

849
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,937
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

850
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,445
Did you need something, sir?

851
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,916
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

852
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,110
Okay.

853
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,214
Paul, are you there?

854
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,047
Yes, sir.

855
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,855
Who can I call to stop this?

856
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,457
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

857
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:15,602
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.
