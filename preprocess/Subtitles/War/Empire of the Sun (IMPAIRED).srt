- Who?
- The Japanese.

483
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,772
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.

484
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:51,643
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?

485
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:55,210
If we stay in the camps,
the Japanese will look after us.

486
00:00:55,494 --> 00:01:00,124
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.

487
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,290
They'll fight the Americans.

488
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,769
RAWLINS: You admire the Japanese?
JIM: They're brave.

489
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,727
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.

490
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,970
We don't want them to win.

491
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:12,807
I know.

492
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:15,609
Remember, we're British.

493
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,243
Yes.

494
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:19,332
I've never been there.

495
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,212
Put that down.

496
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,532
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?

497
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:30,327
Think of it as the antidote.

498
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,769
<i>We are never sure of sorrow</i>
<i>Joy was never sure</i>

499
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:35,568
<i>Today will die, tomorrow</i>
<i>Time stoops to no man 's lure</i>

500
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:37,332
<i>With love grown...</i>

501
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,691
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.

502
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:44,523
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.

503
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:47,762
Those from the hospital garden?

504
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,965
I have to give Basie something...

505
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,642
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.

506
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,414
Because he only drinks boiled water.

507
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:59,410
You'll wear yourself out looking
after everyone.

508
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,722
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?

509
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:12,891
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!

510
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,210
Won't taste the same without you.

511
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:25,928
BO Y:
Wait for me!

512
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:49,443
MAN: What about mines?
- Get out.

513
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:54,728
MAN: Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!

514
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:58,492
- Boss, it's the kid.
BASIE: Come in.

515
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:06,965
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!

516
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:09,529
So would I. Have you got one?

517
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:18,292
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.

518
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,128
There isn't enough air for you
in China.

519
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,770
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.

520
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:27,044
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.

521
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:28,528
Good boy.

522
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:32,723
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?

523
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,812
- '45.
- '45? How'd you get that?

524
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:40,610
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.

525
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:43,772
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.

526
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,807
- What's that?
- It's a trap.
