Yeah, I heard that you were, like,
a gun dealer or something.

Pretty much. I mean,

which is worse.

The fact that you sell

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,402
- Thanks, man.

324

DAVID: So, I don't get it.

325
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,090
If there's an entire defense industry,

326
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,124
why would the Pentagon
want to buy anything from you?

327
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,931
They don't want to, they have to.

328
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,531
Remember Little League?

329
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,604
How, at the end of the season,
they'd give out that big MVP trophy

330
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,165
and that one kid would always win it?

331
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,646
Yeah, Evan Talbot.

332
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,286
Right. But then, one year,
somebody's mom complained?

333
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,802
Then they had to give everybody
a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

334
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,804
Even that fat retarded kid,
Robbie Friedman, got one.

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,002
That's kind of like what's happening here.

336
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,284
I'm still confused, man.

337
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,643
The Pentagon fucked up
when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army.

338
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,010
They gave all these no-bid contracts
to Cheney's boys, and they got caught.

339
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,686
So Bush started this initiative
to level the playing field

340
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,322
and now every Pentagon purchase,
every gun, every grenade,

341
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,246
every bullet, gets offered to
small businesses for bidding.

342
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,330
And sure, the big dogs
still get the big trophies.

343
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,847
But the Pentagon's
got to give little trophies

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world.

345
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,728
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid.

346
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,566
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded.

MAN ON TV: In a speech today,

349
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,568
President Bush said that
contrary to reports

350
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,684
he has no plans to attack Iran.

351
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,571
The President said, "That's ridiculous.

352
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,081
"We didn't even have plans
when we attacked Iraq. "

Yeah?

Yes. Yes, I do.

What are you going to do?

Jerk men off the rest of your life?

Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off.

Sorry.

Okay, good. Well, at least
you thought it through.

It's not funny.

Dude, I am so fucked.

David, look at me.

375
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,168
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq.

376
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,210
It's a fucking gold rush.

377
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,171
That's really nice of you, Efraim.

378
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,203
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

379
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,368
I've been looking to bring
somebody on for a while now.

380
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,040
The problem is, I don't trust anyone.

381
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
But you're my boy.

382
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,127
I mean, no offense,
but I'm against this war.

383
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,041
Me and Iz are going to rallies
and signing petitions.

384
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,890
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too.

385
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,605
I fucking hate Bush.

386
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,205
But this isn't about being pro-war.

387
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,448
The war is happening.

388
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,688
This is about being pro-money.

389
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,770
DAVID: The more Efraim talked,
the more it made sense.

390
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,928
Besides, compared to my other prospects,

391
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,487
this was the chance of a lifetime.

392
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,287
My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?

393
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,568
I think it's a great idea.

394
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,565
DAVID: So I lied.

395
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,525
You know I've always
believed in this business.

396
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,726
DAVID: I told her that Efraim
had great contacts in the government.

397
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,485
And instead of selling bed sheets

398
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,808
to penny-pinching retirement homes

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,480
we'd now be selling sheets
to the free-spending,

400
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,768
overfunded U.S. Military.

401
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,530
It's genius.

402
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,769
DAVID: I had to lie. Iz hated the war.

403
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,965
She had two cousins serving in Iraq.

404
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,525
She also hated the mountain of bed sheets
that were taking up half our apartment.

405
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,204
I spent the next six weeks
in a crash course on arms dealing.

406
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,323
The Herstal 556 light machine gun.

407
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,727
Belgian, but made under license
in lots of places.

408
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,725
DAVID: When it came to this shit,
Efraim knew everything.

409
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,089
Makes, models, weights, where it was made.

410
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,965
Remember, there's been an arms embargo
against China since Tiananmen Square.

411
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,081
DAVID: And if there was an angle to
be played, he knew about that too.

412
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,362
You have to read between
the lines with this stuff.

413
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,171
All the money is made between the lines.

414
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,286
DAVID: I'd spend my entire day
scouring the government's website,

415
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,161
searching for overlooked contracts
that we could squeeze our way into.

416
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
Hey, I think I got something.

417
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,770
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back.

418
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,405
DAVID: And then, in the middle of the night

419
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,841
we'd be back in the office,
working the phones.

420
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,361
Forging relationships

421
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,962
with weapon manufacturers
all over Eastern Europe.

422
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,766
No, David Packouz from AEY.

423
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,889
I told Iz we were doing conference calls
with sheet suppliers in Pakistan.

424
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,242
They called guys like us war dogs.

425
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,681
Bottom feeders who make money off of war

426
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,087
without ever stepping foot
on the battlefield.

427
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,162
It was meant to be derogatory,
but we kinda liked it.

428
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,125
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

429
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,484
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

430
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,041
Very nice.

431
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,682
DAVID: Ralph Slutsky
was Efraim's silent partner.

432
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,571
He was a local businessman

433
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,809
who owned 14 dry cleaners
all across Miami.

434
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,930
Why didn't anybody tell me
the mister is broken?

435
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,929
Ralph put up the money to back the deals
in exchange for 25% of the company.

436
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,327
Or at least what he thought was 25%.

437
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,802
We're doing God's work, Ralph.

438
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,809
We really are.

439
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,048
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel.

440
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,846
In my mind, this is not
a metaphorical debt.

441
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,209
DAVID: Ralph was under the impression
that Efraim was an observant Jew

442
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,851
who only dealt arms as a means

443
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,963
to protect Israel from her enemies.

444
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,804
Beautifully said.

445
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,447
Did you happen to catch
last Friday's Torah portion?

446
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,286

- EFRAIM: Same here.

447
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,086
It reminds me so much
of this story I once read.

448
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,965
About a young man traveling to Pinsk.

449
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,647
DAVID: And that was Efraim's genius.

450
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,202
He would figure out
who someone wanted him to be

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,290
and he would become that person.

Where did you find this guy?

DAVID: You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

457
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,046
EFRAIM: Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

458
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,204
DAVID: Yeah. He turned me
on to this company in Cyprus.

459
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,801
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard.

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,081
Henry Girard?

461
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,446
Yeah, you know him?

462
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,722
You spoke to Henry Girard?

463
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,167
A couple of times. Why? Who is he?

464
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,887
Dude, for the last 20 years,
this guy has basically supplied

465
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,447
both sides of every conflict
on the planet.

466
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,165
He's a fucking animal.

467
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,045
Really? Why is he calling me?

468
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,129
Because he's a fucking animal.

469
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,171
It's all money and it all matters.

470
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,124
Hey, mami, where are you going?

471
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,364
I'm trying to find my friends.

472
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,886
You want to make some money?

473
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,241
Excuse me?

474
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,847
I'll give you $1,000 right now

475
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,929
if we fast forward to our third date.

476
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,691
What does that even mean?

477
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,248
It means we just had a great dinner,
maybe met your friends for some drinks

478
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,249
and now you're about to blow me in my car.

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,405
- It's urgent.
- Yeah, of course.

642
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,447
And for the record,
I'm also his best friend,

643
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,166
so probably should have been
invited to whatever this is.

644
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,445
Look, these are her friends.
This is her dinner party.

645
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,768
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

646
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Trust me, you don't want to be here.

647
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,771
I don't want to be here, all right?

648
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,521
Now, what's going on?

649
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,444
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas.

650
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,962
- What? Why?
- I don't fucking know, David.

651
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,089
I dropped out of high school before
they covered international diplomacy.

652
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,241
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

653
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,761
- Who's that?
- Fuck, it's Santos.

654
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,007
He knows!

655
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,006
Pick it up, I want to listen.

656
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,646
- Pick... Pick up the fucking phone.
- This is David.

657
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,161
CAPTAIN SANTOS: Yeah, I just heard
my guns are being held up in Jordan.

658
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,370
Captain Santos, yes,
there's been a slight hiccup.

659
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,891
What are they even doing in Jordan?

660
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,121
DAVID: Not to worry.

661
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,687
They're in a hangar in Amman.
Totally safe.

662
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,571
My team and I are working
on a solution right now.

663
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,285
You didn't answer my question.

664
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,289
What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?

665
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,243
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli.

666
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,090
President of AEY, sir.

667
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,290
David has apprised me of the situation and
we are looking at options as we speak.

668
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
Options? What kind of options?

669
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,891
Well, are you familiar
with the Corvus TP1 9?

670
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,048
That's Brazilian and it's shit.

671
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,481
Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.

672
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,762
Sir, I need you to work
with us a little on this.

673
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,961
Let me get this straight.

674
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,491
I'm in the ass crack of the world,
defending your freedom.

675
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,603
And I got to work with you shit bags?

676
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,041
Look, I don't know

677
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,171
if those Berettas are really in Amman or
if you're just trying to goose your profits

678
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,569
like every other piece of shit
in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

679
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,366
Either way, you're endangering my mission.

680
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,607
I'm shutting you down.

681
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,484
I'm canceling you for cause.

682
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,244
DAVID: Getting canceled for cause
was a death sentence.

683
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,051
It meant we would never
win another contract.

684
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,770
Captain, please do not do that.

685
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,731
I know you're upset.

686
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,843
But from one Christian to another

687
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,129
my wife and I are having
serious financial problems.

688
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,370
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital.

689
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,767
Medical bills are through the roof.

690
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,205
If you do this, it'll ruin me.
It'll ruin my family.

691
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,521
As God as my witness,

692
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,648
- I will get you your guns.
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)

693
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,841
Hello?

694
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,767
What a fucking piece of shit!
Do you believe this fucking guy?

695
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
- Fuck.
- IZ: What's going on?

696
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,729
What guns, David?

697
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,443
IZ: Are you fucking kidding me?

698
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,200
You told me you guys
were selling bed sheets.

699
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,210
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too.

700
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,164
I thought you meant pillows!

701
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,371
Look, I can't support a kid
by giving massages.

702
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,369
Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets.

703
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,164
No, David, you lied to me.

704
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Because I know how you feel about the war.

705
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,563
I thought we both felt that way!

706
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,170
I'm five months pregnant!

707
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,249
And it's a problem
if I can't trust the man

708
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,521
I'm having a baby with!

709
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,848
- Of course you can trust me.
- Really?

710
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,805
Because five minutes ago, I didn't
even know you were an arms dealer!

711
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,605
I'm not an arms dealer.

712
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,330
What we do is perfectly legal.

713
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,768
We work for the government.
We're middlemen.

714
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,167
We don't touch the guns,
we don't see the guns.

715
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
We never even leave the office.

716
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,444
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
It's time sensitive.

717
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,806
David, do you have a passport?

718
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,529
What? Yeah, why?

719
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,961
We have to go to Jordan. Like, ASAP.

720
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,571
Straighten this shit out.

721
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,205
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

722
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,601
Yeah.

723
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,041
EFRAIM: Yo, you window or aisle?

724
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,043
- DAVID: Excuse me, sorry.
- Yeah, we just landed.

725
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,850
- DAVID: Excuse me.
- EFRAIM: The Embassy call?

726
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,731
Excuse me. Okay, bye.

727
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,050
- Sorry, kind of an emergency.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

728
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,969
Don't worry, I have to go first.
I'm American.

729
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,321
I'm sorry.

730
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,969
DAVID: The American Embassy
offered little to no help

731
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.

732
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,888
So we took matters into our own hands.

733
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,881
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

734
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,729
BOY: He says your permit has expired

735
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,406
and that you can't fly your crates
out of Jordan without one.

736
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,204
Yeah, we know. That's why we're here.

737
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,082
Look, we were told that
you know people in the government,

738
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,165
that maybe you can help us out.

739
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,886
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

740
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,971
He says it will take six weeks
to get a new permit.

741
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,003
Yeah, that's the issue.
We don't have six weeks.

742
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,770
We need our guns today.

743
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,485
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

744
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,411
Look, I don't want to come off
as the ugly American here.

745
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,161
And maybe I don't understand
the rituals of your culture

746
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,691
but this feels like the moment

747
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,848
where we are supposed to offer
him a gift, am I correct?

748
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,770
- You are correct.
- All right.

749
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,362
$1,400 U.S. Cool?

750
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,361
Cool, man.

751
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,684
Could have just started with that,
you know, saved all this bullshit.

752
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,881
I like your shades.

753
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,770
Tell him I'll give him
100 bucks for those shades.

754
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,166
Tell him in gibberish.

755
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,084
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

756
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,969
No way. Alligator.

757
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,049
Yeah, I know. I...

758
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,806
It's Lacoste. It's actually a crocodile.

759
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,964
I like fancy shit, that's my thing.

760
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,611
Tell him.

761
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,084
DAVID: For three days,
we didn't hear anything.

762
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,245
It was ridiculous.

763
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,525
Our entire business was riding on the word
of an 11-year-old translator.

764
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,443
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

765
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,811
We don't know that yet.

766
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,207
No! I know what it feels like
to fuck somebody.

767
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,641
I also know what it feels like
to get fucked by somebody.

768
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,251
And we just got fucked.

769
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,887
You need to chill out.

770
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,724
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

771
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,241
We're in a Muslim country,
I can't even get a blowjob!

772
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,005
It's embarrassing!

773
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,161
It's chaos here! Fuck!

774
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,251
(PHONE RINGING)

775
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,201
Yeah.

776
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,001
Right now?

777
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,525
We're coming down.

778
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,290
That was Aladdin. They're in the lobby.

779
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,721
See that? Come on.

780
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,081
Hold on. Are you fucking kidding me?

781
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,321
What's the problem?

782
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,888
You wanted your guns back,
he got you your guns back.

783
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,402
What? No, we said we needed a permit
to fly them to Iraq.

784
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,082
Exactly, but you don't need
a permit to drive them.

785
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,604
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

786
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,085
Why not? Marlboro is the best
smuggler in all of Jordan.

787
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,561
DAVID: Who, this?

788
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,406
This is the best smuggler
in all of Jordan?

789
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,725
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad
three, four times a month.

790
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,206
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

791
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,408
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

792
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,451
- Why are you asking him that?
- 800 kilometers.

793
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,846
And he knows what he's doing?

794
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,446
DAVID: Efraim, stop.

795
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,608
- 100% the best.
- EFRAIM: Come on.

796
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,684
It's like 500 miles.

01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,645
Even the AK ammo?

1123
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,530
Not a problem.

1124
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,566
You do know it's
100 million rounds, right?

1125
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,689
Henry has contacts in Albania.

1126
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,367
Albania?

1127
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,360
They spent decades preparing
for a Western invasion that never came.

1128
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,369
That country is one giant arsenal.

1129
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,528
It's all just sitting there.

1130
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,001
Tell him the best part.

1131
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,202
They're in the process of joining NATO,

1132
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,609
so they have to dispose of all
of their Soviet era weapons.

1133
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,049
They are literally dismantling it
and turning it into scrap.

1134
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,568
I can get most of the shit
for pennies on the dollar.

1135
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,570
Now, tell him the other best part.

1136
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,043
You're looking at the exclusive agent
for the whole fucking thing.

1137
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,130
DAVID: This was the magic bullet.

1138
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,247
One supplier who could
fill the entire Afghan deal.

1139
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,727
This wouldn't just put us in contention.

1140
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,087
We might actually win this thing.

1141
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,041
Sorry, I have a question.

1142
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
Sure.

1143
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,204
With that kind of hookup

1144
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,289
why don't you just bid
on the contract yourself?

1145
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,921
Full disclosure?

1146
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,762
I'm barred from doing any business
with the U.S. government.

1147
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,086
I'm on a watch list.

1148
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,486
Like a terrorist watch list?

1149
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,807
Mmm-hmm.

1150
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,402
- Got it.
- Wait, what?

1151
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,090
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

1152
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,482
- 10 cents a round.
- That's fucking amazing.

1153
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,721
And what about shipping?

1154
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,450
You can get Ilyushin 76
through Russian pilots.

1155
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,681
80K per flight.

1156
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,769
I'm sorry, you're on
a terrorist watch list?

1157
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,081
EFRAIM: What the fuck!

1158
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,282
Do you work for Homeland Security?
Relax, bro.

1159
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,404
You two should probably talk this over.

1160
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,126
We will. But we are very interested.

1161
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,601
Good. My flight leaves
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1162
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,802
I can't spend more than 48 hours
in this dump.

1163
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,920
That's what I always say.
Vegas is a two-day town.

1164
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,290
I was talking about America.

1165
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,963
We're talking exclusive access
to a stockpile

1166
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,527
of Soviet Bloc non-standard
weapons and ammo.

1167
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,364
That's going to win this deal for us.

1168
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,965
He's on a terrorist watch list!

1169
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,448
Whatever. People end up on that list
for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

1170
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,206
That's not why he's on the list.

1171
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,523
Look, the Pentagon wants
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

1172
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,161
in the middle of a worldwide shortage.

1173
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,527
Where do you think
they think that's going to come from?

1174
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,885
A bunch of shady motherfuckers
like that guy.

1175
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,488
This is the job.

1176
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,489
To do business with the people in places

1177
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,690
the U.S. government
can't do business with directly.

1178
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,010
It's as simple as that.

1179
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,646
Fuck!

1180
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,886
(KNOCKING)

1181
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,321
Hey, boys.

1182
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,171
So we discussed it,
and we'd like to move forward.

1183
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,404
Fantastic. Congratulations.

1184
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,722
- But we have to see the merchandise.
- Oh, of course.

1185
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,530
On site, in person.

1186
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,164
You guys ever been to Albania?

1187
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,891
Honestly, until last night

1188
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,764
I didn't even know it was
a real fucking country.

1189
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,570
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

1190
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,724
Come on in. I'll call my guy
and we'll set it up.

1191
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,608
DAVID: Albania is a lot of things.

1192
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,002
But a beautiful place is not one of them.

1193
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,565
It took us three separate flights

1194
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,081
and 22 hours just to get there.

1195
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,571
Henry's people sent a driver

1196
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,250
to pick us up at the airport

1197
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,091
and the guy would not stop talking.

1198
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,044
I fall over, she revive me.

1199
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,446
(LAUGHS)

1200
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,530
DAVID: But none of that diminished
Efraim's enthusiasm.

1201
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,922
He really believed
this could be the answer.

1202
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,406
(LAUGHS)

1203
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,605
Welcome, AEY.

1204
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,441
I am Yili Pinari,

1205
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,961
head of Albania's largest
military export company.

1206
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,447
Efraim Diveroli. Good to see you.

1207
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,131
This is my business associate,
David Packouz.

1208
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,964
- Glad to meet you.
- How you doing?

1209
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,647
Uh...

1210
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,286
Thank you for the sign.

1211
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,284
Oh. It's for you.

1212
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,330
Yes, I know.
I said thank you for the sign.

1213
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,771
So, show us what you got.

1214
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,485
EFRAIM: What is this place?

1215
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,642
YILI: Storage for the Albanian army.

1216
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,129
We have 700 more like it
across the country.

1217
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,322
DAVID: You have 700 warehouses like this?

1218
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,885
YILI: Not just warehouse.

1219
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,010
We use church, hospital, school.

1220
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,322
Albania is most armed country
in the world.

1221
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,284
EFRAIM: Hey, that's cool. Congrats, bro.

1222
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,369
DAVID: It was like
a fucking museum in there.

1223
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,165
Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight

1224
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,964
since the Cold War.

1225
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,810
But that didn't matter to us.

1226
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,207
All we cared about was the AK ammo.

1227
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,405
It's okay. We have plenty
of what you came for.

1228
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,526
All these containers
are filled with your bullets.

1229
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,009
What do you mean,
all the bullets are right here?

1230
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,491
126 million rounds.

1231
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,647
Fuck me.

1232
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
Yeah. Fuck us all.

1233
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,526
(EXCLAIMS)

1234
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,401
How old are these?

1235
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,724
30, maybe 40 years. AK-47 bullets

1236
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,042
can last forever if properly stored.

1237
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,050
Right. Well, how were these stored?

1238
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,611
Uh, who gives a fuck
how these were stored?

1239
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,080
All that matters is they fucking work.

1240
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,566
Do they work?

1241
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,206
You try.

1242
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,923
(INAUDIBLE)

1243
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,603
DAVID: They fucking worked.

1244
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,363
The entire defense industry
was scrambling over this deal.

1245
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,604
And the key to it was sitting
in 23 shipping containers

1246
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,124
in the back of a rusted out warehouse
on the other side of the world.

1247
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,770
DAVID: We got back with just enough time

1248
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,606
to submit our bid
before the government's deadline.

1249
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,400
And then we waited.

1250
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,966
(CHEERING)

1251
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,442
We waited five months.

1252
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,166
Pa.

1253
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,481
- (CHUCKLES)
- (BABY COOING)

1254
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,131
EFRAIM: David!

1255
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,287
- Is that Efraim?
- What?

1256
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,487
- Is it?
- David!

1257
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,080
We fucking won!

1258
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,766
Holy shit. We won the Afghan deal.

1259
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,485
- What?
- We won the Afghan deal!

1260
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,926
- We won?
- We fucking won!

1261
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,764
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

1262
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,962
- We fucking won!
- Yeah, motherfucker!

1263
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,326
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1264
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,281
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

1265
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,641
(CHUCKLES)

1266
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,486
DAVID: Before we could begin,

1267
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,883
AEY still needed to be vetted
by the government.

1268
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,485
It's a pain-in-the ass process

1269
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,165
involving three separate audits

1270
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,971
and an in-person interview.

1271
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,687
The audits were the biggest hurdle.

1272
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,531
I mean, we didn't even
have a real bookkeeper.

1273
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,722
We didn't have real books.

1274
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,368
We had to fabricate AEY's accounting

1275
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,409
going back three years.

1276
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,565
Ledgers, bank statements,
phony purchase orders,

1277
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,643
we forged it all.

1278
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,084
Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,

1279

1440
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,561
Why, what do we got?

1441
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,481
Let me get this straight. I'm in Albania
right now freezing my ass off.

1442
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,966
You're at Liv, trying to get laid?

1443
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,611
David, it's 1:00 a.m. here.

1444
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,285
I'm blowing off some steam.

1445
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,244
Yeah, 1:00 a.m. is when you're
supposed to be at the office

1446
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,131
because that's the middle of fucking day
in every country we do business with.

1447
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,561
Look, we got a problem
with the AK ammunition.

1448
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,481
- What kind of problem?
- It's Chinese.

1449
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,445
Chinese, bro?
What does that even mean, Chinese?

1450
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,165
It means it's from China.

1451
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,722
What are you talking about?
I was there, I saw the ammo.

1452
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,921
We both did.

1453
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,281
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you.

1454
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,680
They fucked us. Okay? We got played.

1455
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,611
Hold on. How do you even
know it's Chinese?

1456
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,610
There's Chinese writing
on every fucking crate.

1457
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,609
Trust me, it's Chinese.

for two days!

1462
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,201
It's Efraim and David.

1463
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,851
We have a serious fucking problem.

1464
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,281
I'm listening.

1465
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,648
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.

1466
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,729
What, you think the Afghans
who are getting

1467
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,003
shot up by the Taliban give a shit
where their ammo comes from?

1468
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,645
No, but the Pentagon does.

1469
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,365
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

1470
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,289
America has an embargo against China.

1471
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,246
You had your boys show us the one crate
of Albanian ammo in the entire country.

1472
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,886
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you
from inspecting the other crates?

1473
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,488
Did you even bother to ask
what the country of origin was?

1474
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,011
Who the fuck would ask that?

1475
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,086
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

1476
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,045
of illegal Chinese ammunition
that you sold us.

1477
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
What are we supposed to do?

1478
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,484
Do your fucking job!

1479
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,761
The U.S. government
wants to look the other way.

1480
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,007
Don't give them a reason not to.

1481
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,771
And while you're at it,
learn the difference between

1482
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,725
"We have a problem"
and "You have a problem."

1483
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,881
Fuck!

1484
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,607
DAVID: We were fucked.
The ammo was worthless

1485
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,889
and I was stuck in Albania
trying to piece together new suppliers

1486
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,481
from all over Eastern Europe.

1490

What the fuck are you doing here, man?

1491
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,841
I have a big idea.

1492
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,006
How did you get in my room?

1493
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,486
They let me in.

1494
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,645
I'm a trustworthy guy.

1495
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,531
Not only did they let me in,
they brought me room service.

1496
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,606
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea.

1497
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,326
Yeah? What's that?

1498
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,800
What if we repack?

1499
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,321
Repack what?

1500
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,521
The bullets!

1501
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,610
What if we repack them all?

1502
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,171
100 million rounds?

1503
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,131
David, it can be done.

1504
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,881
Think about it.
We'll also save a fortune on shipping.

1505
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,162
We trade out all the big,
heavy wooden crates

1506
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,925
for light cardboard boxes.

1507
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,202
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo.

1508
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,643
Look at this towel. Okay?

1509
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,767
Turkish. Made in Turkey.

1510
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,484
Not anymore. Now it's an Albanian towel.

1511
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,041
It's only Chinese
if the packaging says it's Chinese.

1512
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,927
Yeah. But I mean, that's
also fucking illegal, man.

1513
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,569
We have two options.

1514
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,041
We either repack this shit and send it off

1515
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,971
or we can walk away
from a $300 million-deal.

1516
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,130
What do you want to do?

1517
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,169
DAVID: When you put it like that
there's really only one option.

1518
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,481
Our driver Bashkim
introduced us to his friend

1519
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,047
who owned a boxing and storage company
out of Tirana.

1520
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,046
This is Enver. I grew up with him.

1521
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,281
Nice to meet you, Enver.

1522
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,201
You too. Bashkim told me
a little about your situation.

1523
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,051
Yeah, look, to put it simply,
we have a weight problem.

1524
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,208
We're shipping
a large quantity of ammunition

1525
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,129
from Albania to Afghanistan.

1526
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,765
Right now, it's packed in heavy tins

1527
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,166
inside big wooden crates.

1528
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,566
And what we would like to do

1529
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,564
is to transfer those bullets
into plastic bags

1530
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,211
and then put those in double-walled,

1531
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,765
corrugated fiberboard boxes.

1532
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,921
Do you know what those are?

1533
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,527
Yeah, of course. For what reason?

1534
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,961
We just told you.

1535
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,531
What the fuck is it with this country?

1536
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,646
The original packaging, it's too heavy.

1537
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,691
Too many crates. We need to streamline.

1538
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,249
Okay. How many crates?

1539
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,410
A lot. It's 100 million
rounds of ammunition.

1540
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,083
Understood. But how many actual crates?

1541
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,327
We have 68,520 crates.

1542
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,286
I've seen it.

1543
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,164
It's fucking crazy.

1544
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,961
Done.

1545
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,001
So 50 men, eight weeks.

1546
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,445
I can do it for $100,000.

1547
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,609
100,000 U.S. dollars?

1548
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,961
Yeah.

1549
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,324
- Give us a second.
- Yeah. One second, please.

1550
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,370
Okay. I'm going to talk very seriously.

1551
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,046
DAVID: It was hard not to laugh.

1552
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,204
I mean, not only was this guy
saving the entire deal,

1553
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,925
but by repacking all the ammo

1554
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,528
we would increase our profit margin
by almost $3 million.

1555
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,251
Where should we get dinner tonight?

1556
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,722
There's this place by the hotel.
It's pretty good.

1557
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,122
Okay. All right, go ahead.

1558
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,601
Okay, deal.

1559
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,123
It was even better than we thought.

1560
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,688
We were trading heavy wooden crates
for light cardboard boxes.

1561
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,645
Eight ounce tins for plastic bags.

1562
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,085
By repacking the ammo,

1563
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,886
we would lighten our overall load
by 180 tons.

1564
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,287
180 fucking tons!

1565
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,166
That meant fewer flights
using lighter planes burning less fuel.

1566
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,883
Which all added up to more money for us.

1567
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,927
On December 8th, 2007,

1568
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,361
AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds

1569
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,562
to the Afghan army.

1570
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,409
It went off without a hitch.

1571
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,362
Come on, just say it once, sweetie.
Come on.

1573
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,880
We really have to go, David.

1574
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,447
No, hey, five more minutes,
please? Please?

We're about to eat. My mom's waiting.

so that we can talk for a minute?

1580
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,601
I'm sorry, David.

1581
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,081
We'll call you in a couple days. Okay?

01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,647
All right, here he is.

1755
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,763
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1756
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,006
Hey, bro.

1757
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,922
Good to see you.

1758
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,528
Sorry things have gotten so crazy.

1759
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,730
Yeah. Me too.

1760
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,570
WAITRESS: You having anything, hon?

1761
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,808
I'll just have a coffee. Thanks.

1762
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,964
I've thought about it a lot.

1763
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,600
And I don't want you to walk away
from this empty-handed.

1764
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,801
Cool.

1765
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,611
So I had Warren draft up
a severance agreement.

1766
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,285
And I think it's pretty fair.

1767
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,411
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year
for the next four years.

1768
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,046
200 grand?

1769
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,524
Is this a fucking joke, man?

1770
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,084
Is this what you meant by mediation?

1771
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,560
In all fairness, there was never

1772
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,728
a partnership agreement,
no prior contract.

1773
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,971
Yeah. I have something better
than a partnership agreement.

1774
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,964
I have proof.

1775
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,680
Before I left Albania, I took everything.

1776
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,881
What the fuck.

1777
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,811
All the documents we forged,
photos of repacking.

1778
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,081
- David!
- Repacking?

1779
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,520
- He didn't tell you?
- David!

1780
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,131
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1781
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,164
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1782
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,211
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1783
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,085
Yeah, and we made
$8 million doing it, asshole.

1784
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,281
Careful, Efraim.

1785
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,930
We told Ralph we only made
$3 million on that one.

1786
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,121
Wait, what now?

1787
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,964
He sends you fake accounting
reports every month.

1788
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,844
- Oh, fuck off.
- I make them on my laptop.

1789
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,326
Now you're just making shit up.

1790
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,722
Really? Because I kept everything,
you dumb fuck!

1791
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,571
I even have copies of the bank statements
that we photoshopped

1792
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,807
and sent to the government.

1793
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,082
Get the fuck out of here.

1794
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,124
I can bury you.

1795

Us.

1796
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,364
I think you meant to say,

1797
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,882
you can bury us.

1798
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,202
Because anything that implicates me,

1799
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,881
implicates you as well.

1800
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,206
- Efraim, wait.
- No, no, no.

1801
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,961
I came here today prepared
to pay you $200,000.

1802
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,525
Now I'm not even going to pay
for breakfast.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

1804
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,844
Oh. What's going on over here? Huh?

1805
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,081
Hello?

1806
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,123
MAN: May I speak with David Packouz?

1807
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,322
- Yeah, who's this?
- Hi, David.

1808
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,603
This is C. J. Chivers
with The New York Times.

1809
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,451
I was wondering if you had a minute
to talk about AEY,

1810
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,962
and the alleged repackaging
of Chinese ammunition.

1811
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,085
I don't know what you're talking about.

1812
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,408
Well, according to my source,
there's an ongoing investigation

1813
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,601
at the State Department.

1814
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,444
And I was hoping
to get some clarification...

1815
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,888
David, this sounds pretty serious.

1816
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,411
Yeah, I know.

1817
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,124
Maybe you should call my uncle.

1818
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,086
The lawyer.

1819
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,651
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Oh, my God. Okay.

1820
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,444
That's a good idea.

1821
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,246
Hey, give me a minute.
I'll meet you guys in the lobby.

1822
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,721
You just get a call
from The New York Times?

1823
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,041
Yeah.

1824

01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,881
Me too.

1826
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,881
You know, Scarface was on TV last night,

1827
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,330
and I was watching it and thinking about
when we were little

1828
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,851
and we used to do the lines
from the movie.

1829
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,362
You're my best friend, David.

01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,481
Wow.

1834
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,048
Are you ever not acting, man?

1835
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,727
What does that mean?

1836
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,287
You just tell me
what you think I want to hear,

1837
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,481
because The New York Times called,

1838
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,682
and you're freaking out
that I might say something.

1839
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,486
Just admit it.

1840
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,208
We were never best friends.

1841
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,047
You were just playing
the part of my best friend.

Yeah.

- Fuck.

1852
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,007
all the lies we told the government,

1853
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,000
in the end, the thing that did us in?

1854
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,086
Yes, I'm trying to reach
the Department of Defense, please.

1855
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,886
Efraim never paid the box guy.

1856
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,047
To who do you report a crime?

1857
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,724
After Enver called the Pentagon,

1858
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,446
the State Department launched
a full-scale investigation,

1859
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,489
that went on for months.

1860
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,206
They busted Ralph at one of his shops
in the middle of a work day.

1861
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,643
He was horrified
and couldn't make a deal fast enough.

1862
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,084
All that bullshit about him wanting
to mediate a truce between Efraim and I...

1863
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,406
It was a setup.

1864
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,204
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1865
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,125
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1866
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,563
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1867
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,490
They had us dead to rights.

1868
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,370
It was pathetic.

1869
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,811
While going through Efraim's computer,
they even found a to-do list that said,

1870
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,082
"Repackage Chinese ammo. "

1871
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,486
The story tonight
that has Pentagon officials scrambling.

land a big Pentagon contract?

FEMALE REPORTER: Federal agents arrested
both men last week, charging them with fraud

1874

for selling outdated, defective
Chinese ammunition

1875
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,845
to the Pentagon.

with over 70 federal crimes

1877
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,567
and sentenced to four years in prison.

1878
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,762
I pled guilty and was sentenced
to seven months house arrest.

1879
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,403
Congress called the Afghanistan contract
a case study

1880
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,002
in all that is wrong
with the government's procurement process.

1881

In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again
to bid on Federal contracts.

It's okay.

If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

I had bad information.

When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

1912
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,605
was that a coincidence?

1913
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,249
What do you think?

1914
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,960
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

1915
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,484
Can I ask you another question?

1916
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,965
My driver in Albania went missing.

1917
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
Do you know what happened to him?

1918
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,926
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1919
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,764
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

1920
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,931
It's for you.

1921
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,768
No more questions.
