[Guide]
THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS, MADAM.

2
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,702
WORLD FAMOUS FOR BEAUTY
AND LONG, TRAGIC HISTORY.

3
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,704
BEEN CONQUERED MANY TIMES.

4
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:39,709
CONQUERED BY
PHOENICIANS, ASSYRIANS,
PERSIANS, MACEDONIANS.

5
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,215
ALSO CONQUERED
BY GREEKS, ROMANS,
BYZANTINES, TURKS.

6
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:49,719
PURCHASED FROM TURKEY
BY YOUR ESTEEMED SELF,
THE BRITISH EMPIRE.

7
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,222
ALL CYPRUS MOST
FOND OF THE BRITISH.

8
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,226
I'M AN AMERICAN.

9
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,729
FOND OF AMERICANS
ALSO. WE CYPRIOTS
ARE FOND OF EVERYBODY.

10
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,232
SHALL WE GO
THROUGH THE
CASTLE NOW?

11
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,734
NO, I'VE CHANGED
MY MIND.

12
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,238
THEN MAYBE THE TOWER
OF OTHELLO AT THE
HARBOR OF FAMAGUSTA.

13
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,239
IT'S INCLUDED
IN THE TOUR.

14
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:10,740
ALL RIGHT.

15
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,764

WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE

18
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,819
PRISON SHIP HAS
ARRIVED FULL OF JEWS
FOR THE CAMPS, MADAM.

19
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,321
WHAT CAMPS?

20
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,323
DETENTION CAMPS OUT
AT KARAOLOS, MADAM.

21
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,325
YOU SEE, THE JEWS,
THEY CHARTER A SHIP

22
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,327
FROM EUROPE TO
GET TO PALESTINE.

23
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,830
THEN THE BRITISH, THEY
CATCH THE SHIP AND SEND
THE WHOLE BUNCH HERE.

24
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,332
THE ARABS DON'T WANT
THEM IN PALESTINE.

25
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:45,335
AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE
BRITISH DON'T WANT
THEM HERE, EITHER.

26
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,336
BUT THEY GOT THEM.

27
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:47,337

STOP!

30
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,349
STOP!

31
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,351
GET HIM!

32
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,353
GET HIM!

33
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:09,359
MAYBE YOU CAN
BACK UP AND DRIVE
ME TO THIS ADDRESS.

34
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,363
HOUSE OF THE
BRITISH COMMANDER.

[Both grunting]

[Shrieks]

38
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,923
NOW, THEN.

39
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,924
GET HIS FEET.

40
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:15,925
RIGHT.

41
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,428
UP.

42
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,453
MRS. FREMONT?

43
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,957
THE GENERAL'S
EXPECTING YOU
IN THE GARDEN.

44
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,469
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. FREMONT?

45
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,472
I'M VERY GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

46
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,974
PLEASE
SIT DOWN.

47
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,477
OH, FOUND THAT HERE
IN THE GARDEN.

48
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,980
FROM THE COLOR,
I'D SAY IT BELONGS TO
THE BYZANTINE PERIOD.

49
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,484
THE BYZANTINES
OCCUPIED CYPRUS
FOR CENTURIES.

50
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,986
GIVES ONE AN
IDEA HOW TEMPORARY

51
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,489
OUR CLAIMS TO THE
WORLD'S REAL ESTATE ARE.

52
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,992
Y.
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ARCHEOLOG

53
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,494
FEW PEOPLE DO.

54
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,496
DIDN'T YOU ONCE
PUBLISH SOMETHING

55
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,997
ABOUT THE ROMAN
RUINS IN CHELTENHAM?

56
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,000
A VERY OBSCURE
SOMETHING. HOW
DID YOU KNOW?

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,002
TOM MENTIONED IT IN
ONE OF HIS LETTERS.

58
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,004
HE WAS VERY PROUD
OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

59
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,507
AS I WAS OF HIS.

60
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:41,511
WILL YOU HAVE TEA,
OR SOMETHING LIVELIER?

61
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,513
SOMETHING
LIVELIER,
PLEASE.

62
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,516
IS THAT ICE
I SEE?

63
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,017
SURPRISED?

64
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,522
TOM GOT ME
INTO THE HABIT.

65
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:56,025
NOW I USE ICE IN
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.

66
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,028
THERE WE ARE.

67
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,034
MAY WE DRINK TO TOM?

68
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,537
OF COURSE.

69
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,042
S
I'M EXTREMELY
SORRY CIRCUMSTANCE

70
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,545
COMPELLED US TO
BURY HIM IN THE FIELD.

71
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,548
EVEN SORRIER I
WAS TRANSFERRED
FROM PALESTINE

72
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,050
BEFORE I GOT THE
CHANCE TO SEE YOU.

73
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,555
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
IT TOOK ME ALMOST A
WEEK TO ARRANGE PASSAGE.

74
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,058
BUT YOUR LETTER WAS
WAITING THERE FOR ME,
AND TOM'S THINGS.

75
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,561
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HIM GO WITH US,
YOU KNOW, MRS. FREMONT.

76
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,563
IT WAS ONLY A
BORDER AFFAIR.

77
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,566
ONE OF THE JEWISH
UNDERGROUNDS HAD BLOWN UP
HALF A DOZEN BRIDGES.

78
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:40,570
R.
IT REALLY WASN'T IMPORTA
ENOUGH TO LOSE ONE'S LIFE FO

79
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,572
IS ANYTHING?

80
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,575
WELL, IN MY
OPINION, YES.

81
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:49,579
I'VE KNOWN MANY
SOLDIERS, MRS. FREMONT,
AND WAR CORRESPONDENTS

82
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,081
AND NEWS PHOTOGRAPHERS,
SUCH AS YOUR HUSBAND.

83
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,585
BUT I THINK PERHAPS
TOM WAS THE BRAVEST
MAN I'VE EVER MET.

84
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,005
WE HAVE A SAYING
IN INDIANA,

85
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,507
"THE BRAVER THE BIRD,
THE FATTER THE CAT."

86
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,509
PERHAPS.

87
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,513
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS
PHOTOGRAPH, GENERAL?

88
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,515
ST.
OF COURSE.
 IT WAS HIS LA

89
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,517
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW
TOM GOT THAT SHOT?

90
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,519
WELL, WE WERE
TOGETHER.

91
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,522
I MUST CONFESS, MY EYES
WEREN'T ON HIM AT THE MOMENT
HE SNAPPED THE SHUTTER.

92
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,525
K.
THE AIRCRAFT CAME IN L
OW. WE WERE BOTH IN THE TRUC

93
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,028
I JUMPED DOWN ON O
NE SIDE TO TAKE COVER,

94
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,530
AND TOM JUMPED DOWN
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

95
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,534
TOM COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
COVER AND PHOTOGRAPHED
THE PLANE AS HE DID.

96
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,039
I DARE SAY YOU'RE
RIGHT. HE HAD A STRONG
SENSE OF DUTY.

97
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,042
HE ALSO HAD A
STRONG SENSE OF DEATH.

98
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,546
I FELT I HAD TO
CONFIRM WHAT I SUSPECTED
ABOUT THE LAST PHOTOGRAPH.

99
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,548
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
TO YOU.

100
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,053
WELL, THAT'S OVER A YEAR
AGO. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
OCCUPYING YOURSELF?

101
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,554
AFTER I LOST
THE CHILD, I WAS--

102
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,056
THE CHILD?

103
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,560
DIDN'T TOM TELL YOU WE
HAD A CHILD ON THE WAY?

104
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,063
MEN LIKE TOM ARE
OFTEN QUITE RETICENT

105
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,565
ABOUT THINGS THAT AR
E NEAREST TO THEIR HEARTS.

106
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,535
I UNDERSTAND.

107
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,038
IT WAS QUITE
LATE IN MY PREGNANCY
WHEN TOM WAS KILLED.

108
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,541
APPARENTLY THE PALESTINE
TRIP WAS TOO MUCH.

109
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,544
I LOST THE BABY IN THE
HOSPITAL AT JERUSALEM.

110
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,549
AND THEN I WENT
BACK TO MY OLD
PROFESSION OF NURSING.

111
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,551
I'VE JUST COMPLETED
MY TOUR OF DUTY

112
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,553
WITH THE U.S. PUBLIC
HEALTH SERVICE IN GREECE.

113
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,056
?
VERY GOOD. WHA
T ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE

114
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:29,562
I HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED
YET. I MAY TRAVEL A WHILE
BEFORE I GO HOME.

115
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,564
I HAVE PASSAGE
BOOKED ON A FREIGHTER

116
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,566
THAT SAILS NEXT
WEEK TO ISTANBUL.

117
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,569
FROM THERE I--I
MAY GO TO INDIA.

118
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,071
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
SEE THE VALE OF KASHMIR.

119
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,074
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL SPOT ON EARTH.

120
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,577
MRS. FREMONT
, MAY I INTRODUC
E MAJ. CALDWELL?

121
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,579
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. FREMONT?

122
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,580
NK.
HAVE A DRI

123
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,581
THANK YOU, SIR.
I'D LOVE ONE.

124
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,082
O?
WELL, HOW DID YO
UR DISEMBARKATION G

125
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,084
SMOOTHLY.

126
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,587
WE'RE REALLY UP
TO OUR NECK
IN JEWS, SIR.

127
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,590
KARAOLOS BURSTING
AT THE SEAMS
AND MORE TO COME.

128
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,093
I STILL SAY WE
SHOULD SEND THEM BACK
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

129
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,096
SIR, 2 LOADS WERE
SHIPPED OUT OF HAIFA LAST
WEEK BOUND FOR HAMBURG.

130
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,098
I DON'T SEE WHY
WE CAN'T DO
THE SAME THING.

131
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,600
I SHOULDN'T LI
KE TO HAVE A HAND

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,101
IN SENDING A JEW
BACK TO GERMANY.

133
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,103
SQUEEZE THEM IN AS
BEST AS YOU CAN.

134
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,106
THEY'RE SQUEEZED IN,
ALL RIGHT. SHORT OF BED
SPACE, SHORT OF SUPPLIES,

135
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,610
SHORT OF NURSES,
SHORT OF TEMPER,
SHORT OF EVERYTHING.

136
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,612
MRS. FREMONT'S
A NURSE.

137
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,615
?
WHY DON'T YOU LEND
A HAND AT KARAOLOS

138
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,118
NO, GENERAL. I'M
AFRAID I COULDN'T.

139
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,622
I'VE REALLY BEEN
QUITE TIRED LATELY.

140
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,624
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

141
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,125
ABOUT THE JEWS?

142
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,627
I FEEL STRANGE
AMONG THEM.

143
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,128
IN WHAT WAY?

144
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,632
NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, I
CAN'T THINK.

145
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,134
IT'S JUST A
FEELING I GET.

146
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,136
K?
WILL YOU H
AVE ANOTHER DRIN

147
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,638
OH, THANK YOU, NO. I
REALLY MUST LEAVE.

148
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,141
I'M TOURING THE ISLAND
AND MY GUIDE IS
VERY FIRM WITH ME.

149
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,643
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

150
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,144
THANK YOU FOR THE

A BEAUTY?

00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,014
YOU MUST HAVE
TOWED IT ACROSS.

452
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,017
ALL RIGHT, SHE'S NO

NOT A BAD

NOT A GOOD ONE,
MR. MANDRIA.

WILL YOU NEED
SOMEONE TO OVERHAUL
THE ENGINE TANK?

STEAL IT. PAINT IT.
HIDE IT TILL
I'M READY FOR IT.

MAY I HAVE ANOTHER
SWIM BEFORE MY STEAK?

BECAUSE WE'RE DUE
BACK AT THE CAMP.

YES.

SHE IS NICE.

FOR ME TO TAKE
HER BACK T
O AMERICA WITH ME?

00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:36,551

WE'D BE GLAD TO
LET THEM ALL GO.

OF COURSE. EVERYBODY
LIKES TO GO TO AMERICA

I'LL CANCEL THE REST
OF MY TRIP, AND I'LL

AND IF YOU LIKE
IT, AND WANT TO,

TO GET YOU OUT OF CAMP.

00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,110
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, KAREN?

514
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,111
NOTHING.

515
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:40,114
YOU DO WANT TO
GO, DON'T YOU?

516
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,617
..
YES, BUT I MEAN.

517
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,620
E.
I MUST THINK
ABOUT IT A LITTL

518
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,622
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

519
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,123
.
I DON'T KNOW

520
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,627
.
BUT IT'S SO
IMPORTANT, AND I
NEED A LITTLE TIME

521
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,129
.
YOU KNOW, TO THINK

522
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,133
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU WISH.

523
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:02,637
KITTY?

524
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,138
YES?

525
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:07,141
.
DON'T BE MAD AT ME

526
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,644
OF COURSE NOT.

527
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:14,649
IT'S GETTING LATE.
YOU BETTER FINISH
YOUR STEAK.

528
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:27,662
FINE THING, WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO FOR KAREN,
MRS. FREMONT.

529
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:28,663
SHE TOLD YOU?

530
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,164
MM-HMM.

531
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:32,166
SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT HER FATHER.

532
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:36,170
VE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HER FATHER WAS ALI

533
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,174
WHEN KAREN WAS 6,
HE SMUGGLED HER OUT
OF GERMANY TO DENMARK.

534
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:43,678
AFTER THE WAR,
SHE WENT BACK TO
FIND HER PARENTS.

535
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,681
THE JEWISH AGENCY HAD
RECORDS OF THE DEAD.

536
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,683
SHE FOUND HER MOTHER'S
NAME ON THE DACHAU LIST,

537
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,185
TOGETHER WITH HER
2 YOUNGER BROTHERS.

538
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:53,187
ABOUT THE FATHER
THERE WAS NOTHING,

539
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:55,189
SO NATURALLY SHE HOPES
HE IS STILL ALIVE.

540
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:59,193
MAYBE IN PALESTINE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS SUCH A POSSIBILITY.

541
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,195
HE WAS A VERY
IMPORTANT SCIENTIST

542
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,197
AND THE NAZIS COULD
HAVE SPARED HIS LIFE

543
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:06,701
IN ORDER TO USE HIS BRAIN.
BUT, OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS?

544
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,706
.
IT'S CURIOUS THA
T SHE DIDN'T MENTION
HER FATHER TO ME

545
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,208
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING ABOUT
THESE CHILDREN.

546
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:18,212
THEIR PAST IS SCARRED.
THEY'RE ASHAMED OF IT.

547
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,214
TO HAVE A PARENT WHO
HAS BEEN PERSECUTED,

548
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:22,717
OR KILLED IN A
CONCENTRATION CAMP

549
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:26,721
IS A REPROACH TO THEM.
THEY FEEL GUILTY
FOR HAVING SURVIVED,

550
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,725
SO THEY PRETEND THE BAD
THINGS NEVER HAPPENED.

551
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:34,729
TO TAKE SUCH A CHILD IS
A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY...

552
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,230
...EVEN A SACRIFICE.

553
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,232
WELL, IT'S NO SACRIFICE.

554
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:42,236
I'M ALONE. THE INSURANCE
I GOT AFTER THE DEATH OF M
Y HUSBAND IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

555
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,739
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN A
FINANCIAL SACRIFICE,

556
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,741
ALTHOUGH IT'S
ALWAYS A GOOD THING
TO HAVE MONEY.

557
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:51,746
NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS,
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE A
SACRIFICE OF YOURSELF.

558
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,248
THESE CHILDREN WHO
HAVE LOST EVERYTHING

559
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,251
SPEND THEIR LIVES
SEARCHING FOR A NEW PARENT.

560
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:59,253
THEIR NEED REACHES
OUT TO YOUR HEART

561
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:01,756
AS NATURALLY AS A
FLOWER TURNS TO THE SUN.

562
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,257
AND THEY TRAP YOU.

563
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,760
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
SO LONG WITHOUT LOVE,

564
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,262
THEY--THEY DEMAND ALL
THE LOVE YOU HAVE.

565
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:11,766
KAREN WILL DRAIN
YOU OF LOVE.
SHE'LL EXHAUST YOU.

566
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,770
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED.

567
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:24,779
I'D LIKE TO GO
WITH YOU, KITTY.

00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,264
[Sutherland]
FROM WHAT COMMAND?

744
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,266
23RD GT COMPANY, SIR.

745
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,769
IS ANYTHING IRREGULAR?

746
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,270
COULD BE.

747
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,274
WE DON'T LIST A 23RD
GT COMPANY ON CYPRUS.

748
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,776
YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT.

749
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,279
YES, I SHOULD.

750
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,281
WELL, PERHAPS
I MADE AN ERROR.

751
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,283
OH, IT'S HUMAN.

752
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:16,787
WHO ISSUED CAPT.
BOWEN'S ORDERS?

753
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,790
THEY ORIGINATED WITH BRADSHAW
OF THE COLONIAL OFFICE.

754
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,291
AND, OF COURSE,
YOU SIGNED THEM.

755
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,794
[Sutherland]
YOU EXAMINED
THE SIGNATURES?

756
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,796
WELL, NATURALLY,
AND I COUNTERS...

757
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,297
I SIGNED NO SUCH
ORDER, FRED.

758
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,801
NEITHER HAVE I
SEEN SUCH AN ORDER
FROM THE COLONIAL OFFICE.

759
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,803
WELL...

760
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,807
WELL, THOSE SIGNATURES
MUST'VE BEEN...FORGED?

761
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,811
WE CAN'T EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY. WITH ONE
EXCEPTION, OF COURSE.

762
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,313
YOUR SIGNATURE WAS
GENUINE, WASN'T IT?

763
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,816
SOMEONE HAD TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY, SIR.

764
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,819
AND YOU TOOK IT.
NOW YOU'VE GOT IT.

765
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,321
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE
TO DO WITH IT?

766
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,826
THAT BOAT...

767

SHE'S NOT GOING TO
HAMBURG. SHE'S PROBABLY

UNDOUBTEDLY.

TELL THEM TO
BLOCK THE HARBOR.

771

I'M ASKING LONDON

IF SHE STAYS WHERE SHE
IS, NO ONE WILL MOLEST HER.

805
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,451
THEY'VE THREATENED TO DYNAMITE
THE OLYMPIA IF WE BOARD HER.

806
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,954
DO YOU THINK
THEY MEAN IT?

807
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,956
P
NEARLY 2 YEARS
AGO, A HAGANAH SHI

P. 236 REFUGEES DIED.

GENERAL, I SIMPLY MUST
GET KAREN OFF THE SHIP.

811
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,969
WOULD YOU CARE TO GO
ON BOARD THE OLYMPIA

812
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,471
AND LEARN FROM THE CHI
LD EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED?

813
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,973
WILL THEY LET ME?

814
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,474
I'LL TRY A
ND ARRANGE IT.

815

N.
IF I SUCCEED,
YOU CAN DO ME
A FAVOR IN RETUR

I'LL DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

AT A PRESS CONFERE

SEND THIS EVERY 10 MINUTES,
AND KEEP ON SENDING IT.

825
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,003
COULD WE INTERRUPT,
PLEASE?

826
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,504
YES.

827
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,008
.
THIS IS DR. DE VRIES.
WE ELEVATED OURSELVES
INTO A MEDICAL COMMITTEE

828
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,509
GOOD.

829
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,011
IT'S OUR OPINION
THE SANITARY
ARRANGEMENTS

830
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,513
ON THIS SHIP
ARE HOPELESSLY
INADEQUATE.

831
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:07,017
UNLESS WE MAKE SOME
ADDITIONAL BATHING AND
TOILET FACILITIES,

832
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,019
WE'LL HAVE A
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM.

833
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,021
ALL RIGHT, DOC,
WE'LL TRY TO TAKE
CARE OF IT.

834
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,025
THERE HE IS. THIS
IS MRS. FREMONT,
FROM GEN. SUTHERLAND.

835
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:16,526
HOW DO YOU DO?

836
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,028
HANK?
YEAH.

837
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:21,031
K?
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH
SCRAP LUMBER TO
BUILD PRIVIES ON DEC

838
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,532
I GUESS SO.

839
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,534
10-HOLERS.
KNOCK SOME SHOWERS
TOGETHER, TOO.

840
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,535
OK.

841
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,037
ANYTHING ELSE?

842
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,539
NOT FOR THE
PRESENT, THANK YOU.

843
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,041
THIS ONE TO HAIFA.

844
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,044
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

845
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,545
YES, CAPTAIN.

846
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,049
"YES, CAPTAIN." HIS
MAJESTY'S JEWISH BRIGADE.

847
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:43,053
NORTH AFRICA, SYRIA,
LEBANON AND PALESTINE.
THE DECORATIONS ARE REAL.

848
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,056
IS THAT WHAT SUTHERLAND
SENT YOU TO FIND OUT?

849
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:50,060
YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT THE
GIRL. SHE'S NOT AT THE
CAMP, SHE'S ON THIS SHIP.

850
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,062
AND YOU FORCED
HER TO COME ABOARD.

851
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,563
WE DON'T FORCE
ANYBODY. TEL AVIV YET?

852
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,065
NO.

853
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,066
GO ON.

854
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,068
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING.

855
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,071
I HEARD EVERY WORD YOU
SAID. I LIED TO YOU ABOUT
THE GIRL. WHAT ELSE?

856
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,073
I'M GOING TO TAKE HER
OFF THIS DEATH TRAP.

857
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,075
DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT
YOU'LL DO ON THIS SHIP.

858
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,077
YOU'LL DO EXACTLY
WHAT I TELL YOU
YOU CAN DO.

859
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,078
TEL AVIV
BEGINNING
TO SEND.

860
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,080
FINE.

861
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,582
ASSUMING WE'VE GOT THE
GIRL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE WANTS TO GET OFF?

862
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,585
I AM TRYING TO
SAVE A JEWISH CHILD.

863
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,089
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY
RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE?

864
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,092
DON'T EXPECT ME TO GET
HYSTERICAL OVER THE LIFE
OF ONE JEWISH CHILD

865
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,594
AND DON'T YOU GET
HYSTERICAL, EITHER.

866
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,597
YOU'RE LATE, LADY.
YOU'RE 10 YEARS LATE.

867
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,600
ALMOST 2 MILLION
JEWISH CHILDREN WERE
BUTCHERED LIKE ANIMALS

868
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,102
BECAUSE NOBODY
WANTED THEM.

869
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,105
NO COUNTRY WOULD HAVE
THEM. NOT YOUR COUNTRY
OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY.

870
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,608
AND NOBODY WANTS
THE ONES WHO SURVIVED.

871
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,111
JEWISH FLESH IS CHEAP, LADY.
IT IS CHEAPER THAN BEEF.

872
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,113
IT IS CHEAPER,
EVEN, THAN HERRING.

873
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,615
YOU AND YOUR RESPECT...

874
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,118
TEL AVIV
COMPLETE NOW.

875
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,620
IF YOU CAN FIND THE
GIRL, IF SHE WANTS
TO GO WITH YOU,

876
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,123
TAKE HER. TAKE A
DOZEN IF YOU WANT TO.

KITTY!
KITTY!

880
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,165
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
I COULDN'T EVEN
LEAVE YOU A NOTE.

881
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,667
I HAD TO GO, KITTY
, TO FIND MY FATHER.

882
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,171
...
WHEN YOU ASKED ME
TO GO TO AMERICA,
I DIDN'T KNOW, AND

883
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:44,174
.
OH, KITTY, WE'RE
GOING TO PALESTINE

884
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,177
KAREN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN PALESTINE.

885
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,679
AND THE BRITISH WON'T
LET YOU GO, ANYHOW.

886
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,432
THEY'LL HAVE TO, KITTY.
THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO.

887
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:55,936
.
BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING BACK T
O KARAOLOS, NOT EVER

888
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:58,438
THEN LET ME TAKE
YOU TO PALESTINE.
I CAN FIND A WAY.

889
00:50:58,939 --> 00:50:59,940

GEN. SUTHERLAND
CALLING THE OLYMPIA.

THIS IS THE EXODUS.
COME IN, GENERAL.

899
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,968
I HAVE RECEIVED

I COULDN'T

911
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:55,996
IT'S--IT'S LIKE LEAVING
YOUR FAMILY WHEN
THINGS ARE BAD.

912
00:51:57,998 --> 00:51:58,999
I KNOW.

913

IF YOU WANT ANYTHING,
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW?

THEY'RE JUST GOING
TO TURN THIS SHIP

917
00:52:17,017 --> 00:52:18,518
INTO ANOTHER
CONCENTRATION CAMP.

[Man]
GO BACK? NONSENSE.

919
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:29,029
[Man]
DID WE ESCAPE FOR
JUST OURSELVES ALONE? NO.

920
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:33,033
WE'VE DONE IT FOR
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF JEWS ALL OVER EUROPE

WHO COULDN'T GET OUT.

I WANT YOUR ATTENTION

HEARD GEN. SUTHERLAND
ON THE LOUDSPEAKER.

MAKE A DECISION.

926

YOU CAN GO BACK
TO KARAOLOS...

927
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:51,551
THE ONLY WAY TO
GO BACK TO KARAOLOS
IS BY CRAWLING!

928
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,553
...OR YOU CAN STAY
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

929
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:57,057
WHO ARE YOU MAKING
THE PROPAGANDA FOR?
THEM OR US?

[Crowd cheering]

931
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,064
QUIET, PLEASE.
THERE'S ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY.

932
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,566
YOU WERE PICKED BY
HAGANAH FOR THIS SHIP

933
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:08,568
SO THAT YOUR
ESCAPE TO PALESTINE

934
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,570
WOULD HAVE SOME
MEANING TO THE WORLD.

935
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:13,073
NOW, IF YOU STILL WANT IT
TO HAVE SOME MEANING,

936
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:15,075
IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO
FINISH WHAT WE BEGAN,

937
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:17,077
YOU CAN GO ON A
HUNGER STRIKE.

938
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:19,579
[Man]
NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO MAKE A LITTLE SENSE!

939
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,084
WE SHALL TELL TO THE BRITISH,
"WE SPIT ON YOUR FOOD."

WE ARE GOING TO PALESTINE,

LISTEN. LISTEN, PLEASE.

946
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,107
NOW JUST STOP AND
THINK FOR A MINUTE.

947
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:49,109
TO GO ON A
HUNGER STRIKE

948
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:51,111
IS A VERY
SERIOUS BUSINESS,

949
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,113
BECAUSE ONCE YOU STRIKE

950
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:55,615
IT CAN ONLY END
WHEN YOU HAVE WON
OR WHEN YOU ARE DEAD.

951
00:53:55,615 --> 00:54:00,120
WHAT IS SO UNUSUAL
ABOUT THE JEWS DYING?
IS THAT ANYTHING NEW?

952
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,123
I STAY RIGHT HERE.

953
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:06,126
THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR US TO GO ON LIVING

954
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:09,129
UNLESS WE START
FIGHTING RIGHT NOW.

955
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:12,132
SO THAT EVERY JEW ON
THE FACE OF THE EARTH

956
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:15,135
CAN BEGIN TO START FEELING
LIKE A HUMAN BEING AGAIN.

957
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:17,137
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

958
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:19,139
FIGHT, NOT BEG!

959
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:20,640

WAIT A MINUTE, PLEASE.

EVERYBODY ABOARD THIS SHIP

963
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,153
AGREED TO ACCEPT
HAGANAH DISCIPLINE.

964
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,655
I AM NOW GIVING AN ORDER.

965
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,657
WE WILL SIT DOWN

966
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:41,161
AND WE WILL MAINTAIN
SILENCE FOR 20 MINUTES.

967
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,164
EACH ONE OF US WILL
LISTEN TO HIS OWN HEART

968
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,666
AND TO HIS BRAIN, TOO.

969
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,668
AND THEN WE WILL VOTE.

970
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:52,172
WE WILL NOW MAINTAIN SILENCE.

971
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,689
I SAW THE PEOPLE
ON THAT SHIP.

972
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,693
THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS.
THEY'RE JUST POOR,
MISERABLE PEOPLE.

973
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,196
WHY CAN'T YOU
LET THEM GO?

00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:18,198
YOU MUST UNDERSTAN
D THAT WE BRITISH

975
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,699
HAVE SHOWN
, THROUGHOUT
OUR HISTORY,

976
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,204
AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT
FOR TROUBLESOME
COMMITMENTS.

977
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:27,707
S

A BRITISH MANDAT
E IMPOSED UPON U

BY THE LEAGUE OF NATIO

RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING
PEACE IN THE AREA.

WON'T KEEP THE PEA

.
IF WE ALLOW FURTHE
R JEWISH IMMIGRATION

982
00:55:37,717 --> 00:55:40,220
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE MANDATE,

983
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,224
BUT I DO KNOW THE
JEWS WERE PROMISED A
HOMELAND IN PALESTINE.

984
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:48,228
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR
, BRITAIN NEEDED AND
ACCEPTED JEWISH SUPPORT

985
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,230
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

986
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,731
BUT IN RETURN,

987
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:55,735
E.
THE BALFOUR
DECLARATION OF 1917
MADE SUCH A PROMIS

988
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:59,239
THAT PROMISE WAS RECONFIRMED
DURING WORLD WAR II.

FOUGHT WITH US.

THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS D

992
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:09,749
HOW CAN YOU PROMISE SOMETHING
AND THEN NOT DELIVER IT?

993
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:13,253
.
ENGLAND WAS FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE IN 1917

994
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:16,756
NATIONS ARE VERY LIKE PEOPLE
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.

995
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:20,260
THEY MAKE PROMISES
THEY'RE NOT IMMEDIATELY
ABLE TO FULFILL.

996
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,263
DURING THAT SAME CRISIS,
WE MADE THE ARABS
CERTAIN ASSURANCES.

997
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:26,266
HENCE, THEY HAVE
THEIR CLAIMS, TOO.

998
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:30,270
THE ARABS ARE FANATICS
ON THE SUBJECT OF
JEWISH IMMIGRATION.

999
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,772
JUST NOW, WE
NEED THEIR GOODWILL.

1000
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:34,274
HOW IS IT EVER
GOING TO END?

1001
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:36,276
I DON'T KNOW.

1002
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:39,279
THE WHOLE QUESTION NOW I
S BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS.

1003
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,281
.
I HOPE THEY SOLVE IT

1004
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:45,285
THE SOONER I STOP
OPERATING DETENTION CAMPS,
THE HAPPIER I'LL BE.

1005

00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,842
ON THE OTHER HAND,
EVERYONE MUST
WASH HIS BODY DAILY.

1041
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,344
.
THIS WILL BE
DONE WITH SEAWATER

1042
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:12,849
YOUR PLATOON LEADER WILL CALL
WHEN YOUR TURN COMES.

1043
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,853
IT IS ADVISED TO
CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY.

1044
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:20,356
SO ALL
NECESSARY PHYSICAL WORK
SHOULD BE DIVIDED

1045
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,360
.
AMONG AS MANY
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE

IF AT ANY TIME YOU
SHOULD FEEL LIGHTHEADE

00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,865
OR DIZZY, DO NOT
BE FRIGHTENED.

1048
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,367
IT IS, IN NO
RESPECT, SERIOUS.

1049
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:36,372
.
JUST SIT DOWN
AND LOWER YOUR HEA
D BETWEEN YOUR KNEES

1050
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,875
.
ALL OF US, OF COURSE,
FEEL STOMACH PANGS

1051
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,878
THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE,
BUT NOT DANGEROUS.

1052
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:42,879
THAT'S RIGHT.

1053
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,881
FINAL POINT,

1054
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:48,384
PEOPLE CAN LIVE A
LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD,
A VERY LONG TIME.

ALWAYS, DR. ODENHEIM.
WHAT CAN I DO?

1088
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,292
E,
WE MADE A MISTAK

1089
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:22,795
A BAD MISTAKE IN
LETTING THE CHILDR
EN BE A PART OF THIS.

THEIR BLOOD
REQUIRES MORE SUGAR.

WHAT SHOULD WE
DO ABOUT IT?

FOOD FROM US, THEY WON'T
ACCEPT IT FROM YOU EITHER.

THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE DYING FOR.

1187
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:15,648
JUST TO CALL
ATTENTION TO ISRAEL

1188
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:19,652
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
SEEN IT THEMSELVES.

1189
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:22,154
DOES THE VULGARITY
OF IT SHOCK YOU?

1190
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:25,157
[Sighs]

1191
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:28,661
YOU CAN'T FIGHT TH
E WHOLE BRITISH EMPIRE
WITH 600 PEOPLE.

1192
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,162
IT ISN'T
POSSIBLE.

1193
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,164
HOW MANY MINUTEMEN
DID YOU HAVE AT CONCORD
THE DAY THEY FIRED

1194
01:07:32,665 --> 01:07:34,166
THE "SHOT HEARD
ROUND THE WORLD"?

1195
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,167

I DON'T KNOW

I WISH YOU
COULD WIN.

1199
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:47,179
I WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO HAVE A
COUNTRY OF YOUR OWN.

BUT IT ISN'T

CAN NEVER HAPPEN

1203
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,187
E.
I KNOW. I'VE
BEEN IN PALESTIN

1204
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:57,690
WHEN WERE
YOU THERE?

1205
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,692
.
A YEAR AGO

1206
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:04,196
MR. BEN CANAAN, EVEN
IF YOU GET A PARTITI
ON AND A FREE JEWISH STATE,

1207
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:07,199
THE ARABS WON'
T LET YOU KEEP IT.

1208
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,703
500,000 JEWS
AGAINST 50 MILLION
ARABS?

1209
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:12,705
YOU CAN'T WIN.

1210
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,210
.
YOU THINK
I'M A FOOL

1211
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,714
BUT I CAME TO APPEAL
TO YOU TO CALL OFF
THE HUNGER STRIKE

1212
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:23,215
AND AVOID
A TRAGEDY.

1213
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:25,718
WHY DON'T YOU APPEAL
TO GEN. SUTHERLAND?

1214
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:27,720
WHAT CAN I
TELL HIM?

1215
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:31,724
TELL HIM WHAT
GOD SAID TO MOSES,

1216
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:36,729
"GO UNTO PHARAOH,
AND SAY UNTO HIM,
'THUS SAITH THE LORD,

01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:39,732
"'LET MY PEOPLE GO,
THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME.'"

EXODUS, CHAPTER 7,
VERSE 26.

1219
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:50,242
WE HAVE BEEN
ASKED TO TALK TO YOU,
MR. BEN CANAAN.

1220
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:51,744
DO YOU HAVE TIME?

1221
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:52,745
[Ari]
OF COURSE.

1222
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,748
EXCUSE ME.

1223
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,764
[Woman]
WE HAVE MADE A DECISION
AMONG THE MOTHERS,

1224
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,267
TO SEND THE CHILDREN
BACK TO KARAOLOS NOW
WILL SHOW WEAKNESS.

1225
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:18,771
THE BRITISH WILL SEE
THAT WE ARE NOT SERIOU
S PEOPLE ABOARD THIS SHIP.

1226
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,773
.
IT DOES NOT MATTER
WHAT THE BRITISH THINK

1227
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:22,775
I CANNOT TAKE
THE RESPONSIBILITY

1228
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,276
FOR LETTING CHILDREN
STARVE TO DEATH.

1229
01:09:24,276 --> 01:09:26,278
WE WILL TAKE THE
RESPONSIBILITY.

1230
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:29,782
WE WILL NOT SEND THEM
BACK, AND WE WILL NOT
GO BACK WITH THEM.

1231
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:33,285
K.
I AM SORRY, MRS. FRANK
EL. THE CHILDREN MUST GO BAC

1232
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:36,288
YOU GO BACK IF YOU
WANT TO WITH THEM.
NOW, THAT'S A HAGANAH ORDER.

1233
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:40,292
YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT MAN,
MR. ARI BEN CANAAN,
BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING.

1234
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,296
LOOK AT THESE BABIES OF MINE.
BORN BEHIND BARBED WIRE.

1235
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:47,800
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEY DON'T HAVE TO

1236
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,852
LOOK OUT THROUGH A
FENCE LIKE LITTLE ANIMALS.

1237
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,388
THEY ARE FREE NOW,
AND NOBODY,

1238
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:55,891
.
NO ENGLISHMAN, NO HAGANAH,
WILL EVER LOCK THEM UP AGAIN

1239
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,394
RE.
LOOK AT MRS. HIRSCHBERG HE

1240
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,897
HERS WILL BE THE FIRST,
WHEN SHE HAS NO
MORE MILK TO GIVE.

1241
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,899
TELL HIM.

1242
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,901
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK TO KARAOLOS.

1243
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,404
HE WILL GO TO
PALESTINE WITH ME,

1244
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,406
OR RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHIP,
WE WILL DIE TOGETHER.

1245
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,408
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK.

1246
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,410
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK.

1247
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,422
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO STOP THIS THING
AND LET THEM GO?

1248
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,924
T.
UNFORTUNATELY,
 I CAN'T ANSWER THA

1249
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,427
.
THE AFFAIR'S ENTIREL
Y IN THE HANDS OF LONDON

1250
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,430
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU
KNOW HOW WRONG IT IS.

1251
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,933
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SO?
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A
PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT IT?

1252
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,437
ER.
I CAN'T DO THAT,
KITTY. I'M A SOLDI

1253
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:45,441
I KNOW YOU'RE A SOLDIER,
BUT YOU'RE ALSO A JEW

1254
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,943
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE
OUT THERE ARE JEWS, TOO.

1255
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,446
Y,
I DON'T LIKE TO
DISAPPOINT YOU, KITT

1256
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,448
BUT I'M NOT IN
ANY DEGREE A JEW.

1257
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,450
BUT I THOUGHT...

1258
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,451
.
I KNOW THE RUMOR

1259
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,453
APPARENTLY, THERE HAD TO
BE SOME EXPLANATION

1260
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,456
S.
FOR MY ATTITUDE
TOWARDS THIS
UNPLEASANT BUSINES

I'M SORRY FOR
FLYING OFF
LIKE THAT.

01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,463

YOU'RE GETTING TO
BE QUITE A ZIONIST

AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GLAD YOU DID FLY O

HAPPEN TO OTHER JE

SIGNAL THE AIR BASE.
I'M FLYING TO LONDON
WITHIN THE HOUR.

1271
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:01,517
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AN
INTERESTING WOMAN,
MRS. FREMONT.

1272
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,520
SUTHERLAND
WON'T LET ONE MEMBER
OF THE PRESS COME ABOARD

1273
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,523
AND YOU SHUTTLE
BACK AND FORTH LIKE
A CARRIER PIGEON.

1274

I KNOW YOU SUSPECT ME,
AND I KNOW NOTHING I
SAY CAN MAKE YOU TRUST M

1275
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,030
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT GEN. SUTHERLAND
HAS LEFT FOR LONDON.

1276

THANKS.

1278
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,538
IS THAT ALL?

1279
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,544
TH.
I HEARD OF
DR. ODENHEIM'S DEA

1280
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,547
I'M A TRAINED NURSE,
AND I WORKED WITH
HIM AT KARAOLOS.

1281
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,050
IF I CAN BE USEFUL,
I'D BE GLAD TO
STAY ABOARD.

1282
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,051
WITHOUT FOOD?

1283
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,556
I THINK I CAN GO WITHOUT
FOOD AS LONG AS YOU.

1284
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,062
.
I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU
ON BOARD, MRS. FREMONT

1285
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,567
GLAD TO BE ABOARD,
MR. BEN CANAAN.

1286
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:32,107
WHATEVER MOVE YOU
MAKE, YOU WERE DEA
D 10 MINUTES AGO.

1287
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:35,110
I ASKED FOR AN
OPINION FROM ROMANIA?

1288
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,617
IN?
DO YOU THI
NK THE BRITISH
WILL GIVE

1289
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,119
WE'LL GIVE
IN FIRST.

1290
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,622
THESE SCHLEMIELS.

1291
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,625
MAYBE THEY THINK
THEY'VE BEEN HUNGRY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

1292
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:53,128
THEY DON'T EVEN BEGIN
TO KNOW WHAT REAL
STARVATION IS.

1293
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,631
DOV, IF YOU HATE
THESE PEOPLE SO MUCH,

1294
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,633
?
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO PALESTINE WITH THEM

1295
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,136
BECAUSE THERE,
JEWS FIGHT
INSTEAD OF TALK.

1296
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,142
WHEN I GET THERE,
I'M GOING TO JOIN
THE IRGUN.

1297
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,646
THEY KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

1298
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:14,650
I'M GOING TO BLOW
UP EVERY BRITISH
INSTALLATION I CAN FIND.

1299
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,653
I'M GOING TO
KILL ENGLISHMEN.

1300
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,656
KILL AND KILL
AND KILL THEM

1301
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,658
TILL THERE WON'T BE
ANY MORE, THAT'S ALL.

1302
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,660
BUT THE BRITISH
AREN'T ALL BAD, DOV.

1303
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,162
THEY'RE ROTTEN, THE
WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

1304
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,164
THE BRITISH,
ALL THE RUSSIANS,
ALL THE POLES--

1305
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,666
NOT THE DANES.
WHEN I WAS THERE--

1306
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,167
NO, THE DANES, TOO.
DON'T TELL ME.

1307
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,669
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1308
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,672
THE HANSENS WERE CHRISTIANS,
AND THEY ADOPTED ME.

1309
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,176
ONE EXCEPTION,
ONE LITTLE EXCEPTION.
THAT PROVES SOMETHING?

1310
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:46,181
THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCEPTIONS.
YOU JUST LISTEN TO
ME FOR A MINUTE, DOV.

1311
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,684
WHEN THE NAZIS
MARCHED INTO DENMARK,

1312
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,687
ND
THEY ORDERED EVERY JEW
TO WEAR A YELLOW ARMBA

1313
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,689
WITH THE STAR OF DAVID
ON IT. AND WHEN THEY--

1314
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,190
THAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN
TO A JEW?

1315
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,692
I SAID, LISTEN!

1316
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,194
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1317
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,698
THE NEXT MORNING,
WHEN EVERY JEW IN DENMAR
K HAD TO WEAR HIS ARMBAND,

1318
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,202
KING CHRISTIAN CAME
OUT OF AMALIENBORG PALACE
FOR HIS MORNING RIDE.

1319
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,704
AND DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?

1320
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,206
HE WORE THE STAR
OF DAVID ON HIS ARM.

1321
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,207
BUT WHY SHOULD--

1322
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,709
AND YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

1323
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:17,713
.
BY AFTERNOON,
EVERYBODY WAS
WEARING STARS OF DAVID

1324
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:22,217
Y.
THE JEWS AND THE DANES,
AND, WELL, JUST EVERYBOD

[Dov]
I HID IN THE SEWERS

CAUGHT ME.

01:30:07,385 --> 01:30:08,886
AND THEY SENT
YOU TO AUSCHWITZ?

YES.

TO WHAT WORK WERE
YOU ASSIGNED
IN AUSCHWITZ?

01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:15,893
I TOLD YOU THAT

WORKING IN THE KITCHENS.

WAS LIBERATED, YOU
WALKED TO GERMANY?

WELL...

FIRST YOU
UNDRESSED

1519
01:31:26,964 --> 01:31:29,467
AND THEN THEY
CLIPPED YOUR HAIR.

1520
01:31:29,467 --> 01:31:32,970
AND THEN YOU ALL LINED
UP, AND YOU WENT TO
THE STATION ROOM.

1521
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,474
,
SO THE WAY YOU
REMEMBER IT, THEY WERE

YES.

AND THEN THE
DOCTORS EXAMINED YOU

1525
01:31:44,982 --> 01:31:46,984
AND TOLD YOU
WHAT GATE TO TAKE.

1526
01:31:46,984 --> 01:31:50,488
THERE WERE...
THERE WERE 3 GATES.

1527
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:53,991
AND IF YOU WERE TO BE
KILLED, THEN YOU WENT
THROUGH THE LEFT GATE.

1528
01:31:54,992 --> 01:31:56,494
WHICH MOST
OF THEM DID.

YES. YES, MOST.

1530
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,999
BUT IF YOU WERE
STRONG ENOUGH TO WORK,

1531
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:04,502
THEN YOU WENT THROUGH
THE RIGHT GATE.

1532
01:32:04,502 --> 01:32:05,503
WHICH YOU DID.

1533
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:08,005
YES.

1534
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:10,007
AND THEN THEY
ASSIGNED YOU TO--

1535

WERE 3 GATES.

HAPPENED TO THEM?

WELL...

01:32:29,527 --> 01:32:32,029
THE S.S. GUARDS
KEPT SOME OF THEM.

1544
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:34,532

THEN THE REST WERE SENT
AROUND TO ARMY CAMPS FOR

FOR THE SOLDIERS.

YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

NOW, THOSE WHO WENT
THROUGH THE LEFT
GATE TO BE KILLED,

HOW WAS THE
KILLING ACCOMPLISHED
IN AUSCHWITZ?

THE HOLES?

WHO DUG THE GRAVES?

AT LEAST,
SOMETIMES THEY DID.

1574
01:34:18,135 --> 01:34:20,638
TO BLOW HOLES
IN THE GROUND,

1575
01:34:21,138 --> 01:34:23,140
THEN DUMP THE BODIES IN.

1576
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:25,643
THAT IS CORRECT.

01:49:06,907 --> 01:49:08,408
BUT WHAT
ABOUT YOU, ARI?

1773
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:11,912
FORGET HAGANAH
FOR ONE MOMENT, AND
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

1774
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:13,914
I THINK THESE
BOMBINGS AND
THESE KILLINGS

1775
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:15,415
HURT US WITH THE
UNITED NATIONS.

1776
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:17,918
A YEAR AGO, WE HAD THE
RESPECT OF THE WHOLE WORLD.

1777
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:22,923
NOW, WHEN THEY READ ABOUT
US, IT'S NOTHING BUT
TERROR AND VIOLENCE.

1778
01:49:22,923 --> 01:49:25,926
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
THIS HAPPENS IN HISTORY.

1779
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:29,930
I DON'T KNOW OF ONE
NATION, WHETHER EXISTING
NOW OR IN THE PAST,

1780
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:32,933
THAT WAS NOT
BORN IN VIOLENCE.

1781
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:36,937
TERROR, VIOLENCE, DEATH.

1782
01:49:36,937 --> 01:49:40,440
THEY ARE THE MIDWIVES
WHO BRING FREE
NATIONS INTO THIS WORLD.

1783
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,443
COMPROMISERS LIKE THE HAGANAH
PRODUCE ONLY ABORTIONS.

1784
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:46,947
BEFORE YOU HAVE
A COUNTRY, YOU HAVE
TO HAVE PEOPLE.

1785
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:50,367
THAT'S THE JOB THAT WE'VE
DONE. TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE SMUGGLED IN

1786
01:49:50,367 --> 01:49:53,870
WITH THE WHOLE BRITISH
NAVY BLOCKADING
THE COAST. POPULATION.

1787
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:57,874
THE POPULATION WE'VE BUILT
IS OUR MOST VALID ARGUMENT
WE HAVE FOR INDEPENDENCE.

1788
01:49:57,874 --> 01:50:00,377
HOW CAN WE ASK THE
UNITED NATIONS
FOR A JUST DECISION

1789
01:50:00,377 --> 01:50:03,863
WHEN WE KEEP
BLOWING UP THINGS LIKE
A BUNCH OF ANARCHISTS?

1790
01:50:03,863 --> 01:50:06,800
YOU HAVE JUST USED THE
WORDS "A JUST DECISION."

1791
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,802
MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

1792
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:11,304
FIRSTLY,

1793
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:14,307
JUSTICE ITSELF
IS AN ABSTRACTION,

1794
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,810
COMPLETELY DEVOID
OF REALITY.

1795
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,314
SECOND, TO SPEAK
OF JUSTICE AND JEWS
IN THE SAME BREATH

1796
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:24,317
IS A LOGICAL UNCERTAINTY.

1797
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:25,819
THIRDLY,

1798
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:29,322
ONE CAN ARGUE THE JUSTICE
OF ARAB CLAIMS ON PALESTINE

1799
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:32,826
JUST AS ONE CAN ARGUE THE
JUSTICE OF JEWISH CLAIMS.

1800
01:50:33,827 --> 01:50:34,828
FOURTHLY,

1801
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:37,330
NO ONE CAN SAY THAT
THE JEWS HAVE NOT HAD

1802
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,333
MORE THAN THEIR
SHARE OF INJUSTICE
THESE PAST 10 YEARS.

1803
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,837
I THEREFORE SAY, FIFTHLY,

1804
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:47,340
LET THE NEXT
INJUSTICE WORK AGAINST
SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A CHANGE.

1805
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:50,343
YOU JUST CHANGED
THE SUBJECT ON ME.

1806
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:51,344
YOU NOTICED.

1807
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:54,848
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS MORE
BOMBINGS AND MORE KILLINGS?

1808
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:56,349
I'LL PUT IT
THIS WAY.

1809
01:50:56,349 --> 01:50:58,351
LET THE
NATIONAL COMMITTEE
KEEP ON TRYING

1810
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:00,854
TO TALK THE BRITIS
H OUT OF PALESTINE.

1811
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:04,858
WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS.
WE WILL CONTINUE
TO BOMB THEM OUT.

1812
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,861
NOW TELL ME, HOW'S
YOUR MOTHER?

1813
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:09,863
SHE'S FINE.

1814
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:12,365
AND LITTLE JORDANA?

1815
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:15,368
LITTLE JORDANA
JUST WON HER SECOND

1816
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:17,871
MARKSMANSHIP MEDAL
WITH THE PALMACH.

1817

[Chuckling]

1818
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:23,877
?
AND THAT YOUNG
RASCAL, DAVID BEN AMI,
SHE'S STILL INTERESTED

1819
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:26,880
SHE CAN'T WAIT TILL HE
GETS BACK FROM CYPRUS.

1820
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,883
AND BARAK...

1821
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:33,386
STILL COUNTS MY
NAME AMONG THE DEAD
ON YOM KIPPUR?

1822
01:51:39,893 --> 01:51:41,394
10 YEARS.

1823
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:47,901
VE.
IT'S A LONG TIME
TO BE DEAD TO THE
ONLY FAMILY YOU HA

1824
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:55,408
DOESN'T HE UNDERSTAND
THAT I MUST WORK FOR
ISRAEL IN MY WAY

1825
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:58,411
JUST AS HE WOR
KS FOR IT IN HIS?

1826
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:00,914
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT. I'VE TRIED.

1827
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:03,917
OF COURSE.

1828
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:12,926
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A HOME, IS IT?

1829
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:16,429
WITH ONLY ROSE'S
SAMOVAR TO MAKE
A MEMORY REAL.

1830
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:34,447
EVERY TIME I COME HOME
, I STOP HERE AND JUST
LOOK FOR A MINUTE.

1831
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:35,949
YOU WANT TO
LOOK WITH ME?

1832
01:52:35,949 --> 01:52:36,950
SURE.

1833
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:33,006
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

THE VALLEY
OF JEZREEL.

1835

IF YOU DUG STRAIGHT
DOWN FAR ENOUGH THERE,

1836
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:43,016
YOU'D FIND THE
RUINS OF MEGGIDO.

1837
01:53:43,016 --> 01:53:45,018
YOU'D FIND THE VERY
SAME PAVING STONES

WHEN HE CONQUERED IT.

THAT'S ABU YESHA.
THAT'S AN ARAB VILLAGE
. TO THE LEFT IS GAN DAFNA

IN A PRESBYTERIAN
SORT OF WAY.

1842

.
THAT'S MOUNT TABOR

GATHERED HER ARMIES.

WAS YAKOV RABINSKI
