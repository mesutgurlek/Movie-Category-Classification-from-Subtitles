Your father's been given a promotion.

Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

30
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,112
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

31
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,197
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you go.

is much easier

I don't like soldiers. Do you?

I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

Well, he's the important sort.

He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,189
What?

471
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,038
But, surely you...

472
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,668
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

473
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,756
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

474
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,878
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

475
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,160
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

476
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,835
- You want this country to be strong...
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

477
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,753
How can you...

478
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,392
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you...

479
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,113
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

480
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,958
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

481
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,079
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

482
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,953
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

(CRYING)

484
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,674
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

485
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,999
Grandpa's here.

486
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,600
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

487
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,070
We'll be through in a moment.

488
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,476
Who told you about this?

489
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,513
How's Grandma?

490
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,389
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

491
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,399
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

492
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,796
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- GRANDPA: Absolutely.

493
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,797
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

494
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,075
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

495
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,475
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

496
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,590
GRANDPA: So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

497
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,870
Yes. He's nice.

498
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,153
BRUNO: But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

499
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,715
All we do is boring, old history.

500
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,310
GRANDPA: Let me tell you something,
young man.

501
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,558
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

502
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,160
The work your father is doing here,

503
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,997
history in the making.

504
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,789
When I was your age, history was
my favourite subject by miles,

505
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,711
which obviously
didn't please my father.

506
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,159
Hmm. Why not?

507
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,392
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

508
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,716
Really, does he still teach?

509
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,910
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

510
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,236
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

511
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,159
Really, when?

512
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,636
About four years ago,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

513
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,232
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

514
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,558
Where did he go?

515
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,912
Lieutenant Kotler,

516
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,709
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

517
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,118
I believe it was Switzerland,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

518
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,669
FATHER: How strange that he should
choose to leave the Fatherland

519
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,199
at the very moment it needed him most.

520
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,959
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

521
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,319
More wine!

522
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,313
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

523
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,629
KOTLER: <i>Herr Kommandant?</i>

524
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,712
Did he go there to take the air?

525
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,912
I'm afraid I really don't know,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

526
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,871
You'd have to ask him.

527
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,559
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

528
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,750
With him being in Switzerland.

529
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,668
Come on!

530
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,268
What's the matter with you tonight?

531
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,756
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

532
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,080
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

533
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,550
- I mean, with government policy.
- GRANDPA: One hears of such men.

534
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,869
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

535
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,351
FATHER: Even so, all of them traitors.
GRANDPA: Absolutely right.

536
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,918
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

537
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,555
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

538

545
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,196
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

546
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,832
Oh, Bruno, you don't still think
it's a farm, do you?

547
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,552
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

548
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,396
For Jews, obviously.

549
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,593
Just Jews?

550
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,189
Because they're the best workers?

551
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,636
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

552
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,398
They're no good at anything.

553
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,158
They're in there because they're evil.

554
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,316
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

555
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,635
- But I thought we were fighting...
- They're evil, Bruno.

556
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,557
Evil, dangerous vermin.

Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

561
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,074
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

562
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,075
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

563

now more than ever before.

They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

We're not supposed to be friends,

- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

Do you know this Jew?

No, I just walked in,

01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,197
Shmuel! Shmuel!

625
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,590
I don't understand.

626
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,029
I saw a film about the camp,

627
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,197
and it looked so nice.

628
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,196
I don't know why I did it.

629
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,273
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

630
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,436
and that soldier's so scary.

631
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,995
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

632
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,716
I thought maybe
we weren't friends any more.

633
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,032
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

634
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,755
(PHONE RINGING)

635
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,516
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

636
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,231
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

637
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,390
He's been moved to the front.

638
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,471
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm

639
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,158
would be put to better use there.

640
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,236
<i>Herr Kommandant,</i> telephone.

641
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,509
In actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there

642
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,312
because he failed
to inform the authorities

643
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,669
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

644
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,517
Which was his duty, I might add.

645
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,596
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

646
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,599
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

647
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,279
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

648
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,597
- FATHER: (ON PHONE) What?
- When will Pavel be back?

649
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,074
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

650
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,989
It's Father. They've been bombed.

651
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,838
Grandmother's dead.

652
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,795
MINISTER: "...the victory
which You have obtained for us

653
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,070

654
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,590

655
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,870

Amen."

660
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,716
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

661
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,108
He does.

662
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,434
MINISTER: "Almighty God,
who by the death of..."

663
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,879
<i>BRUNO: Have you ever been</i>
<i>to a funeral?</i>

664
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,950
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

665
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,230
but there weren't any funerals.

666
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,636
That one there to there.

667
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,955
They both died at the same time?

668
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,628
What of?

669
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,109
I don't know.

670
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,869
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

671
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,992
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

672
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,031
We didn't see them again.

673
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,873
(SIGHING) This is fun.

674
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,916
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

675
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,076
- That one there to there.
- This one?

676
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,791
- This one?
- No, that one.

677
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,277
- This one to here?
- No, there!

678
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,311
- (CHUCKLING) To here?
- No.

679
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,078
- Here?
- No.

680
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,669
(BOTH GIGGLING)

681
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,560
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

682
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,716
FATHER: You can't behave like this!

683
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,111
MOTHER: You're questioning
my behaviour?

684
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,513
FATHER: It can't continue!

685
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,109
MOTHER: I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

686
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,469
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

687
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,512
FATHER: Don't you think
there will be questions?

688
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,959
MOTHER: Questions?
FATHER: Well, now, what does it say

689
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,516
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

690
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,959
MOTHER: Work?
Is that what you call it?

691
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,399
FATHER: Pull yourself together,
woman.

692
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,158
MOTHER: Right.
Just ignore it. Ignore it.

693
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,829
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

694
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,680
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

695
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,718
Are you happy here?

696
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,712
Yes. Very.

697
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,392
And you, Gretel?

698
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,234
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

699
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,670
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

700
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,228
No. Not any more, really.

701
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,953
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

702
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,515
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

703
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,314
GRETEL: Back home?
FATHER: No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

704
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,715
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

705
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,996
All of us? You as well?

706
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,231
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

707
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,840
I must stay
and complete my work here.

708
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,635
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

709
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,833
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

710
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,632
Would you like that?

711
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,513
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

712
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,154
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

713
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,998
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

714
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,555
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

715
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,033
- But, Dad...
- No!

716
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,070
It's time for you to move away.

717
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,116
Is everything all right?

718
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,751
We can't find Papa.

719
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,360
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

720
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,470
and they haven't come back.

721
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,755
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

722
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,277
How long for this time?

723
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,076
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

724
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,318
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

725
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,832
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

726
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,510
So, I won't ever see you again?

727
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,239
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

728
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,397
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

729
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,833
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

730
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,716
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

731
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,672
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

732
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,473
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

733
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,351
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

734
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,473
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

735
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,909
Look.

736
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,397
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

737
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,238
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

738
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,594
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

739
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,437
I don't look like you.

740
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,515
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

741
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,076
You could look like me, though.

742
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,395
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

743
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,476
I'm not shaving my hair off.

744
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,799
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

745
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,469
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

746
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,080
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

747
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,270
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

748
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,834
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

749
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,156
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

750
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,316
And don't forget the pyjamas!

751
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,869
Bruno?

752
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,075
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

753
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,555
(SIGHS)

754
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,239
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

755
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,351
All right. Go on then.

756
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,153
(PANTING)

757
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,198
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

758
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,789
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

759
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,592
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

760
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,555
Oh.

761
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,674
Shmuel.

762
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,155
Here.

763
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,759
How do I look?

764
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,559
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

765
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,677
Right. Let's get going.

766
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,389
Bruno?

767
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,159
SHMUEL: That's enough.

768
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,114
(LAUGHING)

769
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,230
Let's go and find your dad.

770
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,554
Come on!

771
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,593
Master Bruno?

772
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,674
BRUNO: Shmuel.

773
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,633
- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

774
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,712
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

775
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,949
Yeah.

776
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,236
We'll check our hut first.

777
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,474
