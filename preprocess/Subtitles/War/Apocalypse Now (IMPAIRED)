Shit.

30
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,214
I'm still only in Saigon.

31
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,690
Every time, I think
I'm going to wake up

32
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,454
back in the jungle.

33
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,967
When I was home
after my first tour,

34
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,730
it was worse.

35
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,574
I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing.

36
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,415
I hardly said a word
to my wife,

37
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:14,255
until I said yes
to a divorce.

38
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:19,761
When I was here,
I wanted to be there.

39
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,596
When I was there,

40
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:23,761
All I could think of

41
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,271
was getting
back into the jungle.

42
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,143
I'm here a week now...

43
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:36,649
waiting for a mission,

44
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:38,650
getting softer.

45
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:46,117
Every minute
I stay in this room,

46
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,625
I get weaker.

47
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:50,128
Every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,

48
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,629
he gets stronger.

49
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,797
Each time I looked around,

50
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,567
the walls moved in
a little tighter.

51
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,164
Everyone gets
everything he wants.

52
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,004
I wanted a mission,

53
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,947
and for my sins,
they gave me one.

54
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:53,110
Brought it up to me
like room service.

55
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:56,383
Captain Willard,
are you in there?

56
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,390
Yeah, I'm coming.

57
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,325
It was
a real choice mission,

58
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:05,831
and when it was over,
I'd never want another.

59
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,340
What do you want?

60
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,842
Are you all right,
Captain?

61
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,845
What's it look like?

62
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,355

63
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:31,355
Affirmative.

65

shut the door?

67
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,865
We have orders to
escort you to the airfield.

68
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,099
What are the charges?

69
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,160
Sir?

70
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,866
What did I do?

71
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,374
There's no charges,
Captain.

72
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,377
You have orders to report
to Com-Sec lntelligence,

73

74
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:56,380

75
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,711
Nha Trang for me.

76
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:58,716
That's right.

77
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:00,980
Come on, Captain.

78
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:04,649
You still have a few hours
to get cleaned up.

79
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:05,656
Captain?

80
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,328
Dave, give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

81
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,627
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

82
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,498
We're going to take
a shower, Captain.

83
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,831

84
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,838
Now, stand underneath
this, Captain.

85
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,168
Aah!

86
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,731
Ohhh...

87
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:34,019
I was going to the worst
place in the world,

88
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,521
and I didn't even
know it yet.

89
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,023
Weeks away
and hundreds of miles

90
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,356
up a river
snaking through the war

91
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,190
like a main circuit cable

92
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,356
plugged straight
into Kurtz.

93
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,369
It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker

94
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,701
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's
memory...

95
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:58,369
any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.

96
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:00,878
There is no way
to tell his story

97
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,108
without telling my own,

98
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:06,379
and if his story
is really a confession,

99
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,044
then so is mine.

100
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,387
Come in.

101
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:11,650
Thank you, sir.

102
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,055
Stand at ease.

103
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:17,895
Want a cigarette?

104
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:20,727
No, thank you, sir.

105
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,070
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

106
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,230
No, sir.

107
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,240
Met the general or myself?

108
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,332
No, sir.

109
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,341
Not personally.

110
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,405
You've worked a lot
on your own?

111
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,777
Yes, sir, I have.

112
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:39,750
Your report specifies
intelligence with Com-Sec.

113
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,980
I'm not disposed to
discuss those operations.

114
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:56,101
Did you not work
for the ClA and I Corps?

115
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,158
No, sir.

116
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,669
Did you not assassinate

117
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,103
a government
tax collector,

118
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,971
Quang Tri province,
June 18, 1968?

119
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:06,703
Captain?

120
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,881
Sir, I'm unaware of

121
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,385
any such activity
or operation...

123
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,889
nor would I be disposed

124
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,652
to discuss
such an operation

125
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,889
if it did
in fact exist, sir.

126
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:36,237
I thought we'd have lunch
while we talk.

127
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,403
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

128
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:43,916
I noticed that you
have a bad hand there.

129
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,416
Are you wounded?

130
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,747
A little
fishing accident

131
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,252
on R and R, sir.

132
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,084
Fishing on R and R?

133
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,088
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,091
But you're
ready for duty?

135
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,091
Yes, General.

136
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,923
Very much so, sir.

137
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,429
Well, let's see
what we have here.

138
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,590
Roast beef.

139
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,360
Usually
it's not bad.

140
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,863
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.

141
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:09,874
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

142
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:12,376
Uh...Captain...

143
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:16,381
I don't know how you feel
about this shrimp,

144
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,383
but if you'll eat it,

145
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,385
you'll never have to
prove your courage

146
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,785
in any other way.

147
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:26,882
Why don't I just
take a piece here?

148
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,293
Captain, you've heard
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

149
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,891
Um...yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

150
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,559
Oh...Jesus.

Luke, would you
play that tape

153
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,131

154
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,733

00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,421
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

158
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:02,359
I watched a snail

159
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:05,192
crawl along the edge...

160
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,959
of a straight razor.

161
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,368
That's my dream.

162
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,167
That's my nightmare.

163
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,977
Crawling...slithering...

164
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,646
along the edge...

165
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:27,148
of a straight razor...

166
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,355

We must incinerate them.

173
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:52,841
cow after cow...

174
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:55,005
village after village,

175
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,447
army after army,

176
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,179
and they call me
an assassin.

177
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,948
What do you call it

178
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:05,980
when the assassins
accuse the assassin?

179
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,286
They lie.

180
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,454
They lie,
and we have to be merciful

181
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,964
to those who lie.

182
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,126
Those...nabobs...

183
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,462
I hate them.

184
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,635
I do hate them.

185
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:31,744
Walt Kurtz was one of the
most outstanding officers

186
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,842
this country
has ever produced.

187
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,182
He was brilliant.

188
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,688
He was outstanding
in every way,

189
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,692
and he was
a good man, too.

190
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,524
A humanitarian man,

191
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:47,088
a man of wit and humor.

192
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,693
He joined
the Special Forces.

193
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,704
And after that, his...

194
00:14:55,274 --> 00:15:00,211
ideas, methods

195
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,974
became...

196
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,407
unsound.

197
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:11,985
Unsound.

198
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,660
Now he's crossed into Cambodia

199
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,496
with this...
Montagnard army of his

200
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:26,732
that worship the man
like a god

201
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,569
and follow every order,

202
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,165
however ridiculous.

203
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:36,238
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

204
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:41,912
Colonel Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

205
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,922
I don't follow, sir.

206
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,514
Murdered who?

207
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,252
Kurtz had ordered
the execution

208
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,260
of some Vietnamese
intelligence agents,

209
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,820
men he believed
were double agents.

210
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,864
So he took matters
into his own hands.

211
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,463
Well, you see, Willard,

212
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,973
in this war,

213
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:07,809
things get...
confused out there--

214
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,782
power, ideals,
the old morality,

215
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,842
and practical
military necessity.

216
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:19,988
But out there
with these natives,

217
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:25,998
it must be a temptation
to...be God.

218
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:33,504
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart,

219
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:37,508
between the rational
and irrational,

220
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,670
between good and evil,

221
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:44,238
and good does not
always triumph.

222
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,545
Sometimes...

223
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,022
the dark side

224
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,524
overcomes
what Lincoln called

225
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,856
"the better angels
of our nature."

226
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,459
Every man has got
a breaking point.

227
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,763
You and I have one.

228
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:08,473
Walt Kurtz
has reached his,

229
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,476
and very obviously,
he has gone insane.

230
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:25,751
Yes, sir.

231
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,486
Very much so, sir.

232
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,584
Obviously insane.

233
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:36,732
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River,

234
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:41,330
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba,

235
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,843
follow it,
and learn what you can.

236
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,844
When you find the colonel,

237
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:51,008
infiltrate his team by
whatever means available

238
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,483
and terminate
the Colonel's command.

239
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,561
Terminate... the Colonel?

240
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:03,959
He's out there

241
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,465
operating without
any decent restraint,

242
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,966
totally beyond the pale

243
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:12,970
of any acceptable
human conduct,

244
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,975
and he's still in the field
commanding troops.

245
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,706
Terminate...
with extreme prejudice.

246
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,477
You understand,
Captain,

247
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,316
that this mission
does not exist...

248
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,480
nor will it
ever exist.

249
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:28,980
How many people
had I already killed?

250
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,484
There were those six
I knew about for sure,

251
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,315
close enough
to blow their last breath

252
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,820
in my face.

253
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,494
But this time,
it was an American

254
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,028
and an officer.

255
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,176
That wasn't supposed to
make any difference to me,

256
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,677
but it did.

257
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:05,517
Shit, charging a man
with murder in this place

258
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,848
was like handing out
speeding tickets

259
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,182
at the lndy 500.

260
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,357
I took the mission.

261
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:17,020
What the hell else
was I going to do?

262
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,030
But I really didn't know

263
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,862
what I'd do
when I found him.

264
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:36,039
I was being ferried
down the coast

265
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,548
in a navy PBR,

266
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,709
a type of
plastic patrol boat,

267
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,878
pretty common sight
on the rivers.

268
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,549
They said it was a good way
to pick up information

269
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:47,057
without drawing
much attention.

270
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,559
That was OK.

271
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:51,562
I needed the air
and the time.

272
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,565
Only problem was,
I wouldn't be alone.

273
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,895
Morning, Captain.

274
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,337
The crew were mostly
just kids,

275
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:05,002
rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.

276
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,837
How old are you?

277
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:08,902
17.

278
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,515
The machinist,
the one they called Chef,

279
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,847
was from New Orleans.

280
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,513
He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam...

281
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,581
probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.

282
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,592
Lance was a famous surfer

283
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,026
from the beaches south of L.A.

284
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,358
To look at him,

285
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,332
you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon.

286
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:34,038
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from
some South Bronx shit hole.

287
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:36,870
I think the light
and space of Vietnam

288
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,706
really put the zap
on his head.

289
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,048
Then there was Phillips,
the chief.

290
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,050
It might have been
my mission,

291
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,382
but it was
the chief's boat.

292
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,887
There's about two points

293
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:52,719
where we can get
into the Nung River.

294
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,224
They're both hot.

295
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,727
They belong to Charlie.

296
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,389
Don't worry about it.

297
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:00,830
I don't smoke.

298
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:05,495
I pulled a few
special ops in here.

299
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,004
About six months ago,

300
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:09,836
I took a man
who was going up

301
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,002
past the bridge
at Do Lung.

302
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:15,171
He was regular army, too.

303
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:20,017
I heard he shot
himself in the head.

305
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:31,862
[ It's the Central Highlands AFVN ]

306
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,522
[ Man, it's really hot ]

307
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,529
Good morning, Vietnam.

308
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,968
I'm Army Specialist
Zack Johnson on AFVN.

309
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,529
It's 82 degrees
in downtown Saigon

310
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,040
and also very humid.

311
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:45,042
We have
an important message

312
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,374
from the mayor of Saigon.

313
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,708
Yeah!

314
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,214
Hang your laundry indoors

315
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:52,546
instead of
on the window sills.

316
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,416
The mayor wants you to
keep Saigon beautiful.

317
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,546
Here's another blast
from the past

318
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,557
going out to Big Sam

319
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,820
who's with 1st Battalion,
35th lnfantry.

320
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:05,489
Dedicated by the fire team
at An Khage.

321
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,498
The Rolling Stones...
Satisfaction.

322
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,828
Ooh. All right!

323
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,996
Watch out, Clean!

324
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,006
Get down, bubber!

325
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:21,342
[ I can't get no ]

326
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,871
[ Satisfaction ]

327
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,249
[ I can't get no ]

328
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,255
[ Satisfaction ]

329
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,551
[ 'Cause I try ]

330
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,182
[ And I try ]

331
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,988
[ And I try ]

332
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:37,426
[ And I try ]

333
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:41,091
[ I can't get no ]

334
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,602
[ I can't get no ]

335
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,265
[ When I'm driving
in my car ]

336
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,674
[ And a man comes on
the radio ]

337
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:55,111
[ He's tellin' me

338
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,616
[ About some useless
information ]

339
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:02,051
[ Supposed to drive
my imagination... ]

340
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,884
All right!

341
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:06,049
Look out, Lance!

342
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,489
Sayonara!

343
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:23,734
At first,

344
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,505
I thought they handed me
the wrong dossier.

345
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:30,014
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

346
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,846
Third generation
West Point,

347
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:35,910
top of his class,
Korea, Airborne,

348
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:38,388
about a thousand
decorations,

349
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:40,118
et cetera, et cetera.

350
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,025
I'd heard his voice
on the tape,

351
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,531
and it really
put the hook in me,

352
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,591
but I couldn't connect up
that voice

353
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,193
with this man.

354
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:02,211
Like they said, he had
an impressive career,

355
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:04,715
maybe too impressive.

356
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:06,717
I mean perfect.

357
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,719
He was being groomed

358
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:13,224
for one of the top slots
in the corporation--

359
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,726
general, chief of staff,
anything.

360
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:20,231
ln 1964, he returned from
a tour in Vietnam,

361
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,733
and things
started to slip.

362
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:26,737
His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff

363
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,239
and Lyndon Johnson
was restricted.

364
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:33,244
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to say.

365
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:36,247
He made three requests
for transfer

366
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,250
to airborne training,
Fort Benning, Georgia,

367
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:41,548
and was finally accepted.

368
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,852
Airborne.

369
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,261
He was 38 years old.

370
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:55,265
Why the fuck
would he do that?

371
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,395
"1966,

372
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,336
"joins Special Forces,

373

returns Vietnam."

374
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:06,276
What's that?

375
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:08,609
Arc light.

376
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,942
B-52 strike.

377
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:12,843
What's that?

378
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,647
Arc light.

379
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,881
Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

380
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,855
Charlie don't never
see them or hear them.

381
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,118
There they are!

382
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,319
Concussion sucks the air
from your lungs.

383
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,191
Something terrible's
going to happen.

384
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,525
Smoke!

385
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:27,690
Secondary burn.

386
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,200
Hueys over there,
lots of hueys.

387
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,032
Let's have a look, Chief.

388
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:37,307
It was the Air Cav.
1st of the 9th.

389
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,536
That's them.

390
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,272
Our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.

391
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:43,541
But they were
supposed to wait

392
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:45,048
another
30 kilometers ahead.

393
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,550
Well, Air Mobile--

394
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:49,781
those boys just
couldn't stay put.

395
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:19,509
1st of the 9th was
an old cavalry division.

396
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,518
It traded its horses
for choppers

397
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:25,022
and gone around Nam
looking for the shit.

398
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,527
They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time.

399
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,528
What they were mopping up

400
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:34,030
hadn't even happened
an hour ago.

401
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:39,736
Keep going.

402
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:41,705
Don't look
at the camera.

403
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:45,174
Just go by
like you're fighting.

404
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:48,804
It's for television.
Just go through.

405
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,211
Keep on going.

406
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,375
Don't look at the camera.

407
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,168
Where can l
find the C.O.?

408
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,677
Over there.

409
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:26,016
Roll up the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

410
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:27,016
Captain Willard.

411
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,518
I carry
priority papers

412
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:31,715
From Com-Sec
Intelligence 11 Corps.

413
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,519
I understand that Nha Trang

414
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,526
briefed you on my mission.

415
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:36,526
What mission?

416
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,358
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

417
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,365
Your unit is
supposed to escort us.

418
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,027
OK, but
stay out of my way

419
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:45,694
until this is done.

420
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,543
All right.
Let's see what we have.

421
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,136
Two of spades.

422
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:56,646
Three of spades.

423
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,683
Four of diamonds.

424
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,479
Six of clubs.

425
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:02,349
Eight of spades.

426
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,821
lsn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

427
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,984
Hey, Captain, what's that?

428
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,620
Death cards.

429
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:12,754
What?

430
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:14,992
Death cards.

431
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,535
Lets Charlie know
who did this.

432
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,670
Cheer up, son.

433
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:23,969
We will not hurt you.

434
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,304
Fire in the hole!

435
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:26,674
Fire in the hole!

436
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,413
We are here to help you.

438
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,842
We are here to extend
a welcome hand...

439
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:36,853
Come on.

440
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,182
Everybody in?

441
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,853
Get in. Hurry up.

443
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,199
Move it out.

444
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,540
Hey! Hey, what's this?

445
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,543
What is this?

446
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:02,546
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

447
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,878
The only thing holding
his guts in

448
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,850
is that pot lid.

449
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,545
What do you have
to say?

450
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,554
He is dirty V.C.

451
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,283
He wants water.

452
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:15,326
He can drink paddy water.

453
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:16,985
Get out of here!

454
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,393
Give me that canteen!

455
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,896
He's a V.C.

456
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,398
Any man
brave enough to--

457
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,797
Get out of here

458
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:24,563
before I kick
your fucking ass!

459
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,069
He killing our people!

460
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,901
Any man brave enought to fight
with his guts hanging out

461
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,567
can drink from
my canteen any day.

462
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:34,078
Colonel, that sailor is
Lance Johnson, the surfer.

463
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,909
Where, here in Chua?

464
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:36,970
Down there.

465
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,577
Repeat. We have a body count...

466
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,256
What's your name, sailor?

467
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:49,588
Gunner's Mate Third Class,

468
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,753
L. Johnson, sir.

469
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:51,761
Gunner's Mate--

470
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,764
Lance Johnson, the surfer?

471
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,424
Yes, sir.

472
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,434
Well, it's an honor
to meet you, Lance.

473
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,936
I've admired your
nose-riding for years.

474
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,371
I like your cutback, too.

475
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,873
Thank you, sir.

476
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:05,876
You cut the "sir"
crap, Lance.

477
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,538
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

478
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:09,875
This guy with you?

479
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:10,937
Yeah.

480
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:13,780
This is Mike
from San Diego,

481
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,046
Johnny from Malibu.

482
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,553
Pretty solid surfers.

483
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:20,057
Not anywhere near
your class, though.

484
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,559
We do a lot of
surfing around here.

485
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:25,061
I like to finish
operations early,

486
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,065
fly down to Vuong Tha
for the evening class.

487
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,243
With Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit...

488
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:43,145
all glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father.

489
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,581
Let us pray in the words

490
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,585
Our Savior gave us.

491
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:51,884
Our Father who art in Heaven,

492
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,618
hallowed be Thy name.

493
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:56,024
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

494
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,418
Kilgore had had
a pretty good day.

495
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:24,387
They choppered in
T-bones and beer

496
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:27,425
and turned the L.Z.
into a beach party.

497
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,586
The more they tried
to make it like home,

498
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:33,256
the more they made
everybody miss it.

499
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:34,923
Make my meat rare.

500
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,695
Rare, but not cold.

501
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:46,068
Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess.

502
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,078
He loved his boys,

503
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,081
and you felt safe
with him.

504
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:54,141
He had that weird light
around him.

505
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:57,154
He knew
he wouldn't get hurt.

506
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,690
What happened
to your mission, Captain?

507
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:03,353
Nha Trang
forget all about you?

508
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,602
Sir?

509
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:16,607
Two places we can
get into the river.

510
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:18,609
Here and here.

511
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,612
These are the only
two spots

512
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,614
I'm really sure of.

513
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,616
That village is hairy.

514
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,618
What do you mean?

515
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:29,347
It's hairy.

516
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,252
Got some heavy ordnance.

517
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,815
I lost a few
recon ships there.

518
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:38,329
What's the name
of that damn village?

519
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:42,856
Damn gook names
all sound the same.

520
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,333
Mike, you know anything

521
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:47,030
about this point
at Vinh Dinh Drap?

522
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,402
That's a fantastic peak.

523
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,338
Peak?

524
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:51,875
About 6 foot.

525
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,379
It's got both the long
right and left slide.

526
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,382
It's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.

527
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:05,148
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

528
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,657
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole country.

529
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,591
It's all god damned
beach break.

530
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:12,630
They shot the hell
out of us there.

531
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:15,029
That's Charlie's point.

532
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:19,062
Sir, we can
go in at dawn.

533
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,571
There's offshore
breezes then.

534
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,664
The boat may not make it.

535
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:27,405
The draft at the river's
mouth may be too shallow.

536
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,379
Hell, we'll put
your boat down

537
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:30,607
right where you want it.

538
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:33,446
This is the Air Cav, son.

539
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,042
Air Mobile.

540
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,088
I can hold that point.

541
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:39,589
You can get anyplace
up that river

542
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,988
that suits you, Captain.

543
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,527
Hell, a 6-foot peak.
Ha ha!

544
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:46,928
I'd like to take a gunship
back to the division.

545
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:49,592
Lance, go with Mike.
Pick out a board.

546
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,134
Bring my 8'6".

547
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,760
What is it, soldier?

548
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:54,600
It's pretty hairy in there.

549
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:56,264
That's Charlie's point.

550
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,332
Charlie don't surf!

551
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:23,934
Jesus, Clean, you ain't
going to believe this.

552
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:24,934
Look.

553
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:29,398
Hey, man, they're
picking up the boat!

554
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:33,940
How you feeling, Jimmy?

555
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,446
Like a mean
motherfucker, sir!

556
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,148
All right, son,
let her rip.

558
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:07,897
I've never gotten used
to a light board.

559
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,236
I'm used to
a heavy board.

560
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:12,401
I know.
It's a real drag.

561
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,411
What do you prefer?

562
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,571
Heavier.

563
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,911
Really? I thought
the young guys

564
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:19,244
liked lighter boards.

565
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,909
You can't ride the nose.

566
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:23,749
Big Duke 6,
this is Eagle Thrust.

567
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,083
We've got it spotted.

568
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:26,589
Big Duke 6,

569
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:27,920
put on
heading 2-7-0.

570
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,926
assume attack formation.

571
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,757
That's a roger, Big Duke.

572
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:33,592
OK, we're going in.

573
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,098
We'll come in low

574
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,929
out of the rising sun.

575
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,333
A mile out,
we'll put on the music.

576
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:40,336
Music?

577
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:41,838
Yeah, I use Wagner.

578
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:44,101
It scares the hell
out of the slopes.

579
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:46,075
My boys love it.

580
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:48,442
They're going to play music!

581
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,112
How come all you guys

582
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:58,121
sit on
your helmets?

583
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:01,056
So we don't
get our balls blown off.

584
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:14,570
Big Duke 6
to Eagle Thrust.

585
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,608
Put on psy-war-op.
Make it loud.

586
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,506
This is
a Romeo Foxtrot.

587
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,204
Shall we dance?

589
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:27,482
Surf!

596
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:07,902
Run, Charlie!

597
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:32,630
There's an automatic 50 cal!
50 cal in the open!

598
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:35,399
I've spotted
a large weapon below.

599
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:36,906
We'll go check it out.

600
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:53,488
Outstanding, Red Team,
outstanding.

601
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,992
Get you a case of beer
for that one.

602
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:19,149
6-4-1-0,
we're over the village.

603
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,980
I see a vehicle.

604
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,110
I'll check it out.

605
00:42:22,186 --> 00:42:24,120
Well done, Hawks,
well done.

606
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:26,122
I want
some 20-mike-mike

607
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,623
right along
those tree lines.

608
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,319
Ripple the shit
out of them.

609
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,293
Got a vehicle on the bridge,

610
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,795
50 caliber on board.

611
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:36,522
Big Duke 6.

612
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,126
Clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

613
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,467
These people never give up.

614
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,303
Nice shot, Bill.

616
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:55,648
Un-ash that shit.

617
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,654
Get it out of here!

618
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,155
It's just a flare.

619
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:00,918
It's all right.
Just a flare.

620
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:01,924
Everybody OK?

621
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:03,290
Lance, you all right?

622
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:04,293
Fine!

623
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,564
I'm not going!

624
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:43,395
I'm not going!

625
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:44,991
I'm not going!

626
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:01,516
We just got secondaries
down there on the plaza.

627
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:03,519
Hold on to our position--

628
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:07,751
Duke 6, Duke 6.
We've got wounded down there.

629
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,519
Ah!

630
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:16,532
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

631
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,534
Get a stretcher over here!

632
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,536
I can't stand it!

633
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,708
Please, God, help me!

634
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:28,108
Aah!

635
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,612
Give him some morphine.

636
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:32,882
7-4-2--

637
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,713
Where's that stretcher?

638
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,720
I want my wounded out
and in the hospital

639
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:39,517
in 15 minutes.

640
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:43,993
Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.

641
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,417
She's got a grenade!

642
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:09,953
She's got a grenade!

643
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:16,789
The fuckin' savages.

644
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:21,391
Holy Christ!
She's a sap.

645
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,126
I'm going to get
that dink bitch.

646
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,189
Get over there, Johnny.

647
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:26,566
I'm rolling this
skid right up her ass.

648
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,341
There's goddamn heat
over there.

649
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,001
I'm taking fire.

650
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,101
I'm taking hits all over.

651
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:35,202
3 o'clock!

652
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:36,371
Drawing fire.
Drawing fire.

653
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:38,813
Drawing fire.
Drawing fire.

654
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,350
Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going in.

655
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:41,646
My tail rotor's out.

656
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:52,126
What do you think?

657
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:53,629
It's really
exciting, man.

658
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,289
No, no! The waves!

659
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:56,833
Oh, right.

660
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,630
Look at that.
Breaks both ways.

661
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:00,567
Watch! Watch! Sheeew!

662
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:03,072
Look! Good 6-foot swells!

663
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:14,083
Go, reds, go!

664
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:19,079
Go on, pump it!

665
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:28,598
Come here, Lance.

666
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,498
lncoming!

667
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,108
This L.Z.'s
still pretty hot.

668
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:41,041
Maybe you should
surf somewhere else.

669
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,602
What do you know
about surfing?

670
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,171
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

671
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,511
Come here.

672
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:48,814
Mike, come here!

673
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:52,588
Change.

674
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,123
You mean right now, sir?

675
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:55,453
I want to see

676
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,517
how rideable that stuff is.

677
00:46:57,595 --> 00:46:59,358
It's still pretty
hairy out there.

678
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,125
You want to surf,
soldier?

679
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,187
Yes, sir.

680
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,063
Good. Because you
either surf or fight.

681
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:05,363
ls that clear?

682
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:06,869
Now get going.

683
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:08,063
I'll cover for you.

684
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:09,572
Bring a board for Lance.

685
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,234
Can't do shit
till the boat gets here!

686
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:13,298
Lance.

687
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,778
I'll bet you can't wait
to get out there.

688
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:17,814
What?

689
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:19,281
See how
they break both ways?

690
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,749
One guy can break right,

691
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:21,876
one left,
simultaneously.

692
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:22,976
What do you think
of that?

693
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,248
We should wait
for the tide to come up.

694
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:26,755
Lance, come here.
Look! Look!

695
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:27,756
lncoming!

696
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:34,297
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours.

697
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:38,301
You want to wait here
for six hours?

698
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:41,269
Yo!

699
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:43,169
Hey! Chief!

700
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:52,782
OK, fellas, quit hiding.

701
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,477
Come on.

702
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:55,484
Let's go.

703
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,520
Goddamn it!

704
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:59,681
Don't you think
it's risky for R and R?

705
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,783
lf I say it's safe
to surf this beach,

706
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,294
it's safe
to surf this beach.

707
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,796
I'm not afraid
to surf this place.

708
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:09,196
I'll show you something.

709
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:13,736
Give me that R.T., soldier.

710
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:18,241
This is Big Duke 6.

711
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:21,244
Goddamn it.
I want that tree line bombed.

712
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,246
Big Duke 6, roger.
1, 2, 3 standby.

713
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:26,147
Bomb them into
the stone age, son.

714
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:29,118
They need some napalm
down near the tree line.

715
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,245
Can you put
it down there?

716
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,755
Roger, 1-3.

717
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,451
Going to suppress
some mortar fire

718
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:37,255
off the tree line
down there.

719
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:38,295
Roger. Here we come.

720
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,556
Good. Give it all you got.

721
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,497
Bring in all your ships.

722
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:45,501
Don't worry.
We'll have this place cleaned up

723
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:49,096
and ready for us
in a jiffy, son.

724
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:52,108
Big Duke 6, this is Dove 1-3.

725
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:53,768
You got about
a 30-second stall.

726
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,106
Get your people back
and heads down.

727
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:58,342
It's going to be
a big one.

728
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:04,082
Lance, look at that.

729
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:07,089
Do you see that? Look.

730
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,304
Do you smell that?

731
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,306
Do you smell that?

732
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,807
What?

733
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,308
Napalm, son.

734
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:29,312
Nothing else in the world
smells like that.

735
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:36,820
I love the smell
of napalm in the morning.

736
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:40,823
One time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

737
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:43,826
When it was all over,
I walked up.

738
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:47,489
We didn't find
one stinking dink body.

739
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:48,997
But the smell--

740
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:51,125
You know,
that gasoline smell,

741
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:52,725
the whole hill.

742
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:55,637
It smelled like...

743
00:49:58,575 --> 00:49:59,667
victory.

744
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:07,507
Someday this war's
going to end.

745
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:30,605
Lance.

746
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:32,107
Light it up, man.

747
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:34,110
Come on.
Let's get high.

748
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:35,543
Smoke?

749
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:38,046
"Someday this war's
going to end."

750
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:41,551
That'd be fine
with the boys on the boat.

751
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:44,678
They were just looking
for a way back home.

752
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:45,881
Captain?

753
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:48,686
Trouble is,
I'd been back there,

754
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:52,820
and I knew that it
just didn't exist anymore.

755
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:57,163
Puddin' time.

756
00:50:58,669 --> 00:50:59,601
All right!

757
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,035
That's great, isn't it?

758
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:02,231
Yeah.

759
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,778
lf that's how Kilgore
fought the war,

760
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,280
I began to wonder

761
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:13,782
what they really had
against Kurtz.

762
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:16,786
It wasn't just
insanity and murder.

763
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:20,290
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.

764
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,466
This lady
became his mistress.

765
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:33,970
I mean, he never was
hurting for pussy here.

766
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:35,470
Ha ha ha ha!

767
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:37,473
I'm walking
through the jungle

768
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,974
gathering mangoes.

769
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,476
I meet Raquel Welch.

770
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:46,816
Make a nice
mango cream pudding.

771
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,823
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

772
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:57,327
Hey, Captain, I want
to get some mangoes.

773
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:59,157
Don't go out by yourself.

774
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:02,164
You don't want
to go in there alone,

775
00:52:02,232 --> 00:52:05,099
not unless you really
know the territory.

776
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:07,137
Any poisonous snakes
around here?

777
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:10,435
Fuck it. I want to
go get some mangoes.

778
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:19,474
Chef.

779
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,983
Yes, sir?

780
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,485
How come they
call you that?

781
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:25,146
Call me what, sir?

782
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:28,157
Chef. Because you like
mangoes and stuff?

783
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,659
No, sir. I'm a real chef.

784
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,991
I'm a saucier.

785
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:34,655
Saucier?

786
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:36,323
Yes, sir.

787
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,834
See, I come
from New Orleans.

788
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,370
I was raised to be a saucier.

789
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:43,030
Great saucier.

790
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:44,664
What's a saucier?

791
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:47,505
We specialize in sauces.

792
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,278
Got to be a mango tree
here somewhere.

793
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:02,458
Then I was supposed
to go to Paris,

794
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:05,051
study at
the Escoffier school.

795
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:09,394
Then I got orders
for my physical.

796
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:23,742
Hell, I joined the navy.

797
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:26,078
Heard they had better food.

798
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:28,413
Cook school, that did it.

799
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:30,419
Yeah? How's that?

800
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:33,422
Oh, you don't want
to hear about that.

801
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:37,426
They lined us up in front

802
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:39,928
of a hundred yards
of prime rib.

803
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,932
All of us lined up
looking at it.

804
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,264
Magnificent meat. Really.

805
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:46,927
Beautifully marbled.

806
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,598
Magnifique.

807
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:52,107
Next thing they're
throwing the meat

808
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:53,767
into these big cauldrons.

809
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:56,779
All of it. Boiling it.

810
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,280
I looked inside, man.

811
00:53:58,348 --> 00:53:59,940
It was turning gray.

812
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:03,709
I couldn't fucking
believe that one,

813
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:06,153
so I applied for
radioman's school,

814
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:08,987
but then they gave
me the engine mach--

815
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:50,699
What is it?

816
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,031
Charlie?

817
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:06,940
Aah! Look out!

818
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:07,949
Aah!

819
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,610
It's a fucking tiger!

820
00:55:09,686 --> 00:55:12,246
It's a tiger, man!
A tiger!

821
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:14,813
Lance, get up front!
Behind the 60, Clean!

822
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:16,222
Got it, babe.

823
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:17,385
Oh, shit.

824
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,224
Chef, come on!

825
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:21,059
Fucking tiger!

826
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:22,564
Captain, come on!

827
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,225
Move out! Let's go!

828
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,233
Let's go!

829
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:26,496
Man.

830
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,164
You were right!
Never leave the boat!

831
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,365
Clean, bring
that 60 forward!

832
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,930
What?

833
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:35,501
I got to remember,
never get out of the boat!

834
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,843
Never get out of the boat!

835
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:39,779
Get out of here now!

836
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,181
How many is it?

837
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:42,912
Fucking tiger!

838
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:44,248
What?

839
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,583
Tiger?

840
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:48,090
I didn't come here for this!

841
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:51,093
I don't want this goddamn
fucking shit, man!

842
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:55,257
You can kiss my ass because
I'm fucking bugging out!

843
00:55:55,332 --> 00:55:57,596
I didn't come here for this!

844
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,603
I don't fucking need it!
I don't want it!

845
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:03,196
I didn't get
on the goddamn train

846
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,207
for this kind of shit!

847
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,709
All I want to do
is fucking cook!

848
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:10,212
I just want
to learn to fucking cook!

849
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,544
You're all right.
It's all right.

850
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:13,810
What happened, bro?

851
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,818
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

852
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:17,820
It's going
to be all right.

853
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:18,980
All right.

854
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:20,990
It's going
to be all right.

855
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:22,992
It's going to be
all right.

856
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,654
Never get out
of the fucking boat.

857
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:27,663
Hi, tiger!
Bye, tiger!

858
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,164
Goodbye!

859
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,164
"Never get out of the boat."

860
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:35,670
Absolutely goddamn right.

861
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:39,838
Unless you were going
all the way.

862
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,515
Kurtz got off the boat.

863
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:51,015
He split from the whole
fuckin' program.

864
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:56,188
How did that happen?

865
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,353
What did he see here
that first tour?

866
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:09,138
38 fucking years old.

867
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,640
lf you joined
the Green Berets,

868
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,609
there was no way you'd ever
get above colonel.

869
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,442
Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.

870
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:21,617
The more I read
and began to understand,

871
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,949
the more I admired him.

872
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,217
His family and friends
couldn't understand it,

873
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,225
and they couldn't
talk him out of it.

874
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:31,726
He applied three times

875
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:34,730
and put up
with a ton of shit.

876
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:36,732
When he threatened
to resign,

877
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,734
they gave it to him.

878
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:44,239
The next youngest guy
in his class

879
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:45,740
was half his age.

880
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:49,745
They must have thought
he was some far-out old man

881
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,246
humping over that course.

882
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,578
I did that when I was 19.

883
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,413
It damn near wasted me.

884
00:57:57,487 --> 00:58:00,081
A tough motherfucker.

885
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,189
He finished it.

886
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:07,529
He could have gone
for general...

887
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:11,366
but he went
for himself instead.

888
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:16,201
Dear Eva,

889
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:18,867
today was really a new one.

890
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:22,537
Almost got eaten alive
by a fucking tiger.

891
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,214
Really un-fucking-believable,
you know?

892
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:30,014
We're taking this guy
Captain Willard up the river,

893
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:33,522
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.

894
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,182
[ Come on, baby ]

895
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:38,193
Thought you might have
heard by now from...

896
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,525
October, 1967.

897
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:43,725
On special assignment,
Kontum province, 11 corps.

898
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,064
Kurtz staged
Operation Archangel

899
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:47,728
with combined local forces.

900
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:50,068
Rated a major success.

901
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:55,737
He received
no official clearance.

902
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:58,747
He just thought it up
and did it.

903
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:02,580
What balls.

904
00:59:02,652 --> 00:59:05,678
They were going to nail
his ass to the floorboards

905
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,017
for that one,

906
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,524
but after the press
got hold of it,

907
00:59:09,593 --> 00:59:12,528
they promoted him
to full colonel instead.

908
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,030
Ah, man.

909
00:59:15,098 --> 00:59:18,192
The bullshit piled up
so fast in Vietnam,

910
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,862
you needed wings
to stay above it.

912
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:50,528
This sure enough
is a bizarre sight

913
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,500
in the middle
of this shit.

914
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,504
They expecting us this time?

915
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:59,667
Damned if I know.

917
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:06,872
Anybody hear me?
Hello? Hello? 1...1...

918
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,110
Jesus.

920
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,717
Let's back up
into this truck.

921
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:17,885
What?

922
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:19,895
We got to get
all this stuff

923
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,225
off the truck.

924
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:29,037
You ever been up
here before, Chef?

925
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:31,369
I bet you could
score up here.

926
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:34,035
Yo, man.
Check out the bikes, man.

927
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,202
Yamahas.

928
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:38,213
Suzuki. Yeah, that's a good one.

929
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:41,375
Yeah. Sukiyaki.
Hey, man. This is...

930
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:47,719
This must be the guy.

931
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,224
Right up there.

933
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:00,569
Three drums of diesel fuel.

934
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:03,538
Come on, man, move.
We don't have time.

935
01:01:03,606 --> 01:01:05,005
What do you want?

936
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:07,168
Can I get some panama red?

937
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:08,437
Panama red? Yeah.

938
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:09,910
Sergeant.

939
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,880
Destination?

940
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:13,381
I don't have
no destination.

941
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,714
I can't do nothing
without a destination.

942
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:17,047
Sergeant.

943
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,055
Without a destination,
I can't do a goddamn thing.

944
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:22,387
Hey, sarge,
these guys are with me.

945
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:23,721
Destination's classified.

946
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:26,728
Here are priority papers
from Com-Sec lntelligence.

947
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:28,058
OK. Right, sir.

948
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:29,894
Listen, it's
a real big night.

949
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:31,433
8 bucks for that Camel.

950
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,763
Hey!

951
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,773
Just give him some fuel.

952
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,103
You got it.

953
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:42,610
Hey, listen, Captain.

954
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:44,271
I'm really sorry
about tonight.

955
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:45,939
It's really bad around here.

956
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:48,450
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk,

957
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:49,780
and you got it.

958
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:52,947
Would you guys like
some seats for the show?

959
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,285
You want those?

960
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:56,791
The show. The show out here.
The bunnies.

961
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,794
What bunnies?
The Playboy bunnies?

962
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:00,295
You got it.

963
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:02,729
Hey, listen, Captain.

964
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,391
On the house.

965
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:06,059
No hard feelings, huh?

967
01:02:43,006 --> 01:02:45,270
How you doing out there?

968
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,777
I said, how you doing
out there?

969
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:53,077
We want to say hello
to all of you out there

970
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:56,084
who worked so goddamn hard
on Operation Brute Force.

971
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:59,679
Hello to all you
paratroopers out there!

972
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:02,782
And the Marines!
And the sailors!

973
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:03,791
- Yay!
- Boo!

974
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,327
We're proud of you.

975
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:08,330
We know how tough
and hard it's been. Yeah.

976
01:03:08,398 --> 01:03:11,663
To prove it, we're going to
give you some entertainment

977
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,224
we know you'll like!

978
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:16,238
Miss August--
Miss Sandra Bayne.

979
01:03:17,874 --> 01:03:20,968
Miss May--Miss Terri Turee!

980
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,568
Yeah!

981
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:24,909
And the Playmate of the Year--

982
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,915
Miss Terri Foster!

983
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,507
Yeah! Let's go!

984
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:33,017
[ Oh, Suzie Q ]

985
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:36,684
[ Oh, Suzie Q ]

986
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:42,030
[ Oh, Suzie Q,
baby, I love you ]

987
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,861
[ Suzie Q ]

988
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:47,699
[ I like the way you walk ]

989
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:51,137
[ I like the way you talk ]

990
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,642
[ I like the way you walk ]

991
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:56,645
[ I like the way you talk ]

992
01:03:56,713 --> 01:03:58,476
[ My Suzie Q ]

993
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:02,150
[ Whoa, Suzie Q ]

994
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:05,621
[ Whoa, Suzie Q ]

995
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:09,287
[ Oh, Suzie Q ]

996
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,122
[ Baby, I love you ]

997
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:13,287
[ Suzie Q ]

998
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:31,980
Grease my gun!

999
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,673
You're cute.
I like you.

1000
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:03,541
I'm here, baby!

1001
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,547
I'm here.

1002
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,020
You fucking bitch!

1003
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:15,182
Take it off!

1004
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:19,721
Hey, lover, you want
us to come over?

1005
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:21,787
I sure do!

1006
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:23,798
Sign my centerfold!

1007
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:25,959
Take it off! Take it off!

1008
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:28,060
Take it off! Take it off!

1009
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,926
Get the girls! Let's go!

1010
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,012
So long.

1011
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,856
Charlie didn't get
much USO.

1012
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:09,371
He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.

1013
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,969
His idea of great R and R

1014
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:17,808
was cold rice
and a little rat meat.

1015
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:22,512
He had only two ways home--

1016
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:24,678
death...

1017
01:07:24,754 --> 01:07:26,051
or victory.

1018
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:40,231
No wonder Kurtz put a weed
up command's ass.

1019
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:47,575
The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns

1020
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:50,077
who'd end up giving
the whole circus away.

1021
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:53,081
Do you believe
I got to come here

1022
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:54,582
and find her here?

1023
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,912
Ho! Shit!

1024
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,077
Like shit.

1025
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,586
Chicken time.

1026
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:01,418
You ain't shitting,
brown motherfucking--

1027
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,058
Who is that?
What's going on?

1028
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:07,494
What the fuck is that?

1029
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:09,155
ls that you, Lazaro?

1030
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:11,757
Come on, man.
Don't chicken out now.

1031
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:27,281
Fire on the canvas!

1032
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,113
I got it! I got it!

1033
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,449
I got it!
Get out of there!

1034
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:36,715
Lance! Lance!

1035
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:16,360
Late summer. Autumn, 1968.

1036
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:18,366
Kurtz's patrols
in the highlands

1037
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,368
coming under
frequent ambush.

1038
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:22,700
The camp started
falling apart.

1039
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:31,212
November.

1040
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,872
Kurtz orders assassination

1041
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:36,214
of three Vietnamese men
and one woman.

1042
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,719
Two of the men
were colonels

1043
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:40,551
in the South Vietnamese Army.

1044
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,892
Enemy activity
in his old sector

1045
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:46,394
dropped off to nothing.

1046
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,131
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.

1047
01:09:53,536 --> 01:09:55,800
He joined
the Special Forces,

1048
01:09:55,872 --> 01:09:59,569
and after that,
his, uh...

1049
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:01,906
The army tried one last time

1050
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:04,503
to bring him
back into the fold.

1051
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,013
lf he'd pulled over,

1052
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:09,176
it alI would have
been forgotten,

1053
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:10,742
but he kept going.

1054
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,256
And he kept
winning it his way.

1055
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:15,585
Montagnard army...

1056
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:17,592
And they called me in.

1057
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,252
...man like a god,

1058
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:21,262
and follow every order,

1059
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,456
however ridiculous.

1060
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:26,801
They lost him.

1061
01:10:28,538 --> 01:10:29,971
He was gone.

1062
01:10:31,274 --> 01:10:34,141
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,

1063
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,144
mostly from captured V.C.

1064
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:39,977
The V.C. knew his name
by now,

1065
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:42,313
and they were
scared of him.

1066
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:44,319
His men were playing
hit and run

1067
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,321
all the way into Cambodia.

1068
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:54,992
I'm going to
the Vietnam White House

1069
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:56,326
to have dinner

1070
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,663
with the president
of the United States.

1071
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,827
That's where I'm going.

1072
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:03,929
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.

1073
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:06,266
Clean.

1074
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,114
How long has that kid
been on this boat?

1075
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:14,774
Seven months.

1076
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:18,445
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.

1077
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:19,783
It's very possible,
Captain,

1078
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:21,948
he thinks the same
of you.

1079
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,959
Oh, yeah?
What do you think, Chief?

1080
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:26,790
I don't think.

1081
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:29,126
My orders say
I'm not supposed to know

1082
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:30,631
where I'm taking this boat,

1083
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,133
but one look at you,

1084
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:34,465
and I know
it's going to be hot,

1085
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:35,799
wherever it is.

1086
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:46,977
We're going upriver

1087
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:49,847
about 75 clicks above
the Do Lung Bridge.

1088
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:55,515
That's Cambodia, Captain.

1089
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:57,183
That's classified.

1090
01:11:57,259 --> 01:11:59,853
We're not supposed
to be in Cambodia,

1091
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:01,521
but that's
where I'm going.

1092
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:04,964
Get me close
to my destination,

1093
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,899
and I'll cut you loose.

1094
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:12,274
All right, Captain.

1095
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:34,958
"Dear son,

1096
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:37,625
"I'm afraid that both you
and your mother

1097
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,635
"will have been worried
at not hearing from me,

1098
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:44,799
"but my situation here has
become a difficult one.

1099
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:47,638
"I have been officially
accused of murder

1100
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,972
by the army."

1101
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,146
"The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.

1102
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,984
"We spent months
uncovering them

1103
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:02,490
and accumulating evidence."

1104
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,095
"When absolute proof
was completed,

1105
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,098
"we acted like soldiers.

1106
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,930
"The charges
are unjustified.

1107
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:14,435
"They are, in fact,

1108
01:13:14,503 --> 01:13:16,767
"and in the circumstances
of this conflict,

1109
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:18,932
quite completely insane."

1110
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:31,882
"ln a war,
there are many moments

1111
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:34,218
"for compassion
and tender action.

1112
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,884
"There are many moments
for ruthless action--

1113
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,893
"what is often
called ruthless--

1114
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:43,057
"but may in many
circumstances be only clarity--

1115
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:45,726
"seeing clearly
what there is to be done

1116
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:51,137
"and doing it--
directly, quickly, awake.

1117
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:52,799
Looking at it."

1118
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:57,311
"I will trust you
to tell your mother

1119
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:59,313
"what you choose
about this letter.

1120
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,474
"As for the charges
against me,

1121
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,245
"I am unconcerned.

1122
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:06,083
"I am beyond their timid,
lying morality,

1123
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:08,589
and so I am beyond caring."

1124
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,751
"You have all my faith.

1125
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:13,590
Your loving father."

1126
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:27,937
Shut the fuck up!

1127
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,602
I'm sure sorry about that.

1128
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,613
lf I'd known,
I'd take you to New Orleans.

1129
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,880
I'll get you fixed up.

1130
01:14:38,954 --> 01:14:41,047
Lay off, Chef.

1131
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:44,058
I want to break
your fucking head!

1132
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:45,889
Lay off, Chef!

1133
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:48,054
When are you going
to do it?

1134
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:50,030
Chef! I said now!

1135
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,657
Chef! Knock it off!

1136
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:54,567
Give him a break!
What did I say?

1137
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:56,605
And give your jaws a rest!

1138
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,230
And this ain't the army.

1139
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,741
You're a sailor!

1140
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,744
Get out of that army shit

1141
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:04,677
and stop smoking that dope!

1142
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:06,180
You hear me?

1143
01:15:10,586 --> 01:15:13,180
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1144
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:14,517
Camouflage.

1145
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,852
How's that?

1146
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:18,223
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere.

1147
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:19,727
Stay awake
up there, man.

1148
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:21,763
You got a job to do.

1149
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:40,615
Sampan off the port bow.

1150
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:42,617
Sampan off the port bow.

1151
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:44,448
Let's take a look.

1152
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,613
Lance, bring 'em in!

1153
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:49,283
Clean, on the 60.
Chef, get a 16.

1154
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,952
Clean, get on that 60!

1155
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:56,126
What's up, Chief?

1156
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:00,301
We're going to take
a routine check.

1157
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:03,566
Let's forget routine now
and let them go.

1158
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:05,573
These boats are
running supplies.

1159
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:07,905
I'm going
to take a look.

1160
01:16:08,978 --> 01:16:10,912
Chief, my mission's
got priority here.

1161
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,915
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

1162
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:15,746
Until we reach
your destination,

1163
01:16:15,818 --> 01:16:17,979
you're just on
for the ride.

1164
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:20,988
Stand by, Lance.
Throw the rope!

1165
01:16:21,056 --> 01:16:22,489
All right, come on.

1166
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:24,150
Let's bring it over.

1167
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:41,365
Look in that hold.
Bring the people out of there.

1168
01:16:47,182 --> 01:16:48,615
Come on.
Hurry up, motherfucker!

1169
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:50,549
Move it, gook!

1171
01:16:52,187 --> 01:16:54,052
Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1172
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:55,852
I got you, Chief.

1173
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:11,302
That's them.
Yeah, they're OK.

1174
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:12,806
Board and search it.

1175
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,638
Ain't nothing on it.

1176
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,200
Board it and search it.

1177
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:18,337
Just baskets and ducks.

1178
01:17:18,414 --> 01:17:19,346
Bananas.

1179
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:20,677
Ain't nothing on it.

1180
01:17:20,749 --> 01:17:23,013
What's wrong with you?
Board and search.

1181
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,349
Look. Just a goat
and some fish.

1182
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:26,353
Chef--

1183
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:27,354
There's nothing--

1184
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,685
Get on that boat!

1185
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,019
There's nothing on it!

1186
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:31,024
Get on it!

1187
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:32,993
All right!
Move it, asshole!

1188
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:34,427
Goddamn it!

1189
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:36,259
Pigs. Look. Mangoes.

1190
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:38,266
What's in the rice bag?

1191
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:39,392
Rice.

1192
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:40,901
Well, look in there!

1193
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:41,937
Fucking fish.

1194
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,596
More coconuts.

1195
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:45,606
Rice. Here's rice.

1196
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,267
What's in that
vegetable basket?

1197
01:17:48,344 --> 01:17:50,278
Get out of here!
Come on.

1198
01:17:50,346 --> 01:17:51,404
Aah!

1199
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,573
Chef, check that
vegetable basket.

1200
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:55,549
Shut up, slope.

1201
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:56,549
Nothing.

1202
01:17:56,618 --> 01:17:57,710
What's in the boxes?

1203
01:17:57,786 --> 01:17:58,753
Nothing.

1204
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:00,618
Look in that tin can.

1205
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:02,623
Just fucking rice!
That's all!

1206
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:03,885
Check the yellow can.

1207
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:04,891
Nothing!

1208
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,689
She was sitting on it.

1209
01:18:10,032 --> 01:18:10,964
Chef!

1210
01:18:14,203 --> 01:18:18,037
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!

1211
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:25,706
Motherfuckers!
Cocksuckers!

1212
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:28,215
Come on!
Let's kill them all!

1213
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:29,341
Huh, idiots?

1214
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:30,908
Fucking cocksucking
mothers!

1215
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:32,078
Hold it!

1216
01:18:32,154 --> 01:18:34,918
Let's shoot the shit
out of all of them!

1217
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:35,922
Hold it!

1218
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:38,391
Why not?
Jesus Christ!

1219
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,553
Why the fuck not?

1220
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,925
Clean.

1221
01:18:42,998 --> 01:18:44,090
I'm good.

1222
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:52,935
You OK, Lance?

1223
01:18:53,008 --> 01:18:54,498
Fucking shit!

1224
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:56,669
Look what she was
hiding, huh?

1225
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:58,007
You all right?

1226
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,514
See what she was
running for?

1227
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:05,146
It's a fucking puppy.

1228
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:09,152
It's a fucking puppy.

1229
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:10,521
Give me that dog!

1230
01:19:10,592 --> 01:19:11,524
No!

1231
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:12,855
Give it to me!

1232
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:15,362
No! Give me
the fucking dog, asshole!

1233
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:16,693
Fuck you!

1234
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:19,358
Take the fucking mango,
too!

1235
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:20,697
You want that?

1236
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,202
Chef, she's moving
behind you.

1237
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:23,704
She's alive.
Check her out.

1238
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:24,704
Fucking--

1239
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:26,206
Chef! She's moving
behind you!

1240
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:27,537
Check her out!

1241
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:28,701
All right.

1242
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,041
Come on, Clean.
Give me a hand.

1243
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:32,375
Give him a hand.

1244
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:33,540
Fucking...

1245
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:36,209
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.

1246
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,549
Slow down
and take it easy.

1247
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,552
Calm down.

1248
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:40,883
Wait a minute.

1249
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:42,218
ls she breathing,
Chef?

1250
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,883
She's hurt.

1251
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:45,859
She's bleeding.

1252
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,361
Bring her on board.
We'll take her to some ARVNs.

1253
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:49,363
What are you talking about?

1254
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,365
I'm taking her
to some friendlies.

1255
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:52,866
She's wounded.
She's not dead.

1256
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:54,368
Get out of there, Chef.

1257
01:19:54,436 --> 01:19:55,664
- The book says, Captain--

1258
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:56,999
Aah!

1259
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,616
Fuck you. Fuck them.

1260
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:11,812
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1261
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:17,221
It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves.

1262
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,224
We'd cut them in half
with a machine gun

1263
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,884
and give them a Band-Aid.

1264
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,062
It was a lie.

1265
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,224
And the more
I saw of them,

1266
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,393
the more I hated lies.

1267
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:36,070
Those boys would never
look at me the same way again,

1268
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:40,077
but I felt like I knew
a few things about Kurtz

1269
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,908
that weren't
in the dossier.

1270
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:49,745
Do Lung Bridge
was the last army outpost

1271
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,254
on the Nung River.

1272
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,921
Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz.

1273
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,795
Lance.

1274
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:03,733
Hey, Lance,
what do you think?

1275
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:04,962
It's beautiful.

1276
01:22:05,037 --> 01:22:08,131
Huh? What's
the matter with you?

1277
01:22:08,206 --> 01:22:10,140
You're acting kind of weird.

1278
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,803
You know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1279
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:14,971
Yeah.

1280
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:16,309
I dropped it.

1281
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:17,814
You dropped acid?

1282
01:22:17,883 --> 01:22:19,976
Far out.

1283
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:22,982
Friendly!

1284
01:22:23,055 --> 01:22:24,647
Friendly! Friendly!

1285
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:34,187
Take me home!
Goddamn it!

1286
01:22:34,266 --> 01:22:37,463
Fucking shore police!
Shit! You want to die?

1287
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,800
Take me home!

1288
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,634
Motherfuckers!

1289
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,469
Hey!
You fucking police!

1290
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,804
Don't leave me!

1291
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,309
Fuck you!

1292
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,471
You'll get
what you deserve!

1293
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:59,319
ls there a Captain Willard
on board?

1294
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,722
Yeah.

1295
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:02,225
Who's that?

1296
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:04,194
Lieutenant Carlson, sir.

1297
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:06,992
Get that light off me!

1298
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,499
I was sent from
Nha Trang with these

1299
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:10,830
three days ago, sir.

1300
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,335
Expected you here sooner.

1301
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,338
This is mail for the boat.

1302
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,499
You don't know
how happy this makes me, sir.

1303
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:18,839
Now I can get out of here--
if I can find a way.

1304
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:26,510
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

1305
01:23:30,055 --> 01:23:31,647
Captain,
where you going?

1306
01:23:31,723 --> 01:23:33,156
I got to find somebody.

1307
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:34,487
I need some information.

1308
01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:37,585
Meet me at the other side
of the bridge.

1309
01:23:37,662 --> 01:23:39,289
Somebody go with him.

1310
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:40,456
Chef.

1311
01:23:40,532 --> 01:23:41,965
I'll go.

1312
01:23:42,033 --> 01:23:43,466
I want to go.

1313
01:24:36,555 --> 01:24:38,785
Man, listen to
the music, man.

1314
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:40,791
Where can l
find the C.O.?

1315
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:42,292
You came
right to it,

1316
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,622
son of a bitch!

1317
01:24:43,695 --> 01:24:44,787
Lance!

1318
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:46,455
Get down here!

1319
01:24:48,867 --> 01:24:51,802
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1320
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,132
Beverly Hills.

1321
01:24:53,205 --> 01:24:54,467
What?

1322
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:55,972
Straight up the road,

1323
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:59,306
there's a fucking bunker
called Beverly Hills.

1324
01:24:59,377 --> 01:25:02,813
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1326
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:40,213
Goddamn it!
You stepped in my face.

1327
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:41,718
I thought you were dead.

1328
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:43,720
You thought wrong,
damn it.

1330
01:25:45,924 --> 01:25:48,757
I told you to stop
fucking with me!

1331
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:50,761
Think you're so bad,
huh, nigger?

1332
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:52,888
What are you
shooting at, soldier?

1333
01:25:52,964 --> 01:25:54,898
What the fuck
do you think?

1334
01:25:54,966 --> 01:25:56,228
I'm sorry, sir.

1335
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:58,235
There are gooks
by the wire.

1336
01:25:58,303 --> 01:25:59,736
I think I killed them.

1337
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:01,931
You ain't shot shit, man.
Listen.

1339
01:26:03,942 --> 01:26:06,604
He's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.

1340
01:26:14,986 --> 01:26:17,250
You think
you so bad, nigger?

1341
01:26:17,322 --> 01:26:18,846
They're all dead,
stupid.

1342
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,517
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1343
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,584
Who's
the commanding officer?

1344
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:25,596
Ain't you?

1345
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:29,933
You think
you so bad, huh?

1346
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:32,265
I got something for
your ass, nigger!

1347
01:26:32,337 --> 01:26:34,271
I got something
for you now!

1348
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,104
He's underneath
the bodies, man.

1349
01:26:42,013 --> 01:26:43,275
Go get the roach,
nigger!

1350
01:26:43,348 --> 01:26:44,440
I'll get the roach.

1351
01:26:44,516 --> 01:26:45,710
Go get him.

1353
01:26:49,387 --> 01:26:50,649
Roach.

1354
01:26:50,722 --> 01:26:52,383
Roach.

1355
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,719
Roach.

1356
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,726
You got slopes
on the wires.

1357
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:56,954
You hear him?

1358
01:26:57,028 --> 01:26:58,290
Lance!

1359
01:26:58,363 --> 01:26:59,796
Do you hear him?

1361
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:05,568
Well, bust him.

1362
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,241
Hey, G.I.s!
Fuck you!

1365
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,587
You hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1366
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,247
Yeah.

1367
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,950
I kill you, G.I.s!

1368
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:28,686
You need a flare?

1369
01:27:30,428 --> 01:27:31,690
No.

1370
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:35,198
He's close, man.

1371
01:27:35,266 --> 01:27:37,860
He's real close.

1373
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,682
G.I.s, fuck you!

1374
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,227
G.I.s!

1375
01:28:05,296 --> 01:28:06,593
G.I.s! Fuck y--

1376
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:14,200
Motherfucker.

1377
01:28:14,272 --> 01:28:15,864
Hey, soldier.

1378
01:28:19,944 --> 01:28:22,538
Do you know
who's in command here?

1379
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:26,783
Yeah.

1380
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,664
Aah!
Aah!

1381
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,223
Holy shit.

1382
01:28:47,372 --> 01:28:50,466
Chief, two guys just got
blown off that bridge.

1383
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:53,477
You hang on, man.
You're going to be OK.

1384
01:28:57,382 --> 01:28:58,644
What's that?

1385
01:28:58,716 --> 01:28:59,648
Mail, man.

1386
01:28:59,717 --> 01:29:02,277
Later on mail.
Watch them trees.

1387
01:29:04,289 --> 01:29:05,551
There's no diesel fuel,

1388
01:29:05,623 --> 01:29:07,557
But I picked up
some ammo.

1389
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:08,557
Move out.

1390
01:29:08,626 --> 01:29:10,719
Did you find
the C.O., Captain?

1391
01:29:10,795 --> 01:29:12,888
There's no fucking C.O.
here.

1392
01:29:14,632 --> 01:29:16,896
Let's just get going.

1393
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:18,401
Which way, Captain?

1394
01:29:24,008 --> 01:29:25,873
You know which way, Chief.

1395
01:29:27,178 --> 01:29:29,112
You're on your own,
Captain.

1396
01:29:30,348 --> 01:29:32,043
StilI want to go on?

1397
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,710
Like this bridge--
we build it every night,

1398
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,378
Charlie
blows it up again.

1399
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,582
Just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1400
01:29:39,657 --> 01:29:41,386
Think about it.

1401
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,390
Who cares?

1402
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,658
Just get us upriver!

1403
01:29:51,402 --> 01:29:52,892
Chef,

1404
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,064
on the bow.

1405
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,572
Stand by, Clean.

1406
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,608
Let's go!

1407
01:30:54,165 --> 01:30:55,564
Whose package is that?

1408
01:30:55,633 --> 01:30:57,066
You got another one, Clean.

1409
01:30:57,135 --> 01:30:59,399
No shit.
Wait, is that it?

1410
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:01,700
That's it for you.
Lance!

1411
01:31:01,773 --> 01:31:04,071
Mr. L.B. Johnson.

1412
01:31:04,142 --> 01:31:05,734
There you go.

1413
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:08,074
Far out, man.
All right!

1414
01:31:08,146 --> 01:31:10,080
I've been waiting
for this one.

1415
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:11,410
I got another one.

1416
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,416
I got a box from Eva.

1417
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:14,917
"Lance, I hope you're fine."

1418
01:31:14,986 --> 01:31:15,918
I'm fine!

1419
01:31:19,324 --> 01:31:21,758
I'm going to get
back to Antoine's.

1420
01:31:21,826 --> 01:31:23,760
How could I fucking
forget, man?

1421
01:31:23,828 --> 01:31:26,388
Man, you know,
that's the best.

1422
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:27,726
"There could never be

1423
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:29,562
"a place like Disneyland,
or could there?

1424
01:31:29,634 --> 01:31:31,067
Let me know."

1425
01:31:31,135 --> 01:31:32,568
Jim, it's here.

1426
01:31:32,637 --> 01:31:34,002
It really is here.

1427
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,176
"There has been
a new development

1428
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:41,506
"regarding your mission

1429
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,843
"which we must now
communicate to you.

1430
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,043
"Months ago, a man
was ordered on a mission

1431
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:48,380
"identical to yours.

1432
01:31:48,453 --> 01:31:49,886
"We have reason to believe

01:31:49,954 --> 01:31:52,548
"that he is now operating
with Colonel Kurtz.

carrying him MlA

"but they assumed
he was dead.

"Then they intercepted
a letter

1438

he tried to send
to his wife."

1439
01:32:06,404 --> 01:32:08,338
Captain Richard Colby.

1440
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:12,334
He was with Kurtz.

1441
01:32:13,478 --> 01:32:15,241
Disneyland.

1442
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:18,749
Fuck, man, this is
better than Disneyland.

1443
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,909
"Charles Miller Manson

1444

as a symbol of protest."

1446
01:32:25,156 --> 01:32:27,090
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1447
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:29,092
Purple Haze. Look.

1448
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,094
Lance, give me that smoke.

1449
01:32:31,162 --> 01:32:33,426
I got a tape from my mom.

1450
01:32:33,498 --> 01:32:34,556
Reality, man.

1451
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:37,066
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1452
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,070
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.

1453
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,072
She pictures me at home

1454
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,404
having a beer, watching TV.

1455
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,103
Hey, Lance, man.

1456
01:32:47,178 --> 01:32:49,578
Ooh! Hot potato!
Hot potato!

1457
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,911
So glad you decided
to join the--

1458
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,245
Hey, Eva's not sure

1459
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:55,581
she could have
a relationship with me.

1460
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,747
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away,

1461
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:01,587
trying to keep
a relationship with my ass.

1462
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,524
...that's more
than I can say

1463
01:33:03,594 --> 01:33:05,824
for some of
your friends.

1464
01:33:05,897 --> 01:33:07,831
lf this tape is any good,

1465
01:33:07,899 --> 01:33:10,163
I will have dad
and the family

1466
01:33:10,234 --> 01:33:11,496
send you a tape.

1467
01:33:11,569 --> 01:33:12,661
Hey, Lance.

1468
01:33:31,389 --> 01:33:32,822
There! Over there!

1469
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:37,293
Motherfucker!

1470
01:33:58,382 --> 01:33:59,815
Chef! Chef!

1471
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,476
Check out Clean!

1472
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:03,213
Captain, he's hit.
Clean's hit!

1473
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:06,154
Where'd the dog go?

1474
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,658
Lance,
check out Clean!

1475
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:12,560
Where's the dog?
We got to go back and get the dog!

1476
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,222
Hey, Clean!

1477
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:15,560
Hey.

1478
01:34:15,633 --> 01:34:18,067
Hey, bubba!

1479
01:34:18,136 --> 01:34:20,866
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1480
01:34:22,273 --> 01:34:23,706
Hey, bubba!

1481
01:34:23,775 --> 01:34:27,040
And so I'm hoping
that pretty soon,

1482
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:29,045
but not too soon,

1483
01:34:29,113 --> 01:34:30,273
but pretty soon,

1484
01:34:30,348 --> 01:34:31,940
I'll have lots
of grandchildren

1485
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:33,950
to love and spoil.

1486
01:34:34,018 --> 01:34:36,282
Then when your wife
gets them back,

1487
01:34:36,354 --> 01:34:39,289
she'll be mad with me.
Ha ha ha.

1488
01:34:39,357 --> 01:34:41,791
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama

1489
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:44,794
will come to celebrate
your coming home.

1490
01:34:44,862 --> 01:34:47,797
Granny and Dad are trying
to get enough money

1491
01:34:47,865 --> 01:34:49,298
to get you a car,

1492
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:53,463
but don't tell them
because that's our secret.

1493
01:34:53,538 --> 01:34:56,803
Anyhow, do the right thing,

1494
01:34:56,874 --> 01:34:59,308
stay out of the way
of the bullets,

1495
01:34:59,377 --> 01:35:03,143
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece

1496
01:35:03,214 --> 01:35:05,739
because we love you
very much.

1497
01:35:05,817 --> 01:35:07,580
Love, Mom.

1498
01:36:55,526 --> 01:36:58,461
Can't see nothing.
We're stopping.

1499
01:36:58,529 --> 01:37:01,623
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1500
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:03,564
I can't see a thing,
Captain.

1501
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:04,896
I'm stopping this boat.

1502
01:37:04,969 --> 01:37:06,903
I ain't risking
no more lives.

1503
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:09,235
I'm in command here,
goddamn it.

1504
01:37:09,307 --> 01:37:10,899
You'lI do what I say.

1505
01:37:10,975 --> 01:37:13,409
You see anything, Chef?

1506
01:37:15,813 --> 01:37:18,077
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1508
01:37:37,001 --> 01:37:38,935
Watch it over here, Chief!

1509
01:37:40,504 --> 01:37:42,267
Let's do it.

1510
01:37:44,342 --> 01:37:46,435
Lance, on the 50.

1511
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:48,273
He was close.

1512
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:52,615
He was real close.

1513
01:37:54,018 --> 01:37:57,454
I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him,

1514
01:37:57,521 --> 01:37:59,955
as if the boat
were being sucked upriver

1515
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:02,549
and the water was flowing
back into the jungle.

1516
01:38:04,895 --> 01:38:06,954
Whatever was going
to happen,

1517
01:38:07,031 --> 01:38:09,727
it wouldn't be
the way they called it

1518
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,062
back in Nha Trang.

1519
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,507
Arrows!

1520
01:38:17,575 --> 01:38:19,509
Chef!

1521
01:38:20,745 --> 01:38:23,509
Chef, open up fire!

1522
01:38:27,084 --> 01:38:30,019
Lance, fire!

1523
01:38:36,861 --> 01:38:38,453
Chef!

1524
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,827
Chef, it's OK!
Quit firing!

1525
01:38:40,898 --> 01:38:42,422
They're just little toy arrows!

1526
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,627
Cut it out! Quiet!

1527
01:38:44,702 --> 01:38:47,296
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1528
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:50,340
They're just trying
to scare us.

1529
01:38:50,408 --> 01:38:52,467
Quiet!

1530
01:38:52,543 --> 01:38:54,977
You can't get us
out of this mess

1531
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:58,015
Because you don't know
where the hell you're going.

1532
01:38:58,082 --> 01:38:59,344
Do you?

1533
01:39:00,918 --> 01:39:02,442
You son of a bitch!

1534
01:39:31,816 --> 01:39:33,249
A spear.

1535
01:40:52,997 --> 01:40:55,261
My mission was
to get into Cambodia.

1536
01:40:55,332 --> 01:40:57,596
There's a Green Beret
Colonel up there

1537
01:40:57,668 --> 01:40:58,930
who's gone insane.

1538
01:40:59,003 --> 01:41:00,766
I was supposed
to kill him.

1539
01:41:02,006 --> 01:41:04,270
That's fucking typical.

1540
01:41:04,341 --> 01:41:06,775
Shit!
Fucking Vietnam mission.

1541
01:41:06,844 --> 01:41:10,109
I'm short,
and we got to go up there

1542
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:12,615
so you can kill
one of our guys.

1543
01:41:12,683 --> 01:41:15,151
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man!

1544
01:41:15,219 --> 01:41:18,985
Shit! That's fucking crazy!

1545
01:41:19,056 --> 01:41:21,320
I thought
you were going in

1546
01:41:21,392 --> 01:41:22,825
to blow up a bridge

1547
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:25,919
or some fucking railroad
tracks or something.

1548
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,088
Sorry.

1549
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:28,426
No. No, wait.

1550
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:30,763
We'll go together
on the boat.

1551
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:32,096
We'll go with you.

1552
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,763
We'll go up there,
but on the boat.

1553
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:35,930
OK?

1554
01:42:42,339 --> 01:42:45,775
Part of me was afraid
of what I would find

1555
01:42:45,843 --> 01:42:49,279
and what I would do
when I got there.

1556
01:42:49,346 --> 01:42:50,813
I knew the risks...

1557
01:42:52,383 --> 01:42:54,283
or imagined I knew.

1558
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,114
But the thing
I felt the most,

1559
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:02,124
much stronger than fear,

1560
01:43:02,192 --> 01:43:04,888
was the desire
to confront him.

1561
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,893
Just keep moving.

1562
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:23,065
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1563
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:51,553
It's all right! It's all right!

1564
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:53,562
It's all been approved!

1565
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:55,564
I ain't coming in there!

1566
01:45:55,632 --> 01:45:57,190
Them bastards attacked us!

1567
01:45:57,267 --> 01:46:00,202
Come on!
Zap them with your siren, man!

1568
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,760
Zap them
with your siren!

1570
01:46:11,882 --> 01:46:14,316
There's mines over there
and over there, too!

1571
01:46:14,384 --> 01:46:17,319
And watch out.
Those goddamn monkeys bite you.

1572
01:46:17,387 --> 01:46:19,150
Wow. That's a pretty one.

1573
01:46:19,223 --> 01:46:21,521
Move it right in
toward me.

1574
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,218
I'm an American.

1575
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:26,626
Yeah! American civilian.
Hi, yanks.

1576
01:46:26,697 --> 01:46:29,131
Hi. American.

1577
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,633
American civilian.
It's all right.

1578
01:46:31,702 --> 01:46:33,135
You got the cigarettes.

1579
01:46:33,203 --> 01:46:35,637
That's what I've
been dreaming of.

1580
01:46:35,706 --> 01:46:36,638
Chef...

1581
01:46:36,707 --> 01:46:38,641
Who are you?

1582
01:46:38,709 --> 01:46:40,142
Who are you?

1583
01:46:44,214 --> 01:46:45,875
I'm a photojournalist.

1584
01:46:45,949 --> 01:46:48,383
I've covered the war
since '64.

1585
01:46:48,452 --> 01:46:52,149
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia, Nam.

1586
01:46:52,222 --> 01:46:54,315
A-phew-whee!

1587
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:55,653
Phew-whee, baby!

1588
01:46:55,726 --> 01:46:57,159
I'll tell you one thing.

1589
01:46:57,227 --> 01:46:58,785
This boat is a mess, man.

1590
01:46:58,862 --> 01:47:01,330
Who are all these people?

1591
01:47:01,398 --> 01:47:03,832
They think you've come to...

1592
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:06,495
to take him away.

1593
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:08,834
I hope
that isn't true.

1594
01:47:08,906 --> 01:47:11,340
Take who away?

1595
01:47:11,408 --> 01:47:13,342
Him!

1596
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,241
Colonel Kurtz.

1597
01:47:15,312 --> 01:47:17,507
These are all
his children, man,

1598
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:19,139
As far as you can see.

1599
01:47:19,216 --> 01:47:23,016
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1600
01:47:23,086 --> 01:47:26,613
Could we, uh,
talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1601
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:27,679
Hey, man,

1602
01:47:27,758 --> 01:47:30,352
you don't talk
to the colonel.

1603
01:47:30,427 --> 01:47:32,952
You listen to him.

1604
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:36,431
Uh...the man's
enlarged my mind.

1605
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:40,129
He's a poet-warrior
in the classic sense.

1606
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:43,138
I mean, sometimes,
you'll say hello to him.

1607
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:45,140
He'll just
walk right by you.

1608
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,641
He won't
even notice you.

1609
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,644
Then suddenly
he'll grab you,

1610
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:50,646
throw you in a corner,
and say,

1611
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:54,650
"do you know that if
is the middle word in life?

1612
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:57,653
lf you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you--"

1613
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,780
I can't--
I'm a little man.

1614
01:47:59,856 --> 01:48:01,653
He's a great man.

1615
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:04,660
I should have been
a pair of ragged claws

1616
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,662
scuttling across floors
of silent seas.

1617
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,664
Stay with the boat.

1618
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:11,166
Don't go
without me, OK?

1619
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:13,168
I want to
get a picture.

1620
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,172
He can be terrible,

1621
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,673
and he can be mean,

1622
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,676
and he can be right.

1623
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,235
He's fighting the war.

1624
01:48:23,313 --> 01:48:24,644
He's a great man.

1625
01:48:27,484 --> 01:48:28,610
I mean...

1626
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:33,617
I wish I had words.

1627
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,123
I wish I had words.

1628
01:48:35,192 --> 01:48:37,126
I could tell you something like

1629
01:48:37,194 --> 01:48:39,628
the other day,
he wanted to kill me.

1630
01:48:39,696 --> 01:48:41,630
Why did he
want to kill you?

1631
01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:43,131
Because I took his picture.

1632
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,637
He said, "if you take
my picture again,

1633
01:48:47,704 --> 01:48:50,138
I'm going to kill you."

1634
01:48:50,207 --> 01:48:51,868
And he meant it.

1635
01:48:54,077 --> 01:48:56,910
So you just lay cool,
play it cool,

1636
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:58,641
Lay back, dig it?

1637
01:48:58,715 --> 01:49:01,183
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1638
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:03,378
But you don't--
You don't--

1639
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,148
You don't judge
the colonel.

1640
01:49:05,222 --> 01:49:06,985
You don't judge the colonel

1641
01:49:07,057 --> 01:49:08,490
like
an ordinary man.

1642
01:49:14,331 --> 01:49:15,662
OK, watch it now.

1643
01:49:15,732 --> 01:49:17,996
These are Americans!
American!

1644
01:49:18,068 --> 01:49:20,002
Feel the vibe
of this place.

1645
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:21,594
Let me
take your picture.

1646
01:49:21,672 --> 01:49:23,105
Hey, could you--
Hello?

1647
01:49:23,173 --> 01:49:25,266
Could you hold it
a minute?

1649
01:49:47,698 --> 01:49:48,926
Colby.

1650
01:50:05,115 --> 01:50:07,242
The heads.

1651
01:50:07,317 --> 01:50:09,649
You're looking
at the heads.

1652
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,814
Hey, sometimes
he goes too far.

1653
01:50:12,889 --> 01:50:15,653
He's the first one
to admit it.

1654
01:50:15,726 --> 01:50:17,660
He's gone crazy.

1655
01:50:17,728 --> 01:50:19,161
Wrong! Wrong!

1656
01:50:19,229 --> 01:50:21,857
lf you could have
heard the man

1657
01:50:21,932 --> 01:50:23,365
just two days ago...

1658
01:50:23,433 --> 01:50:25,594
lf you could have
heard him then.

1659
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:28,604
You're going to call him crazy?

1660
01:50:28,672 --> 01:50:29,832
Fuckin' A.

1661
01:50:31,842 --> 01:50:33,400
I just want
to talk to him.

1662
01:50:35,579 --> 01:50:37,604
Well, man,
he's gone away.

1663
01:50:37,681 --> 01:50:40,115
Disappeared
out in the jungle

1664
01:50:40,183 --> 01:50:41,616
with his people.

1665
01:50:41,685 --> 01:50:43,118
I'll wait for him.

1666
01:50:43,186 --> 01:50:44,619
He feels comfortable
with his people.

1667
01:50:44,688 --> 01:50:47,282
He forgets himself
with his people.

1668
01:50:49,693 --> 01:50:51,126
He forgets himself.

1669
01:50:51,194 --> 01:50:52,126
Captain.

1670
01:50:52,195 --> 01:50:54,629
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1671
01:50:54,698 --> 01:50:55,630
OK, Chef.

1672
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:58,998
We'll go back
to the boat for a while.

1673
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:02,061
Yeah.
Stay with Lance.

1676
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:27,495
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1677
01:51:27,564 --> 01:51:28,997
He's worse than crazy--

1678
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:30,259
He's evil.

1679
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,767
That's what the man's
got set up here.

1680
01:51:32,836 --> 01:51:34,770
Man, it's fucking
pagan idolatry!

1681
01:51:34,838 --> 01:51:36,499
Look around you.

1682
01:51:36,573 --> 01:51:38,006
Shit, he's loco.

1683
01:51:38,074 --> 01:51:39,507
Then you'll help me?

1684
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:41,601
Help you? fuckin' A,
I'll help you.

1685
01:51:41,678 --> 01:51:44,112
I'lI do anything to
get out of this joint.

1686
01:51:44,181 --> 01:51:46,115
We could blow
all them assholes away.

1687
01:51:46,183 --> 01:51:48,117
They're so fucking
spaced out,

1688
01:51:48,185 --> 01:51:49,618
they wouldn't
even know it.

1689
01:51:49,686 --> 01:51:52,621
I ain't afraid of
all them fucking skulls

1690
01:51:52,689 --> 01:51:55,089
and altars and shit.

1691
01:51:56,359 --> 01:52:00,557
I used to think if
I died in an evil place,

1692
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,621
then my soul
wouldn't be able

1693
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:04,132
to make it to heaven.

1694
01:52:04,201 --> 01:52:05,634
But now...

1695
01:52:05,702 --> 01:52:07,727
Fuck.

1696
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:10,136
I mean, I don't care
where it goes

1697
01:52:10,207 --> 01:52:12,141
as long as
it ain't here.

1698
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:14,143
So what do you
want to do?

1699
01:52:14,211 --> 01:52:15,644
I'll kill the fuck.

1700
01:52:15,712 --> 01:52:17,145
Get out of here.

1701
01:52:17,214 --> 01:52:18,704
I'm going to need you
to wait here.

1702
01:52:18,782 --> 01:52:20,647
I'll go up with Lance,
scrounge around,

1703
01:52:20,717 --> 01:52:22,207
check the place out,

1704
01:52:22,285 --> 01:52:26,221
see if I can find
the colonel. OK?

1705
01:52:26,289 --> 01:52:29,224
What do you
want me to do?

1706
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:30,224
Damn it.

1707
01:52:30,293 --> 01:52:32,727
Here.
Here, take the radio,

1708
01:52:32,796 --> 01:52:35,731
and if l
don't get back

1709
01:52:35,799 --> 01:52:37,562
by 2200 hours,

1710
01:52:37,634 --> 01:52:40,262
you'll call in
the air strike.

1711
01:52:43,306 --> 01:52:44,603
Air strike?

1712
01:52:46,309 --> 01:52:47,901
The code is "Almighty,"

1713
01:52:47,978 --> 01:52:51,470
coordinates
0-niner-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1714
01:52:51,548 --> 01:52:53,243
It's all in there.

1715
01:52:55,318 --> 01:52:58,082
0-niner-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1716
01:53:06,263 --> 01:53:10,165
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

1717
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:16,138
The place
was full of bodies--

1718
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:20,734
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.

1719
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:29,084
lf I was still alive,

1720
01:53:29,152 --> 01:53:31,586
it was because
he wanted me that way.

1722
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:41,996
Hey!

1723
01:54:04,688 --> 01:54:08,624
It smelled like
slow death in there.

1724
01:54:08,692 --> 01:54:10,717
Malaria...

1725
01:54:10,794 --> 01:54:12,557
Nightmares.

1726
01:54:14,798 --> 01:54:17,596
This was the end
of the river all right.

1727
01:54:31,648 --> 01:54:33,582
Where are you from,
Willard?

1728
01:54:38,221 --> 01:54:40,689
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1730
01:54:46,029 --> 01:54:47,963
Were you born there?

1731
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:50,591
Yes.

1732
01:54:50,667 --> 01:54:52,601
Whereabouts?

1733
01:54:52,669 --> 01:54:54,534
Toledo, sir.

1734
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,903
How far are you
from the river?

1735
01:55:09,686 --> 01:55:11,347
The Ohio River,
sir?

1736
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:13,787
Uh-huh.

1737
01:55:13,857 --> 01:55:15,484
About 200 miles.

1738
01:55:23,133 --> 01:55:26,569
I went down that river once
when I was a kid.

1739
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:33,475
There's a place
in the river--

1740
01:55:33,543 --> 01:55:34,976
I can't remember.

1741
01:55:35,045 --> 01:55:37,070
Must have been
a gardenia plantation

1742
01:55:37,147 --> 01:55:40,082
or a flower plantation
at one time.

1743
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:42,584
It's all wild
and overgrown now,

1744
01:55:42,652 --> 01:55:46,053
but for about 5 miles,

1745
01:55:46,122 --> 01:55:50,582
you'd think that heaven
just fell on the Earth

1746
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,094
in the form
of gardenias.

1747
01:56:08,178 --> 01:56:09,907
Have you ever considered...

1748
01:56:12,048 --> 01:56:14,312
any real freedoms?

1749
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:23,287
Freedoms from the opinion
of others...

1750
01:56:26,096 --> 01:56:28,223
even the opinions
of yourself?

1751
01:56:44,047 --> 01:56:48,484
Did they say why...
Willard...

1752
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:55,683
why they want
to terminate my command?

1753
01:57:10,406 --> 01:57:13,773
I was sent on a
classified mission, sir.

1754
01:57:16,746 --> 01:57:19,806
It's no longer classified,

1755
01:57:19,883 --> 01:57:20,815
is it?

1756
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,990
What did they tell you?

1757
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,959
They told me...

1758
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:37,056
that you had gone...

1759
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,930
totally insane.

1760
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:42,631
And, uh...

1761
01:57:42,705 --> 01:57:46,641
that your...
methods were...

1762
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:47,971
unsound.

1763
01:57:51,514 --> 01:57:53,778
Are my methods unsound?

1764
01:57:59,422 --> 01:58:01,982
I don't see...

1765
01:58:02,058 --> 01:58:06,427
any method...
at all, sir.

1766
01:58:12,902 --> 01:58:17,100
I expected...
someone like you.

1767
01:58:19,742 --> 01:58:21,266
What did you expect?

1768
01:58:29,385 --> 01:58:31,216
Are you an assassin?

1769
01:58:35,959 --> 01:58:37,119
I'm a soldier.

1770
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:42,062
You're neither.

1771
01:58:44,601 --> 01:58:47,570
You're an errand boy...

1772
01:58:47,637 --> 01:58:49,969
sent by grocery clerks...

1773
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,541
to collect a bill.

1774
01:59:39,188 --> 01:59:41,213
Why, huh?

1775
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:44,089
Why would
a nice guy like you

1776
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:46,128
want to kill a genius?

1777
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:54,135
Going in
pretty good, huh?

1778
01:59:54,203 --> 01:59:55,636
Why?

1779
01:59:57,707 --> 01:59:59,641
You know...

1780
01:59:59,709 --> 02:00:02,644
do you know
that the man...

1781
02:00:04,714 --> 02:00:07,444
the man
really likes you?

1782
02:00:10,219 --> 02:00:12,153
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1783
02:00:12,221 --> 02:00:13,654
But...

1784
02:00:13,723 --> 02:00:17,159
he's got something
in mind for you.

1785
02:00:17,226 --> 02:00:19,592
Aren't you
curious about that?

1786
02:00:19,662 --> 02:00:21,596
I'm curious.

1787
02:00:21,664 --> 02:00:23,598
I'm very curious.

1788
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:26,430
Are you curious?

1789
02:00:28,404 --> 02:00:31,601
There's something
happening out here, man.

1790
02:00:33,676 --> 02:00:35,109
You know something, man?

1791
02:00:35,178 --> 02:00:37,703
I know something
that you don't know.

1792
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:39,611
That's right, jack.

1793
02:00:39,682 --> 02:00:43,618
The man is clear
in his mind,

1794
02:00:43,686 --> 02:00:46,120
but his soul is mad.

1795
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:49,124
Oh, yeah.

1796
02:00:49,192 --> 02:00:51,126
He's dying, I think.

1797
02:00:51,194 --> 02:00:54,630
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1798
02:00:54,697 --> 02:00:59,191
But the man's, uh...

1799
02:01:02,205 --> 02:01:05,641
He reads poetry
out loud, all right?

1800
02:01:07,009 --> 02:01:09,136
And a voice...

1801
02:01:09,212 --> 02:01:11,146
A voice...

1802
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:16,652
He likes you 'cause
you're still alive.

1803
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:19,153
He's got plans for you.

1804
02:01:19,222 --> 02:01:21,588
I'm not going to help you.

1805
02:01:21,657 --> 02:01:24,592
You're going to help him.
You're going to help him.

1806
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:29,097
What are they going to say
when he's gone?

1807
02:01:29,165 --> 02:01:31,099
'Cause he dies when it dies--

1808
02:01:31,167 --> 02:01:32,600
When it dies, he dies.

1809
02:01:32,668 --> 02:01:35,102
What are they going
to say about him?

1810
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:38,607
That he was a kind man,
he was a wise man?

1811
02:01:38,674 --> 02:01:41,108
He had plans,
he had wisdom?

1812
02:01:41,177 --> 02:01:42,804
Bullshit, man!

1813
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:46,110
Am I going to be the one
to set them straight?

1814
02:01:46,182 --> 02:01:47,479
Look at me--
Wrong.

1815
02:01:50,686 --> 02:01:52,916
You.

1816
02:01:56,692 --> 02:01:59,388
Almost eight hours.

1817
02:02:01,597 --> 02:02:03,758
God.

1818
02:02:03,833 --> 02:02:05,733
I'm asleep.

1819
02:02:07,203 --> 02:02:10,434
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1820
02:02:22,151 --> 02:02:23,482
Fuck.

1821
02:02:27,156 --> 02:02:29,681
Has it been
eight hours?

1822
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:34,585
Hello, Almighty,
Almighty.

1823
02:02:34,664 --> 02:02:37,098
This is PBR Street Gang.

1824
02:02:37,166 --> 02:02:39,361
Radio check, over.

1825
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:40,868
PBR Street Gang,

1826
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:42,928
this is Almighty
standing by, over.

1827
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:04,350
Ooh! Ooh!

1828
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:08,850
Oh, Jesus!

1829
02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:17,597
Oh, Christ!

1830
02:04:19,569 --> 02:04:20,900
Oh!

1831
02:06:44,714 --> 02:06:46,648
"We are the hollow men,

1832
02:06:46,716 --> 02:06:48,650
"We are the stuffed men,

1833
02:06:48,718 --> 02:06:54,247
"Leaning together
headpiece filled with straw.

1834
02:06:54,323 --> 02:06:59,158
"Alas! Our dried voices
when we whisper together

1835
02:06:59,228 --> 02:07:01,253
"Are quiet
and meaningless

1836
02:07:01,330 --> 02:07:04,663
As wind in dry grass..."

1837
02:07:04,734 --> 02:07:06,531
Oh, he's out there.

1838
02:07:06,602 --> 02:07:09,662
He's really out there.

1839
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:11,172
"Shape without form..."

1840
02:07:12,742 --> 02:07:14,607
"Shade without color.

1841
02:07:14,677 --> 02:07:18,408
"Paralyzed force...

1842
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:19,914
Gesture without motion."

1843
02:07:19,982 --> 02:07:22,849
Do you know
what the man's saying?

1844
02:07:22,918 --> 02:07:24,783
Do you?

1845
02:07:24,854 --> 02:07:26,287
This is dialectics.

1846
02:07:26,355 --> 02:07:28,619
It's very simple dialectics--

1847
02:07:28,691 --> 02:07:30,124
One through nine.

1848
02:07:30,192 --> 02:07:32,126
No maybes, no supposes,
no fractions.

1849
02:07:32,194 --> 02:07:33,627
You can't
travel in space.

1850
02:07:33,696 --> 02:07:36,130
You can't go out into
space with fractions.

1851
02:07:36,198 --> 02:07:38,632
What are you going
to land on? 1/4, 3/8?

1852
02:07:38,701 --> 02:07:40,635
What are you going to do

1853
02:07:40,703 --> 02:07:42,637
when you go
from here to Venus?

1854
02:07:42,705 --> 02:07:44,138
That's dialectic physics.

1855
02:07:44,206 --> 02:07:46,640
Dialectic logic is
there's only love and hate.

1856
02:07:46,709 --> 02:07:48,904
You either love somebody
or you hate them.

1857
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:57,485
This is the way
the fucking world ends.

1858
02:07:57,553 --> 02:08:00,488
Look at this fucking
shit we're in, man!

1859
02:08:00,556 --> 02:08:02,490
Not with a bang...
a whimper.

1860
02:08:02,558 --> 02:08:05,356
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.

1861
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:36,056
On the river,

1862
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:38,958
I thought that the minute
I looked at him

1863
02:08:39,028 --> 02:08:40,427
I'd know what to do.

1864
02:08:40,496 --> 02:08:43,465
But it didn't happen.

1865
02:08:43,532 --> 02:08:46,126
I was in there
with him for days,

1866
02:08:46,202 --> 02:08:47,726
not under guard.

1867
02:08:47,803 --> 02:08:49,236
I was free.

1868
02:08:49,305 --> 02:08:52,138
But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.

1869
02:08:52,208 --> 02:08:55,143
He knew more about
what I was going to do

1870
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:56,974
than I did.

1871
02:09:02,685 --> 02:09:05,984
lf the generals
back in Nha Trang

1872
02:09:06,055 --> 02:09:08,489
could see what I saw,

1873
02:09:08,557 --> 02:09:12,357
would they stilI want me
to kill him?

1874
02:09:12,428 --> 02:09:14,487
More than ever, probably.

1875
02:09:14,563 --> 02:09:17,999
What would his people
back home want

1876
02:09:18,067 --> 02:09:22,595
if they learned how far
from them he'd really gone?

1877
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,571
He broke from them,

1878
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,438
and then he broke
from himself.

1879
02:09:27,509 --> 02:09:32,947
I'd never seen a man
so broken up and ripped apart.

1880
02:09:33,015 --> 02:09:35,950
I've seen horrors,

1881
02:09:36,018 --> 02:09:38,452
horrors that you've seen.

1882
02:09:40,022 --> 02:09:42,957
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1883
02:09:43,025 --> 02:09:45,960
You have a right
to kill me.

1884
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:48,963
You have a right
to do that.

1885
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:52,967
But you have no right
to judge me.

1886
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:02,636
It's impossible
for words...

1887
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:06,169
to describe...

1888
02:10:06,248 --> 02:10:10,981
what is necessary...

1889
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:16,650
to those
who do not know

1890
02:10:16,725 --> 02:10:20,252
what horror means.

1891
02:10:21,563 --> 02:10:22,928
Horror.

1892
02:10:25,501 --> 02:10:29,938
Horror has a face...

1893
02:10:30,005 --> 02:10:34,442
and you must
make a friend of horror.

1894
02:10:34,510 --> 02:10:39,948
Horror and moral terror
are your friends.

1895
02:10:40,015 --> 02:10:45,453
lf they are not, then they
are enemies to be feared.

1896
02:10:45,521 --> 02:10:48,456
They are truly enemies.

1897
02:10:53,028 --> 02:10:58,125
I remember when l
was with Special Forces.

1898
02:11:00,536 --> 02:11:04,973
It seems
a thousand centuries ago.

1899
02:11:08,043 --> 02:11:14,607
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1900
02:11:18,554 --> 02:11:20,988
We'd left the camp...

1901
02:11:21,056 --> 02:11:25,925
after we had inoculated
the children for polio,

1902
02:11:25,995 --> 02:11:29,089
and this old man
came running after us,

1903
02:11:29,164 --> 02:11:30,597
and he was crying.

1904
02:11:30,666 --> 02:11:33,931
He couldn't say--

1905
02:11:34,003 --> 02:11:35,937
We went back there.

1906
02:11:36,005 --> 02:11:42,934
They had come and hacked off
every inoculated arm.

1907
02:11:43,012 --> 02:11:51,943
There they were in a pile,
a pile of...little arms,

1908
02:11:52,021 --> 02:11:56,458
and I remember...

1909
02:11:56,525 --> 02:11:58,459
l--l--

1910
02:11:58,527 --> 02:12:00,461
I cried.

1911
02:12:00,529 --> 02:12:07,526
I wept like...
some...grandmother.

1912
02:12:07,603 --> 02:12:11,300
I wanted
to tear my teeth out.

1913
02:12:11,373 --> 02:12:13,307
I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

1914
02:12:13,375 --> 02:12:15,639
And I want to remember it.

1915
02:12:15,711 --> 02:12:18,145
I never want to forget it.

1916
02:12:18,213 --> 02:12:20,181
I never want to forget.

1917
02:12:20,249 --> 02:12:25,448
And then I realized,
like I was shot,

1918
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:29,457
like I was shot
with a diamond--

1919
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:34,462
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1920
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:38,967
I thought,
"My God! The genius of that,

1921
02:12:39,034 --> 02:12:44,472
the genius...
the will to do that."

1922
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:51,469
Perfect, genuine,
complete, crystalline, pure.

1923
02:12:51,547 --> 02:12:55,984
Then I realized
they were stronger than we

1924
02:12:56,051 --> 02:13:00,488
because they could stand it.
These were not monsters.

1925
02:13:00,556 --> 02:13:02,990
These were men,
trained cadres.

1926
02:13:03,058 --> 02:13:06,494
These men fought
with their hearts,

1927
02:13:06,562 --> 02:13:09,497
who have families,
who have children,

1928
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:11,999
who are filled
with love,

1929
02:13:12,067 --> 02:13:13,796
but they had
the strength,

1930
02:13:13,869 --> 02:13:15,803
the strength...

1931
02:13:19,575 --> 02:13:21,509
to do that.

1932
02:13:21,577 --> 02:13:25,946
lf I had 10 divisions
of those men,

1933
02:13:26,014 --> 02:13:30,451
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1934
02:13:30,519 --> 02:13:37,254
You have to have men
who are moral,

1935
02:13:37,326 --> 02:13:40,762
and at the same time,

1936
02:13:40,829 --> 02:13:49,259
who are able to utilize
their primordial instincts

1937
02:13:49,338 --> 02:13:54,469
to kill without feeling,
without passion,

1938
02:13:54,543 --> 02:13:56,977
without judgment.

1939
02:13:57,045 --> 02:13:59,809
Without judgment.

1940
02:14:03,552 --> 02:14:07,488
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

1941
02:14:26,375 --> 02:14:30,744
I worry that my son
might not understand

1942
02:14:30,812 --> 02:14:35,840
what I've tried to be,

1943
02:14:35,918 --> 02:14:41,720
and if I were
to be killed, Willard,

1944
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:45,556
I would want someone
to go to my home

1945
02:14:45,627 --> 02:14:48,289
and tell my son
everything.

1946
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:54,233
Everything I did,
everything you saw.

1947
02:14:54,303 --> 02:14:58,763
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

1948
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:01,604
the stench of lies.

1949
02:15:03,845 --> 02:15:08,782
And if you understand me,
Willard, you--

1950
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:11,546
you wilI do this
for me.

1953
02:16:17,052 --> 02:16:18,986
PBR Street Gang,

1954
02:16:19,054 --> 02:16:20,487
this is
Almighty, over.

1955
02:16:20,555 --> 02:16:22,455
PBR Street Gang,

1956
02:16:22,524 --> 02:16:25,391
this is Almighty
standing by, over.

1957
02:16:26,862 --> 02:16:28,454
PBR Street Gang,

1958
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:30,293
this is Almighty
standing by.

1959
02:16:30,365 --> 02:16:31,798
How do you copy?

1960
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:39,000
They were going to make me
a major for this,

1961
02:16:39,074 --> 02:16:43,010
and I wasn't even in
their fucking army anymore.

1962
02:16:43,078 --> 02:16:48,744
Everybody wanted me
to do it...

1963
02:16:48,817 --> 02:16:51,479
him most of all.

1964
02:16:51,553 --> 02:16:53,714
I felt like
he was up there,

1965
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:56,849
waiting for me
to take the pain away.

1966
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:02,188
He just wanted to go out
like a soldier--

1967
02:17:02,264 --> 02:17:04,664
Standing up.

1968
02:17:04,733 --> 02:17:09,067
Not like some poor wasted
rag-assed renegade.

1969
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,838
Even the jungle
wanted him dead,

1970
02:17:14,910 --> 02:17:18,903
and that's who he really
took his orders from, anyway.

1971
02:17:58,754 --> 02:18:02,554
[ Come on, baby,
take a chance with us ]

1972
02:18:07,396 --> 02:18:11,298
[ Come on, baby,
take a chance with us ]

1973
02:18:15,971 --> 02:18:19,168
[ Come on, baby,
take a chance with us ]

1974
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:23,769
[ And meet me at the back
of the blue bus ]

1975
02:18:23,845 --> 02:18:27,781
[ Do the blue rug
on the blue bus ]

1976
02:18:27,849 --> 02:18:30,340
[ Do the...
Do the... ]

1977
02:18:30,419 --> 02:18:33,286
[ Come on, yeah ]

1978
02:18:35,957 --> 02:18:38,653
"We train young men
to drop fire on people,

1979
02:18:38,727 --> 02:18:42,219
"but their commanders
won't allow them

1980
02:18:42,297 --> 02:18:47,064
"to write fuck
on their airplanes

1981
02:18:47,135 --> 02:18:50,730
because it's obscene."

1982
02:20:13,455 --> 02:20:15,047
The horror.

1983
02:20:18,894 --> 02:20:20,589
The horror.

1987
02:25:43,251 --> 02:25:45,344
Calling
PBR Street Gang.

1988
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:47,854
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty.

1989
02:25:47,922 --> 02:25:49,787
Do you read me?
Over.

1990
02:25:51,226 --> 02:25:52,659
PBR Street Gang,

1991
02:25:52,727 --> 02:25:55,161
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty--

1993
02:26:33,768 --> 02:26:35,360
The horror.

1994
02:26:39,274 --> 02:26:41,265
The horror.
