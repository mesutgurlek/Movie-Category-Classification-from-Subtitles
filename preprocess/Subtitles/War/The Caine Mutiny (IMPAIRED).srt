1
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,727
And so today
you are full-fledged ensigns.

2
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,450
Three short months ago,
you assembled here

3
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,940
from all parts of the nation,
and all walks of life. -

4
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:27,193
- Field, factory,
office, and college campuses.

5
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,489
Each of you knew what the fighting was about,
or you wouldn't have volunteered.

6
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:36,869
Each of you knew that the American way of
life must be defended, by life itself.

7
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:41,400
From here on,
your education must continue...

8
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
in the more demanding school
of actual war.

9
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,755
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign
in the United States Navy. -

10
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:53,219
- You go down to the sea to fight in
the toughest conflict of all time.

11
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:56,510
Your fellow Americans share
my confidence that...

12
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,510
you will serve the Navy and the Country
with honor and distinction.

13
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:03,479
Good luck
and good hunting.

14
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:13,614
Mother: Willie,
over here!

15
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:18,950
- Darling, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks, Mother.

16
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,950
- Congratulations, Willie.
- Thanks, Uncle Loyd.

17
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,470
Your mother promised to
let me know if the Navy...

18
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,370
doesn't makes full use of your abilities.

19
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,629
With the proper approach, perhaps I could
help you be placed somewhere else.

20
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:34,302
- Good luck for now, in the meantime.
- Thank you.

21
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:36,910
Mother, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
skip your party tonight.

22
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,010
Some of the fellas are having
a little celebration.

23
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:42,935
But darling, the party's in your honor.
Besides, we have so few days left together.

24
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:48,065
Your friends will forgive you, I'm sure.
You can call them from the house.

you were wonderful.

Thanks.
I'm surprised your mother let you out.

Darling, let's not spoil the night.
I've only got a couple of days left.

46
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:06,662
- I'm leaving Sunday.
- How do you expect me to feel?

47
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,810
Leaving me standing there
all alone.

48
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,210
Willie, why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?

49
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:16,360
I wanted you to met her.
But, there's a time for everything.

I'm sure.

To the most important woman in your life...
Mom.

52

- May, stop it.
- I'm sorry, Willie.

53
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:37,060
I didn't mean to ruin your big evening.
I guess, I just bruise easily.

54
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:41,280
Alright,
what do we do to celebrate?

55
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:44,700
We can go to the Fairmont, Top of the Mark,
anything you say...

56
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Or we don't have to go to a club.

57
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:53,459
- Meaning what?
- Look darling, I've only got 48 hours.

58
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:58,047
- Willie, don't.
- May, I love you.

59
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:05,096
All right.
Will you marry me?

60
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,224
Look darling,
if there were more time...

61
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,853
I didn't expect you to.

62
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:17,567
I guess I forgot who I was. Just another
nightclub singer for a big weekend.

63
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:21,612
I don't want any more of it.
Not another minute.

64
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:53,186
- Good luck, Mr. Keith.
- Thanks, George.

Drop a cable the minute
you get to Pearl Harbor.

67
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,710
If I can.

68
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,110
I'm terribly worried.
Uncle Loyd tells me...

69
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,510
that ship you've been assigned too
has been in lots of battles.

70
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,720
Mother,
don't worry.

71
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,530
- Do you have enough spending money?
- More than enough.

72
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,000
You'd better take this extra $100, dear.

73
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Mother,
please don't cry.

74
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,580
I can't help it.
You're all I have left.

75
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,900
Willie, promise me you'll be careful. Don't
volunteer or do anything foolish.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,420
Mother,
I won't.

77
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:29,013
I won't. I promise.

Crossing over.

82

- This way, Keith.

83
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,000
This way,
Keith.

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,190
Hey!

85
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:30,218
Watch that enthusiasm. Nobody ever felt
that way about the Caine before.

86
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,410
I'm sorry, sir.
I lost my footing.

87
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,010
Keith,
this is our communications officer Lt. Keefer.

88
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,010
- How do you do, sir.
- How about logging him in, Tom

89
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,400
Your orders,
Keith.

90
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,600
Those monstrous papers that transform
ex-civilians into men without minds.

91
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,940
- I hate to be the one that does this to you.
- Gangway, lady with a baby!

92
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:52,970
Meatball, Horrible,
pick up Mr. Keith's gear in the well boat.

93
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,070
Aye, aye, sir.

94
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:00,450
Oh Keith, this is our executive officer,
Steve Maryk.

95
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,750
- Glad to have you on board, Keith.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,970
Steve's our fireball,
the guy who gets things done.

97
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,670
- There's one on every ship.
- Very funny.

98
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,630
Come on Keith,
let's meet the captain.

99
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,230
- Watch your feet, sir!
- Come on, Keith!

100
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,090
They're making a mistake
scraping this ship.

101
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,190
The only thing that's keeping the water out
is the rust.

102
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,320
What do you want?

103
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,120
He's here,
sir.

104
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,730
OK, bring him in.

105
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,330
In here,
Keith.

106
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
Captain DeVriess,
this is Ensign Keith.

107
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,100
Keith!

108
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:10,860
May I see your orders and qualifications jacket,
or are they a military secret?

109
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:12,420
I'm sorry,
sir.

110
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,920
Princeton,
'41...

111
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,000
Top five percent
in midshipman's school...

112
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:31,297
Pretty good background,
pretty good record.

113
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:36,010
Disappointed they assigned you
to a minesweeper, Keith?

114
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,510
Well, sir... to be honest.
Yes, sir.

115
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:43,680
You saw yourself on a carrier,
or a battleship, no doubt?

116
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes sir,
I had hoped that...

117
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:50,358
Well, I only hope that
you're good enough for the Caine.

118
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,420
I'll try to be worthy of this assignment,
sir.

119
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,320
She's not a battleship or a carrier,
the Caine is a beaten-up tub.

120
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:02,570
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hrs
a day just to keep her in one piece.

121
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,870
I understand,
sir.

122
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,610
I don't think
you do.

123
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,710
But whether you like it or not, Keith,
you're in the junkyard navy.

124
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,130
Steve, put in with Keefer
in Communications.

125
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,720
And tell Tom when he's free,
to show this Princeton Tiger

126
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,720
and our other new ensign
around the ship.

127
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes, sir.

128
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,936
And Keith...

129
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:31,274
Don't take it so hard.
War is hell.

130
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,900
- Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.
- My condolences.

131
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
- Thanks.
-Alright, my Junior League\citizens...

132
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,872
Let's get with it.
The USS Caine is a minesweeper.

133
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,120
These paravanes
used for minesweeping.

134
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,620
They carry sweep wires
off both sides of the ship.

135
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:54,005
The wire contacts the mooring cable of a mine
and saws it in two.

136
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,960
We've been in combat a year and a half,
and during that time ...

137
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,960
we've never been asked to
swept one single mine.

138
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,930
So, the first thing you've got to learn
about this ship is that ...

139
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,430
she was designed by geniuses
to be run by idiots.

140
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,190
This is the engine room.

141
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,690
To operate, all you need is any group
of well trained monkeys.

142
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,200
99 percent of what we do
is strict routine,

143
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,900
only one percent requires creative intelligence.

144
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,730
That about does it.
Any more questions?

145
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,530
Yes, sir.
Where do we go to surrender?

146
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:27,960
It's not that easy.

147
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,660
- Sir, you don't like the Navy, do you?
- Who called the Caine <i>"the Navy"</i>?

148
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,250
Well gentlemen, just one more thing to do.
Climb the mast.

149
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:44,263
What for?
A mast is a mast.

150
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,890
When the Captain orders a tour,
he means from the keel to the foretop.

151
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,890
That's the foretop.

152
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:56,984
I have a wife and a kid, I'm very fond of them.
I'll probably never see them again.

153
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,850
Well done!

154
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,350
- I'm glad he liked it.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:39,819
Keith, I regret to tell you, I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:45,324
Height bothers me.
Those poor sailors down there.

157
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,530
I could use my hat,
but it's the only one I've got.

158
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,530
I have two others.

159
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,709
- That's darn cordial of you.
- Perfectly, welcome.

160
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,761
Hey, what's keeping you guys up there?
Lunch!

161
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Lunch!?
Oh!

162
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:16,898
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's all right.

163
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:21,520
Tell me Keith, now that you've had
a chance to study the Caine...

164
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,190
more closely,
do you like her better?

165
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:30,453
- The tour was very interesting, sir.
- Is the ship too messy for you?

166
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,120
- That is a difficult question, sir.
- It's a ridicules question.

167
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,120
The question is,
<i>"Is this mess a ship?"</i>

168
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:42,673
Very decent of you to join us for lunch, Tom.
I didn't think you could spare the time.

169
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:47,094
Well, my novel will suffer, but even the
greatest of literary artists gets hungry.

170
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:50,310
Pull up a chair, Tom, and
cast some pearls before the swine.

171
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,010
- Or whatever it is you say you do.
- I will.

172
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:58,105
Somebody has to protect these fresh eager
young faces from the captain's badgering.

173
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:02,527
I'm not badgering anyone, Tom. I'm just
conducting a one-man board of inquiry.

174
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:07,198
I'm trying to find out if
Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.

175
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:12,010
There is no escape from the Caine, save death.
We are all doing penance.

176
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,330
Sentenced to an outcast ship,
manned by outcasts,

177
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,830
and named after the greatest outcast
of them all.

178
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,250
- Here we go again.
- I'm merely stating absolute fact.

179
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,350
He's right, Steve...

180
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,220
I've been sweating out myself,
waiting for two years to be...

181
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,220
relieved of command,
and there is no sign of it yet.

182
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:35,268
But then...
I don't have Ensign Keith's influence.

183
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,060
Sir,
I don't understand.

184
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:45,111
I received this dispatch from
Admiral Wards about an hour ago.

185
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,075
<i>"With your approval, I will request transfer
to my staff for Ensign Willis Steward Keith."</i>

186
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:56,414
<i>"Understand of course
needs of USS Caine have priority."</i>

187
00:17:56,622 --> 00:18:02,753
- Sir, I didn't know anything about this request.
- Could be coincidence.

188
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:06,465
Or someone pulling strings.

189
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:07,970
What'll it be,
Keith?

190
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,380
The admiral's staff or as Tom puts it:
<i>"the hell of the Caine"?</i>

191
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,430
Well, I don't know,
sir.

192
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,430
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to fight a war?

193
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,560
Captain,
this is hardly a place for a decision.

194
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,560
Oh nonsense, Steve. A good officer should be
able to make up his mind anywhere.

195
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:33,659
- Well, come on, Keith. We haven't got all day.
- Well, sir...

196
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:52,011
- I'll stay on board, sir.
- That takes care of that.

197
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,097
Ah Willie,
you will live to regret this day.

198
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:17,360
Sir, I spotted a lot of Japanese aircraft
off the starboard bow. Position, Angle 20.

199
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,660
Angle 20.

200
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,916
You see them,
Captain?

201
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:28,047
If the war last ten years Keith, you may learn
to tell the difference between aircraft and seagulls.

202
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:44,856
<i>"Man all stations for minesweeping drill.
Man all stations for minesweeping drill."</i>

203
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,360
Launch sweep gear.

204
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,060
<i>"Launch sweep gear."</i>

205
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,288
Port paravanes in the water.

206
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,030
<i>"Steve, that was the lousiest performance
I've ever seen.  </i>

207
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,730
<i>"Tell the men to get the lead out."</i>

208
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,730
Stand by to stream starboard side.

209
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,000
Retrieve sweep gear.

210
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,510
<i>"Retrieve sweep gear."</i>

211
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,995
<i>"C'mon Steve, snap it up.
The Jones is beating us in."</i>

212
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,130
Look out!

213
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,400
Stop the engines.
Get me a line.

214
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
You're not going to swim for it,
the water's full of sharks.

215
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,420
- Stand by the line.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:07,063
Mr. Keith, this action dispatch just arrived.
Mr. Keefer said you had the code duty.

217
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,310
I'll take care of it
right away.

218
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,080
OK!
Haul away!

219
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,840
Lead the line
outboard of everything.

220
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,240
Report
<i>"float recovered."</i>

221
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,961
The Jones never saw the day
they could beat us.

222
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,216
You pooped out, Steve! We streamed three
minutes quicker at Guadalcanal.

223
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,930
You must love that guy
to do what you did for him.

224
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,180
Go dry yourself,
Keith.

225
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:39,155
- Is that you, Willie?
- Yeah.

226
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,700
Hey Willie,
didn't you say you went to Princeton?

227
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,700
I didn't say.

228
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,700
Well, maybe one of these days I'll let you read
a couple of chapters of my novel.

229
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:51,450
- A Princeton man's opinion might be valuable.
- Thanks.

230
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,930
- Horrible!
- Yes, sir?

231
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,420
Pick up those orange peels.
This isn't a hunting barge.

232
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Yes, sir

233
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
[Meatball laughs]

234
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:25,451
Alright Meatball, laugh once more
and you're in trouble.

235
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,440
[Bosun's whistle sounds off]

236
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,950
Over intercom: <i>"Ensign Keith, report to
the Captain's cabin.  </i>

237
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,550
<i>"On the double,
on the double!"</i>

238
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,680
Oh these 90-day wonders...

239
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,980
Everyone one of them thinks
they're five-star admiral.

240
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah.

241
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,250
[Knocks on door]

242
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,600
- Come in.
- Yes, sir?

243
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,570
Keiths, three days ago, this ship received a
dispatch addressed to us for action.

244
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,780
- Smitty here, says he gave it to you.
Is that correct?

245
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,780
Yes, sir. I forgot about it.
It's still in the pocket of my dirty khaki.

246
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:15,793
- Did you decode the message?
- No, sir.

247
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,500
It's incredible stupidity
and carelessness on my part...

248
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,500
Fortunately,
I had the job done for you.

249
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:23,000
- That'll be all, Smitty.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:27,720
Keith...

251
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:33,500
Have you any idea how serious misplacing
an action dispatch can be?

252
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,170
Yes, sir.

253
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,390
I don't think you have.

254
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,690
Because of you, this ship might have failed
to carry out a combat assignment.

255
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,200
I hope you realize that
for such a failure,

256
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,700
I would bear the full responsibility
in a court martial.

257
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,490
I understand,
sir.

258
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:55,010
I've been filling out officer's fitness
reports this morning, Keith.

259
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,630
- How you think this ought to affect yours?
- Anyone can make a mistake, sir.

260
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,460
There are mistakes
and mistakes.

261
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,460
The margin for error
is narrow in the Navy, Keith.

262
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:11,015
There's too much loss of life and property
damage possible in every act.

263
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,390
Here.

264
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,390
Read it.

265
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:22,485
<i>"Ensign Keith seems
a fairly bright young man."</i>

266
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:26,781
<i>"He may become a competent officer
once he overcomes...</i>

267
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:30,159
<i>...the light and careless approach
to his duties."</i>

268
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,450
- Do you consider that fair?
- Sir, if I may be permitted...

269
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,950
Go ahead,
Keith.

270
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:39,460
I made a mistake, but I don't see why
I should be singled out for it.

271
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Everyones goofed off
around here.

272
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,000
The Caine's a slack ship.

273
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,500
The men act like a pack of cut throats,
and the decks look like a Singapore junk.

274
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:51,347
I take it than, you must also
strongly disapprove of me.

275
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:58,187
- Go ahead Keith, man to man.
- Sir, I'm in no position to approve or disapprove.

276
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:02,066
I only know my conception of a captain
seems different from your own.

277
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:06,863
I'll take it under advisement.
Since you feel so bitter. -

278
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:11,110
- Perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day.

279
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:16,120
As you can see Keith,
I'm being relieved of command.

280
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,793
Next week, this time,
you'll have yourself a new captain.

281
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,466
Lieutenant Commander
Philip Francis Queeg. Feel better?

282
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:32,680
- Definitely, sir.
- Good. That'll be all, Keith.

- Thank you.

Crew dismissed.

293
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:33,550
Oh... ah Captain,
if you would like me too,

294
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,950
I'll stay aboard for a couple of days
till you get used to the feel of things.

295
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,270
No thanks. There's no need for that. We all
have our own ways of running a ship.

296
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,870
Sure.

297
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,580
This one's tired.
She's had the guts run out of her.

298
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,080
She ought to be melted down
for razor blades.

299
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:53,761
The crew may not look like much,
they're tired, too. Every man is okay.

300
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,848
- I understand.
- I hope you do.

301
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,250
Yours, Captain.

302
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,110
Attention on deck.

303
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,810
- Request permission to leave to leave the ship.
- Permission, granted, sir.

304
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,210
Captain,
sir?

305
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,440
- What is it, Meatball?
- Nothing, sir.

306
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:17,326
Well, a few of the guys chipped in and...

307
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,200
Whose idea was this?

308
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:28,340
Well, I won't accept it.
It's against Navy regulations.

309
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,340
- Well, that's what I told them, sir
- You don't always go by regulations, Captain.

310
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:35,887
That's my trouble.
I've been aboard the Caine too long.

311
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,720
Now you men take an even strain
with the new skipper,

312
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,720
and everything
will be all right.

313
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:47,064
- I'm leaving the ship, sir.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:55,260
[ Bosun's whistle blows <i>"Away Galley"</i> ]

315
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:03,748
What do you know? Somebody
left his watch lying around.

316
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:13,257
I might as well have a souvenir of this old bucket.
Not a bad-looking watch at that.

317
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:16,427
- What time is it, Mr. Keith?
- 11:00, sir.

318
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:21,474
Make it 10:30.
I'll always keep it a half hour slow -

319
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:26,229
- To remind me
of the fouled-up crew of the Caine.

320
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,520
Carry on.

321
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:03,570
What's everybody
so choked up for?

322
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:09,856
No matter what everyone says, Willie, I still think
that someday you'll make an officer.

323
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:14,235
<i>Captain Queeg requests a meeting of all
officers at in the wardroom 13:00.</i>

324
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:20,690
Well gentlemen,
we'll gonna be shipmates for a long time.

325
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,910
I though we ought
to get acquainted.

326
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,165
I've formed some pretty good impressions.
You're probably curious about me.

327
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:31,252
Well, my background is simple enough.
Just another naval officer.

328
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,600
I've had seven tough years
in the Atlantic.

329
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,410
Believe-you-me,
they made the last two mighty interesting.

330
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:42,900
The way those subs ganged up on us,
I thought they had it in for me personally.

331
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
Now,
to get down to cases.

332
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,980
Anyone who knows me,
will tell you I'm a book man.

333
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,680
I believe everything in it was put
in for a purpose.

334
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:54,275
When in doubt, remember on board this ship,
we do things by the book.

335
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,610
Deviate from the book, and you've better
have a half a dozen good reasons,

336
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,110
and you'll still will get
an argument from me.

337
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:02,870
And I don't lose arguments
on board my ship.

338
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,370
That's one of the nice things
about being captain.

339
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,990
Now I want you to remember
one thing,

340
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,710
on board my ship
excellent performance is standard. -

341
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,000
standard performance
is sub-standard,

342
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,590
and sub-standard performance is not
permitted to exist. That, I warn you.

343
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:23,040
OK?
Now that I've shot my face off,

344
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I'll give anyone who wants too,
the chance to do the same thing.

345
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,920
Captain,
I don't want to seem out of line,

346
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,190
but it's been a long time since
this crew did things by the book.

347
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,690
Mr. Maryk,
you may tell the crew for me...

348
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,400
there are four ways
of doing things on board my ship:

349
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,770
The right way, the wrong way,
the Navy way, and my way.

350
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,160
- They do things my way, and we'll get along.
- Aye, aye, sir.

351
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,400
Okay?
Anyone else?

352
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,540
[Knock on door]

353
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,793

354
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:58,130
Beg pardon, Captain. Sorry to interrupt.
Official message from ComServ Pac.

355
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,630
Thank you.

356
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:07,430
One moment,
messenger.

357
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,270
What's your name
and rate?

358
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,270
Urban, sir.
Seaman First, Signalman Striker.

359
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,862
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:43,170
Gentlemen,
did anyone notice anything peculiar...

361
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,170
about Seaman First Class Urban?

362
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,900
A shirt-tail hanging outside trousers
is the regulation uniform,

363
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,140
I believe,
for bus boys...

364
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,730
not however,
for a sailor in the US Navy.

365
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,730
These are the things we are going
to start noticing again.

366
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,154
- Maryk, who's the Morale Officer?
- There is no Moral Officer, sir.

367
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:06,240
- Who's the Junior Ensign?
- Keith, sir.

368
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:08,500
Mr. Keith?
Sir?

369
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,070
You are now the Morale Officer.

370
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,450
In addition to your other duties,

371
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,250
you will now see to it that every man keeps
his shirt-tail tucked inside his trousers.

372
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,250
Aye aye, sir.

373
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,250
OK...

374
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,801
If I see another shirt-tail flapping while
I'm Captain of this ship...

375
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:28,400
Woe betide the sailor,
woe betide the OOD,

376
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,800
and woe betide the Morale Officer.
I kid you not.

377
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Now...

378
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,310
according to this dispatch,
we are to proceed to Area X-ray...

379
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,000
at 08:00 tomorrow
to tow targets.

380
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:41,870
I'm going to give it to you simply.

381
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,070
The Caine is going to be the best
target-towing ship in this man's navy.

382
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,740
That'll be all,
gentlemen.

383
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:54,910
Mr. Keith, I want all the men to have their hair
cut to regulation length,

384
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,410
and their faces clean shaven
by 24:00.

for the appearance of this sailor?

Well,  tuck your shirt in,

And now,
Mr. Keith...

407
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,740
First of all, do you or don't you have
an explanation for this?

408
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:01,220
Sir, I was on the fantail-

409
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,620
I didn't ask for an alibi. Evidently,
my orders must mean very little to you.

410
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:07,540
Sir, I'm completely at fault,
but I tried my best.

411
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,340
Your <i>"best",</i> Mr. Keith,
is only a maximum of inefficiency.

Hey, what's the matter with the old man?

413
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,390
Yeah,
I know.

414
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,970
- Captain...
- Will you not interrupt while I'm speaking?

415
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,830
Captain,
we're going around in cir...

416
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:26,040
One more word out of you,
and you're on report.

417
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,940
Aye, aye, sir.

418
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:29,400
And you, Mr. Keefer, can you explain why the
first violation...

419
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,400
occurred while you were
officer of the deck?

420
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,400
There are limits to what a man can do
when he has the deck.

421
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:38,570
Mr. Keefer, the officer of the deck is
as equally as responsible his duties...

are we cutting back across our tow?

But it's happened!

438
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,790

right standard rudder. I was just...

You idiot.

440
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:07,870
Captain, we've steamed
over our tow line.

441
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,080
Who said we steamed over the tow line?
Who said that?

442
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,590
We've cut the target adrift.

443
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,290
We did nothing of the kind. Something
must have been wrong with the cable.

444
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,970
We can hardly be held responsible
if we're given faulty cable...

445
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,470
that breaks the minute
the ship turns a few degrees.

446
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,391
Sir, should we recover the target?
It shouldn't take more than half an hour.

447
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:28,771
Half an hour? That means we'll be the last ship
back in Pearl Harbor. No thank you.

448
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,930
We're not going to have to answer
a lot of questions...

449
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
about something that's
not our fault.

450
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,155
- Reel in the cable.
- Aye, aye, sir.

451
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:46,330
Mr. Keefer, send the following dispatch.
ComServ Pac:

452
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:53,296
<i>"Defective tow line parted,
south-west corner, x-ray."</i>

453
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:57,758
<i>"Target adrift.
Menace to navigation."</i>

454
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:02,722
<i>"Suggest tug,
recover or destroy."</i>

455
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:07,518
He'll never get away with it.

456
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,180
Now, let's head for the barn.
Aye, aye, sir.

457
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,980
All engines ahead full.

458
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,000
All engines ahead full,
sir.

459
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,840
Queeg: Willie?
- Sir?

460
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,040
You look worried?

461
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:36,320
I know a man's shirt is a petty detail, but
big things are made up of details.

462
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,920
Don't forget...

463
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,760
For want of a nail, a horseshoe
was lost, and then the whole battle.

464
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,000
A captain's job is a lonely one.
He's easily misunderstood.

465
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:53,610
Forget that I bawled you out. It was good
for the morale of all concerned.

466
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,810
OK?

467
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,528
Yes, sir.

468
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,380
Keefer:
Hallelujah!

469
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,560
Look what just came in.
We're going back to San Francisco.

470
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,160
San Francisco?
You're kidding.

471
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:18,673
All thanks to our beloved Captain Queeg.
He's in plenty of hot water.

472
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,300
I told you the Navy would never accept his
double talk about the towing line.

473
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,800
They can't be sending us all the way back
just for that?

474
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,150
Listen to this: <i>"Upon arrival,
Commanding Officer USS Caine...</i>

475
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,470
<i>"report immediately
Commander Western Sea Frontier."</i>

476
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,470
I tell you Willie,
he's in serious trouble.

477
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:35,590
Our Captain is about
to be boiled in oil.

478
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,190
And you, you lucky fellow,
are about to see your girl.

479
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,750
Willie!

480
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,383
- Willie, darling.
- Mother.

481
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:48,650
This is a real surprise.

482
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,950
Well, you didn't expect me not to be here,
did you?

483
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,350
Oh, it's wonderful to have
my boy close again.

484
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:03,230
Mother... I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine. May Wynn.

485
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:09,283
I'm always delighted
to meet one of Willie's friends.

486
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,619
Thank you.

487
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:22,046
Hello, Oh! Hello, May?
Sure! I'll be right down then. Okay.

488
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,350
Well, I guess I'm ready to go, mother.
I'm afraid I'm going to miss you all.

489
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,050
It's just a weekend at Yosemite.

490
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:33,182
- A sailor needs some play time.
- Miss Wynn's going with you?

491
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,000
Yes,
she is.

492
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:40,356
- You must feel strongly about her.
- I do, mother. I like her a lot.

493
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:47,488
- You have a nice weekend yourself.
- Are you in love with her, Willie?

494
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:51,325
I don't know. But I sure missed her
every minute I was away.

495
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:55,746
Well, she is attractive, but you
don't know anything about her.

496
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,520
You haven't even
met her parents.

497
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,120
That's right. I guess I'll have
to do that someday.

498
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:03,990
Wille, for your own sake,
all I want you to do is...

499
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,590
well, promise you won't
do anything rash.

500
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:08,620
- I promise.
- You mean it, Willie?

501
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,920
Sure,
I mean it.

502
00:43:11,095 --> 00:43:13,010
Goodbye,
Mom.

503
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:38,581
Easy, May.
That's good.

504
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:47,920
Well,
how did you like it?

505
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,420
It's like breaking in a new song.
Fun but scary.

506
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:55,973
You know, it was nice of your mother
to let you come to Yosemite like this.

507
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,268
- It wasn't up to my mother.
- Well...

508
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:03,648
- It looks like the war has made a difference.
- Has it?

509
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:08,736
I missed you more than
I planned to.

510
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:15,910
Announcer:
<i>"Let the fire fall!" </i>

511
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,169
- May: This is paradise.
- Willie: Isn't it.

512
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:34,510
- Willie, there are people.
- Let them look.

513
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,852
You have changed. Sometimes I think
there's almost a chance for us.

514
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:50,820
- Willie, it's getting late.
- It's getting very late.

515
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:20,930
I'll wait,
thanks.

516
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:24,450
Good morning, darling.
Sorry I'm late.

517
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,850
I guess I'm not used to being
without an alarm clock.

518
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:31,777
- What a day. Have you ordered yet?
- Not yet.

519
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:35,323
- Just some orange juice and coffee, please.
- Make it two.

520
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,880
Do you know what I would like to do?
I'd love to take a long walk.

521
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,280
Climb to the top of that mountain
over there.

522
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:48,503
- Darling, what's the matter?
- Just thinking.

523
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:51,790
Well, come on now, somethings the matter.
I expected you to be happy...

524
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:57,220
May, what would you think about spending
the rest of your life with a monster like me?

525
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:01,974
- What's this?
- I'm talking about our getting married.

526
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,940
Is that what
you really want?

527
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,940
Of course I want it.
Don't look at me as if I'm a crazy.

528
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:13,440
I don't want you to marrying me because
you feel sorry for me.

529
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,040
Because you think it's the
decent thing to do.

530
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,614
Look, May...

531
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,618
I love you and I want to marry you.
Yes or no?

532
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,660
No.

533
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Why not?

534
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:31,060
Because your mother won't approve.
I think that's whats bothering you.

535
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,080
Of course she'll approve.

536
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,380
She won't approve, but you'll marry me anyway
and you'll be so unhappy.

537
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:40,346
I won't be unhappy.
I love you.

538
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:44,183
Maybe you do...
really do.

539
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:50,398
But marriage has to be by your own approval.
No one else's.

540
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:53,401
That's asking a lot,
May.

541
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:58,530
That's right.

542
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:08,249
Have a good cry, Willie.
I know I will.

543
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,490
Well brother, in another 30 seconds
you'd have been AWOL.

544
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,920
I just got the telegram.

545
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,820
And you just couldn't tear yourself away
from your girl?

546
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,820
Yeah.

547
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,310
Any news on Queeg?

548
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,810
Queeg: <i>"Tangle up all lines
and stand by to cast off. </i>

549
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:38,905
<i>"Hope you haven't been inconvenienced any,
Mr. Keith. "</i>

550
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:42,408
Looks like you made a slight mistake, Tom.
He's still here.

551
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:45,490
My mistake was nothing
compared to the Navy's.

552
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,990
Take in the bow.

553
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:56,210
Well gentlemen,
as you probably know by now,

554
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,710
we returned to San Francisco
for a new radar installation.

555
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:03,470
However, certain misleading reports on things
that happened at Pearl Harbor...

556
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,470
were sent to
the Force Commander.

557
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,250
This created doubts in his mind
about the Caine's competence...

558
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,850
to be returned
to combat.

559
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:12,990
I made it clear to him that I inherited a ship
in a low state of training...

560
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,690
and I could hardly be expected to pull it
into shape overnight, he agreed.

561
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:21,490
So from now on, gentlemen,
there will not be further mistakes...

562
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,990
on the part of the officers
and crew of this ship.

563
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,850
[Coughing] Sorry sir,
some smoke went down the wrong way.

564
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,790
This,
is an important command.

565
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:32,290
The Navy's is probably waiting for me
to make a butch,

566
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,790
Well I'm not going to make it and I'm not going
to permit anybody to make it for me.

567
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:39,670
So much for old business.

568
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,630
Gentlemen,
I've have good news for you.

569
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,970
We're on our way to
the greatest invasion attempted in this war.

570
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:53,145
I kid you not. The greatest.
So let's all straighten up and fly right.

571
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:15,293
All hands, put on battle dress.

572
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,250
[ Blowing: <i>"General Call"</i> ]

573
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:23,926
<i>"All hands, put on battle dress
and anti-flash cream."</i>

574
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:36,022
We don't have to shot the Japs.
We can scare them to death.

575
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:24,862
Cease fire, cease fire.
Keith: <i>"Cease fire, cease fire."</i>

576
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:26,990
Close the boat group and take stations.
Mr. Keith, you take the com.

577
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,390
Aye, aye, sir.

578
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:47,969
That's the group we're suppose to take in.
Jacob Group Four.

579
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:50,300
Correct course, 045.
<i>"045",</i> aye, aye.

580
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,300
All engines, ahead full.
<i>"All engines, ahead full."</i>

581
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:02,480
We're closing too fast.
We're gonna run those boats down.

582
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,480
Where's the captain?

583
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:04,730
He's on the wing.

584
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,730
On the wing? How can he left you handle
the ship at a time like this?

585
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,825
All engines stop.
- <i>"All engines stop."</i>

586
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:16,500
Boats ahoy!
Boats ahoy!

587
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,890
What's going on?
Who's yelling at whom, here?

588
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,790
Sorry, sir. It looked like we were overshooting
these boys, so I stopped.

589
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,860
Well, let's get it over with.
What's the distance to the beach?

590
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,960
About three miles, sir.
We're suppose to take...

591
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:29,060
I just want to know the yardage,
OK?

592
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,760
Steve, you take the com, get us there.
Full speed ahead.

593
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,019
We will proceed.
Follow us. Good luck.

594
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,010
OK,
thanks.

595
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:55,661
Left tangent: 006.

596
00:51:55,828 --> 00:52:00,166
- Beacon: 084.
- Distance: 5,000.

597
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:22,939
We're pulling too far ahead of the attack group.
All engines back one third.

598
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:34,325
Left tangent: 350.

599
00:52:34,492 --> 00:52:38,955
- Beacon: 116.
- Distance: 4,000.

600
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,870
Why are we slowing down?
Sir, we we're losing them.

601
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,170
If they can't keep up with us, throw over
a dye marker when we reach the spot.

602
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:59,050
Hey, we're getting too close.
You want to run us on the beach?

603
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,480
Sir, we still have at least 1,500 yards
to go with the boats.

604
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,480
1,500 yards?
You're crazy.

605
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,860
I can read instruments
as well as anybody on this ship.

606
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,690
We're within 1,000 yards
of the beach right now.

607
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,690
This is as far as we're
suppose to take them.

608
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:14,400
- Left full rudder.
- <i>"Left full rudder."</i>

609
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,700
- All engines ahead full.
- <i>"All engines ahead full."</i>

610
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:18,160
- Throw over a dye marker.
- But, Captain...

611
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,260
You heard me,
throw over a dye marker.

612
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,660
Fantail from the bridge,
throw over a dye marker.

613
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,270
Sir, we can't leave
those marines...

614
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,270
Mr. Maryk, I'm taking the com,
I'm relieving you.

615
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,970
Aye, aye, sir.

616
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:58,070
- What's he doing? Running away?
- Don't look for trouble, Tom.

617
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,430
Well...

618
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:12,480
What do you think of
your boy now?

619
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,880
I don't know.

620
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,890
- There must be a reason for what he did.
- Yeah. There's a reason, all right.

621
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:39,951
<i>"I've got those yellow stain blues
those silly yellow stain blues</i>

622
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:45,540
<i>"when someone fires a shot
it's always there I am not</i>

623
00:54:45,706 --> 00:54:52,088
<i>"I've got those yellow stain blues
the old yellow stain blues</i>

624
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:56,968
<i>"those yellow stain blues. "</i>

625
00:54:57,134 --> 00:55:00,230
- We'd better pipe down.
- Don't be so worried, Willie.

626
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,970
You know, it's about time you
got over being impressed

627
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,070
by people in authority like parents
and ship captains.

628
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,740
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome.

629
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,640
Shhh...
more, more.

630
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:14,569
<i>"I've got those yellow stain blues
down from my head to my shoes</i>

631
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:20,533
<i>"you should see strong men quail
if he should spy a shirt-tail..." </i>

632
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,163
- OK Buddy, cut it.
- Oh Steve, I thought you'd be amused.

633
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:27,300
This is magnificent saga of a man who's lack of
charm...

634
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,500
is only exceeded by his
lack of intestinal fortitude.

635
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,960
It's not funny Tom,
and you ought to know better.

636
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,080
Find somebody else to sing about.
That's an order.

637
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:37,250
Why, <i>"Old Yellowstain"</i>
ought to be flattered.

638
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,260
I don't want to hear the name
<i>"Old Yellowstain"</i> again.

639
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,760
Yes, sir.

640
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,600
The captain wants a meeting
in the wardroom, immediately.

641
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,600
And he kids us not.

642
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:56,950
Now, don't get up gentlemen, please.
I'm not too feeling well.

643
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,150
What I have to say
won't take long.

644
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:03,500
That'll be all,
steward.

645
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:16,923
I know that some of you are perhaps
a little afraid of me.

646
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:21,344
I'm not that terrible.
I have a wife and a child and a dog.

647
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:27,808
They're rather fond of me. Even
the dog doesn't think I'm a monster.

648
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,064
Perhaps certain things
happened today.

649
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:36,440
Well, as I always say,
a command is a lonely job.

650
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,440
It isn't easy to make decisions.

651
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:42,000
Sometimes the captain of a ship
needs help...

652
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,280
by help I mean...
constructive loyalty.

653
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,960
What I'm trying to say is,
a ship is like a family.

654
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,960
We all have our ideas
of right and wrong. -

655
00:56:56,128 --> 00:57:00,716
- But we have to pitch in
for the good of the family.

656
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,050
If there was only some way
we could help each other.

657
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,810
I, ah...

658
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:21,445
If there is anything, any of you would like to say,
I.. I mean, I'll be glad to listen.

659
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:36,294
Well, I've spoken my piece.
I only hope it registers.

660
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,390
Don't get up,
please.

661
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:46,510
Painter, have the pharmacist mate
send up some more aspirin.

662
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,510
My headache's much worse.

663
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:49,840
Yes, sir.

664
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:06,699
This is what is known
in literature as the <i>"pregnant pause."</i>

665
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:29,847
Well, there's only one thing left to do,
write to Walter Winchell.

666
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:35,770
- He almost made me feel sorry for him.
- Don't be so sentimental, Willie.

667
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:38,000
I thought it was a
pretty good speech.

668
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:42,250
It wasn't exactly an apology, but it was
as close as he could get to one.

669
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,650
We could have
backed him up.

670
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,782
What could we have said? He turned yellow
the first time we got into action.

671
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:50,540
Look Princeton, you know from nothing
about DeVriess...

672
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,240
and you know even less
about Queeg.

673
00:58:53,412 --> 00:58:56,332
He's a tired man .
His nerves are shot.

674
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,253
It's happened before that a man loses his
head after what Queeg has gone through.

675
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:03,464
That's an endearing explanation,
but it won't hold.

676
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:09,262
Has the thought ever occurred to you that
our captain might be unbalanced?

677
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:12,723
I'm no psychiatrist, but I know something
about abnormal behavior.

678
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,470
Captain Queeg has every symptom of
acute paranoia.

679
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,470
It's just a question of time before
he goes over the line.

680
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:21,482
- Step outside, Keith.
- I'd like to stay, sir.

681
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:27,488
- Let him. He studied psychology at college.
- You're fooling with dynamite, Tom.

682
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:29,940
Will you look at the man?
He's a Freudian delight.

683
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,740
He crawls with clues.

684
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,290
His fixation on the little rolling balls.

685
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,000
The chattering in second-hand phrases
and slogans.

686
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,290
His inability to look you in the eye.
The constant migraine headaches...

687
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:42,940
Shirt-tails, and tonight's pathetic speech:

688
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,040
<i>"Forget about my turning yellow,
my dog likes me."</i>

689
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,370
- I think Tom does make sense.
- You stay out of it.

690
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,470
Alright...

691
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,660
so he has migraine headaches
and he rolls steel balls.

692
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,760
And he does a lot of other screwy things,
so what?

693
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:01,772
You used to get up before reveille,
and fill a lot of paper with scribbling.

694
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:04,901
Everybody's a screwball in some way.
That doesn't make them crazy.

695
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:08,112
You're kidding yourself,
Steve.

696
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:11,010
Alright, will you go over to
the fleet medical officer with me,

697
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:14,110
and repeat everything
you've told me?

698
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:15,860
Do you agree with my diagnosis
of Queeg?

699
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,160
Not with a word of it, even if I understood
what you were talking about.

700
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:22,370
Well then, why should you expect me to take
the whole thing on my shoulders?

701
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,370
You are his executive officer, if you don't see it,
I wouldn't stand a chance.

702
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:29,000
OK then,
we drop it right now.

703
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,590
There'll be no more talk about
the captain being crazy.

704
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,180
It's like running around explosives
with a blow torch.

705
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,180
I still insist he's
a paranoia case

706
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:44,982
See this bible?

707
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:46,400
I swear to you on this,

708
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,400
I'll report to the captain anything further
you say along those lines.

709
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:54,617
There's no more friendship on this point.
That's the straight dope.

710
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:32,196
<i>"Medical log

Stop the picture!
Will you please stop this picture!

716

Attention on deck!

717
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:11,140
May I ask, why I wasn't notified that
this movie was being shown?

718
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,440
Sir, last week you told me you
couldn't look at another Western.

719
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
So I just assumed...

720
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:18,951
You assumed! This was calculated disrespect
to your commanding officer.

721
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:23,000
All right. There will be
no more movies for 30 days.

722
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:31,797
<i>"May 28, 1944. Morale couldn't be lower.

<i>"The officers are just going through

<i>"for the instruction
and safety of the crew..."</i>

726
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:15,930
This is the captain speaking.

727
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,630
A great many men have ignored
my orders about wearing battle gear.

728
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,630
So there is only one way
to drive the point home.

729
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:26,000
Every man not wearing a helmet or lifejacket
will be docked 3 days liberty.

730
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:40,420
I see you! Now I want that knocked that off!
Stop putting on that gear!

731
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,820
- Mr. Keith.
- Sir?

732
01:03:41,993 --> 01:03:44,580
Put that man down there without
a lifejacket on report.

733
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,880
Which one,
sir?

734
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,580
That one down there,
on number one machine gun!

735
01:03:51,752 --> 01:03:54,920
You people think you're very clever.
Well, you're not fooling me!

736
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:06,180
Get that red-headed fellow over there.
That one there!

737
01:04:09,103 --> 01:04:10,970
Sir, it's impossible to tell
which one's red-headed.

738
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,270
- They're all wearing their helmets.
- Keith, you're an idiot!

739
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:20,710
This is the captain speaking.

740
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:25,410
Some misguided sailors on this ship still think
they can pull a fast one on me.

741
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:26,950
Well, they're very
much mistaken.

742
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,950
Since you've taken this course,  the innocent
will be punished with the guilty.

743
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:33,080
There will be no liberty for any member
of this crew, for three months.

744
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,580
I will not be made a fool of.
Do you hear me?

745
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:45,389
<i>"July 30, 1944. Today we received
a gift from officers of the USS Pinkney. </i>

746
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:48,768
<i>"A gallon of frozen strawberries. </i>

747
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:54,190
<i>"I was checking the watch at 1:00 in the
morning when I spoke to Ensign Keith..." </i>

748
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,000
How's it going?

749
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,670
Situation quiet, the captain's been put away
for the night.

750
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,730
Lay off.

751
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:06,770
Steve, you know that I was with you,
and against Tom at the beginning.

752
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,700
But I don't see how the Caine can go on
like this much longer. No ship can.

753
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,000
You haven't the experience to know,
one way or the other.

754
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,338
- I'm not blind. I've watched the men.
- All right, all right.

755
01:05:17,505 --> 01:05:20,910
The captain's in rocky shape, but he'll
come out of it. He's got too.

756
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:25,370
Mr. Maryk, Mr. Keith, the captain wants
a meeting of all officers right away.

757
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,660
- Now, at 01:00 in the morning?
- Yes, sir.

758
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,160
Do you know what's it about?

759
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,760
Yes, sir,
Strawberries.

760
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,000
Are you sure this
is a gallon can?

761
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:40,440
Yes, sir. It's a lard can.
Just took it from the pantry, sir.

762
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:45,199
I suppose you're wondering
why I called this meeting.

763
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:47,910
As you all know by now, we had an
excellent dessert for dinner tonight,

764
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,410
ice cream and frozen strawberries.

765
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,920
Well, about an hour ago, I sent Whitaker
to the pantry to bring me another portion.

766
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,120
He came back with the ice cream
all right.

767
01:05:56,294 --> 01:06:00,000
But he said:
<i>"Sir, there ain't no more strawberries."</i>

768
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:04,450
Now gentlemen, I do not believe that
the officers of this ship consumed...

769
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,220
a full gallon of strawberries at dinner tonight.
And I intent to prove it.

770
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,937
Mr. Maryk, how many portions of ice cream
and strawberries did you have?

771
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,190
- Two, sir.
- Whitaker...

772
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:20,050
dole out a scoop of sand
for each portion of strawberry.

773
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,150
Yes, sir.

774
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:30,703
- Mr. Keefer, how many for you?
- Three, Captain.

775
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:38,794
- Keith?
- Two, sir.

776
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:42,465
- Harding?
- Two, sir.

777
01:06:47,512 --> 01:06:50,097
- Painter?
- Two, sir.

778
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,800
- Comedy?
- Two, sir.

779
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,100
- Jorgensen...?
- Two, sir.

780
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,100
-Laughlin?
-Two, sir.

781
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,760
And the steward's mates had three.
Right, Whitaker?

782
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,660
Yes sir,
one helping each, sir.

783
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:14,455
- Mr. Keith said it was okay.
- Yes, I did, sir.

784
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:21,003
And I had four.

785
01:07:22,547 --> 01:07:26,217
Twenty-four portions in all.

786
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:32,000
Now gentlemen, this tureen holds
an amount of sand that is equal...

787
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,410
to the amount of strawberries we had
at dinner tonight. Right, Whitaker?

788
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,310
Yes, sir.

789
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:40,481
Mr. Maryk, take a look at this gallon can
and tell me how much sand is left.

790
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,610
Maybe a quart,
or a little less.

791
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,780
OK...

792
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:54,990
have any of you gentlemen an explanation for
the quart of missing strawberries?

793
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
There can be no doubt that someone else
finished them for us.

794
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,000
As of now gentlemen, you are all appointed
to a board of investigation...

795
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,750
to find out who's responsible
for this theft.

796
01:08:05,923 --> 01:08:10,553
- Mr. Maryk, you are the senior member.
- Do you mean in the morning, sir?

797
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,210
Now Mr. Maryk, according to my watch,

798
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:15,510
does not mean in the morning,
it means 01:47.

799
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:18,000
I expect a full report by 08:00.

800
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:23,630
Alright, alright, pipe down.

801
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:26,230
The faster we get  this done,
the faster we can get some sleep.

802
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,090
Send in the stewards one at a time
for questioning.

803
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,190
Yes, sir.

804
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:35,470
If only the strawberries had been poisoned,
all our problems would have been solved.

805
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,570
Strawberries,
anyone?

806
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:48,716
- Unsatisfactory.
- Sorry, Captain.

807
01:08:48,883 --> 01:08:51,260
We kept the mess boys and the cook
most of the night.

808
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,760
They may be lying,
but it's a dead end.

809
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,220
We couldn't keep covering the
same ground endlessly, sir.

810
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,220
Gentlemen, you spent the entire night
and accomplished nothing.

811
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:02,313
While I thought the whole thing out
very clearly.

812
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,480
Did it ever occur to you that some bright boy...

813
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,150
might have made a duplicate key
to the wardroom icebox?

814
01:09:07,318 --> 01:09:08,650
Sir, there's no indication...

815
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,650
There are some things we must assume,
Mr. Maryk, in order to be a good officer.

816
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:17,310
Now back in '37, when I was
a lowly ensign on a cruiser,

817
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,410
five pounds of cheese
was missing.

818
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:23,835
Everybody was willing to forget about it,
but not me.

819
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:26,440
I snooped around
and found some chow hound...

820
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,140
had made a wax impression
of the icebox key.

821
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,500
I made him confess and I got myself
a nice letter of commendation.

822
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,420
This looks to me like exactly
the same situation.

823
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:39,267
- But sir, we can't be sure there's a dupli...
- You've tired every other solution, haven't you?

824
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:41,000
Now I've worked out a very simple plan.

825
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:45,890
First, we collect every key on this ship
and tag it with the name of the owner.

826
01:09:46,065 --> 01:09:50,319
Second, we strip all hands to make
sure we've got all the keys.

827
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,323
Third, we test each key
on the icebox padlock.

828
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,850
And the one that fits
will give us the name of the owner.

829
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,450
But Captain,
how do we know there is such a key?

830
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,000
I say there's a key.

831
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,000
Captain, what's to prevent this bright boy
from tossing the key overboard?

832
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,250
No, no, no, he would never toss
it overboard...

833
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,750
after he had gone to all the trouble
of making it.

834
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:12,340
He may try to hide it,
but we'll find it.

835
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,340
I ah...
never thought of that, sir.

836
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,250
Don't stand there,
get on the ball.

837
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,450
We ought to have little fun
for a change,

838
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,050
now that we have some
detective work to do.

839
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,350
Yes, sir.

840
01:10:28,566 --> 01:10:33,529
Steve, turn me in if you want to.
But this is it. This is over the line.

841
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,910
Queeg is a paranoia or
there's no such thing as paranoia.

842
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,910
-Tom, I warned you.
- Yes. Can't you see what he's doing?

843
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:43,164
He's re-enacting his big triumph of his career,
<i>"The Cheese Investigation."</i>

844
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:48,930
He still wants to prove he is the red hot
Ensign Queeg of 1937. There is no key.

845
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,340
Well,
what happened to the strawberries?

846
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,340
Does it matter?
Is it worth turning a ship upside down?

847
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:56,760
Would anyone
but a crazy man do it?

848
01:10:59,639 --> 01:11:04,227
Steve, are you familiar with
Article 184 of Navy regulations?

849
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,479
Vaguely.

850
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,860
Listen to this.

851
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,860
On the Caine
it's required reading.

852
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,860
Article 184:

853
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:24,163
<i>"It is conceivable that most unusual and
extraordinary circumstances may arise </i>

854
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,310
<i>"In which the relief from duty of
a commanding officer... </i>

855
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,410
<i>"by a subordinate becomes necessary.</i>

856
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,710
<i>"Either by placing him under arrest
or on the sick list.</i>

857
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:35,710
<i>"Such actions shall never be taken without the
approval of the Navy Department... </i>

858
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:40,300
<i>"except when it is impracticable because
of the delay involved."</i>

859
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:45,518
If I were you, Steve,
I'd memorize it.

860
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:06,450
I'll take these
to the captain.

861
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:13,400
- Great weather for stripping down.
- Yeah, great for pneumonia.

862
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,150
That wouldn't stop
the investigation.

863
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,170
- Next.
- Alright, Meatball, you can get dressed.

864
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,740
Why... Mr. Keith, don't you want to x-ray me
for the key? Just to make sure?

865
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,140
I've seen him, Mr. Keith, he swallowed the key
with his coffee. Very tricky.

866
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:26,392
Pipe down you guys,
both of you.

867
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:29,990
So long, fellas.

868
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,690
Well, don't tell me you're
escaping from the Caine.

869
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:37,850
I got dispatch orders back to the states.
My wife is seriously ill.

870
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,150
I'm sorry to hear that.

871
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,660
- She'll be all right, Harding.
- Thanks.

872
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,360
We'll keep you posted on the outcome
of the great key investigation.

873
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,660
Yeah,
do that.

874
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:48,000
- Good luck, Harding.
- Thank you, sir.

875
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:53,430
Look fellas, if I tell you something, will you
promise not to do anything about it?

876
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,830
At least for now,
until I'm ashore?

877
01:12:58,216 --> 01:13:01,219
- OK, what is it?
- There is no key.

878
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:05,097
- What?
- How do you know?

879
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:08,768
I know, the mess boys ate the strawberries.
I saw them.

880
01:13:08,935 --> 01:13:12,280
I kept my mouth shut because I
didn't want to get them in trouble.

881
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,680
Then I made
my mistake,

882
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,240
I told the captain.

883
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,240
He called me a lair, and threatened to
hold up my orders ...

884
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,440
if I mentioned a word to anyone.

885
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:22,824
- So please don't say anything.
- You can count on us.

886
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:27,078
Boy, I'm happy to get out of this madhouse.
Well, so long and good luck.

887
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,410
I'll call all your wives and girls
for you.

888
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:36,950
Well...

889
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:42,050
Tom, I've been thinking about
what you've were saying.

890
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:46,681
I've been thinking about Article 184,
and I've got to admit you're right.

891
01:13:46,848 --> 01:13:48,520
Admiral Halsey is here
with the fleet.

892
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,520
How about going over to see him after
we finish with this nonsense.

893
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:57,567
- Sure.
- You too, Willie.

894
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:46,450
Request permission to come on board, sir.
Admiral Halsey's quarters.

895
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,950
- Official business from the Caine.
- Very well.

896
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,450
- Lt. Jones.
- Yes sir.

897
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:51,950
These gentlemen
would like to see the admiral.

898
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:54,450
Very well.
Come along with me.

899
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:45,000
Just a minute please,
gentlemen.

900
01:15:57,395 --> 01:16:03,734
Steve, this is a fine time to think of this,
but... we're making a big mistake.

901
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:06,820
- What are you talking about?
- Well, look at this.

902
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:09,360
We've been
kidding ourselves.

903
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:13,360
This isn't the Caine. This is the real navy,
with real officers, not Queegs.

904
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:17,957
- The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.
- What are you driving at?

905
01:16:18,124 --> 01:16:19,570
They'll never believe our story.

906
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,170
I don't get it.
Is the captain off his head or isn't he?

907
01:16:23,337 --> 01:16:24,830
Is this record I've kept,
correct or not?

908
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,630
Yes, it's correct. The trouble is that
we won't be able to make it stick.

909
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:31,060
Unfortunately, everything Queeg did,
everything you've got in your log there,

910
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,360
can be interpreted
as an attempt to enforce discipline.

911
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,700
Yes,
but we know different.

912
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,600
Yeah, because we've lived through it,
Halsey hasn't.

913
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,690
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

914
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,190
Just be glad I've
thought of it now.

915
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,690
Believe me, Steve, if go through with this,
we're in trouble.

916
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:46,230
It won't mean as much to our boy here
and me, as it will to you,

917
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,230
you want to
stay in the Navy.

918
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:49,740
This can smash your whole career.

919
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,940
Do you want them to think
you're a mutinous officer?

920
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,740
Tom has an argument there.

921
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:57,079
Yes, but I'm willing to take a chance.
Are you scared?

922
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:02,100
Scared? I can see six sides to every risk and
12 reasons why I shouldn't take it.

923
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,570
Cut the kidding,
Tom.

924
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,460
Look fellas, behind this smiling
eloquent brilliant exterior,

925
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,060
I've got a yellow streak
15 miles wide.

926
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:13,720
- I'm too smart to be brave.
- Admiral Halsey will see you now.

927
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,650
I pass.

928
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:20,350
Thanks anyway. Thank the admiral.
We've decided this isn't the time.

929
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:27,020
Intercom:
<i>" Station special C at anchor detail. </i>

930
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,020
<i>" Make all preparations for getting under the way</i>

931
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:35,030
<i>" Make all preparations for heavy
weather. Dismissed from quarters. "</i>

932
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:53,928
- Steve, what do we do now?
- Without Tom, I couldn't get to first base.

933
01:17:54,095 --> 01:17:57,090
I never even heard the word <i>"paranoid"</i>
before he pulled it on me.

934
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,930
He's got to make the pitch,
or we're sunk.

935
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,100
I just don't get it.
Tom's certainly not a coward.

936
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,770
To tell you the truth Willie,
I don't know what Tom is... now.

937
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,370
You better double-time it
back to your ship.

938
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,770
We received a storm warning
and the fleet's getting underway.

939
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:42,530
- Turn on the standard lights.
- Aye, aye, sir

940
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,450
Sir, the barometer's still dropping.

941
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,350
Captain, the barometer is still dropping!
- I've seen it.

942
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:55,400
Captain, the Chief Engineer wants to know
if you gonna take on ballast?

943
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,000
No.
Tell him no.

944
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:58,430
Captain, I suggest that we do,
sir.

945
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,430
I'm not gonna foul up the fuel lines
with salt water.

946
01:20:31,878 --> 01:20:35,756
Captain the sea is brutal.
We need more knots to outrun it.

947
01:20:36,924 --> 01:20:39,430
Bridge to Engine Control.
This is the captain speaking.

948
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,930
You down in there the engine room,
I want power.

949
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:46,620
Power on the starboard engine, do you hear?
Emergency flank power.

950
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,220
Do you want this ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.

951
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:59,155
Close that door
and lock it.

952
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:03,451
- Sir, I've relieved the watch.
- Pass the word to put on life jackets.

953
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:11,292
It's difficult holding her, sir.
The wheel feels loose.

954
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,610
Captain, I don't know if we can keep on riding
with our stern to the wind.

955
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,670
Those are fleet orders,
Mr. Maryk.

956
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,670
I still think the depth charges
should be put on safe.

957
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:22,170
Sir, the depth charges are on safe.
Mr. Keefer gave the order to set them

958
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:25,848
Why wasn't I told these things? I can't go
steaming around with a lot of dead charges.

959
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,500
- Sir, I told Mr. Keefer...
- You speak when you're spoken too.

960
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Mr. Keith, put this man on report
for insolence and neglect of duty.

961
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:34,774
While you're at it, get another helmsman.
Keep that idiots face out of my sight.

962
01:21:34,941 --> 01:21:37,730
- But Stillwell's our best man.
- Will you stop this back talking?

963
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:40,730
Is there no one left on this ship who
pays attention to my orders?

964
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:47,760
Engine room reports #1 switchboard
shorted out by salt water...

965
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,160
Shifting to number two.

966
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,877
We're falling off to starboard now, sir.

967
01:21:58,172 --> 01:22:01,509
Captain we're listing to.
Try backing the starboard engine.

968
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,470
Back the starboard engine!

969
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,970
- Back the starboard engine.
- Aye, aye, sir!

970
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:17,130
Willie, look in the radar shack.
See if there are any ships near us.

971
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,730
Aye, aye, sir.

972
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:29,490
If we keep our running with stern to the wind,
we'll roll over.

973
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,230
Captain, the radars are jammed.
There's no sign of the fleet.

974
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:34,830
Passing 2-2-5...

975
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:36,290
Swinging around faster.

976
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:39,290
Captain, we have to maneuver
for the safety of the ship.

977
01:22:39,463 --> 01:22:41,520
We received no orders to move
to maneuver at discretion.

978
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,920
Fleet course is 1-8-0.

979
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:46,020
Sir, how do you know what
the fleet orders are now?

980
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,820
We can call the fleet Commander
and tell him we're in trouble.

981
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,475
We're not in any trouble.

982
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:06,866
Heading 2-4-5!
I can't hold the wheel, sir!

983
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,000
Captain,
back the starboard engine!

984
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:27,840
Captain!

985
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:41,317
Stilwell,
hold it a hard right!

986
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:49,158
- Ease your rudder to standard.
- Rudder easing to standard, sir.

987
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:53,162
Heading 3-2-5.
She's coming around slower, sir.

988
01:24:02,463 --> 01:24:07,090
Stay on this bearing heading into the wind.
Steady on 0-0-0.

989
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,220
Who gave those orders?
Fleet course is 1-8-0.

990
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,220
Captain,
we're in serious trouble.

991
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:18,010
Mr. Maryk, if you question my decisions once
more, I'll order you off this bridge.

992
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,310
Helsman, come left.

993
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:30,491
Stilwell, steady as you go.
Willie, note the time.

994
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,620
Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.

995
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,620
I'm relieving you as captain of this ship
under Article 184.

996
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:45,256
I don't know what you are talking about.
Helmsman, left 1-8-0.

997
01:24:45,423 --> 01:24:48,500
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the Officer of the Deck.

998
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,720
I told you to come left,
now come left, and fast.

999
01:24:51,888 --> 01:24:55,040
I'm sorry sir, but you're not issuing orders
on this bridge anymore.

1000
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,140
I've relieved you.

1001
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:58,890
I take full responsibility.

1002
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,890
Mr. Maryk, you're under arrest.
Go below to your cabin.

1003
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:02,910
Left to 1-8-0.

1004
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,810
No, to right standard rudder.
Come to new course 0-0-0.

1005
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:08,230
Mr. Keith, what do I do?

1006
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:12,533
Come north, Stilwell.
Mr. Maryk has taken command.

1007
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,690
Call your relief, Mr. Keith.
You're under arrest, too.

1008
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:21,459
All officers not on watch, report to the bridge.
This is Mr. Maryk.

1009
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:39,890
- What's up?
- I have just relieved the captain.

1010
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,490
He will continue to be treated
with the utmost courtesy.

1011
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,486
But from now on, I will give all orders.
I take full responsibility for this action.

1012
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:53,366
Don't kid yourself, Mr. Keith backed you up.
He'll pay the same as you will.

1013
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:57,910
You officers, if you know what's good for you,
tell them to stop, while they can.

1014
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:04,752
You officers approve?
Do you, Mr. Keefer?

1015
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:10,800
- It isn't up to Mr. Keefer to approve, Captain.
- You'll all hang for conspiracy to mutiny.

1016
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:16,597
Everybody back to their stations.
Hold the course 0-0-0.

1017
01:26:46,043 --> 01:26:48,580
- It's right over there, mister.
- Thank you.

1018
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:53,550
Yes?
Yes, this is Ensign Keith.

1019
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:59,474
New York?
Thank you.

1020
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:02,220
Hello?

1021
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,720
Hello?

1022
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,317
- May?
- Willie, I've been trying to get you all day.

1023
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:12,361
- Are you all right?
- Well, I'm OK. How are you?

1024
01:27:12,528 --> 01:27:14,950
Willie,
an officer from your ship called.

1025
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:19,450
Ensign Harding?
He told me that you were in trouble.

1026
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:21,480
Willie,
I'm worried.

1027
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,580
Is your mother there
with you?

1028
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:30,463
- No, she's in Washington. Uncle Loyd's sick.
- Sorry to hear it.

1029
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:33,630
May,
it was wonderful of you to phone.

1030
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,475
- May... darling.
- Willie, please don't.

1031
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:45,180
What an idiot I was.

1032
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:49,650
I could have married you in the
most beautiful place in the world.

1033
01:27:50,817 --> 01:27:56,405
- I'll always regret that I didn't for the rest of my life.
- Don't... please.

1034
01:27:56,572 --> 01:28:00,451
It's over.
It's all in the past.

1035
01:28:00,618 --> 01:28:06,374
But I want you to know that I love you,
and I'll never forget you.

1036
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:14,090
Goodbye, Willie.
Thank you.

1037
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:48,750
- Mr. Maryk?
- I'm Maryk

1038
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,910
My name is
Barney Greenwald.

1039
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,530
Pleased to meet you.
Have a crack-up?

1040
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,030
Yep.

1041
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:59,218
- Are you our lawyer?
- Well, I'm a lawyer.

1042
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:03,040
- This is Ensign Keith, Lieutenant Keefer.
- Keith. You're the co-defendant.

1043
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,140
Yes, sir.

1044
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:08,019
- And you, Mr. Keefer?
- I'm holding his coat.

1045
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:09,600
I'm a friend of the family.

1046
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,100
That's pretty flip under the circumstances,
Mr. Keefer.

1047
01:29:12,273 --> 01:29:14,520
Sorry, I was on board the Caine,
communications officer.

1048
01:29:16,694 --> 01:29:17,950
I will be frank with you two.

1049
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,650
I read the preliminary investigation very carefully,
and I think that what you've done stinks.

1050
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,580
If that's the way you feel about it,
then why are you taking the case?

1051
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,280
I didn't say
I'd take it.

1052
01:29:27,455 --> 01:29:28,900
I told legal I would have
a talk with Mr. Maryk.

1053
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,700
Rather I take it or not depends
on what he has to say.

1054
01:29:31,876 --> 01:29:33,990
Steve, maybe you better
get yourself another lawyer.

1055
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,790
Try it. Eight other officers have
already turned it down.

1056
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:39,350
I don't want to upset you too much,
but at the moment,

1057
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,250
you have an excellent chance
of being hanged.

1058
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,057
We'll answer anything
you want to know, Mr. Greenwald.

1059
01:29:46,224 --> 01:29:49,900
Alright, Mr. Maryk, which are you?
A fool or a mutineer?

1060
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
There's no third possibility.

1061
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:55,850
I guess the only way I could prove I was right
was to let the ship go down.

1062
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,650
Three ships were lost in the typhoon,
you know.

1063
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:03,000
Sure, and 194 stayed afloat without the
executive officer relieving the skipper.

1064
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,320
There wasn't any other choice.

1065
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,620
Hold it Willie.

1066
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,620
OK, maybe I was a fool,
but I'm not a mutineer.

1067
01:30:09,789 --> 01:30:11,410
He should get a medal
for what he did.

1068
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:14,910
He had a paranoid skipper who went to pieces
when the ship was in danger.

1069
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,710
And he saved the ship.

1070
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:18,840
The Navy has three psychiatrists
who are prepared testify...

1071
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,740
that Capt. Queeg is completely sane.

1072
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,840
Sure...
paranoids are clever.

1073
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:26,639
They walk a thin dividing line
between sanity and lunacy.

1074
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,250
Are you a psychiatrist,
Mr. Keefer?

1075
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:34,021
No, I'm a writer. It's my business
to be a judge of human behavior.

1076
01:30:34,188 --> 01:30:38,317
I see. And you were the first one to notice
the captain's <i>"psychotic symptoms"?</i>

1077
01:30:38,484 --> 01:30:39,480
Yes.

1078
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:43,150
You explained this all very carefully to Mr. Maryk,
of course.

1079
01:30:43,322 --> 01:30:47,118
- I discussed it, yes.
- Well, that's an interesting point.

1080
01:30:47,285 --> 01:30:49,680
Would you be prepared to repeat it
on the witness stand?

1081
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,950
Why not?

1082
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:56,520
Mr. Keefer, you ought to take a look
at Article 186 of Navy regulations.

1083
01:30:58,296 --> 01:31:02,175
<i>"An officer relieving his commanding officer,
or recommending such action...</i>

1084
01:31:02,341 --> 01:31:05,070
<i>"Together with all others
who so counsel...</i>

1085
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,930
<i>"Must bear the legitimate responsibility for...</i>

1086
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:09,630
<i>"and must be prepared
to justify such action."</i>

1087
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,360
That's confusing the issue.
I'm not on trial.

1088
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,060
If I were,
I'd take the rap with the others.

1089
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:18,310
Too bad we can't use you as
an expert on psychiatry.

1090
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,310
After all,
you made the diagnosis.

1091
01:31:21,486 --> 01:31:23,000
Yes.

1092
01:31:25,656 --> 01:31:27,850
The atmosphere is getting a little thick
in here.

1093
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,450
If you can get along without me,
I'll wait in the hall.

1094
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:35,540
Tom had nothing to do with it.
It was my decision.

1095
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,540
Nobody counseled me,
nobody told me what to do.

1096
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:42,215
- Sure.
- Will you take the case?

1097
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:45,000
I'd much rather prosecute.

1098
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:48,710
Well, I guess I can't
blame you.

1099
01:31:53,643 --> 01:31:57,480
- I'll take it.
- How do we plead?

1100
01:31:57,647 --> 01:32:01,234
- Your case depends on Maryk.
- Well, then, how do I plead?

1101
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,910
Not guilty,
of course.

1102
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,610
You're a great naval hero.

1103
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:10,618
Charge: <i>"Making a mutiny."</i>

1104
01:32:10,785 --> 01:32:15,122
Specification: <i>"In that Steven Maryk,
Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserve.</i>

1105
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:20,336
<i>"While serving on board the USS Caine,
did on or about July 31, 1944.</i>

1106
01:32:20,503 --> 01:32:23,030
<i>"Willfully, forcibly, and without proper authority...</i>

1107
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:27,130
<i>"relieve Lt. Commander Phillip Francis Queeg,
U.S. Navy</i>

1108
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:30,340
<i>"Who was then and there was engaged
lawfully in the exercise of his command, </i>

1109
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,340
<i>"the United States then being in
a state of war."</i>

1110
01:32:35,601 --> 01:32:38,860
Steven Maryk, Lt. U.S. Navy you heard the
charge and specifications preferred against you.

1111
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,560
How say you to the specification?
Guilty or not guilty?

1112
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,560
Not guilty.

1113
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,237
How say you to the charge?
Guilty or not guilty?

1114
01:32:46,404 --> 01:32:48,000
Not guilty.

1115
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:56,706
Gentlemen, the prosecution
is prepared to prove...

1116
01:32:56,873 --> 01:32:59,330
that the removal of Lt. Commander Queeg
was not justified...

1117
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:01,830
by any provision of
the U.S. Navy regulations.

1118
01:33:02,003 --> 01:33:05,882
And consequently, constituted the making of
a mutiny against legal authority.

1119
01:33:06,048 --> 01:33:09,340
We will also submit
qualified psychiatric testimony...

1120
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,340
establishing without a doubt...

1121
01:33:11,512 --> 01:33:14,220
that Lt. Commander Queeg is a sane
and intelligent officer,

1122
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,220
and should not
have been relieved.

1123
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,897
No statement at this time.

1124
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:24,900
In order to establish circumstances,
the prosecution would like to call...

1125
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,400
as it's first witness,
Ensign Willis Stewart Keith.

1126
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,320
Mr. Keith, where you the Officer of the Deck
on the DMS Caine...

1127
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,720
during the morning
of the 31st of July?

1128
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,820
Yes, sir.

1129
01:33:36,996 --> 01:33:41,270
Was the Captain relieved of command by the
Executive Officer during that watch?

1130
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:42,370
Yes, sir.

1131
01:33:42,543 --> 01:33:45,070
Do you know why the Executive Officer
took the action he did?

1132
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:47,000
I do.

1133
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,761
The Captain lost control of himself and the ship
was in imminent danger of foundering.

1134
01:33:51,928 --> 01:33:54,180
Have you ever been in a ship
that foundered?

1135
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,180
No, sir.

1136
01:33:56,349 --> 01:34:00,645
- Mr. Keith, how long have you been in the Navy?
- A little over a year, sir.

1137
01:34:00,812 --> 01:34:04,900
Do you know how many years
Lt. Commander Queeg served at sea?

1138
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,370
No.

1139
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:10,570
As a matter of fact, Lt. Commander Queeg
has served over eight years.

1140
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:14,867
I ask you, which of you is better qualified
to judge if a ship is foundering?

1141
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,830
Myself, sir.

1142
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,700
When I am in possession
of my faculties...

1143
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,700
and Lt. Commander Queeg is not.

1144
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:25,840
Tell me, Mr. Keith. Just how would you
describe this loss of faculties?

1145
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:29,840
Did the Captain rave
or make insane gestures?

1146
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,969
Well,
no, sir.

1147
01:34:33,136 --> 01:34:36,380
After being relieved,
did the Captain go violently crazy?

1148
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,140
Well, the Captain was never wild or raving
either before or after being relieved.

1149
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,640
There are other forms
of mental illness.

1150
01:34:42,812 --> 01:34:45,565
Thank you for
your expert opinion.

1151
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:50,111
Are you aware the Captain has been pronounced
completely rational by three qualified psychiatrists?

1152
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:53,573
They weren't on the bridge
of the Caine during that typhoon, sir.

1153
01:34:53,739 --> 01:34:58,310
- Did you like the Captain, Mr. Keith?
- At first I did, yes, sir.

1154
01:34:58,410 --> 01:34:59,410
And later?

1155
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:04,300
Well, I thought he was incompetent
and unfair.

1156
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,300
He blamed the members of the crew
for his own mistakes.

1157
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,000
And He rode the men
too hard.

1158
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:11,257
- Yourself included?
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:35:11,424 --> 01:35:13,590
You ended up by hating Captain Queeg?

1160
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:15,761
Yes, sir.

1161
01:35:15,761 --> 01:35:20,099
Now, let's come to
the morning of 31st of July, Mr. Keith.

1162
01:35:20,266 --> 01:35:22,770
Was your decision
to obey Mr. Maryk...

1163
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:25,770
based upon your judgment that the Captain
had gone crazy...

1164
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:29,692
or was it based on your hatred
of Capt. Queeg?

1165
01:35:33,571 --> 01:35:37,090
Mr. Keith, it's contempt of court
to refuse to answer questions...

1166
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,490
except on sufficient grounds.

1167
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:43,623
All I can say is that I believe Mr. Maryk
did the right thing, sir.

1168
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:47,960
No further questions.

1169
01:35:49,128 --> 01:35:54,300
Mr. Keith, I would like to ask if you have ever
heard
the expression <i>"Old Yellowstain"?</i>

1170
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:59,263
- Would you repeat that, please.
- <i>"Old Yellow-stain."</i>

1171
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:03,210
- Yes, sir, I've heard it.
- Was it a nickname?

1172
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,810
Yes, for Captain Queeg.

1173
01:36:04,977 --> 01:36:08,606
- What did it imply?
- It implied Cowardice.

1174
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:11,860
I object. I move that question and answer
be struck from the record...

1175
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,860
as an unnecessary attack on the honor
of an Naval officer.

1176
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,000
Mr. Greenwald, the career of an officer
with a 14 year...

1177
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,400
unblemished record
is involved here.

1178
01:36:20,576 --> 01:36:22,890
The court understands your zeal,
but I warn you,

1179
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:26,490
you bear full responsibility
for your conduct in this case.

1180
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:30,290
The court will hold in abeyance
to the prosecution's motion.

1181
01:36:31,462 --> 01:36:34,710
Did that nickname have
anything to do with the typhoon?

1182
01:36:35,883 --> 01:36:38,553
- No, sir.
- That's all.

1183
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,224
- No further questions.
- The court has no questions.

1184
01:36:43,391 --> 01:36:46,270
Mr. Keith, you are warned not to discuss
your testimony with anyone...

1185
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:49,270
except the parties to the trial
and the accused.

1186
01:36:49,438 --> 01:36:51,150
You're excused.

1187
01:36:52,316 --> 01:36:54,530
The ship was rolling bad.
I couldn't hold her.

1188
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:58,030
The Captain wanted me to come left,
the Exec wanted me to come right.

1189
01:36:58,197 --> 01:37:00,530
- Which did you do?
- I obeyed Mr. Maryk, sir.

1190
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:01,530
Why?

1191
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:04,100
Well, Mr. Keith told me that
Mr. Maryk had taken command.

1192
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,700
Did the captain act crazy?

1193
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,470
No, sir.

1194
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,958
- Did Mr. Maryk act crazy?
- No, sir.

1195
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,620
- Did the Captain seemed scared?
- No, sir.

1196
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,120
- Did Mr. Maryk seemed scared?
- No, sir.

1197
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,120
Did anyone?

1198
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:16,000
Just me. I was dam...
I was plenty scared.

1199
01:37:18,176 --> 01:37:19,500
Did you like Captain Queeg?

1200
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,840
I liked him, but not a lot.
But I liked him.

1201
01:37:24,015 --> 01:37:27,920
- He acted strange.
- Was it strange he cleaned up the Caine?

1202
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
No, sir.

1203
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,380
Was it strange he made
the men get haircuts?

1204
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,180
No, sir.

1205
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,880
- Was it strange he was strict
about Navy regulations?

1206
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,980
No, sir.

1207
01:37:36,152 --> 01:37:37,580
Evidently, what you thought strange
were attempts...

1208
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,380
to make good sailors
of his crew.

1209
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:41,780
That's all.

1210
01:37:41,949 --> 01:37:44,050
What do those campaign stars
represent?

1211
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:45,850
Well...

1212
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,622
What do they represent?

1213
01:37:47,622 --> 01:37:52,376
This silver star is the Coral Sea,
Midway, Guadalcanal, Tulagi...

1214
01:37:52,543 --> 01:37:57,465
- That's all.
- Call Lt. Thomas Keefer.

1215
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,344
Mr. Keefer, when did you first learn
about Capt. Queeg's relief?

1216
01:38:01,511 --> 01:38:03,430
Mr. Maryk called us
to the bridge.

1217
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,430
When we arrived, he told us
he had assumed full command.

1218
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:09,977
Did Captain Queeg show any external signs
of being sick?

1219
01:38:10,144 --> 01:38:13,898
Well, in the height of a typhoon nobody
on board a DMS looks very well.

1220
01:38:14,065 --> 01:38:16,859
Lt. Keefer,
didn't you realize...

1221
01:38:17,026 --> 01:38:18,780
that Capt. Queeg's warning
to the other officers...

1222
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,780
about collusion in mutiny
was well founded?

1223
01:38:21,948 --> 01:38:22,800
Yes, I did,
sir.

1224
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,700
Then why, as the next senior officer,
did you take no action?

1225
01:38:25,868 --> 01:38:28,538
I wasn't present when the Captain
was relieved.

1226
01:38:28,704 --> 01:38:30,020
So, I don't know what
he might have done...

1227
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,120
in the critical moments  to convince
the Executive Officer he was sick.

1228
01:38:33,292 --> 01:38:38,131
I decided for the safety of the ship that my
best course was to obey Mr. Maryk's order.

1229
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:43,594
Until such time higher authority either
endorsed or overruled his action.

1230
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:45,990
Mr. Keefer,
during all the period Captain Queeg...

1231
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:48,090
was in command
of the Caine.

1232
01:38:48,266 --> 01:38:51,350
Did you ever observe any
evidence of insanity in him?

1233
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:56,274
I'm afraid I can't answer that question
intelligently, not being a psychiatrist.

1234
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:01,112
Mr. Keefer, did you ever have any reason to
think Capt. Queeg might be insane?

1235
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,110
Greewald: Objection, the witness
is not an expert.

1236
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:05,110
Matters of opinion are
not permissible evidence.

1237
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,110
Judge:
Strike it from the record.

1238
01:39:08,369 --> 01:39:11,550
Mr. Keefer,
at anytime prior to 31st of July,

1239
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:15,250
did you know that Mr. Maryk suspected
Capt Queeg of being mentally ill?

1240
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:21,382
Yes, sir. Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log
he had written on Capt. Queeg's behavior.

1241
01:39:21,549 --> 01:39:25,553
Did you believe that log justified
the relief of Captain Queeg?

1242
01:39:29,056 --> 01:39:32,685
- Well, sir...
- Yes or no, please?

1243
01:39:38,024 --> 01:39:39,310
No, sir.

1244
01:39:41,486 --> 01:39:43,200
Mr. Maryk was
a close friend of mine.

1245
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,400
He persuaded Mr. Keith and me to
go with him to see Admiral Halsey.

1246
01:39:48,576 --> 01:39:51,160
When we arrived on board the flagship
I told him as forcibly as I could,

1247
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,160
that the log didn't
justify such action.

1248
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:58,002
And that we all would be liable to a charged
of combining to make a mutiny.

1249
01:39:58,169 --> 01:40:01,798
Were you surprised later
when Mr. Maryk relieved the captain?

1250
01:40:01,964 --> 01:40:04,801
Yes, sir. I was flabbergasted.

1251
01:40:04,967 --> 01:40:10,973
- Were you pleased, Mr. Keefer?
- I've said Mr. Maryk was a close friend.

1252
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,380
I was badly disturbed.

1253
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,680
I anticipated that at best, he would be
involved in a great difficulty.

1254
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:20,020
No further questions.

1255
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,020
No questions.

1256
01:40:23,277 --> 01:40:25,840
Does Defense Counsel intended to recall
the witness at a later time?

1257
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:26,940
No, sir.

1258
01:40:28,533 --> 01:40:31,120
- No cross-examination?
- No, sir.

1259
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,320
Witness, excused.

1260
01:40:32,495 --> 01:40:33,720
But Barney,
he's lying.

1261
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,120
Every time he opens his mouth,
he gets you into more trouble.

1262
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:39,420
Forget it.
I want one hero, not two mutineers.

1263
01:40:40,294 --> 01:40:42,290
Call Dr Dixon,
please.

1264
01:40:44,257 --> 01:40:45,920
Dr Dixon,
please.

1265
01:40:52,598 --> 01:40:53,940
How did it go,
Tom?

1266
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,640
Raw deal. You know.
You were on the hot seat yourself.

1267
01:40:57,812 --> 01:40:59,980
Sure, I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

1268
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,380
But you're the old word-king.
You know what you were doing.

1269
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,980
Yeah...

1270
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:07,655
Yeah,
I knew what I was doing.

1271
01:41:13,244 --> 01:41:15,250
Doctor, may I ask you
as a psychiatrist,

1272
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:19,750
is it possible for a sane man to
perform offensive or foolish acts?

1273
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:21,240
It happens every day.

1274
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,540
Assuming for the moment,
this is a hypothetical question...

1275
01:41:24,714 --> 01:41:27,460
Assuming that the captain's conduct
was harsh and oppressive,

1276
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,460
and often showed
bad judgment.

1277
01:41:29,635 --> 01:41:32,763
Would that be inconsistent
with your diagnosis of him?

1278
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:38,853
No, no, my colleagues and I didn't find
Lt. Commander Queeg a perfect officer.

1279
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,100
We found a absence
of mental illness.

1280
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,100
Then you would still say that the defended
was unjustified in relieving him?

1281
01:41:44,275 --> 01:41:47,904
From a psychiatric standpoint,
completely unjustified.

1282
01:41:49,322 --> 01:41:51,407
Your witness.

1283
01:41:52,533 --> 01:41:57,030
Doctor my background is legal, not medical.
Forgive me if I ask some elementary questions.

1284
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,530
It's perfectly alright.

1285
01:41:58,706 --> 01:42:01,700
Now doctor, you said in previous testimony
that Lt. Commander Queeg,

1286
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,000
like all adults,
had problems which he handled well.

1287
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:06,600
Could you describe
the problems?

1288
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:10,800
I object. Lt. Commander Queeg is not
on trial here. Lt. Maryk is.

1289
01:42:10,968 --> 01:42:15,097
This question constitutes irrelevant probing
of medical confidence.

1290
01:42:15,264 --> 01:42:16,520
I rely on the judgment
of the court.

1291
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,120
Evidence regarding Lt. Commander Queeg's
mental make-up...

1292
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:21,220
is of the utmost importance
to my case.

1293
01:42:21,395 --> 01:42:24,357
The question is material.
Objection overruled.

1294
01:42:24,524 --> 01:42:27,270
The doctor may answer within
the limits of medical discretion.

1295
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,770
The reporter will
repeat the question.

1296
01:42:28,945 --> 01:42:32,510
<i>"You said that Lt. Commander Queeg,
like all adults,</i>

1297
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:35,110
<i>"had problems which he handled well.</i>

1298
01:42:35,284 --> 01:42:37,570
<i>"Could you describe the problems?"</i>

1299
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:44,000
The overall problem is one of inferiority
arising from an unfavorable childhood...

1300
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,045
and aggravated by some adult experiences.

1301
01:42:46,212 --> 01:42:51,467
- What were those adult experiences?
- He'd undergone a lot of strain.

1302
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:56,305
Long, arduous, combat duty.
I think that's about all I can say.

1303
01:42:56,472 --> 01:43:02,270
- Would he be incline to admit mistakes?
- Well, none of us are.

1304
01:43:02,436 --> 01:43:06,440
- Would he be a perfectionist then?
- Yes.

1305
01:43:06,607 --> 01:43:11,180
Inclined to hound subordinates
about small details?

1306
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,280
Yes.

1307
01:43:12,446 --> 01:43:16,360
Would he be incline to
think that people were hostile to him?

1308
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,360
Yes, that'd be part
of the picture, yes.

1309
01:43:18,536 --> 01:43:22,498
And if criticized, would he feel
that he was being unjustly persecuted?

1310
01:43:22,665 --> 01:43:25,330
I say it's all one pattern
stemming from one premise...

1311
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,330
that he must try
to be perfect.

1312
01:43:28,588 --> 01:43:31,210
Now doctor, you have testified
that the following symptoms...

1313
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:33,210
exist in Lt. Commander Queeg's behavior:

1314
01:43:33,384 --> 01:43:36,804
Rigidity of personality, feelings of
persecution, unreasonable suspicion,

1315
01:43:36,971 --> 01:43:40,933
a mania for perfection, and a neurotic
certainty that he is always in the right.

1316
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:45,938
Doctor, isn't there one psychiatric term
for this illness?

1317
01:43:46,105 --> 01:43:50,318
- I never said there was any illness.
- Thank you for the correction, sir.

1318
01:43:50,485 --> 01:43:53,230
What would you call a personality
that had all these symptoms?

1319
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,452
A paranoid personality.
But that is not a disabling illness.

1320
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:04,457
- What kind of personality, Doctor?
- Paranoid.

1321
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,500
Thank you.

1322
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:11,464
If I may speak, sir. I would like to protest
the counsel's twisting of words.

1323
01:44:11,631 --> 01:44:15,843
There's a big difference between real mental
illness and minor mental disturbances.

1324
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:17,390
Let me put it this way,
Doctor.

1325
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:21,090
Could Captain Queeg have been
disabled by the severe strain of command?

1326
01:44:22,266 --> 01:44:24,930
- That's absurdly hypothetical.
- Is it?

1327
01:44:26,103 --> 01:44:29,941
- Have you ever had any sea duty, doctor?
- No.

1328
01:44:30,107 --> 01:44:32,570
- Have you ever been at sea?
- No.

1329
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,570
How long have you been in the Navy?

1330
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,697
Five months.

1331
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,890
Have you ever had any dealings
with ship captains before this case?

1332
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,990
No.

1333
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,700
Then I suggest that you can not
set yourself up...

1334
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:44,750
as an authority on
the strain of command,

1335
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:47,250
and thus you may be completely wrong
about Capt Queeg.

1336
01:44:51,212 --> 01:44:54,465
- Your witness.
- One minute, Doctor.

1337
01:44:54,632 --> 01:44:57,969
It seems counsel for defense
has raised an interesting point.

1338
01:44:58,136 --> 01:45:00,400
Now in private practice,
did you ever have patients...

1339
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:04,100
who had to deal
with complicated command decisions?

1340
01:45:04,267 --> 01:45:07,020
Men such as plant managers,
industrialists, etc...

1341
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,020
Yes,
quite a few.

1342
01:45:09,188 --> 01:45:10,420
Including some fliers,

1343
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,020
who have to decide questions
of life and death every day.

1344
01:45:13,192 --> 01:45:16,487
I've written a book
on the subject.

1345
01:45:16,654 --> 01:45:19,070
And in those cases, could you
detect where a neurosis...

1346
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:23,070
might damage the ability to make decisions
correctly and at the right time?

1347
01:45:23,244 --> 01:45:24,580
Absolutely.

1348
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,580
And in your examination
of Lt. Commander Queeg.

1349
01:45:27,748 --> 01:45:31,252
- And you found no such damage, is that right?
- Absolutely right.

1350
01:45:31,419 --> 01:45:35,214
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all.

1351
01:45:36,632 --> 01:45:40,386
- Smart guy, Charlie.
- He's sure gonna bear down on me.

1352
01:45:44,223 --> 01:45:45,890
And that's the way
I saw it.

1353
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,890
I thought it was my duty
as a naval officer.

1354
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:53,900
Captain Queeg was mentally ill
and I had to take over.

1355
01:45:54,066 --> 01:45:57,487
And I tell you honestly, if I had to do it again,
I'd do it.

1356
01:45:57,653 --> 01:46:01,199
Thank you, Mr. Maryk.
Your witness, sir.

1357
01:46:01,365 --> 01:46:03,400
Mr. Maryk, 
just a few questions. 

1358
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:07,410
Would you say your grades 
in high school were average?

1359
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:12,800
- Lower than average.
- And in college?

1360
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,630
Lower than average.

1361
01:46:15,797 --> 01:46:18,410
What training have you had in psychiatry, 
or medicine?

1362
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:20,510
None.

1363
01:46:20,676 --> 01:46:23,930
Where did you get the idea
that Capt Queeg was mentally ill?

1364
01:46:25,097 --> 01:46:27,760
- Out of books...
- What books, name the titles. 

1365
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,936
Oh... I can't remember them.

1366
01:46:29,936 --> 01:46:33,439
- Mr. Maryk, define schizophrenia.
- I can't.

1367
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:36,984
- What's a manic-depressive?
- I don't know.

1368
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:39,980
What's the difference between
<i>"paranoid"</i> and <i>"paranoia"</i> ?

1369
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,480
I don't know.

1370
01:46:41,656 --> 01:46:42,710
In truth, 
than Mr. Maryk, 

1371
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:46,410
you don't know what you're talking about 
when you discuss mental illness.

1372
01:46:46,577 --> 01:46:48,000
I didn't say I know 
much about it.

1373
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:51,450
Yet, you thought you knew enough 
to commit an act of outright mutiny.

1374
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:53,480
I wanted to save the ship.

1375
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,880
But doctors, responsible doctors, 
Mr, Maryk, 

1376
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,880
have found the Captain wasn't mentally ill, 
haven't they?

1377
01:46:59,048 --> 01:47:02,800
- They weren't in the ship.
- But, isn't the reverse possible?

1378
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,180
Mr. Maryk, 
isn't it possible that under pressure, 

1379
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,480
you became erratic and couldn't understand 
the captain's sound decisions?

1380
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,350
- Isn't that possible?
- It's possible.

1381
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:12,890
Between the Captain 
and his Executive Officer, 

1382
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,890
who is presumed by the Navy to have
the better judgment in ship handling?

1383
01:47:16,065 --> 01:47:19,000
- The captain.
- One last question, Mr. Maryk.

1384
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:22,320
If the diagnosis of expert doctors
is correct, 

1385
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:25,320
then you're guilty as charged, 
aren't you?

1386
01:47:28,161 --> 01:47:30,160
I guess, 
maybe so.

1387
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:38,296
- No more questions.
- No further questions.

1388
01:47:38,463 --> 01:47:41,210
You may step down, 
Mr. Maryk.

1389
01:47:50,183 --> 01:47:54,353
Take it easy. You've just seen the first act.
The finale's still to come.

1390
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:05,900
Good afternoon, 
gentlemen.

1391
01:48:12,914 --> 01:48:16,620
I assumed command of an extremely sloppy, 
badly-handled ship. 

1392
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,120
I was determined to bring 
the ship into line.

1393
01:48:19,295 --> 01:48:22,290
Lt. Maryk, I might say, 
opposed me from the very first.

1394
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,490
Maybe he thought I was crazy
to keep trying.

1395
01:48:26,177 --> 01:48:29,300
In your judgment, was your ship 
on the verge of foundering...

1396
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,400
when the Executive Officer 
assumed command?

1397
01:48:32,975 --> 01:48:37,190
Well, as you gentlemen know, in a typhoon 
is an extreme hazard at all times,

1398
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,190
but the ship was riding well.

1399
01:48:39,357 --> 01:48:42,318
Lt. Maryk, however, 
went into a panic and ran amok.

1400
01:48:42,485 --> 01:48:46,405
He acted under the disillusion that he, 
and he alone, could save the ship.

1401
01:48:46,572 --> 01:48:49,900
Ensign Willis Keith, 
a totally unreliable and disloyal officer,

1402
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:53,700
combined with him against me 
at this crucial time.

1403
01:48:53,871 --> 01:48:57,430
Bad luck for them really. 
I bear them no malice.  

1404
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,830
I'm extremely sorry 
for them.

1405
01:49:00,002 --> 01:49:01,260
No more questions.

1406
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,960
A word of caution before you proceed 
with the examination, Mr. Greenwald.

1407
01:49:06,134 --> 01:49:08,220
The court recognizes the defense 
is compelled... 

1408
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:11,720
to try to challenge the competence 
of Lt. Commander Queeg.

1409
01:49:11,889 --> 01:49:13,540
Nevertheless, all the requirements
of legal ethics... 

1410
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:17,140
- and military respect remain in force.
- Thank you, sir.

1411
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:22,567
Mr. Queeg, during a period
when the Caine was towing targets. 

1412
01:49:22,733 --> 01:49:25,778
Did you ever steam over your 
own tow line and cut it?

1413
01:49:25,945 --> 01:49:27,900
Objection. 
I beg the courts indulgence. 

1414
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,200
But, I must say, the defense outrages
the dignity of this proceeding.

1415
01:49:31,367 --> 01:49:34,240
The judge advocate wants the defense to 
switch to a guilty plead. 

1416
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:37,240
He thinks the report of the psychiatrist 
closes the case.

1417
01:49:37,415 --> 01:49:40,170
But I say it is up to you 
line naval officers, not doctors...

1418
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,670
to judge the captain's performance of duty.

1419
01:49:42,837 --> 01:49:46,299
And I must review that performance of duty 
for the navy to render a judgment.

1420
01:49:46,466 --> 01:49:47,800
Objection overruled.

1421
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,180
Now sir, did you ever steam over 
your own tow line and cut it?

1422
01:49:52,346 --> 01:49:57,226
Well sir, I for one, am happy to dispose
of this particular slander.

1423
01:49:57,393 --> 01:49:59,350
During the time we were towing the target,

1424
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:02,350
I noticed some anti-aircraft bursts 
close to board.

1425
01:50:02,523 --> 01:50:04,540
Naturally, 
I turned to avoid them.

1426
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,940
And you continued to turned 
in a full circle?

1427
01:50:07,111 --> 01:50:09,110
Well, my helmsman, 
a very unreliable man,

1428
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:11,860
failed to warn me we that we were 
coming around 360 degrees.

1429
01:50:12,033 --> 01:50:14,330
I caught it in time 
and instantly reversed course.

1430
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:18,530
To the best of my knowledge, 
we didn't steam over the tow line.

1431
01:50:18,706 --> 01:50:24,470
I see. Well, besides the anti-aircraft burst, 
did nothing else distract you?

1432
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,170
No, 
not that I recall.

1433
01:50:26,339 --> 01:50:29,240
Captain, weren't you engaged 
in reprimanding a seaman...

1434
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:32,840
named "Lugatch" at length, 
for having his shirt-tail out...

1435
01:50:33,012 --> 01:50:36,349
while the ship turned 360 degrees?

1436
01:50:36,516 --> 01:50:39,477
Well yes, I reprimanded him, 
but that only took two seconds.

1437
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:41,270
Un huh

1438
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:45,441
Now on the morning the Caine escorted
attack boats of Marines to the beach.

1439
01:50:45,608 --> 01:50:49,070
Did your orders include
dropping a yellow dye marker?

1440
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:53,741
- I don't recall.
- Did you drop a dye marker?

1441
01:50:53,908 --> 01:50:57,203
I don't recall.

1442
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:00,980
Well Captain, didn't you steam several hundred 
yards ahead of the attack boats, 

1443
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,580
drop a yellow dye marker,

1444
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:06,629
and retire at high speed, leaving the boats
to make the beach on their own?

1445
01:51:06,796 --> 01:51:08,920
The question is abusive 
and fragrantly leading.

1446
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,420
Mr. Greenwald, there can be a 
no more serious charge...

1447
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,420
against an officer than 
cowardice under fire.

1448
01:51:13,594 --> 01:51:17,431
Sir, 
may I make one thing clear?

1449
01:51:17,598 --> 01:51:21,030
It is not the defense's contention that 
Lt. Commander Queeg is a coward. 

1450
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,930
Quite the contrary.

1451
01:51:23,104 --> 01:51:26,400
The defense assume that no man who raises 
to command a US naval ship... 

1452
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,690
can possibly be a coward.

1453
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,690
And therefore, if he commits 
questionable acts under fire,

1454
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:34,690
the explanation 
must be elsewhere.

1455
01:51:34,866 --> 01:51:36,490
 You may resume 
your examination.

1456
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:40,990
Captain, you seem to be the victim 
of constantly disloyal officers.

1457
01:51:41,164 --> 01:51:44,709
Now, I didn't say that.
Only some of them were disloyal.

1458
01:51:44,876 --> 01:51:47,370
- Mr. Keith and Mr. Maryk, for instance?
- Yes.

1459
01:51:48,546 --> 01:51:53,170
Mr. Queeg, this is a fitness report you wrote 
on Mr. Maryk, 1 July, 1944. 

1460
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,170
One month before 
he relieved you.

1461
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:57,510
Do you recognize it?

1462
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,510
Yes, I do.

1463
01:52:01,684 --> 01:52:04,680
Do you mind reading your
 comments on Mr. Maryk?

1464
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,314
[Queeg mumbles]

1465
01:52:06,314 --> 01:52:09,560
I don't believe the court can hear you, 
Mr. Queeg.

1466
01:52:10,735 --> 01:52:14,950
<i>"This officer has improved in performance 
and duties since his last fitness report."</i>

1467
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,826
<i>"He's consistently loyal, unflagging, 
thorough, courageous, and efficient."</i>

1468
01:52:18,993 --> 01:52:20,690
<i>"He's recommended
for transfer to the regular navy."</i>

1469
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,390
Now, in relation to that report, 
would like to say that...

1470
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,490
Thank you, sir.

1471
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:25,890
Captain, did you ever turn 
your ship upside down...

1472
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,290
in the vain search for 
a key that did not exist?

1473
01:52:28,461 --> 01:52:31,460
I don't know what lies have been
sworn to in this court, 

1474
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,420
But I would like to set you straight on 
this matter right here and now. 

1475
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,920
A key definitely did exist.

1476
01:52:36,093 --> 01:52:39,400
May it please the court. The witness is
 understandably agitated by this ordeal, 

1477
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:40,800
and I request a brief recess to give him a brief...

1478
01:52:40,973 --> 01:52:44,685
I don't want a recess. 
I'll answer all questions right here, and now.

1479
01:52:44,852 --> 01:52:48,272
- Did you conduct such a search?
- Yes, I did.

1480
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:52,610
As usual, my disloyal officers failed me,
and the key couldn't be found.

1481
01:52:52,777 --> 01:52:56,697
Is it a matter of actual fact that wasn't
 this whole fuss over a quart of strawberries?

1482
01:52:56,864 --> 01:52:59,220
The pilfering of food 
in large amounts or small, 

1483
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,620
is one of the most serious occurrences 
on board ship.

1484
01:53:02,787 --> 01:53:05,040
Yes, but didn't you learn that the mess boys
had eaten the strawberries... 

1485
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:07,040
and that you were conducting 
a search for an imaginary key?

1486
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:09,810
I repeat, 
the key was not imaginary. 

1487
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:14,210
And I don't know anything about 
the mess boys eating strawberries.

1488
01:53:14,382 --> 01:53:17,410
Captain, have you no recollection of a 
conversation with an Ensign Harding... 

1489
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:19,500
just prior to him 
leaving the Caine?

1490
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,510
What about?

1491
01:53:21,681 --> 01:53:25,601
Didn't Esign Harding tell you that
the mess boys ate the strawberries?

1492
01:53:25,768 --> 01:53:29,090
All I remember is that, 
he was very grateful for his transfer. 

1493
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:32,190
His wife was ill in the states.

1494
01:53:32,358 --> 01:53:34,470
Captain, do you know
where Ensign Harding is now?

1495
01:53:34,570 --> 01:53:36,070
I have no way of knowing.

1496
01:53:36,237 --> 01:53:38,660
Ensign Harding is in San Diego. 
His wife is fully recovered. 

1497
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:43,160
He has already been summoned and can be 
flown up here in three hours if necessary.

1498
01:53:43,327 --> 01:53:46,100
Would it serve any useful purpose 
to have him testify?

1499
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,200
No, I...

1500
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,200
I...

1501
01:53:51,085 --> 01:53:54,797
I don't see 
any need of that.

1502
01:53:54,964 --> 01:53:59,620
Now that I recall, he might have
said something about mess boys, 

1503
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,220
and then again 
he might not.

1504
01:54:01,387 --> 01:54:06,476
I questioned so many men, and Harding
was not the most reliable officer.

1505
01:54:06,642 --> 01:54:10,640
I'm afraid the defense has no other recourse
than to produce Ensign Harding.

1506
01:54:11,314 --> 01:54:12,860
Now, there's no need 
for that!

1507
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,660
I know exactly what he'll tell you, 
lies!

1508
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,860
No different from any other officer 
in the wardroom.

1509
01:54:17,028 --> 01:54:18,650
They were all disloyal.

1510
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,650
I tried to run the ship properly, by the book, 
but they fought me at every turn.

1511
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,970
If the crew wanted to walk around with their 
shirt-tails hanging out, 

1512
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:25,570
that's alright, 
let them.

1513
01:54:25,745 --> 01:54:28,498
Take the tow line... defective equipment. 
No more, no less

1514
01:54:28,664 --> 01:54:31,500
But they encouraged the crew to 
go around scoffing at me, 

1515
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,500
spreading wild rumors about 
steaming in circles. 

1516
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:36,280
And then <i>"Old Yellowstain". </i>

1517
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:40,380
I was to blame for Lt Maryk's 
incompetence and poor seamanship.

1518
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:44,347
Lt Maryk was the perfect officer,
but not Capt Queeg.

1519
01:54:44,514 --> 01:54:47,150
Ah... but the strawberries, 
that's where I had them. 

1520
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,850
They laughed at me 
and made jokes.

1521
01:54:49,018 --> 01:54:51,050
But I proved beyond the 
shadow of the doubt... 

1522
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:55,850
with geometric logic that a duplicate key to 
the wardroom icebox did existed.

1523
01:54:56,025 --> 01:54:59,020
I would have produced that key, 
if they hadn't pulled the Caine out of action. 

1524
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,820
I know now they were only trying 
to protect some fellow officer...

1525
01:55:15,419 --> 01:55:21,217
Naturally, I can only cover
these things from memory.

1526
01:55:21,384 --> 01:55:26,681
If I've left anything out,
why, just ask me specific questions. 

1527
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:32,895
And, I'll be glad to answer them
one by one.

1528
01:55:56,085 --> 01:55:58,000
No further questions, 
sir.

1529
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,000
The court is closed.

1530
01:56:05,845 --> 01:56:11,809
<i>"For he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1531
01:56:11,976 --> 01:56:17,940
<i>"for he's a jolly good fellow
that nobody can deny. "</i>

1532
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,380
[Singing continues]

1533
01:56:19,484 --> 01:56:24,655
No, baby, there are no girls here.
Just the officers of the Caine.

1534
01:56:24,822 --> 01:56:28,993
What, darling?
Hey, Steve, make them pipe down, will you.

1535
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,240
Knock it off, fellas. 
Ole Willie is talking to his girl.

1536
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,740
Hi, Tom.

1537
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:38,628
Hi, fellas.

1538
01:56:38,795 --> 01:56:42,340
- Steve.
- Hello, Tom.

1539
01:56:42,507 --> 01:56:45,000
I didn't think you had the guts 
to come around.

1540
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:47,590
I didn't have the guts 
not to.

1541
01:56:53,768 --> 01:56:55,100
Steve.

1542
01:56:59,941 --> 01:57:04,445
I want to thank you for not telling the fellas
about what happened.

1543
01:57:04,612 --> 01:57:06,430
Of course I'm delighted about 
the way things turned out.

1544
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,030
So, It's over and done with.

1545
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:12,260
Look, you can take 
a plane tonight. 

1546
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:16,660
I'm getting a new ship and a new skipper, 
but we'll have plenty of time to get married.

1547
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:21,040
We'll let my mother afterwards.
Please, May.

1548
01:57:22,213 --> 01:57:27,718
I love you, darling. I love you!
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1549
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:32,550
Hey, Steve, Tom, that was May.
We're...

1550
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:41,816
Well, well, well. The officers
of the Caine in happy celebration.

1551
01:57:41,983 --> 01:57:48,360
- What are you Barney, kind of tight?
- Sure, I've got a guilty conscience.

1552
01:57:49,532 --> 01:57:52,960
I defended you Steve because I found
the wrong man was on trial. 

1553
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,660
So I torpedoed Queeg 
for you.

1554
01:57:55,830 --> 01:58:00,251
I had to torpedo him.
And I feel sick about it.

1555
01:58:00,418 --> 01:58:02,750
OK Barney, 
take it easy.

1556
01:58:03,921 --> 01:58:05,190
You know something? 

1557
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:10,590
When I was studying law, and
Mr. Keefer here was writing his stories. 

1558
01:58:10,761 --> 01:58:15,266
And you Willie was tearing up the dear 
old playing fields of Princeton. 

1559
01:58:15,433 --> 01:58:19,395
Who was standing guard over this fat, 
dumb happy country of ours, aye?

1560
01:58:19,562 --> 01:58:24,108
Not us. Oh no, we knew you couldn't
make any money in the service.

1561
01:58:24,275 --> 01:58:28,730
Who did the dirty work for us?
Queeg did, and a lot of other guys.

1562
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:32,283
Tough, sharp guys
who didn't crack up like Queeg.

1563
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:36,170
But no matter what, Capt Queeg endangered
the ship and lives of the men.

1564
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:39,570
He didn't endanger anybodies lives.
You did, all of you. 

1565
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:41,870
You're a fine bunch 
of officers.

1566
01:58:42,043 --> 01:58:43,670
You said yourself 
he cracked.

1567
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:47,670
I'm glad you brought that up Mr. Painter. 
That's a very pretty point.

1568
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,887
You know, I left out one detail in court martial.
It wouldn't have helped our case any.

1569
01:58:53,054 --> 01:58:55,180
Tell me Steve, after the <i>"Yellowstain"</i> incident, 

1570
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,680
Queeg came to you for help, 
and you turned him down. Didn't you?

1571
01:58:58,851 --> 01:59:01,437
Yes, we did.

1572
01:59:01,604 --> 01:59:05,775
You didn't approve of his conduct as an officer. 
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.

1573
01:59:05,942 --> 01:59:09,987
So you turned on him. You ragged him.
You made up songs about him.

1574
01:59:10,154 --> 01:59:11,740
If you'd given Queeg 
the loyalty he needed, 

1575
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,240
do you suppose the whole issue 
would have come up in the typhoon?

1576
01:59:15,409 --> 01:59:17,830
You're an honest man, Steve, 
I'm asking you. 

1577
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:20,830
Do you think it would have been necessary 
for you to take over?

1578
01:59:21,999 --> 01:59:24,470
It probably
wouldn't have been necessary.

1579
01:59:26,045 --> 01:59:29,632
- If that's true, we were guilty.
- Ah... you're learning, Willie.

1580
01:59:29,799 --> 01:59:33,344
You learn you don't work with a captain
because of the way he parts his hair.

1581
01:59:33,511 --> 01:59:37,430
You work with him because he's got the job,
or you're no good.

1582
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:42,000
Well, the case is over.
You're all safe.

1583
01:59:43,563 --> 01:59:46,190
It was like
shooting fish in a barrel.

1584
01:59:48,734 --> 01:59:52,000
And now we come to the man
who should have stood trial.

1585
01:59:52,655 --> 01:59:54,450
The Caine's favorite author. 

1586
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:57,450
The Shakespeare whose testimony
nearly sunk us all.

1587
01:59:57,618 --> 01:59:59,530
Tell them, 
Keefer.

1588
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:03,830
No, you go ahead. 
You're telling it better.

1589
02:00:05,168 --> 02:00:09,422
You ought to read his testimony.
He never even heard of Capt Queeg.

1590
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:13,301
- Let's forget it, Barney.
- Queeg was sick, he couldn't help himself.

1591
02:00:13,468 --> 02:00:20,057
But you, you're real healthy. Only you didn't
have one tenth the guts he had.

1592
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,310
Except I never fooled myself, 
Mr. Greenwald.

1593
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:26,310
I want to drink a toast to you, 
Mr. Keefer.

1594
02:00:26,481 --> 02:00:30,985
From the beginning you hated the Navy.
And then you thought up this whole idea.

1595
02:00:31,152 --> 02:00:35,948
You managed to keep your skirts nice and 
starched and clean, even in the court martial.

1596
02:00:36,115 --> 02:00:38,390
Steve Maryk will always be remembered
as a mutineer...

1597
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:39,990
But you...

1598
02:00:40,161 --> 02:00:45,917
You'll publish your novel, you'll make a
million bucks, marry a big movie star.

1599
02:00:46,083 --> 02:00:48,410
And for the rest of your life, 
you'll live with your conscience.

1600
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:50,210
If you have any.

1601
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:54,760
Here's to the real author of
<i>"The Caine Mutiny".</i> 

1602
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,260
Here's to you, 
Mr. Keefer.

1603
02:01:02,475 --> 02:01:05,000
If you want to do anything about it, 
I'll be outside. 

1604
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:09,520
I'm a lot drunker than you are, 
so it'll be a fair fight.

1605
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:18,301
- Goodbye, darling.
