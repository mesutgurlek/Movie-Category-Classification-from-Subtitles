1
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,797
Go inside.

2
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,875
Hurry up.

3
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,877
This way.

4
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,358
Hurry up.

5
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

6
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,950
- I...
- No, that's mine.

7
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,230
Allez hup!

8
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,275
How far are the trees, Danny?

9
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,755
Over 200 feet.

10
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,598
Yeah, I'd say 300.

11
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,790
Long ways to dig.

12
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,754
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

13
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,636
Willie, you think X got away?

14
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,830
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

15
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,952
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

16
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,671
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

17
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,873
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

18
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,514
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

19
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,157
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

20
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,918
Good morning, Group Captain.

21
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,590
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

22
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,508
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

23
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,517
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

24
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,631
the word is "policy"?

25
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,954
Yes.

26
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,957
Thank you.

27
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,957
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

28
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,595
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

29
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,431
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

30
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,632
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

31
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,591
energy, manpower and equipment

32
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,349
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

33
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,392
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

34
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,435
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

35
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,519
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

36
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,915
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

37
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,793
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

38
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,674
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

39
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,677
Yes, I know.

40
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,475
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

41
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,353
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

42
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,268
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

43
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,029
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

44
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,232
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

45
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,396
Dickes, William.

46
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,557
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

47
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,910
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

48
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,554
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

49
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,593
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

50
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,395
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

51
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,795
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

52
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,718
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

53
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,832
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

54
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,237
No.

55
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,559
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

56
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,837
This is a new camp.

57
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,557
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

58
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,196
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

59
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,313
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

60
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,432
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

61
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,437
by the Luftwaffe high command.

62
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,358
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

63
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,552
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

64
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,679
Very wise.

65
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,511
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

66
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,918
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

67
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,798
and for gardening we will give you tools.

68
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,593
We trust you to use them for gardening.

69
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,518
Devote your energies to these things.

70
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,154
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

71
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,315
And, with intelligent cooperation,

72
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,549
we may all sit out the war

73
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,509
as comfortably as possible.

74
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,271
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

75
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,597
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

76
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,995
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

77
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,759
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

78
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,676
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

79
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,349
- In 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

80
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,233
It's in the history books. I read it.

81
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,593
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

82
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,597
Yeah. No tools.

83
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,354
Hey, Virgil.

84
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,119
Hey, did you see the cooler?

85
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,992
Boy, is it ever a big one!

86
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,395
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,752
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

88
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,952
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

89
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,516
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

90
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,710
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

91
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,832
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

92
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,636
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

93
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,513
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

94
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,473
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

95
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,837
Willie, cigarettes.

96
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,875
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

97
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,673
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

98
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,189
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

99
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,232
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

100
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,751
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

101
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,871
Are you pushing me?

102
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,877
That's mine, you son of a...

103
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,238
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

104
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,750
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

105
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,519
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

106
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,312
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,317
You, too!

108
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,790
Get away! Get back in your huts!

109
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,389
Go on!

110
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,754
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

111
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,394
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

112
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,080
Hey, you got something goin' already?

113
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,397
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

114
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,398
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

115
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,273
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

116
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,358
They'd never see me, especially at night.

117
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,155
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

118
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

119
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,199
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

120
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,670
I think I'll take a little walk.

121
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,588
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

122
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,597
Let me have it, mate.

123
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,957
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

124
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,230
I love you? What bloody good is that?

125
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,033
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

126
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,631
Out. Out!

127
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,676
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

128
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,076
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

129
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,077
Get out, Sedgwick.

130
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,437
Hold it, hold it!

131
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,117
- Your name?
- Ives.

132
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,796
Ives.

133
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,799
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

134
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,229
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

135
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,636
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

136
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,120
I will not take action against you now.

137
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,075
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

138
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,079
on both sides.

139
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,829
Hey! Get out!

140
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,477
Don't shoot!

141
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,435
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

142
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,233
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

143
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,999
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

144
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,430
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

145
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,393
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

146
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,115
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

147
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,037
- OK.
- You stay there!

148
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,355
Out of the way. Out.

149
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,755
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

150
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,155
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

151
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,957
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

152
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,314
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because I wanna get out.

153
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,717
Do you speak German?

154
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,429
Wire cutters.

155
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,277
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

156
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,472
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

157
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,397
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

158
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,317
Captain Hilts, actually.

159
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,237
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

160
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,272
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

161
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,518
I suppose what's called
in the American army a "hotshot pilot".

162
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,995
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

163
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,759
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

164
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,269
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

165
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,709
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

166
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,673
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

167
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,190
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

168
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,959
About 99 per cent.

169
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,117
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

170
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,834
10 days isolation, Hilts.

171
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,554
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

172
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,954
Right.

173
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,472
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

174
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,636
Cooler.

175
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,790
- Name?
- Ives.

176
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,672
Flying Officer Ives.

177
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,677
Cooler. 20 days.

178
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,957
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

179
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,035
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

180
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,232
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

181
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,237
No, I was in college.

182
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,116
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

183
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,279
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

184
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,396
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

185
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,475
How tall are you, Ives?

186
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,272
Five feet four. Why?

187
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,957
Oh, just wondering.

188
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,869
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

189
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,231
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

190
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,349
Bicycles?

191
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,150
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

192
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,716
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

193
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,671
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

194
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,113
No, horse racing. Jockey.

195
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,957
Jockey.

196
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,910
Jockey.

197
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,509
Hilts?

198
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,717
Are you there, Hilts?

199
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,949
Yeah, I'm here.

200
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,753
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

201
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,359
Sure.

202
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,838
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

203
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,714
You had to fight off the birds.

204
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,751
You know, birds.

205
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,711
Girls, man. Girls.

206
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,677
Do you not have them in the States?

207
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,831
Hilts?

208
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,837
Are you there, Hilts?

209
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,228
Ives.

210
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,757
What?

211
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,317
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

212
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,318
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

213
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,752
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

214
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,477
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

215
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,956
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

216
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,833
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

217
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,155
How are you going to get the dirt out?

218
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,071
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

219
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,072
Aye.

220
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,108
Well, what do you think?

221
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,668
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

222
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,597
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

223
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,235
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

224
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,557
Eric.

225
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,715
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

226
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,593
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

227
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,757
He has arrived.

228
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,197
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

229
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,471
I suggest this prisoner be kept

230
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,990
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

231
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,678
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

232
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,075
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

233
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,033
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

234
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,994
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

235
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,430
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

236
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,394
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

237
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,832
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

238
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,757
not the SS,

239
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,231
or the Gestapo.

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,991
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

241
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,556
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

242
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,353
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

243
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,438
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

244
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,348
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

245
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,795
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

246
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,632
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

247
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,517
Herr Kuhn.

248
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,712
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

249
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,195
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

250
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,197
Well, it's new.

251
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,913
Here. Let's find you a bed.

252
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,917
Thanks.

253
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,317
Come in.

254
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,717
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

255
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,269
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

256
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,119
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

257
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,596
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

258
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,918
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

259
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,793
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

260
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,309
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

261
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,357
You met the commandant?

262
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,276
Yes, I did.

263
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,312
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

264
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,034
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

265
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,957
Who else is here? Cavendish?

266
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,799
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

267
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,797
- Blythe?
- Yes.

268
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,835
Almost the whole X organisation.

269
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,750
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

270
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,236
As Von Luger put it:
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

271
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,470
There's madness in their method.

272
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,909
What about Tommy Bristol?

273
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,235
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

274
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,676
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

275
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,277
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

276
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,557
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

277
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,830
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

278
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,713
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

279
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,559
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

280
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,956
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

281
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,275
Too many lives are at stake.

282
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,269
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

283
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,277
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

284
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,073
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

285
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,158
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

286
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,508
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

287
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,633
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

288
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,079
How?

289
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,033
By putting more men out of this

290
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,913
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

291
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,750
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

292
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,189
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

293
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,791
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

294
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,434
Have you thought of what it might cost?

295
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,912
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

296
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,270
knuckle under and crawl.

297
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,358
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

298
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,153
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

299
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,158
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

300
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,192
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

301
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,231
not the Gestapo and the SS.

302
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,915
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

303
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,598
then the SS and the Gestapo.

304
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,474
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

305
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,477
There's only one way to put it, sir.

306
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,070
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

307
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,078
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

308
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,760
I have no argument with you, Roger.

309
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,668
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

310
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,355
When are you calling a meeting, X?

311
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,037
Tonight.

312
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,757
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

313
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,269
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape

314
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,595
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

315
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,838
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

316
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,032
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

317
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,879
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

318
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,833
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

319
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,313
Meanwhile, we dig.

320
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,713
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

321
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,912
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

322
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,270
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

323
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,312
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

324
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,510
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

325
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,473
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

326
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,036
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

327
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,948
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

328
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,231
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

329
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,591
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

330
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,553
I did. There'll be three.

331
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,799
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

332
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,755
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

333
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,351
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

334
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,157
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

335
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,349
250.

336
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,238
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

337
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,432
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

338
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,949
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

339
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,911
Yes, but...

340
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,078
OK, Roger.

341
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,716
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

342
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,070
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

343
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,592
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

344
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,597
We're going to tunnel.

345
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,877
Splendid.

346
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,519
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

347
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,677
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

348
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,476
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

349
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,875
Hendley. We haven't met.

350
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,877
- Scrounger?
- Right.

351
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,195
Dennis, maps and surveys.

352
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,632
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

353
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,595
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

354
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,871
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

355
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,913
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

356
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,828
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

357
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,078
I want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

358
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,478
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

359
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,111
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

360
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,995
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

361
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,271
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

362
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,595
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

363
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,350
Oh, hello.

364
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,959
My name's Blythe.

365
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,230
Hendley.

366
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,437
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

367
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,199
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

368
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,753
Oh, a bird watcher?

369
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,429
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

370
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,515
I suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

371
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,710
Yes, we have some.

372
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,279
Tea?

373
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,708
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

374
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,352
Where's your kit?

375
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,519
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

376
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,596
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

377
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,353
Such as.

378
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,997
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

379
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,517
I'll need a camera.

380
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,160
- What kind?
- A good one.

381
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,308
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

382
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,153
All right.

383
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,510
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

384
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,756
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

385
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,155
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

386
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,875
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

387
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,834
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

388
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,349
It's not that I mind so much.

389
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,040
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

390
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,676
Yeah.

391
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,472
I'll get our wood.

392
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,877
Close up! Close up!

393
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,437
Close up!

394
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,438
Close up!

395
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,754
Close up!

396
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,838
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!

397
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,557
Splendid.

398
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,239
Blythe, what are you doing here?

399
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,715
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

400
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,515
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

401
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,350
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

402
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,152
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

403
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,237
I'm the forger.

404
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,993
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

405
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,394
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

406
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,035
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

407
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,151
109? Right.

408
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,637
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

409
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,833
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

410
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,077
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

411
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,714
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

412
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,310
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

413
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,476
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

414
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,433
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

415
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,393
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

416
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,949
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

417
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,231
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

418
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,515
Get away!

419
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,432
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

420
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,151
Stop this nonsense!

421
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,269
Get away!

422
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,992
Turn the water off!

423
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,996
Somewhere!

424
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,349
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

425
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,598
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

426
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,757
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

427
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,632
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

428
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,039
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

429
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,276
Not when you're organised, Mac.

430
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,876
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

431
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,788
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

432
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,958
Good luck to us, Danny.

433
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,390
Why 17?

434
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,353
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

435
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,717
All right?

436
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,077
It's good.

437
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,397
It's very good.

438
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,076
Get out! Get out!

439
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,029
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

440
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,070
Mopping up.

441
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,153
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

442
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,793
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

443
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,470
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

444
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,079
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

445
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,432
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

446
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,791
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

447
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,593
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

448
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,188
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

449
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,756
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

450
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,950
Where'd you hear that... sir?

451
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,709
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

452
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,593
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

453
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,995
Why? It's only a two-man job.

454
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,635
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

455
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,035
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

456
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,515
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

457
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,634
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

458
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,397
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

459
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,876
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

460
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,638
and then straight out.

461
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,514
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

462
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,269
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

463
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,155
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

464
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,309
Well...

465
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,469
When do you intend to try this?

466
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,114
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

467
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,437
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

468
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,757
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

469
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,075
bloody close to being wire-happy.

470
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,033
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

471
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,958
It'll work. I know it will.

472
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,079
Good luck.

473
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,077
Thank you.

474
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,919
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

475
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,554
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

476
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,511
Good night, sir.

477
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,958
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

478
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,311
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

479
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,318
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

480
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,715
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

481
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,796
If we stop all the breakouts,

482
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,310
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

483
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,878
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

484
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,513
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

485
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,395
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

486
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,471
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

487
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,513
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

488
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,076
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

489
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,430
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

490
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,394
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

491
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,671
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

492
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,636
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

493
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,356
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

494
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,552
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

495
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,274
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

496
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,755
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

497
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,758
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

498
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,873
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

499
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,877
Well, of course.

500
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,357
Would you mind?

501
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,717
Now...

502
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,750
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

503
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,077
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

504
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,316
you wander out into the compound

505
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,353
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

506
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,470
Out come the pins.

507
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,949
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

508
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,635
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

509
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,672
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

510
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,759
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

511
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,994
Mac, this is what we'll do.

512
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,197
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

513
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,357
Nice garden you've got, sir.

514
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,031
All right. Let's look sharp.

515
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,995
That looks sharp.

516
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,878
Sir.

517
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,159
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

518
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,194
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

519
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,233
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

520
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,237
We'll manage, sir.

521
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,319
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

522
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,149
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

523
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,798
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

524
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,956
The English are keen on gardening.

525
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,914
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

526
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,955
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

527
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,957
Good point.

528
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,312
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

529
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,557
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

530
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,035
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

531
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,231
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

532
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,557
Here we are. Now, let's see.

533
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,035
Biscuits, two packets.

534
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,355
Coffee, two tins.

535
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,630
Bovril, one jar.

536
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,228
Cigarettes, six packets.

537
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,559
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

538
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,636
And marmalade, mine.

539
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,992
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

540
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,557
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

541
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,792
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

542
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,992
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

543
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,839
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

544
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,234
I'll see what I can do.

545
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,830
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

546
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,076
documents you can put your hands on.

547
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,236
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

548
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,237
Good luck.

549
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,839
O come all ye faithful

550
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,032
Joyful and triumphant

551
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,031
O come ye

552
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,598
O come ye to Bethlehem

553
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,996
Come and behold Him

554
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,078
Born the King of Angels

555
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,636
O come let us adore Him

556
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,070
O come let us adore Him

557
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,637
O come let us adore Him

558
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,194
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

559
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,117
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

560
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,915
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

561
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,395
and this is holding us up very badly.

562
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,191
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

563
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,039
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

564
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,391
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

565
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,875
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

566
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,952
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

567
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,039
Mac.

568
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,037
Excellent.

569
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,269
Have it in by tomorrow night.

570
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,518
Christ the Lord

571
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,875
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,478
Thanks.

573
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,795
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

574
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,029
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

575
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,472
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

576
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,433
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

577
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,116
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

578
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,673
No, no.

579
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,712
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

580
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,831
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

581
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,916
It was a red sky last night.

582
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,837
I never heard that before.

583
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,190
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

584
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,754
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

585
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,678
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

586
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,149
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

587
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,875
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

588
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,759
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

589
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,553
No. I'm not a well man.

590
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,432
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

591
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,154
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

592
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,430
that would make your hair stand on end.

593
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,869
Our dentist here is a butcher.

594
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,635
But don't tell anyone I said so.

595
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,749
It's a soldier's right to complain.

596
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,235
Maybe in your army, but here?

597
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,072
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

598
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,510
Is that so? Terrible.

599
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,277
That's terrible.

600
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,357
Werner.

601
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,076
Why don't we go into my room?

602
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,033
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

603
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,194
I was just gonna make some coffee.

604
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,517
Real coffee.

605
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,279
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

606
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,277
Where is it?

607
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,271
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

608
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,875
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

609
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,756
Yeah. Keep it.

610
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,757
Nein. I must go.

611
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,034
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

612
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,118
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

613
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,360
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

614
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,153
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

615
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,716
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

616
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,354
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

617
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,872
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

618
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,231
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

619
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,794
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

620
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,276
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

621
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,029
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

622
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,470
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

623
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,720
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

624
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,559
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

625
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,559
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

626
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,074
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

627
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,555
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

628
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,194
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

629
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,834
I have better things to do than draw birds.

630
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,794
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

631
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,276
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

632
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,753
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

633
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,110
Which one's the forgery?

634
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,595
- That one.
- That's right.

635
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,392
They both are.

636
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,872
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

637
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,798
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

638
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,715
And a military identity card.

639
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,999
And a...

640
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,633
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

641
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,514
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

642
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,519
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

643
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,355
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

644
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,268
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

645
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,157
It's on loan.

646
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,273
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

647
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,710
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

648
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,515
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

649
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,438
and rather nice lounge suits.

650
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,074
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

651
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,637
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

652
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,758
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

653
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,394
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

654
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,917
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

655
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:24,155
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

656
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,592
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

657
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,598
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

658
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,838
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

659
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,871
This blanket.

660
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,958
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

661
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,195
- Coats.
- Yes.

662
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,073
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

663
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,998
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

664
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,750
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

665
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,030
Blanket ticking.

666
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,676
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

667
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,190
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

668
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,675
Just take a look at this, Roger.

669
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,794
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

670
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,070
and then dye it with boot polish.

671
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,988
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

672
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,873
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

673
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,195
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

674
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,880
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

675
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,912
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

676
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,517
Good morning, Hilts.

677
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,197
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

678
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,276
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

679
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,152
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

680
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,635
Is Ives going with you?

681
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,399
Yeah, if he wants to.

682
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,796
You know that Ives is close to cracking?

683
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,711
Yeah.

684
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,236
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

685
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,875
Right.

686
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,555
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

687
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:41,038
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

688
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,310
in this camp who are trying to escape.

689
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,237
I appreciate that.

690
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,597
Something's coming - I can feel it -

691
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,156
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

692
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,430
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

693
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,835
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

694
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,514
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

695
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,633
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

696
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,633
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

697
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,753
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

698
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,950
But what we do not have...

699
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,390
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

700
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,239
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

701
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,955
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

702
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,874
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

703
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,470
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

704
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,878
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

705
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,355
to the railway station.

706
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,790
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

707
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,434
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

708
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,953
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

709
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,753
- Understandable.
- Completely.

710
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,389
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

711
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,109
Interesting idea.

712
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,312
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

713
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,911
250?

714
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,871
Yeah.

715
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,351
You're crazy. You too.

716
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,836
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

717
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,669
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

718
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,030
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

719
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,991
maps, compasses, rations.

720
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,839
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

721
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,952
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

722
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,835
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

723
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,351
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

724
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,597
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

725
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,597
Any time.

726
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,034
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

727
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,072
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

728
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,873
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

729
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,309
so you can get the information you need?

730
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,911
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

731
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,077
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

732
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,952
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

733
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,833
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,157
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

735
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,157
Check.

736
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,718
Herr Hendley, l...

737
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,195
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

738
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,709
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

739
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,912
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

740
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,637
He lost his wallet.

741
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,070
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

742
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,191
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

743
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,788
I've looked every place, every place.

744
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,910
I must have lost them while I was in here.

745
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,395
- No.
- Yes.

746
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,115
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

747
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,549
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

748
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,552
Werner.

749
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,638
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

750
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,196
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

751
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,149
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

752
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,074
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

753
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,553
- Werner.
- Yes?

754
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,910
There is one small favour.

755
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,510
A camera.

756
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,156
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

757
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,394
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

758
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,517
Focal-plane shutter.

759
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,470
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

760
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,432
Let me know when you got it.

761
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,517
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

762
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,517
Checkmate.

763
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,790
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

764
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,151
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

765
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,510
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

766
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,029
- No good?
- Today, three times.

767
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,319
Willie, you all right?

768
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,317
Pull!

769
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,710
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

770
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,717
Four times today.

771
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,549
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

772
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,717
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

773
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,313
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

774
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,910
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

775
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,995
OK, Willie.

776
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,750
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

777
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,235
A partridge in a pear tree

778
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,672
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

779
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,156
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

780
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,632
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

781
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,955
Four calling birds, three French hens

782
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,755
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

783
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,190
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

784
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,198
Five gold rings

785
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,268
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

786
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,909
Stay with it.

787
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,077
Five gold rings

788
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,077
Four calling birds, three French hens

789
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,715
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

790
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,150
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

791
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,748
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

792
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,872
Five gold rings

793
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,991
Four calling birds, three French hens

794
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,159
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

795
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,793
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

796
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,196
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

797
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,275
Say, Cavendish...

798
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,356
Three French hens, two turtle doves

799
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,311
And a partridge in a pear...

800
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,317
Allez hup!

801
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,477
Never mind.

802
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,674
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

803
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,392
Splendid.

804
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,431
Simply splendid.

805
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,550
This should do very nicely.

806
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,752
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

807
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,839
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

808
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,233
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

809
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,478
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

810
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,511
We make it 50 feet, sir.

811
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,837
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

812
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,837
A day earlier in August.

813
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,551
Morning.

814
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,631
There he goes again.

815
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,194
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

816
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,039
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

817
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,594
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

818
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,871
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

819
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,834
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

820
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,679
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

821
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,233
Right, Roger.

822
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,679
Wow.

823
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,158
Wow.

824
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,439
Wow.

825
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,438
Wow.

826
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,273
Wow.

827
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,879
Wow.

828
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,549
About face!

829
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,637
Forward march!

830
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,235
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

831
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,237
It's the 4th of July.

832
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,118
What the devil's this?

833
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,910
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

834
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,635
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

835
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,149
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

836
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,316
And to getting home.

837
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,953
Very well. We accept.

838
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,832
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

839
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,313
Gentlemen, follow us.

840
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,317
About face!

841
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,077
Company, halt!

842
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,235
All right, let's line up down here!

843
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,555
All right, grab a cup!

844
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,557
Line it up! Here we go.

845
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,914
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

846
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,918
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

847
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,759
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

848
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,589
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

849
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,518
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

850
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,790
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

851
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,037
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

852
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,594
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

853
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,915
Keep it moving.

854
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,156
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

855
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,555
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

856
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,832
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

857
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,517
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

858
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,438
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

859
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,630
Keep it moving.

860
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,751
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

861
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,111
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

862
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,118
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

863
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,437
Get good and stoned, my friend.

864
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,870
Keep it going. Keep it...

865
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,956
No taxation without representation.

866
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,469
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

867
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,070
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

868
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,509
Well, let's drink to Tom.

869
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,517
To Tom.

870
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,232
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

871
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,238
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

872
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,511
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

873
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,630
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

874
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,917
Call on Ives.

875
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,957
Cheers, Hendley!

876
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,677
You know what that is?

877
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,950
I'll tell you what it isn't.

878
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,310
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

879
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,677
How do you like it, sir?

880
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,511
Well, it's...

881
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,517
To the colonies.

882
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,517
Independence.

883
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,158
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

884
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,192
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

885
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,389
Yes, well, it's...

886
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,477
It's good stuff, Hilts.

887
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,597
Thank you, sir.

888
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,957
Danny! Here's to...

889
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,588
Roger, goons in 105.

890
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,316
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

891
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:43,155
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

892
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,991
Here's to going home.

893
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,517
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

894
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,517
Home!

895
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,388
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

896
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,714
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

897
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,391
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

898
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,353
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

899
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,391
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

900
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,711
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

901
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,594
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

902
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,035
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

903
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,397
It's the tunnel.

904
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,437
Success.

905
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,588
Ives!

906
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,759
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

907
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,995
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

908
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,396
Open up Harry.

909
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,034
We dig. Around the clock.

910
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,275
- Cooler.
- Right.

911
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,319
Well, I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

912
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,116
He wasn't caught.

913
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,350
Hilts, welcome home.

914
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,235
Danny?

915
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,317
Danny?

916
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,957
Danny?

917
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,117
Are you all right, Danny?

918
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,757
Yes.

919
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,757
All right.

920
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,712
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

921
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,629
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.

922
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,637
That's impossible.

923
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,637
Yes.

924
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,118
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

925
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,276
I'm sorry, Colin.

926
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,277
It's all right, Smithy.

927
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,069
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

928
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,997
All right.

929
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,680
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

930
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,515
I can't see a bloody thing.

931
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,308
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

932
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,718
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

933
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,400
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

934
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,194
One, two, three, four, five.

935
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,789
Roger.

936
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,153
No, it's me.

937
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,351
How do you like the old escape suit?

938
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,357
Fine, fine.

939
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,517
Colin.

940
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,870
How do you like mine?

941
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,230
It looks splendid.

942
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,790
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

943
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,913
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

944
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,910
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

945
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,759
Please, Willie, let me alone.

946
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,314
I can't go in that tunnel any more.

947
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,749
So I'm going out through the wire.

948
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,755
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

949
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,758
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

950
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,075
- I go out now.
- No.

951
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,277
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

952
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,157
Don't do that.

953
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,157
Willie...

954
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,876
Since I was a boy,

955
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,232
I hate and feared little rooms,

956
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,430
closets, caves.

957
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,869
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

958
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,230
Because I must get out.

959
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,352
I hide the fear, and I dig.

960
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:07,188
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

961
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,834
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

962
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,679
and ruin the escape for everybody.

963
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,197
So I go now.

964
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,633
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

965
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,470
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

966
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,637
All right.

967
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,437
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

968
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,635
Well, how do you think we look?

969
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,912
It's as bad as all that?

970
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:57,309
Colin, I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

971
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,910
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

972
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,477
What's the matter, Roger?

973
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,790
You can't go.

974
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,715
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

975
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,317
Why?

976
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,159
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

977
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,748
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

978
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,757
That's ridiculous.

979
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,991
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

980
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,351
I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!

981
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,390
I can see... that pin down there.

982
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,080
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

983
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,511
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

984
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:49,994
Yes, of course.

985
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,038
Put the pin down there, will you?

986
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,559
All right.

987
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,193
All right. Come on.

988
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,917
Come on. Sit down.

989
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,869
Sit down. It was a good try.

990
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:13,999
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

991
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,476
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

992
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,955
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

993
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,279
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

994
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,437
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

995
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,678
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

996
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,112
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

997
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,549
that mission is accomplished.

998
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,797
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

999
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,672
You mean getting home?

1000
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,075
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1001
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,397
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1002
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,397
I'm sure you have.

1003
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,437
I know Colin has.

1004
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,476
And, Roger, I have too.

1005
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,477
We think we can make it all the way.

1006
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:06,156
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1007
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,239
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1008
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,148
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1009
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,950
No one has said you can't go.

1010
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,749
That's true.

1011
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,110
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1012
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,999
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1013
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,997
or dare go,

1014
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,309
or should be permitted to play God,

1015
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,557
I can't answer you.

1016
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,518
But I can tell you

1017
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:45,475
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1018
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,433
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1019
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,989
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1020
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,995
It's all right with you, Colin?

1021
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,474
Oh, yes. Quite.

1022
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:29,352
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1023
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,117
Good night, gentlemen.

1024
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,557
Actually...

1025
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,796
he's quite right.

1026
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,797
He's completely right.

1027
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,356
I really shouldn't go at all.

1028
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,677
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1029
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,076
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1030
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,552
I can see things up here. Close to.

1031
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,035
I can see to work, but...

1032
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,075
you're just a blur.

1033
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,077
I know.

1034
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,149
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1035
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,430
Colin, do you have any tea?

1036
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,034
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1037
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,437
Splendid.

1038
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,516
Hi, Hilts.

1039
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,517
Hey, Mac.

1040
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,113
When?

1041
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,708
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1042
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,229
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1043
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,033
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1044
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,434
What time?

1045
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,551
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1046
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,437
You OK?

1047
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,952
Cavendish.

1048
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,479
Griff, down there.

1049
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,477
Goff, there.

1050
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,512
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1051
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:20,392
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1052
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,319
There are the lights.

1053
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,230
Right on the tick, Danny.

1054
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,232
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

1055
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:12,036
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1056
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:16,234
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1057
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,998
Yes.

1058
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,997
No.

1059
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,637
I don't know.

1060
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,837
It's time, Roger.

1061
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,996
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1062
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,953
It's all clear, sir.

1063
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,357
All set, Roger.

1064
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,072
Roger.

1065
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,077
Good luck.

1066
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,109
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1067
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,550
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1068
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,436
Willie...

1069
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,518
I can't wait. I must get out.

1070
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,350
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1071
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:34,430
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1072
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:38,038
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1073
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:41,038
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

1074
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,994
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1075
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,315
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1076
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,317
Let me out. Let me out.

1077
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,755
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1078
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,077
Danny? What is it?

1079
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,516
Danny, what's going on?

1080
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,677
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

1081
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,560
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1082
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:29,389
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1083
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,957
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1084
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:37,156
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1085
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,157
Down you go.

1086
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,796
Danny cut out, huh?

1087
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,388
Willie took him up top. Hilts, l...

1088
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,514
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1089
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,797
Right.

1090
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,232
Bartlett.

1091
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,996
All right?

1092
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:22,715
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1093
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,513
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1094
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,949
The guard is between us and the lights.

1095
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,832
How could that happen?

1096
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:33,316
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1097
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,473
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1098
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,197
We could postpone it.

1099
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,437
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1100
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:03,950
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1101
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,993
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1102
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,189
What about the towers?

1103
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,630
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1104
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,308
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1105
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,752
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1106
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,874
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1107
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,476
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1108
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,158
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1109
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,795
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1110
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:53,398
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1111
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,274
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1112
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,717
He's over there.

1113
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,397
Right. You go first, Eric.

1114
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,909
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1115
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,950
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1116
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,638
Right.

1117
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,239
Thank you.

1118
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,237
- Good luck.
- Right.

1119
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,917
We're moving.

1120
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:38,358
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1121
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:46,033
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1122
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:50,312
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1123
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:53,273
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1124
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,110
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1125
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:01,119
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1126
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,277
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1127
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,757
In here, Colin.

1128
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,117
Sit down.

1129
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,955
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1130
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,517
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1131
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:53,359
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1132
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,918
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1133
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,076
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1134
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,831
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1135
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,269
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1136
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,837
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1137
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:21,711
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1138
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,317
What's that?

1139
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,720
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1140
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:40,230
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1141
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:43,511
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1142
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,039
Willie.

1143
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:58,675
Willie!

1144
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,513
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1145
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,517
Get 'em out.

1146
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,511
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1147
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,950
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1148
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:26,997
Light the lamps down there!

1149
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:30,074
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1150
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:33,033
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1151
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,197
Danny, look.

1152
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:43,877
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1153
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,430
What the hell's going on?

1154
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,233
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1155
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:58,957
Go.

1156
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,071
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1157
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,270
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1158
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,391
Get him out fast.

1159
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,677
Come on.

1160
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,871
Come on, Danny, move.

1161
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,277
Up you go.

1162
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,877
Give me your bag.

1163
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:54,237
We're on the rope!

1164
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:41,076
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1165
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:45,318
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1166
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,872
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1167
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,910
Come on, come on.

1168
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,069
Come on.

1169
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,358
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1170
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,031
Don't shoot!

1171
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,557
Don't shoot!

1172
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,511
Get off! We're coming back!

1173
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:49,832
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1174
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,599
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1175
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,950
We would've heard the shots before.

1176
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,389
Pull!

1177
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,397
Wait for me.

1178
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,557
Out.

1179
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:28,715
Out.

1180
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,791
- How many did he say?
- 76.

1181
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,194
76.

1182
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:06,878
- 76.
- 76.

1183
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:22,511
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1184
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:20,237
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1185
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,432
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1186
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:25,312
Makes quite a group.

1187
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,989
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1188
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,677
Tallyho.

1189
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,797
Tallyho.

1190
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:38,989
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1191
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:40,997
All right.

1192
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:49,473
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1193
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:11,038
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1194
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:13,390
That's quite exciting.

1195
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,633
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1196
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,197
Switzerland.

1197
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,029
Hey!

1198
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:45,196
Bartlett.

1199
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:46,710
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I... I hadn't quite decided.

1200
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:49,513
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1201
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:50,436
None.

1202
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:53,154
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1203
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,510
What have you done with your papers?

1204
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,431
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1205
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:03,711
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1206
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,796
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1207
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,435
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1208
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,549
- I wanted to get home.
- I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1209
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:15,989
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1210
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:18,270
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1211
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:22,950
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1212
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:26,868
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1213
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:31,079
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1214
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,316
I picked up when I was shot down.

1215
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:46,358
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1216
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:48,311
That's right.

1217
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,470
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1218
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,997
Hello, boys.

1219
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:26,637
Hello.

1220
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,035
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1221
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,954
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1222
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,640
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1223
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:57,029
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1224
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,720
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1225
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:09,431
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1226
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:14,631
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1227
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:28,469
Go!

1228
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,757
Next stop, Switzerland!

1229
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:39,756
The Alps.

1230
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:41,108
Splendid.

1231
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:56,598
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1232
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:26,114
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1233
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:52,915
Go that way! I'll follow.

1234
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:17,555
Hendley?

1235
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,077
Colin!

1236
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:30,030
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1237
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:38,198
Colin, I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1238
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:41,237
That's all right.

1239
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,077
Thank you for...

1240
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:47,832
getting me out.

1241
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,591
Caf Suzette.

1242
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:18,557
Hello?

1243
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:21,037
Hello?

1244
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:58,079
Resistance.

1245
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,077
Resistance?

1246
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:02,477
You are English?

1247
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:04,997
I'm Australian.

1248
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:10,317
- You can speak English. I understand.
- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1249
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:13,671
I've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1250
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:17,554
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1251
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:19,557
Can you help me?

1252
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,355
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1253
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:09,229
Good luck.

1254
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:10,873
Thank you.

1255
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,872
You are English.

1256
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:42,517
Herr Bartlett?

1257
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:51,597
Your German is good.

1258
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:54,315
And I hear also your French.

1259
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,993
Your arms... up!

1260
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,717
Herr Bartlett.

1261
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:38,549
And Herr MacDonald.

1262
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:43,310
We are together again.

1263
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:47,668
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1264
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,515
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1265
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:09,950
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1266
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,911
Yes.

1267
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:14,395
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1268
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,988
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1269
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:19,270
Och, no, no.

1270
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:22,870
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1271
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,798
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1272
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:29,754
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1273
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:32,394
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1274
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:14,109
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1275
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:17,550
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1276
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:43,397
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1277
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:45,875
kept me alive.

1278
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,877
And even though we...

1279
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:51,435
I've never been happier.

1280
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:54,237
You know, Mac...

1281
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:35,912
1 1 of your men are being returned today.

1282
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:37,473
Oh, who?

1283
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:39,670
I do not have that information.

1284
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,956
I...

1285
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,951
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1286
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:51,510
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1287
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:54,029
Shot?

1288
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:58,709
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1289
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,514
How many of them were wounded?

1290
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:08,238
Here are the names... of the dead.

1291
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:14,474
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1292
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,477
None.

1293
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:20,269
They - the higher authority -

1294
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:23,754
only directs me to inform you that...

1295
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:28,437
that 50 men were...

1296
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:35,269
I see.

1297
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:39,351
Addison, John.

1298
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,277
Alladale, Peter.

1299
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:43,356
Bancroft, Edward.

1300
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:45,550
Bartlett, Roger.

1301
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,477
Cavendish, Dennis.

1302
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:49,677
Eldridge, David.

1303
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:52,277
Felton, William.

1304
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:55,077
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1305
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,751
I am your guide, se?or.

1306
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:19,871
Spain?

1307
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,948
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1308
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:45,469
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1309
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,672
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1310
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:51,314
What happened to Blythe?

1311
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:53,670
He didn't make it, sir.

1312
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:55,950
Roger was right about that.

1313
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,553
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1314
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:05,594
I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1315
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:08,037
The Gestapo murdered them.

1316
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:10,679
50?

1317
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:12,757
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1318
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:14,195
Yes.

1319
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:15,673
Danny and Willie?

1320
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:17,597
No, they're not on the list.

1321
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:19,957
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1322
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:23,309
I'm sorry.

1323
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:28,590
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1324
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:30,950
Mess up the works.

1325
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:34,117
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1326
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:36,631
Do you think it was worth the price?

1327
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:40,194
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1328
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:45,037
Yes, sir.

1329
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:36,228
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1330
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:45,909
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1331
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:49,396
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1332
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:53,392
How many?

1333
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:55,397
50.

1334
02:41:56,480 --> 02:42:01,508
It looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before I do.

1335
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:53,797
Sir.

1336
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:01,599
Hey, Hilts!

1337
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:59,309
