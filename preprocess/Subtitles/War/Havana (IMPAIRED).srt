1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,878
<i>I've been in a lot of places
since Pearl Harbor.</i>

2
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,036
<i>I like something about every one of them.
Even Vegas.</i>

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,070
<i>But there's only one city I miss.</i>

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,196
<i>General Batista had been running
the country for almost 30 years.</i>

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,439
<i>But this was 1958.</i>

6
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,793
<i>We weren't paying attention
to the rebels in the hills.</i>

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,791
<i>All we knew about Havana was...</i>

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,434
<i>... the lights in the Prado never went out...</i>

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,475
<i>... and you had a damned good chance
of having the time of your life.</i>

10
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,069
Check.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,989
Check.

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,877
Bet $10.

13
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,993
$10, ra. Ise $20.

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,231
You guys know something I don't?

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,549
- Ra. Ise $25.
- Come in.

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,309
Sorry, Captain, but Tony the bar boy
saw some guys breaking into the cars.

17
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,152
Wa. It a m. Inute. What was your bet?

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,357
- See you and ra. Ise you $25.
- I told them they cannot do that.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,113
But they say they're SIM
and they can do what they want.

20
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,590
- $25?
- Take your time, Captain.

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,432
Christ. Look, I call.

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,593
I'll be right back.

23
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,516
- What the hell. Is SIM?
- S-l-M. Military intelligence.

24
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,953
Batista's gestapo.

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,749
This is an American ship,
so as you're concerned, it's American soil.

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,310
- There are arms on this ship.
- Have you found arms on this ship?

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,235
Here's the license number. Maybe
we'll have to detain the ship in Havana.

28
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,278
You can't hold a ship
because of one solitary pistol.

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,274
That deck is off-limits except to the crew.

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,432
You're violating every
international maritime law there is...

31
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,909
...and unless you can show me
a search warrant...

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,309
...I'm reporting you to the US Embassy.

33
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,278
We've been adv. Ised there's contraband
on this ship.

34
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,713
Advised by who?

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,758
Just because your military can't control
some kids throwing...

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,989
It's mine.

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,993
<i>- This your car, sir?
- You copied the wrong plates, amigo.</i>

38
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,197
That's my gun. Why? Is there a problem?
Want to see my perm. It?

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,510
It's prohibited to bring weapons into Cuba.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,875
Could we talk about this outside?

41
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,758
- I'm sorry for the fuss, Captain.
- After you, sir.

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,278
Okay, everything's settled.

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,989
Just relax. Have a nice time.
Have a Christmas drink on the house.

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,152
Mrs. Duran?

45
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,912
Marion Chigwell.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,912
We met the last t. Ime I was. In Havana
at Nettie Greenfield's.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,070
Of course. Hello.

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,832
I don't know if Nettie told you.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,037
<i>I'm writing an article on Caribbean cuisine
for Gourmet Magazine.</i>

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,189
Really?

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,113
She said you know a woman
who has the best cook in Havana.

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,839
What w. Ill happen to that man
who owned the gun?

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,715
They'll probably give him a hard time.

54
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,269
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Thanks, no. Excuse me.

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,439
It's no joke, my friend.
It's a very serious offense.

56
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,750
I see no permit here, sir.

57
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,758
Maybe I got it right here.

58
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,357
Maybe I need a new permit.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,316
Come on, guys. It's Christmas Eve.

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,749
<i>We are no longer. Issu. Ing perm. Its, señor.</i>

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
The fresh air woke me up.
Tell me about your article.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,113
See if you like this.

63
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,275
- I'm crazy about it.
- A pinch of ground coffee.

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,351
<i>Another for the lady, por favor.</i>

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,437
What were you do. Ing states. Ide?

66
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,988
- Palm Beach parties?
- No, just...

67
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,230
Just last minute Christmas shopping?

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,995
$300.

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,151
That's a lot of money.

70
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,754
Could you excuse us?
There's a guy really sick in here.

71
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,195
Use the one downstairs, please. Thanks.

72
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,117
- $400.
- You just sa. Id $300.

73
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,634
- You're ungrateful.
- Okay, I...

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,312
...make. It $350.

75
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,669
$500.

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,718
It's a kind of picante sauce.
It's extraordinary.

77
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,076
- Wa. It a m. Inute, man.
- What?

78
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,878
Where's my gun?

79
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,316
You go out on the deck,
and look over the railing...

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,038
...way over.

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,554
He uses fresh cilantro instead of parsley.

82
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,596
I'm so sorry. Excuse me again.

83
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,949
Dance, Sailor?

84
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,870
You look surprised.
Don't women ever ask you to dance?

85
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,470
Not women as beautiful as you.

86
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,948
Thank you, sir.

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,231
And the ones that do usually find it easier
than you did.

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,833
What?

89
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,914
I said all that fuss over one little gun.

90
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,957
They got a tip, they say.

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,671
- Is that the end of it, you think?
- End of what?

92
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,035
- The searching.
- Probably not. Why?

93
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,317
- Bringing in something you shouldn't?
- Perfume.

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,757
That's going the other way.
Smells good, though.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,149
It wasn't your gun, was it?

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,313
- Excuse me, miss. I've got some friends...
- $500.

97
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,117
- No, thanks.
- I haven't told you...

98
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,349
Okay. What?

99
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,596
- It's silly, really.
- Is it?

100
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,316
Because you don't seem silly to me.

101
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,079
Let me guess.

102
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,552
You want to drive your car off the boat
but you've suddenly developed a problem.

103
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,435
Come here.

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,953
You can't be doing this for a living.
You're lousy at it.

105
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,951
I'm not doing it for a living.

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,354
People know you in Havana?

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,557
I live there.
I'll pay whatever. It takes. $600.

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,269
$800.

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,591
You really want this, don't you?

110
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,473
W. Ill you do. It?

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,919
It would be against my principles,
if I had any.

112
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,039
One, two, three, four, five, six.

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,432
The way it works is half now, half later.

114
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,239
That way I won't run away
with your "perfume."

115
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,359
The Lido.

116
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,715
Pardon me?

117
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,878
Where I'll take your car.

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,793
Fine. I'll see you at the casino
at 10:00 for...

119
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,108
The payoff.

120
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,911
Thank you.

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,470
Want to tell me what k. Ind of car,
or should I just try them all?

122
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,758
A green Town and Country.

123
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,512
Mine's a Cadillac convertible.

124
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,349
Naturally.

125
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,997
Swell.

126
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,796
Please get out of the car, sir.

127
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,028
- What's. In the boxes?
- What?

128
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,514
What's. In the boxes?

129
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,071
- Probably hand grenades.
- Open them.

130
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,559
- Take a couple for the kids.
- Thank you, sir.

131
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,189
Jack.

132
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,755
- Ramos, where's the story?
- How are you?

133
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,752
Right here,
interviewing your fellow Americans.

134
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,876
It's amazing. No one is afraid.

135
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,310
Should we be?

136
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
You don't take any of this seriously,
do you?

137
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,390
I know. It's like pesos to you.

138
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,754
Or any foreign currency.

139
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,479
If it's not an American dollar,
it's worth nothing.

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,711
Jack, I'm telling you we are in the middle
of a revolution.

141
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,399
This revolution is real.

142
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,597
It's too early for this bullshit.
Have you seen Joe Volp. I?

143
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,672
- Never mind.
- Welcome back.

144
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,436
How are you?
You ought to check your messages.

145
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,431
I've been trying to reach you for a week.

146
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,671
I've been putting together a stake.
Can't run a game without one.

147
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,591
It's off. There's no game to run.

148
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,750
Mike McClany on two, Joe.

149
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,354
- Later.
- You're kidding, right?

150
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,954
Nobody's interested
in high-stakes poker right now.

151
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,315
We got a I. Ittle confus. Ion go. Ing on
down here.

152
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,879
You mean the revolution?

153
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,599
There should be a lot of loose money,
people cashing out.

154
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,954
You know what they do?

155
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,270
They give their wives money,
buy holy statues.

156
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,352
The wife shoves a few grand
up St. Anthony's ass and flies to Miami.

157
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,512
- Forget poker.
- Langan's down three, wants three more.

158
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,870
I'll tell you something
I learned in the Pacific.

159
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,713
Nothing like some gunfire
to stimulate a little action.

160
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,837
Is that right? Somebody blew up
an ammunition dump last night.

161
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,672
- See any big players?
- They're there.

162
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,116
They're not playing. They don't
smell blood. I thought we had a deal.

163
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,760
They're not playing 'cause
they don't know what'll happen.

164
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,118
They're sweating out there. I can smell it.
This is exactly the time to set up a big one.

165
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,397
You just got off the boat.
These people have what we call factions.

166
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,040
One group wants this guy,
the other wants their guy.

167
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,430
Meanwhile, this Castro is broadcasting
shortwave from the mountains.

168
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,954
Talking insurrection.
Change, he's talking about.

169
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,508
Change what?
They don't know what they want.

170
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,433
That's why they'll play.
They can do something about it.

171
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,512
You want to play poker,
play poker in your apartment.

172
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,355
The players I'm talking about...

173
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,830
...they don't walk up three flights.

174
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,436
I can make this thing happen.

175
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,830
They'll walk around the tables.
It would heat things up. A big game.

176
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,070
Nice shoes, Jack. New?

177
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,913
There are other places.

178
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,389
Not really. Meyer still runs this town.

179
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,238
Think it over, Joe.

180
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,192
But don't take too long.
The revolution might go away.

181
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,871
No more bets.

182
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,391
Twenty-two, black.

183
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,991
Place your bets, folks.

184
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,798
Gonna bet seven, right?

185
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,989
That's what people usually bet
when they don't bet their birthdays.

186
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,558
This way you lose also.
It just takes longer.

187
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,795
Nineteen, red.

188
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,874
I got it. Never mind. I got it. Sorry.

189
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,674
Cigarette lighter, cigarettes...

190
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,910
...passport, US, wallet.

191
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,631
- Want a da. Iqu. Ir. I?
- Ginger ale, please.

192
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,276
Ginger ale and a daiquiri.

193
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,990
Let me give you your money.

194
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,240
Here's the parking ticket and...

195
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,949
Six, seven, eight. It's all here.

196
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,553
Aren't you impressed?

197
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,154
You think I'm just a jerk
trying to pick you up?

198
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,199
- Why should I change my m. Ind, Mr...
- We. Il.

199
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,875
You can call me Jack.
And what's your name?

200
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,399
Millicent Smith.

201
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,237
No, it's not.

202
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,515
What do you do, Mr. We. Il?
Are you a magician?

203
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,555
Ann...

204
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,032
Shirley no, not Shirley.

205
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,799
- Catherine.
- Roberta.

206
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,796
What are the rad. Ios for, Bobby?

207
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,077
- Did you think I wouldn't check?
- A worthy cause.

208
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,958
Worthy enough to get me stuck
in a Cuban jail?

209
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,436
Yes.

210
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,396
Are you some kind of fanatic?

211
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,118
Thank you for helping.

212
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,470
- Green Town and Country for the lady.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

213
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,829
- I'd like to see you again.
- I told you. I'm married.

214
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,557
No, you didn't.

215
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,990
I'm sorry. It was unintentional.

216
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,719
That's too bad.

217
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,228
This isn't like the States.
People fool around here.

218
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,470
I think it's the climate.

219
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,751
I keep a place here. A small flat.

220
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,469
It's in one of the old buildings.
A lot of charm, discreet.

221
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,554
You're very straightforward,
aren't you, Mr. We. Il?

222
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,154
I can be suave.

223
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,710
Believe me. But I figure you know
a lot of suave guys.

224
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,428
I got no edge that way.

225
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,636
But how many crude guys do you know?

226
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,872
You are seriously beautiful.

227
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,313
Please.

228
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,519
It's very important
that nobody know about this.

229
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,559
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

230
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,154
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I do.

231
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,920
Silk blouse, fancy car.
Why do you need a revolut. Ion?

232
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,549
You did me a favor.
I'm very grateful, but you're arrogant.

233
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,076
What do you really know about Cuba?

234
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,517
Who's. In charge and how to stay out
of trouble. What I know about any place.

235
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,079
That's not enough.

236
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,069
Can I have that?

237
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,598
For luck.

238
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,120
- Do you believe in luck?
- Nope.

239
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,392
I really have to go. Thank you.

240
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,910
I got a message for Joe Volp.i.

241
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,549
Th. Is. Is Jack We. Il.
Tell him I'm out playing cards.

242
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,236
<i>The ante is dos pesos.</i>

243
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,871
We're play. Ing stra. Ight draw.

244
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,155
You bluffed me, man. I know it.

245
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,431
What's the word for "bluff"
in this language?

246
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,078
Bluff is the word.

247
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,752
It'll cost you a grand.

248
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,669
I'm in.

249
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,477
<i>All for you, amigo.
Also some coffee, when you get a chance.</i>

250
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,832
It's Baby Hernandez.

251
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,593
So what they say is true, Jackie?

252
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,114
- What?
- That you'll play anywhere.

253
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,634
Anywhere they'll have me. You in?

254
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,077
Deal. I got to make a call.

255
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,835
Deuce, trey. Possible straight.

256
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,469
Nine to five, office hours. Pair of ladies.

257
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,915
Four of clubs. Suicide king.

258
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,991
Seven and three belong to me.

259
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,439
Ladies bet.

260
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,398
I w. Ill bet $300.

261
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,311
I'm in.

262
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,154
Good action. Congenial surroundings.

263
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,390
It's all I ask for.

264
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,189
- I got impatient.
- You're in no position.

265
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,111
Got your attention, though.

266
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,871
I always said if you thought about anything
but snatch and poker...

267
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,871
...you'd be a remarkable man.

268
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,598
Look at those poor sons of bitches.

269
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,831
They'll trade in that schmuck Batista
for what? Some other schmuck.

270
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,150
What do you th. Ink, Joe? You worr. Ied?

271
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,114
You know they spit on Nixon
in South America?

272
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,158
They sp. It on the V. Ice Pres. Ident
of the United States.

273
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,397
<i>And The New York Times
thinks Castro's Jesus H. Christ.</i>

274
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,951
Younger than me, Castro.

275
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,759
Okay. You can run one game at the Lido.
Ten percent rake, the way we said.

276
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,869
That's not enough.

277
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,152
I want more, Joe.

278
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,949
I've played every Elk's club and Moose hall
in America, Joe.

279
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,395
I remember every hand of every game...

280
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,199
...and now I want a shot, one shot...

281
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,995
...at a game I could never get near before...

282
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,516
...with guys who don't even think
how much they're playing for.

283
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,192
I want the house to back me.
I want you to talk to Meyer.

284
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,359
Yesterday you were begging to run
a game. Now you want to get bankrolled?

285
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,831
- Didn't I save your life during the war?
- I was. In Vegas.

286
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,188
I would have.

287
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,880
What. Is th. Is? I don't th. Ink I remember you.

288
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,113
Funny thing happened to me
last week, Joe.

289
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,509
I realized I wasn't going to die young.

290
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,111
This is the time for me.

291
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,591
Right now. And this is the city.

292
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,831
You're a little tired, Jack.
One game, the way we said.

293
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,399
We'll see how that goes.

294
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,109
One world at a time, my friend.

295
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,874
I find an old-fashioned strongman
like Batista sort of charming, funny.

296
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,270
- To us that joke is now stale.
- But who is he? Castro?

297
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,591
Just a voice on the radio.
Is he a Communist?

298
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,712
What. Is a Commun. Ist?
In Russia, Communism is boring.

299
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,791
Bring it to the Caribbean. Cha-cha-cha.

300
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,877
By the way, it's the daiquiri here
and the mojito at the Conuco.

301
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,313
Felipe.

302
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,238
Hi. Do you speak English?

303
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,874
- All the time.
- I told you he was American.

304
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,792
- L. Isten. We can't dec. Ide.
- What you want. Is a da. Iqu. Ir.i.

305
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,428
<i>Daiquiris. Dos.</i>

306
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,631
- And what if I don't like it?
- You will.

307
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,234
My name's Jack We. Il, by the way.

308
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,038
I'm Diane...

309
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,076
...and she's Patty.

310
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,798
Down here marlin fishing?

311
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,110
<i>Merry Christmas, señoritas.</i>

312
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,515
- Your first trip to Havana?
- Where's the story?

313
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,034
These two beautiful flowers are the story.

314
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,271
Welcome to Hem. Ingway's favor. Ite bar.

315
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,238
We know. We hoped we'd see h. Im here.

316
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,311
I'm Diane and she's Patty.

317
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,118
Hello. He didn't tell you?

318
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,109
Tell us what?

319
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,078
Son of a gun. That's so like you, Ernie.

320
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,075
Ernest Jack Hemingway.

321
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,114
- Where's the beard?
- He's traveling incognito.

322
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,158
<i>Hello. I'm Marion Chigwell.
I write for Gourmet.</i>

323
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,958
How are you? Hello.

324
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,955
Were you on the Key West ferry
a few nights ago?

325
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,998
- Was I wear. Ing a beard?
- No beard.

326
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,278
Hey, what about Castro and them?
Is all this dangerous?

327
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,078
Excuse me. Nice meeting you.

328
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,513
- Ladies.
- Shoving off?

329
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,354
I still have three restaurants to try
before midnight. I'll see you.

330
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,197
- You think he's a fruit?
- He's lying about something.

331
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,038
Okay, let's start at a place
where the tourists don't drink.

332
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,596
- Want to try a moj. Ito?
- Sure. I want to try everything.

333
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,954
All right.

334
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,311
- How about you, Diane?
- I'm Patty.

335
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,960
Right, just testing you.
Want to try everyth. Ing, too?

336
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,157
I sure hope so.
See the guys at the end of the bar?

337
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,558
Dressed in white.
They're Batista's secret police.

338
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,671
S-l-M. SIM.

339
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,239
What do they want?

340
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,034
They want to keep something
from happening.

341
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,111
That'd be too bad.

342
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,430
My God.

343
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,953
- It's Duran.
- What?

344
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,113
It's Arturo Duran.

345
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,633
Is he a friend of yours?

346
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,995
I know his family. He's a doctor.

347
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,080
I met him once.

348
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,709
They say he's been in the mountains,
meeting with Castro.

349
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,994
I think he's a very important man
in the resistance.

350
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,150
Are we going to eat here or what?

351
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,954
- Who's the woman?
- That's his wife.

352
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,793
Hello.

353
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,316
It's been a long time.
Do you have a moment?

354
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,955
For you? Are you kidding?

355
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,197
<i>- Good evening.
- Señora Duran.</i>

356
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,630
I didn't know your husband
knew Jack We. Il.

357
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,111
- Yes.
- I'm Diane and this is Patty.

358
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,155
Sorry. Ramos is okay...

359
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,874
...but he's a reporter, after all.

360
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,357
- Yeah.
- You don't know who I am, do you?

361
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,633
Just that Ramos gets all choked up
when he talks about you.

362
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,473
You know Latins.

363
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,188
I wanted to thank you for what you did.
My wife says you were amazing.

364
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,551
Can you have supper with us?

365
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,676
- No...
- Of course you can.

366
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,233
Please.

367
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,749
It would make us very happy.

368
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,398
I think you will like the food.

369
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,950
- I've eaten here.
- Mr. We. Il keeps an apartment. In Havana.

370
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,270
You spend a lot of time in Havana?

371
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,876
I come down here to play cards.

372
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,510
- Gambling?
- I keep the gambling to a minimum.

373
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,797
- How do you do that?
- By being good at it.

374
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,479
These guys in the shades
they don't worry you?

375
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,355
Not so much. Not because I'm brave.

376
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,152
For Batista there are two classes
of people in Cuba...

377
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,750
...the torturable and the non-torturable.

378
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,990
I come from a well-known family...

379
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,150
...an old one, rich.

380
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,434
Too rich.

381
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,513
I hope you know how important it was,
what you did for us.

382
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,029
It's okay. I'll take your word for it.

383
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,314
You're a card player.
A good one, I assume.

384
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,190
If I asked you to do something more...

385
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,398
No, I don't play cards for that.
That's politics.

386
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,437
That's very American.
Politics is what your life is all about.

387
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,590
- But you're not interested.
- Not my life.

388
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,989
Everyone's I. Ife, Mr. We. Il.

389
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,270
Isn't politics just a kind of hope?

390
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,953
It's still politics.

391
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,238
What about fa. Irness?

392
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,754
I'm sorry?

393
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,958
As a gambler,
doesn't fairness interest you?

394
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,634
Very much.

395
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,559
Outside of the casinos here, it's not so fair.

396
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,717
Children in the country die of TB.

397
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,031
And those that don't die,
when they get hungry enough...

398
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,232
...they come to Havana
and sell themselves.

399
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,189
- Some of us are trying to change...
- You're mak. Ing Mr. We. Il uncomfortable.

400
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,909
I'm sorry. I'm being a bore.

401
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,073
You see, it's just that we have
one objective in mind...

402
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,710
...to get rid of him.

403
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,075
You cannot do that nicely.

404
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,875
Please don't misunderstand me.

405
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,350
In fact, I'm fascinated by men like you...

406
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,197
...how you keep a kind of innocence.

407
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,750
Perhaps it isn't innocence at all.
Perhaps Mr. We. Il...

408
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,598
...really doesn't give a damn.

409
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,199
I know politicians. I play cards with them.

410
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,598
And I love to because they're easy to beat.

411
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,917
It's the only place an ordinary man
can beat a politician.

412
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,309
I think I ought to join my friends.

413
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,235
- It was good of you to take the time...
- Why are they easy to beat?

414
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,990
Because sometimes in poker it's smarter
to lose with a winning hand...

415
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,595
...so you can win later with a losing one.

416
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,116
And politicians never can quite
believe that...

417
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,196
...because they want the power now.

418
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,959
I think you know more
than you adm. It, Mr. We. Il.

419
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,998
Someone has to be responsible
for changing things.

420
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,958
Maybe so, but I don't really feel qualified
to decide who.

421
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,598
Then why did you help?

422
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,956
- It was a business deal.
- Then why did you give back the money?

423
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,950
She told me the envelope was in her purse
when she got home.

424
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,150
Perhaps you do believe
in something after all.

425
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,118
Perhaps you believe
. in beaut. iful women, Mr. We. il.

426
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,551
<i>Blow job, americano señor?</i>

427
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,878
Santos, how's it going?

428
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,591
Twilight of the gods, Jackie.

429
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,317
Well, well.

430
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,677
You're full of surprises.
How do you know him anyway?

431
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,479
We went to jun. Ior h. Igh school together.
I miss anything?

432
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,270
Having a good time, ladies?

433
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,834
It's okay, but...

434
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,912
- I want to see the real Havana.
- Yeah?

435
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,036
- Where are the I. Ights?
- Don't turn on the lights.

436
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,190
Snow Wh. Ite. Come here.

437
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,829
This is what you came down for, isn't it?

438
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,591
Patty, where are you?

439
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,077
Wh. Ich one are you?

440
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,159
Wh. Ich one are you?

441
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,471
Anejo and a cup of coffee.

442
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,638
Lost you last night.

443
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,430
You hear the one about the prostitute,
the parrot and the pig?

444
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,636
A prostitute, a parrot and a pig
are floating along in a raft.

445
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,753
And the...

446
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,833
The parrot says to the pig...

447
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,638
Do you want to hear this?

448
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,713
Taken in the morgue this morning.

449
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,757
SIM finally got him.

450
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,551
They say he tried to escape
and they had to shoot him.

451
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,037
What d. Id he say last n. Ight? Anyth. Ing?

452
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,714
Was he worr. Ied? What d. Id he say?

453
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,831
He said he was non-torturable.

454
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,231
Right. So they just killed him.

455
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,668
Goddamn SIM.

456
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,158
Joe Volp. I has been look. Ing for you.
He said he was able to arrange the party.

457
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,231
Varadero Su. Ite at the L. Ido.

458
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,035
Are you not telling me something
I should know?

459
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,395
What about the w. Ife?
What happened to her?

460
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,914
Newspaper says "disappeared."

461
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,597
Your husband was a fool.

462
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,632
But he was a Cuban fool.

463
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,510
You, I cannot understand.

464
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,429
This government is the protector
of your class!

465
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,710
Tell me you understand that!

466
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,794
Do you understand that?

467
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,639
Are there others like you
from the country club?

468
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,669
Tell me!

469
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,716
Perhaps you know them
from the hairdresser or the yacht club?

470
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,314
<i>What am I gonna do w. Ith you, señora?</i>

471
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,836
The heavy hitter's Roy Forbes.

472
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,672
Canadian. Tin mines. Loaded.

473
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,990
- Who are the wrestlers?
- Bodyguards.

474
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,150
One of our players is unpopular lately.

475
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,515
Colonel Menocal. Runs SIM.

476
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,079
Gentlemen. Who do you know, Jack?
You know W. Illy?

477
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,196
Somebody said you were sailing
off Venezuela.

478
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,474
You know Baby.

479
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,671
Roy Forbes, Jack We. Il.

480
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,595
- Captain.
- Lieutenant. Faustino Coro.

481
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,753
Buy-in's a grand.

482
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,352
- Give me three.
- Just gonna stick your toe in the water?

483
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,674
You're letting this bum in the game, Joe?

484
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,598
I let you in, Mike.
Who the hell am I gonna refuse?

485
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,834
<i>- Colonel Menocal. Jack We. Il.
- Mucho gusto.</i>

486
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,073
Colonel.

487
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,839
Table stakes. $20 ante. Dealer's cho. Ice.

488
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,674
We play. Ing aga. Inst Joe Volp. I's money
or yours?

489
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,394
All mine.

490
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,188
In honor of you, Mr. Forbes.
Canadian stud.

491
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,232
You know how to play?

492
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,676
Sure. Four cards straight.
A flush beats a pair.

493
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,113
Okay with you?

494
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,469
Of course.

495
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,718
I seen your friend, Dante de Cenzo,
in Miami.

496
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,473
Did he tell you I own this joint now?

497
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,913
Practically.

498
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,839
The feds made him sell.
S. Ince the Kefauver...

499
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,588
...you can't own a jo. Int. In Vegas and Cuba.

500
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,195
Louder, Mike. The bugs may not have
picked up every word.

501
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,914
- This is public knowledge.
- It is now.

502
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,629
When you play poker you got to ante f. Irst.
One of the main rules.

503
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,118
It's Christmas firecrackers.

504
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,755
- Ten bets.
- It's getting to be like Shanghai.

505
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,637
I was there in '49.

506
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,439
It was sensational, but I stayed too long.

507
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,988
The Communists came in. I lost a fortune.

508
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,355
$50.

509
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,397
Trick is to get in and to get out.

510
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,311
Th. Is. Is not Shangha. I, W. Illy.

511
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,038
This is Havana, Cuba.

512
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,550
Any chance Mrs. Duran is alive?

513
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,598
Play poker, Jack.

514
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,078
Whose bet?

515
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,993
It's Jack's bet.

516
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,510
<i>Wa. It, señora.</i>

517
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,588
Surely you know something of value,
something I can tell my colonel.

518
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,469
It would please him.
I would be sergeant maybe.

519
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,751
<i>Come in here, señora.</i>

520
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,308
I want to show you something.

521
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,755
What can happen.

522
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,629
You see what can happen?

523
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,118
You know this pretty girl?

524
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,879
Her name is...

525
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,951
...Monica Eloy.

526
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,918
She's 17 years old.

527
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,629
She was a drama student at the university
before it was closed.

528
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,558
She had a scholarship.

529
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,272
She made her own clothes.

530
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,552
She could sew very well,
and she made her own clothes.

531
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,271
She made that dress.

532
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,748
I'll drown before I tell you anything more.

533
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,198
You'll die a corporal, you son of a bitch.

534
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,594
What am I supposed to th. Ink?

535
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,757
When you ra. Ised,
I thought you had sevens back to back.

536
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,634
Now you want me to think
you have hearts.

537
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,876
But then you wouldn't have checked.

538
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,159
$800.

539
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,834
Your eight.

540
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,198
Five more.

541
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,993
I'm out.

542
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,350
I think you're trying to steal it.

543
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,797
I have aces, my friend.

544
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,231
Four hearts beats a pair, right?

545
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,872
It's up to you, Mr. Forbes.
Want to call. It a n. Ight?

546
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,429
You're too lucky, Jack, and I'm too tired.

547
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,515
It doesn't pay to underestimate you.

548
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,714
Mrs. Duran is being questioned
by authorities.

549
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,799
- You're the authorities, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

550
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,150
Buy you some breakfast, Colonel?

551
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,874
- I assure you...
- Sure.

552
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,436
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Forbes?
- Except for the losing.

553
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,834
Sandwiches were great.

554
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,992
Maybe we can make it more interesting
for you next time.

555
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,318
I m. Ight try. It aga. In. See you, We. Il.

556
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,239
How'd it go?

557
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,910
You know how it went.
I remember you now.

558
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,072
- You still play a decent game of poker.
- You gonna talk to Meyer?

559
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,390
What were you do. Ing w. Ith the colonel?

560
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,997
- I was just curious.
- Stop it!

561
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,352
If you want broads, pick them
with better political affiliations.

562
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,398
There's a lot of foolish people
in Havana these days.

563
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,554
Why'd you take a marker
from the lieutenant?

564
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,794
He's a jerk.

565
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,237
You know it'll take a Cuban lieutenant
10 years to buy back his marker?

566
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,193
Joe, are you gonna talk to Meyer?

567
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,713
I don't know yet.

568
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,557
Rank has its privileges.

569
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,758
Boss goes home to sleep...

570
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,039
...and here you are.

571
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,117
- Is there something l...
- Yeah.

572
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,233
This little marker.

573
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,554
<i>Señor We. Il...</i>

574
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,476
...it will take me a little time to...
- Volp. I says 10 years.

575
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,917
- Well, no...
- lf you're lucky.

576
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,157
Wh. Ich you def. In. Itely are not.

577
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,759
Till now.

578
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,638
First class.

579
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,392
By the time your boss wakes up,
you're in a Miami hotel...

580
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,119
...sitting by the pool sipping a sloe gin fizz.

581
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,079
Why would I do that?

582
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,152
Because the political situation stinks
down here.

583
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,438
And it's getting worse.

584
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,398
Because they'd pass you for promotion
if you let a friend of mine out of here.

585
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,593
The woman you asked about?

586
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,159
American passport.

587
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,878
She shouldn't be here.

588
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,398
Nobody should be here.

589
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,755
And to pay for the sloe gin fizz...

590
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,594
...and dinner?

591
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,511
$2,000. Amer. Ican.

592
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,359
Do you have any friends where you can go?

593
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,678
I'd like to walk a little.

594
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,950
I'd like to get a cup of coffee
and I'd like to walk a little.

595
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,798
Do you have a cigarette?

596
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,835
Here.

597
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,158
Could you eat something?

598
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,038
What'd they do to you?

599
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,558
What are you, a gangster?

600
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,038
Do I look like a gangster?

601
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,992
You can see the fish.

602
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,077
Listen, I don't know
that this is gonna work or not...

603
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,030
- Where are you from?
- I don't know. Philadelphia.

604
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,316
I have friends in Philadelphia.

605
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,238
I bet I don't know them.

606
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,912
I think we ought to get out of here.

607
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,434
- I'd like to walk.
- Walk?

608
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,518
- Where?
- Home.

609
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,990
I don't think you should go home.

610
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,312
Fried egg sandwich okay?

611
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,477
- I'm not hungry.
- You will be. Sit down.

612
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,154
Go ahead.

613
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,319
What day. Is. It?

614
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,439
- Sunday.
- Someone has to get to Santa Clara.

615
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,354
Why? What's go. Ing on. In Santa Clara?

616
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,751
<i>Just before Santa Clara,
Arturo's family has a finca...</i>

617
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,274
...a country house...

618
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:23,070
...just this side of Santa Clara, sometimes
the rebels use it. They don't know that...

619
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,919
Where are you from?

620
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,840
- I mean, where did you grow up?
- Sweden.

621
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,835
I thought a Scandinavian country.

622
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,478
Do you have family there?

623
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,272
Are you in touch with them?

624
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,760
No. Christmas.

625
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,954
- It's Christmas now.
- Not this Christmas.

626
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,276
You ought to be in touch with them.

627
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,269
You really ought to make a point of it.

628
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,516
So you came down here from Sweden?
What? To warm up?

629
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,919
I was in California. I lived in California.

630
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,118
- Hollywood.
- Hollywood!

631
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,673
You get around.
What were you do. Ing. In Hollywood?

632
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,997
I saw Garbo when I was a kid.

633
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,469
Garbo?

634
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,114
Oh, right! Swedish!

635
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,830
<i>She was in Camille with Robert Taylor.</i>

636
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,229
- No kidding?
- He was Armand.

637
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,158
He was so pretty.
I wanted to meet him. So I...

638
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,350
I came to California to be an actress.

639
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,159
To be pals with Taylor.
That's one way to do it.

640
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,553
You came down to Cuba
from sunny California.

641
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,918
I came here from Mexico.

642
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,831
Hold. It. What happened to Cal. Iforn. Ia?

643
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,799
I married a writer. He was blacklisted,
so we had to leave the States.

644
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,029
Commie?

645
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,394
I've known good ones,
and I've known bad ones.

646
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,479
He wrote Westerns.

647
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,033
I I. Ike Westerns.

648
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,956
I don't know what they have to do
with anything, but I like them.

649
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,473
He hated Mexico.

650
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,594
He started drinking,
and then it was finished.

651
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,871
- I should have got some clean clothes.
- We'll get you some.

652
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,668
How did it go for you in Mexico?
I mean, did you get any acting jobs?

653
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,075
I did.

654
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,916
<i>I was always la gringa.</i>

655
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,389
My favorite was when I played
the daughter of a mad scientist...

656
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,750
...and he replaces my brain.

657
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,393
He replaces my brain
with the brain of a gorilla.

658
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,269
And my sweetheart
doesn't know this, but...

659
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,160
...he comes to the lab one night
and he says:

660
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,309
<i>Querida, ¿qué pasa?
Te comportas de un modo bastante raro.</i>

661
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,392
And I go:

662
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,512
I met a lot of nice people in Mexico.
I met Arturo.

663
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,998
In the past seven years I've spent
maybe 10 days in the States.

664
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,398
What's. It I. Ike these days?

665
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,393
Dodgers moved to L.A.

666
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,997
Giants moved to San Francisco.

667
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,315
And you can see yourself on television
in front of the RCA building.

668
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,149
See?

669
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,638
Do you want to go back?

670
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,392
I can get you a seat anytime. Anywhere.

671
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,120
I don't think it's safe for you here anymore.

672
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,432
Why are you do. Ing all th. Is?

673
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,519
For old time's sake.

674
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,991
Do you want to rest for a while?

675
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,992
I'd like to take a shower.

676
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,399
It's over there.

677
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,279
He almost did it.

678
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,272
We were so close.

679
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,795
I'm sorry.

680
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,473
He was a good guy.

681
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,433
Yes, he was.

682
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,713
You have no idea.

683
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,595
He said...

684
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,800
...he'd like to play poker
with you sometime.

685
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,631
I'd rather take a nap in here.

686
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,435
- Here. I'll close the shutters.
- No!

687
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,633
That's why I like it.

688
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,718
You don't have to stay.

689
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,194
I live here.

690
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,878
Would you put on a record?

691
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,029
Congratulations. Meyer's interested.

692
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,952
Forbes has a couple of heavyweight
Canucks coming from Montreal.

693
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,039
<i>Something wrong?</i>

694
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,876
<i>- Nothing's wrong.
- Good.</i>

695
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,669
<i>Be at Meyer's party tonight.
He want's to get a look at your face.</i>

696
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,513
<i>With any luck,
I can set this up in a day or two.</i>

697
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,235
<i>Get there around 11:00.
Meyer won't be there before then anyway.</i>

698
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,714
What's th. Is?

699
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,189
- What are you up to?
- What's go. Ing on?

700
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,958
It's a simple question.

701
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,553
What are you up to?

702
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,231
Looking for the big one,
just like everybody down here.

703
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,473
Only this time you did a favor
for a woman.

704
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,438
I was brought up that way.

705
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,670
You know she's political, this woman?

706
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,789
- And she's also beautiful.
- Beautiful women are all over Havana.

707
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,077
This one's exceptional.

708
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,711
$2,000 is high.

709
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,590
Even if she's exceptional, it's high.

710
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,830
First class seats are difficult
during the holidays. Don't waste them.

711
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,270
Come on, Colonel!

712
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,518
She's pretty. I did her a favor. That's it.
What do I want w. Ith a revolut. Ionary?

713
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,717
- Do you think I care about this stuff?
- But you need to care.

714
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,078
You need to, because your father didn't
manicure his nails and neither did mine.

715
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,118
My old man coughed up his lungs
in the cane fields.

716
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:19,748
And do you know who owned those fields?

717
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:22,310
Arturo Duran's family.

718
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:26,628
His people get tired of fucking you
one way, they fuck you another.

719
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,153
We have a good I. Lfe, you and I.

720
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:35,110
These people want to bring down
everything you're here for:

721
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,512
The food, the fucking,
the gambling, the shows.

722
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:43,432
They think this is all
for a government to decide.

723
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,828
- What do you th. Ink?
- I made a mistake.

724
01:10:49,639 --> 01:10:50,913
Yes, you did.

725
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,469
But you're a damn good poker player.

726
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:02,427
You know what I'd like to do with my life
if I weren't a policeman?

727
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:04,753
What you do.

728
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,432
I love the game.

729
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:13,192
Don't start doing the wrong thing
with your life.

730
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:51,155
Wa. It a m. Inute!
You gotta celebrate with me tonight!

731
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:53,993
We were d. Iscuss. Ing three at a t. Ime.

732
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,115
I gave myself a Christmas present:

733
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:59,589
Chinese, a negrita,
and I think the other one was Danish.

734
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:02,910
- How was it?
- I felt left out.

735
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,234
Celebrate with me.

736
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,116
You said we were on the same boat.

737
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:08,269
- We were.
- There was a very elegant lady.

738
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:11,396
Roberta Duran. You danced with her.
She's a friend of mine.

739
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:13,947
- It's terrible about her husband.
- Have you seen her?

740
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,075
- Disappeared, they say.
- Disappeared?

741
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,277
- Come on! Disappeared!
- She was released.

742
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:22,508
I'm glad.

743
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:25,433
It's easy to lose track of people in Havana.

744
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:29,393
- Damn right! I was trying to find her!
- Excuse me? I must find the head.

745
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,788
Can you imagine what it looks like
in this place?

746
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:34,473
I've been trying to find her
for an interview.

747
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:37,989
But the government closed down
the paper. The editor's in jail.

748
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,435
- You're kidding?
- No. He's leaving Havana tomorrow.

749
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:43,032
What are you gonna do?

750
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,988
I was going to join Fidel,
but you have to bring your own gun.

751
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:50,355
- So I'm going to Miami Beach instead.
- You're not going...

752
01:12:50,879 --> 01:12:54,189
No! It's the tragedy
of the Cuban middle class, my friend.

753
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:57,790
We know what should be done,
but we go to Miami Beach instead.

754
01:12:57,879 --> 01:13:01,997
We're paralyzed by self-doubt
and intellectuality...

755
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:04,033
...and by you.

756
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:08,754
<i>- We want to be so much I. Ike Amer. Icans.
- You're getting messy, chico.</i>

757
01:13:08,839 --> 01:13:10,716
And we need to be ourselves.

758
01:13:10,799 --> 01:13:13,313
Have something to eat.
The food is terrible in Florida.

759
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:15,629
No food, Baby. All right?

760
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:17,713
I'll miss you.

761
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:22,438
- You be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

762
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:28,912
I'm hearing rumors...

763
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,514
...about big poker, no limit.

764
01:13:31,759 --> 01:13:33,477
It m. Ight be true. Where's Joe?

765
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:35,834
Down the hall getting the bad news.

766
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:45,514
Joe, are we gonna set up in the same...

767
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:50,157
What's he say. Ing?

768
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:53,275
Take off.

769
01:13:55,759 --> 01:13:58,273
Nobody's serv. Ing out there! What. Is th. Is?

770
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:10,990
They're fighting in Santa Clara.

771
01:14:13,919 --> 01:14:16,035
Rebels just cut the island in half.

772
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:20,788
Our half is smaller than their half, Jack.

773
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,835
- Meyer, th. Is. Is Jack We. II.
- Where's the offens. Ive I pa. Id for?

774
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:30,672
- It's supposed to be an armored train.
- An armored train.

775
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:33,273
Like China, like Siberia,
like the Boxer Rebellion!

776
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:35,429
- We prom. Ise...
- Shut up and listen!

777
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,076
Here's what you're gonna do tomorrow:

778
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,229
You're gonna talk to Batista's people.

779
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,435
You're gonna explain to them
how upset I am...

780
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,716
...and they better get off their asses
and start fighting soon...

781
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:49,109
...or they'll go back to being a bunch
of banana eaters.

782
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:53,238
Remind them that the only reason
there's civilized plumbing in this country...

783
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:56,914
...is because the Americans came here
in '98 and beat the shit out of Spain.

784
01:14:56,999 --> 01:15:00,628
Batista's palace had an outdoor crapper
before we put one inside!

785
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,756
The only reason he's got an army
is because we gave him one.

786
01:15:03,839 --> 01:15:08,993
He better start using it or he'll wind up
on a corner selling beans, like he started.

787
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:11,271
We. Invented Havana!

788
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:15,507
And we can goddamn well move it
someplace else if he can't control it.

789
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:18,030
Now you explain that to him.

790
01:15:30,919 --> 01:15:32,989
Do you want to go for a walk, Jack?

791
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:35,667
Why not?

792
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,873
What do you th. Ink, Joe?
Are we rained out?

793
01:15:46,999 --> 01:15:50,230
No. The game's still on.
He said he'd back you, he will.

794
01:15:50,959 --> 01:15:53,951
He's full of tantrums.
Doesn't interfere with business.

795
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,394
Listen. The professor, is he around?

796
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:01,635
The professor's here.
Still screwing widows at the Nacional.

797
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,151
Some things never change.

798
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,230
Not him. He's seen it all.

799
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:08,031
I need to talk to him.

800
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:18,637
I like this town, Jack.

801
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,955
They call it the pearl of the Antilles...

802
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:22,950
...the Paris of the Caribbean.

803
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:25,155
- It's a city.
- There are other cities.

804
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,515
Believe me. New York is good. Chicago.

805
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,194
How long can they hold off the rebels?

806
01:16:33,959 --> 01:16:38,749
I don't know. If Batista takes a powder,
it's all over. Havana's closed.

807
01:16:39,759 --> 01:16:43,991
Forget the army. Forget the generals.
They'll all be running for their yachts.

808
01:17:01,959 --> 01:17:04,189
This town's crawling with spooks now.

809
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,276
Used to be all you had was the FBI
on your ass. No more.

810
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:13,792
- You take any heat from them?
- They don't deal with people like me.

811
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,118
These guys went to Yale.
They play bridge.

812
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:18,758
They fuck each other.

813
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,429
You know, they won't let me back
in the States.

814
01:17:26,519 --> 01:17:28,191
I'm not a citizen anymore.

815
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:30,753
Not a citizen?

816
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:38,547
What'll you do. If the rebels take the c. Ity?

817
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:42,469
Meyer's talking about Santo Domingo.

818
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:45,630
Ever been there? It's nowhere.

819
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,230
Maybe I'll go to Costa Rica.

820
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,714
I got a friend there. Retired.

821
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:53,474
W. Idow.

822
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:57,910
Meyer's got his money both ways.

823
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,470
He's making deals with the rebels,
trying to buy insurance.

824
01:18:01,919 --> 01:18:03,557
He thinks I don't know.

825
01:18:05,799 --> 01:18:06,993
Not gonna work.

826
01:18:10,759 --> 01:18:12,989
I'm gonna go stick my head in church.

827
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,872
When are you leav. Ing?

828
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,307
Last.

829
01:18:24,919 --> 01:18:25,988
Hi, sonny.

830
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,116
- Hi, Professor.
- Joe Volp. I sa. Id you were back.

831
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,110
Spending time at the Nacional?

832
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,996
Twin sisters from St. Louis
and loaded with mazoola.

833
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:38,310
Rebels are fighting in Santa Clara.

834
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:41,550
Yes. History's overtaking us, my boy.

835
01:18:41,999 --> 01:18:45,833
The wheel turns.
I hope you stay till the bitter end.

836
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:49,757
I'm going. One more game.

837
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:52,078
Want to come w. Ith me?

838
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:55,556
Take the ferry. Dr. Ive to Vegas.
You want to go to Vegas?

839
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:56,908
Nonsense.

840
01:18:57,519 --> 01:19:01,353
Atom bombs and sandy pussy.
What's your hurry?

841
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,510
I always stay here too long.

842
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:08,472
Every time I came down here I thought:
"This is where anything's possible.

843
01:19:08,559 --> 01:19:11,517
"I can find the best fuck
and biggest game of my life."

844
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:13,669
I'm ahead, way ahead, man. It's...

845
01:19:14,999 --> 01:19:17,388
...stupid for me to stick around too long.

846
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:24,398
I met this woman.

847
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,396
I know her 72 hours...

848
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,198
I don't know.

849
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:36,832
You stick with her.

850
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:39,990
Take the advice of an old man.

851
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:44,636
There's nothing like a woman, or two.
They love men. Even jerks.

852
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:50,830
The biggest jerk you ever knew somehow
has a woman that's nuts over him.

853
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,596
Women are perfect. The rest. Is bullsh. It.

854
01:19:56,519 --> 01:19:58,350
I can't. She took off.

855
01:20:00,919 --> 01:20:03,956
I think I know where she is.
She's down where they're fighting.

856
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:06,109
Goddamned if I know why.

857
01:20:09,519 --> 01:20:11,510
It's time to get out, Professor.

858
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:14,355
So when are you leaving, sonny?

859
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:16,353
After the game.

860
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:22,952
I just get this...

861
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:30,237
What are you gonna do?

862
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,429
Hell, I don't have to do anything.

863
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:35,832
But you do.

864
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:21,557
<i>I got somebody I gotta get out of there.
Americano.</i>

865
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,594
Santa Clara. I got a friend in there.

866
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:30,793
Speak Spanish!

867
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,991
I gotta get her out.

868
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,230
<i>Señora, what has happened here?</i>

869
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:31,075
Where's the woman w. Ith the car?

870
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:45,312
Where's the...

871
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,396
<i>Woman, señora.</i>

872
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:56,192
Car.

873
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,434
<i>Finca! Duran. Oh, shit!</i>

874
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:20,792
It means lost, right?

875
01:25:35,759 --> 01:25:37,078
Bye-bye, Yankee!

876
01:25:55,519 --> 01:25:56,838
I got your note.

877
01:26:01,799 --> 01:26:03,437
How did you get through?

878
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:07,077
By not speaking Spanish.

879
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,709
I didn't think I'd see you again.

880
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:31,310
That's how I thought it would go, too.
What. Is th. Is place?

881
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,230
This is Arturo's family home.

882
01:26:35,879 --> 01:26:39,189
- What are you do. Ing?
- The rebels have a transmitter out back.

883
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,434
I don't understand why you came.

884
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:44,233
Are you sorry?

885
01:26:50,519 --> 01:26:52,271
What's the transm. Itter for?

886
01:26:52,919 --> 01:26:57,231
They'll try to contact Havana tonight,
to contact our group. They don't know.

887
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:01,634
When I was. In pr. Ison I saw Bufano.

888
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:03,113
Who's Bufano?

889
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,152
He's with us. He's supposed to be with us.

890
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:11,552
Talking with the police.
I don't believe it, but I saw him. I'll try...

891
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:14,949
So you tell the rebels
not to contact the group. Then what?

892
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:17,714
- I don't know.
- Menocal's looking for you.

893
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,994
He missed you
by just a few minutes yesterday.

894
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:22,547
- I think I'm safe here.
- Nobody's safe here!

895
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:24,835
Jesus! I just drove through it!

896
01:27:24,919 --> 01:27:28,628
There are soldiers all over the road!
There is no front line in this war!

897
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,233
If he looks for you,
he'll check the airport and ferry!

898
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:34,152
- What do you expect me to do?
- Get out of Cuba.

899
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:35,952
Just for a little while.

900
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:38,599
- I know a guy with boats.
- I can't leave now.

901
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,078
Why not?

902
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,157
You think one out-of-work actress
will make any difference?

903
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:44,308
Come on!

904
01:27:44,879 --> 01:27:47,188
What has th. Is got to do w. Ith you anyway?

905
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:49,588
This isn't our business!
This is their business!

906
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:51,909
You put this place on like a costume!

907
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:55,077
<i>You've got your lines in español.</i>

908
01:27:55,799 --> 01:27:59,155
You're not poor. You're not hungry.
You're sure as hell not Cuban!

909
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:01,799
I don't have to be Cuban
to know when things are unfair.

910
01:28:01,879 --> 01:28:03,949
Th. Ings are unfa. Ir! Where have you been?

911
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:07,395
- I don't want to live that way.
- You don't marry into a revolution!

912
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:09,709
If you need war,
you'll run the rest of your life!

913
01:28:09,799 --> 01:28:13,189
Don't tell me how to make sense
of my life! I don't know you.

914
01:28:13,879 --> 01:28:17,997
All you see here is a place for a card game
because there's a fever to gamble now.

915
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:20,195
That's not what's going on!

916
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:22,788
People's lives are ending!

917
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:24,990
Families are tearing apart!

918
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:28,873
You don't really understand any of this...

919
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:32,315
...because you spend your life
playing cards.

920
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,677
I feel more honest playing cards than I do
believing these mountains are mine.

921
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:21,598
Oh, shit!

922
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:06,957
Does this phone work?

923
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:15,917
They haven't slept for weeks.
They are so excited.

924
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:18,711
Can you imagine how they feel?

925
01:30:18,799 --> 01:30:20,710
How close they are, how far they've come!

926
01:30:20,799 --> 01:30:22,152
Listen, Bobby.

927
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,035
I don't know about a lot of things.

928
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,309
But the things I know, I know well.

929
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:32,590
I try to keep out of the way
of stuff I don't understand.

930
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:35,348
Mostly.

931
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,715
All this is like living your life
in the newspapers.

932
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,351
Like you read what to do.

933
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:48,069
But they make too much out of everything.

934
01:30:49,959 --> 01:30:52,154
Most of the time, nothing's going on.

935
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,718
Just everyday stuff.

936
01:30:55,319 --> 01:30:58,117
You take a walk. You buy a necktie.

937
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:01,708
You eat a sandwich. Life.

938
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,150
Jesus! You can't live ideas.

939
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:10,072
Most things that are alive
don't even have ideas.

940
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:13,593
What's really go. Ing on
happens before ideas.

941
01:31:15,879 --> 01:31:17,028
Before talk.

942
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:21,156
Before anybody says anything.

943
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:25,834
And after.

944
01:31:27,839 --> 01:31:29,033
In the quiet.

945
01:31:30,599 --> 01:31:32,157
It isn't an idea.

946
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:39,475
It's a feeling. It's like...

947
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,358
...being part of something
more than yourself.

948
01:31:50,879 --> 01:31:52,949
Like a song some people sing together.

949
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:03,839
I don't think this is anything I can explain.

950
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:07,792
You mean, not to me.

951
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:15,315
I'm not in there singing, am I?

952
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:29,036
Something is happening.

953
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,756
I bailed you out, what...

954
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,798
...48 hours ago? I made you a sandwich.

955
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:41,195
I drove all the way to...
I don't even know where this place is.

956
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:43,952
Then why are you here?

957
01:32:50,919 --> 01:32:52,989
You want to change the world, Bobby?

958
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:55,993
Change mine.

959
01:33:02,519 --> 01:33:03,952
How can I?

960
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,038
What about my world?

961
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:30,672
<i>If I go with you...</i>

962
01:33:32,519 --> 01:33:34,396
<i>... what will happen to mine?</i>

963
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:06,591
It's gonna be okay, Bobby.

964
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:47,958
What are they bomb. Ing?
There's nothing to bomb!

965
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,073
I'm not doing this. This is somebody else.

966
01:34:57,639 --> 01:34:59,118
You got a cigarette?

967
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:02,718
I came 200 miles after you
without a cigarette.

968
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,070
I've never heard it this quiet.

969
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:16,467
What's th. Is?

970
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,637
I don't know. Nothing.

971
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,108
A scar.

972
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,235
- No, it isn't. Tell me.
- Why?

973
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:27,917
Because you don't want to.

974
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:31,748
- It's a diamond.
- What?

975
01:37:33,599 --> 01:37:35,396
- I swallowed it.
- Please.

976
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:38,314
Tell me.

977
01:37:42,919 --> 01:37:45,308
I knew this old hustler when I was a kid.

978
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,434
You know, a mechanic.

979
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:52,392
A crooked player.

980
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,671
He showed me how he had this diamond
sewed into his arm by a doctor.

981
01:37:57,759 --> 01:38:01,877
So when I was in Yokohama, I bought
a diamond and had a Jap doctor do it.

982
01:38:09,519 --> 01:38:11,032
See the idea was...

983
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,993
...that no matter how bad things got,
no matter what they did to you...

984
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:17,798
...no matter what...

985
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:21,555
...you still have this last chance.

986
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:25,115
You'd always have this diamond.

987
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:29,997
You still feel that way?

988
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:32,673
I was in my twenties.

989
01:38:38,839 --> 01:38:39,828
I do.

990
01:38:42,279 --> 01:38:43,917
Tell me about the boat.

991
01:38:44,799 --> 01:38:45,948
Our boat?

992
01:38:46,999 --> 01:38:48,068
What?

993
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,038
You know about boats?

994
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:55,677
Do I know about boats?

995
01:38:56,879 --> 01:38:58,631
Where do you want to go, pal?

996
01:38:59,079 --> 01:39:00,831
You want to go to California?

997
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:04,952
Are you going with me?

998
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,308
Sure, I am.

999
01:39:11,519 --> 01:39:14,238
I haven't been there in a while.
Any place else?

1000
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:17,354
Anywhere?

1001
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:20,237
Anywhere in the world.

1002
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:17,271
- Where you been?
- Out of town.

1003
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:19,634
- Tell me about the game.
- It's tonight.

1004
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:27,277
- What t. Ime?
- You got a schedule problem?

1005
01:40:27,519 --> 01:40:30,591
- What's go. Ing on?
- What are you talk. Ing about? Noth. Ing.

1006
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:33,957
Is this about a broad? About that broad?

1007
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:36,509
It's about a card game. What t. Ime, Joe?

1008
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:41,391
They want to start early. 6:30, same suite.

1009
01:40:41,759 --> 01:40:43,158
You feeling lucky?

1010
01:41:10,559 --> 01:41:12,436
It's com. Ing. In from the Keys.

1011
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:15,477
I can have it hosed down and refueled
by midnight.

1012
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:18,757
- Midnight?
- Yes.

1013
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,909
They start blowing horns, kissing,
nobody notices one little boat.

1014
01:41:22,999 --> 01:41:25,513
- Listen, the lady's traveling alone.
- Yes?

1015
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:28,310
Can you get her set up okay?

1016
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:31,395
Say, the Edgewater? Nice room?

1017
01:41:31,799 --> 01:41:33,517
It's high season in Miami.

1018
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:37,117
But I know a guy who can clear up a room
for me.

1019
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:41,348
Just for the night. I'll try to get out
of here sometime tomorrow.

1020
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:43,749
No later than midnight for the lady.

1021
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,672
After that, who knows?

1022
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:48,274
Boats get impounded, funny things happen.

1023
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:07,348
- He wants her out of the country.
- What?

1024
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:11,630
Do you understand me?
He wants her out of Havana. Now!

1025
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,030
- Who?
- Arturo.

1026
01:42:14,959 --> 01:42:16,028
Do it!

1027
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:38,151
- What happened?
- It's okay.

1028
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,912
You've no idea how fried people can get
over one boat.

1029
01:42:40,999 --> 01:42:43,149
- What happened?
- Honest to God!

1030
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,597
Everybody's trying to get out.
I don't know what's going on.

1031
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,671
- Do you have some antiseptic?
- Soap's fine.

1032
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,635
I tried to buck the line.

1033
01:42:53,719 --> 01:42:55,869
Boy! Some people have a short fuse.

1034
01:42:57,159 --> 01:42:59,229
And these were women and children.

1035
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:01,837
It was really over a boat?

1036
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:04,235
Yeah, a 72-footer.

1037
01:43:04,839 --> 01:43:07,034
Hell, it's worth a couple of punches.

1038
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,347
It's arranged?

1039
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:12,273
About midnight.

1040
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:15,032
- My things are at the house.
- You can't go there.

1041
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,268
I know.

1042
01:43:19,879 --> 01:43:22,677
I gotta get the guy with the boats paid off.

1043
01:43:27,919 --> 01:43:30,114
There's a fr. Lend of m. Ine, Joe Volp. I...

1044
01:43:30,199 --> 01:43:32,872
...he's holding some dough for me
at the Lido.

1045
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:37,109
Now, it's gonna take a while.
Are you gonna be all right here?

1046
01:43:41,559 --> 01:43:43,038
You're good at this.

1047
01:43:44,599 --> 01:43:46,157
I like doing it.

1048
01:43:47,079 --> 01:43:49,468
Maybe you should go with a prizefighter.

1049
01:43:50,919 --> 01:43:52,068
No. You.

1050
01:43:57,599 --> 01:43:58,793
Are you sure?

1051
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:01,353
Do you mean...

1052
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:03,598
...do I miss Arturo?

1053
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:08,307
Of course I do.

1054
01:44:08,999 --> 01:44:10,432
You shared a lot.

1055
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,393
Revolution.

1056
01:44:13,479 --> 01:44:15,868
No. He just made me feel...

1057
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:23,673
I wanted to be simpler
when I was with him.

1058
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:27,918
More honest. Myself.

1059
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,351
How many times have you lost everything?
Lots of times, yes?

1060
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:41,829
Maybe it's possible to come back
from that.

1061
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:45,277
There are so many ways to be happy,
and I...

1062
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:50,032
I feel that with you sometimes.
But sometimes...

1063
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:52,108
...I feel...

1064
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,517
...terrible about the thought of being
happy with you, because if it weren't...

1065
01:44:58,399 --> 01:44:59,468
Don't.

1066
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:01,113
Don't say it.

1067
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:12,312
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Remember the phone.

1068
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:14,788
One ring, and if it rings again...

1069
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:16,878
...it's you.

1070
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:37,788
So long.

1071
01:45:38,439 --> 01:45:40,270
You say someth. Ing, Mr. We. II?

1072
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:02,474
Marion.

1073
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:05,472
What'll you have?

1074
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:09,037
- How's the book coming?
- Good. Quite well.

1075
01:46:09,919 --> 01:46:11,238
What happened to you?

1076
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:14,868
Aren't gamblers pacifists?
Like musicians, afraid to hurt their hands?

1077
01:46:14,959 --> 01:46:17,029
You here collecting recipes?

1078
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:18,916
No. I'm off duty.

1079
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,150
I thought you guys didn't sleep?

1080
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,672
Not cookbook writers.

1081
01:46:27,559 --> 01:46:28,912
You guys.

1082
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:32,358
What's th. Is about?

1083
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,397
Is Arturo Duran alive?

1084
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:41,712
- Arturo Duran. Why would I...
- Where. Is he?

1085
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:43,512
Who has h. Im?

1086
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:48,316
- You're in a funny mood, Jack.
- Yes, I am.

1087
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:53,117
I'll tell you how funny.

1088
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:58,147
I'm going to stand up in this bar,
and I'm going to make an announcement.

1089
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:02,118
<i>I'm going to announce how a fake fairy
from Gourmet Magazine is a spook.</i>

1090
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:03,518
You are, aren't you?

1091
01:47:04,559 --> 01:47:05,912
Quiet down, Jack.

1092
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:08,273
I'll break your face.

1093
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:10,873
No, you won't.
Not in front of these people.

1094
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:13,873
That's what you are, isn't it?
Some kind of spy?

1095
01:47:14,439 --> 01:47:17,317
Menocal works for SIM and for you,
doesn't he?

1096
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:21,111
The OSS, the CIA
whatever it is you call yourselves now.

1097
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:23,711
Don't do anything stupid.

1098
01:47:24,799 --> 01:47:27,836
I think I will. Everybody!
I want to tell you something!

1099
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:29,274
What?

1100
01:47:30,999 --> 01:47:32,193
Talk to me.

1101
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:37,433
Smart.

1102
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,432
Here's what I want.

1103
01:47:57,599 --> 01:48:00,830
I'm Jack We. II. I got some. Informat. Ion
for Colonel Menocal.

1104
01:48:05,759 --> 01:48:07,909
Holiday traffic, Mr. Forbes.

1105
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:12,758
Something to report?

1106
01:48:14,759 --> 01:48:16,158
Nothing to report.

1107
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:19,678
Why do you come?

1108
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,877
I work for some people.

1109
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:26,793
- What people.
- You've done business with us.

1110
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:29,718
I see.

1111
01:48:30,679 --> 01:48:31,748
A joke.

1112
01:48:32,199 --> 01:48:33,314
Not at all.

1113
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,715
They want Arturo Duran alive.

1114
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:39,148
Well.

1115
01:48:39,919 --> 01:48:40,954
C.O.D.

1116
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:46,074
He's dead.

1117
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:49,236
Now let's not fuck around.

1118
01:48:49,599 --> 01:48:52,909
They're not interested in details.
They want what they want.

1119
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:03,267
Do they know...

1120
01:49:03,799 --> 01:49:06,267
...that Mrs. Duran is in your apartment...

1121
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:07,947
...right now?

1122
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:13,037
Sure. They sent me to Santa Clara
to bring her back.

1123
01:49:30,359 --> 01:49:32,031
Doesn't do her justice.

1124
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:34,598
Either of you.

1125
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:48,515
It was a good idea,
but finally it didn't work. He spit on it.

1126
01:49:49,719 --> 01:49:51,357
See, there? Spit.

1127
01:49:52,799 --> 01:49:54,551
Let's save some time, okay?

1128
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,789
Marion Chigwell's laid it all out.

1129
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:02,070
- I can call him.
- Call him.

1130
01:50:04,919 --> 01:50:06,272
Remember W. Ilson?

1131
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:10,237
W. Ilson's prepared to offer you asylum.
Here it is.

1132
01:50:18,519 --> 01:50:20,475
What the fuck. Is go. Ing on here?

1133
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:23,552
You people pay me to keep
the Communists under control...

1134
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:27,154
...and now you say,
"Let th. Is one go. We need h. Im."

1135
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:29,037
You need him for what?

1136
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:32,793
You're crazy.

1137
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:35,678
You're like, I don't know,
like pregnant women.

1138
01:50:36,359 --> 01:50:39,749
- You have a whim...
- I just do what they tell me. Come on!

1139
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:43,117
And what happens to me?

1140
01:50:43,239 --> 01:50:47,073
I'm your trash collector, but when I go
to the embassy I'm treated like shit!

1141
01:50:47,159 --> 01:50:51,550
Asylum. V. Irg. In. La. And. It's beaut. Lful.
Now, where is he?

1142
01:50:56,999 --> 01:51:00,833
- And I live on what?
- $25,000 and a job.

1143
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:04,037
Another joke?

1144
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:20,475
Okay, $50,000. All cash.

1145
01:51:20,879 --> 01:51:23,347
I'll need a few hours to get the authority.

1146
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:27,637
- Where. Is he?
- I haven't said yes or no.

1147
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:30,517
- How do I know you can deliver?
- I'll show you photographs.

1148
01:51:30,599 --> 01:51:32,351
Touch. Feel. Talk to.

1149
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:38,715
They're going to make him part
of the new government, aren't they?

1150
01:51:40,039 --> 01:51:41,472
Christ, you're fools.

1151
01:51:41,559 --> 01:51:43,948
They just want to talk to him.
Where. Is he?

1152
01:51:44,599 --> 01:51:47,033
You won't get a fucking thing out of him.

1153
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:48,592
<i>He's a real Cubano.</i>

1154
01:51:48,879 --> 01:51:51,677
- Yeah? Then what do you want him for?
- Insurance.

1155
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,030
In case it goes the other way.

1156
01:52:45,799 --> 01:52:48,154
You son of a bitch.

1157
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:51,797
What are you do. Ing here?

1158
01:52:51,879 --> 01:52:53,790
No, it's all right.

1159
01:52:54,039 --> 01:52:57,031
- Where. Is she?
- She's all right. Listen.

1160
01:52:59,879 --> 01:53:01,949
I'm going to get you out of here.

1161
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:06,670
- He thinks I'm with the CIA.
- He's been swindling the CIA for years!

1162
01:53:07,519 --> 01:53:09,987
Why the hell
do you have to be so ignorant?

1163
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:12,988
- Where. Is she? R. Ight now?
- She's safe.

1164
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,110
- We're do. Ing th. Is ton. Ight.
- You can't!

1165
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:18,987
- Yes, I can. Just do what I tell you.
- Why aren't you play. Ing cards?

1166
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,030
- We don't have t. Ime for th. Is.
- Why?

1167
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:23,633
Once I asked you for help, and you said no!

1168
01:53:24,759 --> 01:53:26,158
I changed my mind.

1169
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:27,508
Bullshit!

1170
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,316
Are you gonna make it?
Or am I just wasting my time?

1171
01:53:37,999 --> 01:53:39,318
Come on.

1172
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,269
What are you gett. Ing out of th. Is?

1173
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:45,308
Nothing.

1174
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:48,838
You're a liar.

1175
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:56,356
She's beautiful, isn't she?

1176
01:53:59,879 --> 01:54:01,107
More than that.

1177
01:54:05,559 --> 01:54:07,834
I want to thank you for seducing my wife.

1178
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:10,398
I mean it.

1179
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:13,037
The anger kept me going.

1180
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:18,787
It was like strong, cold coffee.

1181
01:54:20,559 --> 01:54:22,470
Sometimes when it was bad...

1182
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:26,915
...the only way to keep my mind together...

1183
01:54:28,039 --> 01:54:30,951
...was to concentrate
on ways of killing you.

1184
01:54:42,919 --> 01:54:44,557
She's a hell of a lady.

1185
01:54:47,959 --> 01:54:49,597
Does she know I'm alive?

1186
01:54:50,359 --> 01:54:51,838
She buried you, man.

1187
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:12,268
Deal.

1188
01:55:12,999 --> 01:55:14,478
Better make it fast.

1189
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,791
It's like meat going bad.

1190
01:55:17,919 --> 01:55:18,795
He won't keep.

1191
01:55:18,879 --> 01:55:22,667
Have him at his house, cleaned up, 11:00.
The money will be there.

1192
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:07,072
You want buy a young girl?
Some enchanted evening?

1193
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,035
What happened? I was so worr. Led.
The telephone kept ringing.

1194
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:46,708
- We have a boat?
- Everything's all right.

1195
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:50,191
I washed this blouse and dried it
in the oven.

1196
01:56:50,439 --> 01:56:53,988
Well, almost dry.
You don't have an iron. It's so wrinkled.

1197
01:56:55,319 --> 01:56:57,879
You look fine. No, I don't have an iron.

1198
01:56:58,959 --> 01:57:00,153
I never had an iron.

1199
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:02,628
I can get some new things in Miami.

1200
01:57:04,119 --> 01:57:05,393
Are we going?

1201
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:08,316
There's one more thing to do.

1202
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:11,117
- Then do it.
- I will.

1203
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:16,395
- Is a 72-footer a big boat?
- Yes, it's pretty big.

1204
01:57:16,759 --> 01:57:19,796
- We'll take. It to M. Lam. I and then where?
- Bobby...

1205
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:22,712
It doesn't matter.
Maybe from Miami we can take a train.

1206
01:57:22,799 --> 01:57:25,871
A long trip and not worry
about where we get off.

1207
01:57:25,999 --> 01:57:27,193
Listen, kiddo.

1208
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:30,472
- People don't say that anymore.
- Listen to me, will you?

1209
01:57:30,559 --> 01:57:31,992
It's from the '20s.

1210
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,877
If I had never met you...

1211
01:57:42,279 --> 01:57:44,156
...I'd have lived my life...

1212
01:57:48,559 --> 01:57:49,674
He's alive.

1213
01:57:54,999 --> 01:57:56,398
Arturo's alive.

1214
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,112
He's at your house.

1215
01:58:02,679 --> 01:58:05,068
And he's okay, and he's waiting for you.

1216
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:18,992
Oh, God.

1217
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:40,230
There's nothing to say, Bobby.

1218
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:23,593
For a moment...

1219
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:29,191
...for one moment...

1220
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:31,832
...I was lost...

1221
01:59:33,959 --> 01:59:35,790
...in a sweet place.

1222
01:59:40,519 --> 01:59:41,713
But lost.

1223
01:59:54,119 --> 01:59:54,995
Wa. It.

1224
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:01,917
Let me take you there.

1225
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:09,354
Nowhere.

1226
02:01:04,759 --> 02:01:06,829
Batista's left the country! Come on!

1227
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:11,072
Come on! Let's go!

1228
02:01:48,559 --> 02:01:49,753
It's all over.

1229
02:02:30,119 --> 02:02:31,268
That's my car!

1230
02:04:25,919 --> 02:04:27,671
You stood up a lot of guys.

1231
02:04:31,879 --> 02:04:35,189
They're upstairs playing right now.
It's not too late.

1232
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:37,592
Yes, it is.

1233
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:43,592
It's 1959, Joe.

1234
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:54,392
Where's the lady?

1235
02:04:56,599 --> 02:04:58,237
She's with her husband.

1236
02:04:59,519 --> 02:05:00,872
Nobility.

1237
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:04,155
I always said you were a noble guy.

1238
02:05:08,439 --> 02:05:10,999
We're noth. Ing but cocks
leading our brains around...

1239
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:13,309
...just like the nuns told us, right?

1240
02:05:17,239 --> 02:05:18,433
Who's ahead?

1241
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:44,427
Looks like fun.

1242
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:50,598
Time to leave, Jack.

1243
02:06:27,399 --> 02:06:28,912
Anejo and coffee.

1244
02:06:50,039 --> 02:06:51,392
Things go well?

1245
02:06:53,759 --> 02:06:54,908
Great.

1246
02:06:55,479 --> 02:06:57,674
How about you? You win or lose?

1247
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:01,269
It's never over, so we never lose.

1248
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:04,837
Then you never win either.

1249
02:07:05,479 --> 02:07:08,391
<i>All passengers prepare to board.</i>

1250
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:11,233
<i>Please stand by your cars.</i>

1251
02:07:11,679 --> 02:07:14,512
<i>- Have passports ready.
- Menocal's looking for you.</i>

1252
02:07:15,239 --> 02:07:17,070
He's probably at the embassy.

1253
02:07:18,679 --> 02:07:20,351
He's been there and gone.

1254
02:07:22,159 --> 02:07:23,274
Last night.

1255
02:07:26,359 --> 02:07:27,758
Gone? Where?

1256
02:07:28,999 --> 02:07:30,637
Probably V. Irg. In. La.

1257
02:07:37,159 --> 02:07:40,231
And I'm off to the Far East,
writing a new book:

1258
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:42,916
<i>The Cuisine of Indochina.</i>

1259
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:45,992
Indochina.

1260
02:07:46,919 --> 02:07:50,514
Where's Indoch. Ina?
I mean, I know, but I don't know.

1261
02:07:51,759 --> 02:07:53,511
It's a long way away, Jack.

1262
02:07:54,879 --> 02:07:56,073
I'll see you.

1263
02:08:32,759 --> 02:08:33,874
Pick a card.

1264
02:08:37,159 --> 02:08:38,797
You're not celebrating.

1265
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:41,112
It wasn't my fight.

1266
02:08:43,039 --> 02:08:44,233
How is he?

1267
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:47,513
He's wonderful.

1268
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:50,392
He's with them.

1269
02:08:52,759 --> 02:08:53,987
You too?

1270
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:59,670
But I thought you might be here.

1271
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:01,753
It's funny.

1272
02:09:02,439 --> 02:09:05,192
I didn't know I was leaving
until 20 minutes ago.

1273
02:09:17,319 --> 02:09:18,957
Were you wa. It. Ing for me?

1274
02:09:21,919 --> 02:09:23,147
All my life.

1275
02:09:26,279 --> 02:09:29,715
<i>All passengers should prepare to board.</i>

1276
02:09:29,999 --> 02:09:32,274
<i>Please stand by your cars.</i>

1277
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:37,392
That old trick.

1278
02:09:39,559 --> 02:09:42,073
The other one was a quarter. This is a half.

1279
02:09:44,439 --> 02:09:46,157
Where are you go. Ing, We. II?

1280
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:50,067
Don't know. California, maybe.

1281
02:09:55,159 --> 02:09:57,434
How did you get Menocal to let him go?

1282
02:09:58,999 --> 02:10:00,034
I lied...

1283
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:02,317
...about a few things.

1284
02:10:29,799 --> 02:10:32,393
You don't quite believe
what you know, do you?

1285
02:10:35,639 --> 02:10:36,708
I do.

1286
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:39,911
I know I love you, Bobby.

1287
02:10:44,999 --> 02:10:48,787
And I know a butterfly can flutter its wings
over a flower in China...

1288
02:10:49,359 --> 02:10:51,589
...and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.

1289
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:52,873
I believe it.

1290
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:58,669
They can even calculate the odds.

1291
02:11:01,479 --> 02:11:03,037
It just isn't likely.

1292
02:11:06,599 --> 02:11:08,510
And it takes so long.

1293
02:11:12,159 --> 02:11:14,627
<i>All passengers and all autos...</i>

1294
02:11:14,879 --> 02:11:16,949
<i>... should be boarding immediately.</i>

1295
02:11:17,559 --> 02:11:20,027
<i>Have your passports ready.</i>

1296
02:11:22,959 --> 02:11:24,677
You know where to find me.

1297
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:27,951
Walk. Into any cas. Ino...

1298
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:33,038
...and ask any high-stakes poker player...

1299
02:11:40,439 --> 02:11:42,430
..."Where. Is Jack We. II?"

1300
02:11:44,919 --> 02:11:46,034
Right.

1301
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:14,952
So long, pal.

1302
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:15,719
<i>I do this sometimes.
Drive down from Miami.</i>

1303
02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:22,469
<i>It isn't that I expect her.
The ferry doesn't run anymore.</i>

1304
02:13:24,879 --> 02:13:26,551
<i>But it happens sometimes.</i>

1305
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,030
<i>I see a boat offshore and...</i>

1306
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:31,315
<i>... something goes faster in me.</i>

1307
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:33,233
<i>Hope, I guess.</i>

1308
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:38,396
<i>What the hell. Fidel Castro
was on the Jack Paar Show.</i>

1309
02:13:38,759 --> 02:13:40,397
<i>So anything can happen.</i>

1310
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:45,115
<i>I even read the newspapers now.</i>

1311
02:13:46,679 --> 02:13:50,149
<i>Not just looking for point spread,
the odds or the morning line.</i>

1312
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:53,755
<i>Human interest, that's what I read.</i>

1313
02:13:55,799 --> 02:13:59,633
<i>A dozen lines about what happened
on a street corner in Indianapolis...</i>

1314
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:05,751
<i>... or identical twins meet after 30 years,
smoke the same brand of cigarettes...</i>

1315
02:14:05,919 --> 02:14:08,513
<i>... and both married
to somebody named Shirley.</i>

1316
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:10,668
<i>Like that.</i>

1317
02:14:12,439 --> 02:14:14,157
<i>Somebody came out of Havana...</i>

1318
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:16,833
<i>... told me Baby Hernandez
was the big winner that night.</i>

1319
02:14:16,919 --> 02:14:18,398
<i>Lives in Jersey now.</i>

1320
02:14:19,239 --> 02:14:21,514
<i>And I got a postcard from Joe Volpi...</i>

1321
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:23,877
<i>... postmarked Santo Domingo.</i>

1322
02:14:23,959 --> 02:14:27,031
<i>So I guess he's still doing it,
running things for Meyer.</i>

1323
02:14:28,999 --> 02:14:31,593
<i>It's a new decade. Things are different.</i>

1324
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:34,948
<i>We got our own kind of revolution going.</i>

1325
02:14:37,399 --> 02:14:39,117
<i>I'm doing okay these days.</i>

1326
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:41,233
<i>I'm way ahead.</i>

1327
02:14:42,759 --> 02:14:44,477
<i>But it's not the same.</i>

1328
02:14:47,639 --> 02:14:50,597
<i>I sit with my back to the wall,
watch the entrance.</i>

1329
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:54,515
<i>You never know who's gonna walk in.</i>

1330
02:14:55,879 --> 02:14:57,756
<i>Somebody blown off course.</i>

1331
02:14:59,999 --> 02:15:01,717
<i>This is hurricane country.</i>

1332
02:15:01,718 --> 02:15:02,718
