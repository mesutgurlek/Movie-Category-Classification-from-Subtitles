The young man
said his name was Rig.

96
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:37,265
He gave us some good advice
on our work

97
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,568
and stayed at our house.

98
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,970
After three days, he left...

99
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,507
And then nine months later,
she gave birth to a son.

100
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,642
(Crowd laughs, baby cries)

101

Whose child is it?

102
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,185
(Tearful)
I do not know, my lady.

103
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,522
We were all in the same bed.

104
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,557
I was too scared-you see?

105
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:05,127
She is not an honest woman.

106
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,028
She had sex with Rig,

107
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:10,265
and could not bring herself
to tell me the truth!

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,538
Do you know who this Rig was?

109
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,441
No. He was just a young man.

110
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,610
On the contrary.

111
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,746
We know from
our ancient stories

112
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,349
that Rig is another name
for Heimdal.

113
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,319
The God Heimdal?

114

115
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:35,357
Yes, the God Heimdal!

116
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,225
You are fortunate

117
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,127
that he chose your household
to appear in.

118
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,362
That's just a story!

119
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,497
Our whole lives
are just stories.

120
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:45,567
You should be ashamed
you did not trust your wife,

121
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,637
<i>despite the joy and comfort</i>
<i>she has brought you,</i>

122
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:51,039
<i>and the fact that a God</i>
<i>chose you</i>

123
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,941
of all people to visit.

124
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,280
Do not punish her,
but rejoice with her.

125
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,683
Drink wine with her.

126
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,385
And sacrifice
one of your animals

127
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:05,787
to Heimdal the God.

128
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,958
But if I hear
you have harmed this woman,

129
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,028
or this child,

130
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,397
you will answer for it to me!

136

I had not expected that.

137
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:50,298
My lord, why don't we attack?

138
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,301
They have a strong position.

139
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,303
Perhaps if we can make them
leave their position

140
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:56,605
and attack us.

141

<i>Saxon warrior 1: How can
we force them to do that?</i>

142

They're scavengers,
little more than beasts.

143
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,245
We must be able
to out-think them.

144

<i>Saxon warrior 2</i>
<i>if we leave it much longer,</i>

145
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,314
they'll be even better dug-in.

146
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,683
My lord, if a wolf comes
into your sheep fold,

147
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,218
you don't try to out-think it.

148
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:11,786
You go in and drive it away,

149
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:14,489
- or kill it!
- How dare you argue with me?!

150
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,224
Saxon warrior 2: Lord Aethelwulf,
forgive us. We only meant...

151
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,260
lord Aethelwulf:
I know what you meant.

152
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,829
You meant that you're already
greater warriors than I am...

153
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,464
although only yesterday
you were still green

154
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,266
sucking on
your mother's breasts.

155
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,768
Go do your jobs. Set up camp.

156
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,377

158
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,382
Ragnar: Yes, I can see them.

159
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:44,519
What're we waiting for?

160
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,888
To see what they'll do.

161
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:51,693
So you want to hand them
the initiative.

162
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,595
We can't afford
to lose half our men

163

I'm lord Aethelwulf,

Hmm.

205
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:15,487

Ragnar:
What ails you my friend?

214
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,982
The gods won't lift my curse.

215
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,019
I am fated to live forever

Ragnar: This?

219
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,033
This is the king's brother.

220
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,603
What do you say?

221
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,072
Shall we go visit the king?

222

<i>King Aelle: God help us!</i>

223

My brother defeated. Dead.

God help Northumbria.

225
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,282
Lord Edgar: Sire, we do not
know if your brother is dead.

King Aelle: But we do know, my
lord, that he was defeated!

227
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:24,723
Who are these barbarians,
these savages?

228
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:27,826
Why have they come
to torment us?

229
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,429
Bishop Unwan:
Sire, some learned and wise men

230
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,532
say that these northmen
have been sent here by God

231
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,234
to punish our people

232
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:38,570
for their many sins
and transgressions.

233
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:41,106
That we have departed from
the path of righteousness

234
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:42,741
that our lord set out,

235
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,312
so now he is holding us
to terrible account.

236
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,414
(Nobles mutter in agreement)

237
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,050
Noble 3: Forgive me, sire,

238
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,686
but what if God has not
sent these northmen here

239
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,488
to plague us?

240
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,257
Then who has, pray?

241
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,792
Could it not, sire,

242
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,627
rather be the work
of the devil?

243
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,162
(Nobles mutter in agreement)

244
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,765
<i>King Aelle: Go on then, my lord.
What is your advice?</i>

245
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,767
<i>Noble 3</i>
<i>my advice, sire, is that,</i>

246
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,003
as we are facing
the forces of Satan,

247
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,539
we must resist them
at all costs.

248
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,375
Even at the cost of...
Of all our lives,

249
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,444
if necessary.

250
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,280
<i>For evil cannot be accommodated</i>

251
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,716
nor yet ever bargained with.

252
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,352
Several nobles:
Aye! (Murmuring)

253
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,289
<i>Noble 4:</i>
<i>Sire, if I might speak?</i>

254
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:32,758
<i>I-I put it to you</i>

255
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,194
that it might be that
these pagans have come here

256
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,962
by their own account,

257
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,231
and that they are neither
of God

258
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,100
nor the devil.

259
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:42,901
They are just savage men

260
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,170
more interested in robbery
and plunder

261
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,239
than in matters of the spirit.

262
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,375
King Aelle: Then what is your advice?
(Nobles yelling)

263
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,111
Noble 4: Sire, since
they have come for gain,

264
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:54,713
then let us offer them
enough money,

265
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,949
or whatever else they desire,

266
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,718
to go away
and leave us in peace!

267
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,186
(Nobles yell and shout)

268
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,156
Noble 2: Shame! Shame on you!
Shame on you!

269
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,058
<i>Noble 5: He is right!</i>

270
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,060
Why waste more blood?

271
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:10,629
Let's pay them off!

272
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,064
(Nobles yell and shout,
divided)

273
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,133
<i>King Aelle: My lords,</i>

274
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,403
let me think on it,
just a little while.

275
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:20,606
In the meantime,
let it be known

276
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:23,542
I have sent envoys out
to raise more men to arms,

277
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:26,478
for our use if need be.

278
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,915
Nobles: (Muttering quietly)
Long live the king!

279
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:33,519
(Hall buzzes with chatter)

280
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,760
<i>King Aelle: (Sotto

Fight against those

283
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:53,539
Draw the spear and javelin

Say to my soul,

294
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,535
Lord Eadric: Greetings.

295
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,103
King Aelle invites your leader

296
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:01,139
to meet him in his villa
to talk.

297

Who is your leader?

(Silence)

299
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,184
The king did not know that
his brother was still alive.

<i>He would like to talk to you</i>

Do you accept

Rollo: We should attack,
while they are weak.

307
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:56,595
How long will it take them
to raise another army?

308

I want to talk to the king.

<i>Rollo:</i>
<i>What is there to talk about?</i>

in his household?

314

<i>I want them.</i>

315
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:14,813
I want to see how he lives...

316
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:17,816
What manner of men they are,

<i>If we agree</i>

Ragnar: You forget, we
hold his brother hostage.

322
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,865
Why should he care

Ragnar: When we receive payment,
you shall have your brother.

409
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:28,421
You must give me time
to collect such a vast amount.

410
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:33,760
<i>And in the meantime,</i>

411
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:36,963
you and your men must remain
in your camp

412
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,666
and make no further attacks
on my people

Agreed.

trust the word of a pagan?

Bishop Unwan: Let me
baptize one of them.

417

There is one further condition.

418
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,053
I desire that either you,
or one of your companions,

419
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,489
agrees to be baptized
into our faith.

420
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,657
And that way,

421
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:07,727
I can make peace with a friend
and fellow Christian...

422
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:09,596
And not an enemy.

423

us to become Christian?

Yes.

I hope you can find it
in your heart

434
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,790
to speak to the wife
of the late Earl.

435
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,792
Of course. Hello, Siggy.

436
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,560
Please sit down and join us.

437

Bjorn wait!

438
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,198
Earl Haraldson tried

(Sighs heavily) I know.

440

And if he had succeeded,

441
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:28,274
I would be standing
where Siggy's standing now.

442
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,879
So what would you like me
to say to her?

443
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,919
I would ask her to sit down.

444
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,823
Siggy: Thank you.

445

What can I do for you?

446

Siggy: It is what
I can do for you.

447

I want to serve you.

448
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,845
That is not necessary.

449
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:13,152
I remember very well

451

<i>In fact, I found in service</i>
<i>a great freedom and honor.</i>

453
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:24,731
