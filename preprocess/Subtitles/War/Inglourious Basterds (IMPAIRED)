00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,627
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

6
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,381
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.

7
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
Are you aware
of my existence?

Yes.

00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,720
This is good.

10
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:57,007
Now, are you aware of the job
I've been ordered to carry out in France?

11
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,770
Yes.

12
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,439
Please tell me
what you've heard.

13
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,733
I've heard

14
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,572
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

15
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,575
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

16
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,912
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

17
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,501
But the meaning
of your visit,

18
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,173
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

19
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,094
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

20
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,846
and found nothing.

21
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,266
I'm aware of that.

22
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
I've read the reports
of this area.

23
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,482
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

24
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,652
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

25
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:54,575
most of it being a complete waste of time,
but needs to be done nevertheless.

26
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,621
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

27
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,374
If you can assist me
with answers,

28
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,586
my department can close
the file on your family.

29
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,221
Now,

30
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,143
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

31
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,063
all dairy farmers
like yourself.

32
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,486
Doleracs, Rollins,
the Loveitts

33
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,989
and the Dreyfuses.

34
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,699
Is that correct?

35
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,784
To my knowledge,

36
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,329
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

37
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,333
Herr Colonel, would it disturb
you if I smoked my pipe?

38
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,876
(CHUCKLES) Please,
monsieur LaPadite,

39
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,963
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

40
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,258
Now, according
to these papers,

41
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,595
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

42
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,515
except the Dreyfuses.

43
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,395
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

44
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,773
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

45
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,776
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

46
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,614
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

47
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,657
Only rumors.

48
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,033
I love rumors!

49
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
Facts could be
so misleading,

50
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,206
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

51

Again,
this is just a rumor,

00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:41,765
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.

90
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,015
(THANKING
IN FRENCH)

91
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,434
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter."

92
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,060
Precisely.

93
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,024
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

94
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,401
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

95
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,154
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

96
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,491
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

97
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,911
It would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

98
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,247
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

99
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,750
precisely because
I've earned it.

100
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,214
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

101
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,008
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

102
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,093
I can think like a Jew

103
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,472
where they can only
think like a German.

104
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,266
(CHUCKLING) More precisely,
a German soldier.

105
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,903
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

106
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,990
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

107
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,286
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

108
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,497
it would be
that of the rat.

109
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,128
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

110
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,215
But where our conclusions
differ,

111
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,301
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

112
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,641
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

113
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,769
It's a hostile world,
indeed.

114
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,982
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

115
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,484
would you greet it
with hostility?

116
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,320
I suppose I would.

117
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,947
Has a rat ever done
anything to you

118
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,325
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

119
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,870
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.

120
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,208
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

121
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,919
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

122
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,463
a squirrel could
equally carry.

123
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,132
Would you agree?

124
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,925
(AGREES IN FRENCH)

125
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,595
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

126
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,680
that you do with rats,
do you?

127
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,764
No.

128
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,350
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

129
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,438
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

130
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,691
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

131
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,444
However interesting
as the thought may be,

132
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,780
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

133
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,203
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

134
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,167
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

135
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,710
Probably not.

136
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,087
I didn't think so.

137
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,256
You don't like them.

138
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,216
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

139
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,053
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

140
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,308
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

141
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,935
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

142
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,438
Where does the hawk look?

143
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,691
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

144
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,235
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

145
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,366
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

146
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,288
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

147
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,793
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

148
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,381
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

149
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,508
once they abandon dignity.

150
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,428
May I smoke my pipe
as well?

151
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,642
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

152
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:16,451
Now, my job dictates

153
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,459
that I must have my men
enter your home

154
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,257
and conduct
a thorough search

155
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,136
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

156
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,765
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.

157
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,059
That is unless you have
something to tell me

158
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,187
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

159
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,523
I might add, also,
that any information

- Yes.

Whiskey. Straight.

Well, sir,
such as they are,

509
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:24,503
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

510
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,006
and I've had
two books published.

511
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,926
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

512
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,011
The first book
was called

513
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:36,599
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

514
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:40,519
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

515
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:45,941
It's a subtextual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

Yes.

521
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,459
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

522
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:09,548
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

523
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,884
but I'm familiar with it.

524
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,010
Explain it to me.

525
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,720
Pardon, sir?

526
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:19,058
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

527
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:24,313
under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.

528
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,859
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

529
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,196
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

530
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,323
An alternative
to what he considers

531
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,368
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

532
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,746
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

533
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,414
How's he doing?

534
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,542
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

535
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,589
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

536
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,593
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

537
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,680
how's he doing?

538
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,014
Quite well, actually.

539
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,266
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

540
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:05,771
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

541
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,316
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

542
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:13,195
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

543
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:18,992
Brief him.

544
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:24,373
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

545
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,083
Three days from now

546
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,504
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

547
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,714
What film, sir?

548
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,466
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

549
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,804
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

550
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,308
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

551
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:47,146
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

552
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,649
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

553
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,818
The master race at play?

554
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,072
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

555
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,700
The objective
of Operation Kino,

556
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,369
blow up the basket.

557
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:07,249
And like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

558
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,835
Jolly good, sir.

559
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:14,089
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

560
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,716
will be your assist.

561
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,678
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

562
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,432
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.

563
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,435
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

564
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,522
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.

565
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:35,319
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

566
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,488
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.

567
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,324
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

568
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,244
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

569
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,498
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

570
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,708
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

571
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:53,545
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

572
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,049
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

573
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,051
How will I know her?

574
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,387
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

575
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,391
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.

576
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,935
Bridget von Hammersmark?

577
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:12,189
(CHUCKLING) The German movie
star is working for England?

578
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,858
Yes, for the last
two years now.

579
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:18,487
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.

580
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,738
Indeed.

581
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:20,864

583
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,333
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

584
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,751
I didn't know.

585
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,253
You said it was
in a tavern.

586
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,504
It is a tavern.

587
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,964
Yeah, in a basement.

588
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,509
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

589
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,887
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

590
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,848
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

591
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,182
We wait.

592
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:52,104
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

That's right, sir.

I hear you're pretty good
with that.

596
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,764
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

597
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,560
Simply making contact with
our agent. Should be uneventful.

598
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:38,275
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

599
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,404
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

600
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,535
I don't look calm to you?

like that, I guess you do.

exactly the loquacious type, is he?

604
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,861
Is that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?

605
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,157
Fair point, Lieutenant.

606
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,204
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

607
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,498
Make bets
on how it all comes out?

608
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,877
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

609
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,298
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

610
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:47,552
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

Isn't that just dandy?

615

Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.

616

You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

617
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,245
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

618
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,123
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.
