they're going to sit down under us when this war is over?

Because it has guns.
Because it has discipline.

In effect,

And I must do it,

But I fear to do it...

upon my soul I do.

00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,724
The English have a great
hunger for desolate places.

Come on, then.

You're a clever
man, sir.

1130
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,441
No, but I know a good
thing when I see one.

1131
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,411
That's fair, surely.

1132
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:01,006
Look here, now. If I am going to break through
to Jerusalem, I must concentrate, not dissipate.

Clausewitz.
You know better?

I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

1135

We should do very well
indeed, shouldn't we?

Easy, gentlemen, please.

02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:11,007
Will you give us something to drink?
Of course, sir.

1138
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,081
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

Shall we go outside?

1141
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:35,083
ALLENBY: So you hold bound
the Turkish desert army?

1142
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:36,571
LAWRENCE:
Yes.

1143
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:39,087
With 1000 Arabs?

1144
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:43,323
1000 Arabs means
1000 knives.

1145
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,482
Delivered anywhere,
day or night.

1146
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,724
It means 1000 camels.

1147
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,244
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack riﬂes.

1148
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:56,600
We can cross Arabia while Johnny
Turk is still turning round.

1149
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:59,128
I'll smash his railways.

1150
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:01,846
And while he's mending them,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1151
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:04,890
In 13 weeks I can
have Arabia in chaos.

1152

You are going back, then?

Yes.

Of course
I'm going back.

1155
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:21,120
Hm. Well, if we can
see it, so can the Turk.

1156
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:25,524
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits,

1157
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:27,051
he'll withdraw.

1158
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:30,010
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1159
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,731
If he gets out now, he knows
he'll never get back again.

1160
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,486
I wonder who will.
No one will.

1161
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:38,287
LAWRENCE: Arabia's
for the Arabs now.

1162
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,641
That's what I've
told them anyway.

That's what they think.

That's why they're fighting.
Oh, surely.

1165
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:57,921
They've only one suspicion.

1166
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:02,689
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1167
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:07,284
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

Have we?

tell them in your name

Are you really going to
give them artillery, sir?

I was wondering
that, sir.

Might be deuced difficult
to get it back again.

Give them artillery and
you've made them independent.

Then I can't give
them artillery, can I?

a horror of bloodshed.

Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just

1598
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,570

Can I take this?

1601
03:01:57,680 --> 03:01:59,603
It is not clean.

1602
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:02,929
No, but it's warm.

1603
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:04,605
And these...

1604
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:08,765
having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1605
03:02:10,240 --> 03:02:15,485
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1606
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:19,887
And let me go back to mine.

All right.

1609
03:02:55,440 --> 03:02:56,930
Hey.

1610
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,843
Mind if I join you?
Oh.

1611
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:02,364
Honoured, sir.

1612
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:07,968
Good to be back.
We heard you were, sir.

1613
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:11,131
What's doing out there?
Where?

1614
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:13,601
Oh, Arabia?
Well, yes, sir.

1615
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:17,208
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1616
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:19,920
We're settling in all right, sir.
We built a squash court.

1617
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:21,525
Jolly good.

1618
03:03:22,360 --> 03:03:26,331
Well, I have to go up there.

1619
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:29,800
It's borrowed.
Someone pinched mine.

1620
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:31,769
Bloody wogs.

1621
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:35,083
Yes, probably.

1622
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:38,167
Jolly good about the squash court.

1623
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:43,446
Lays it on a bit thick,
doesn't he?

1624
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:57,965
Morning.

1625
03:03:58,120 --> 03:03:59,929
Good morning, sir.
Good to be back.

1626
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:03,243
I'll believe you, sir.
No, really, it is.

1627
03:04:06,480 --> 03:04:07,845
Hello.

1628
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:11,603
Morning. You're
to go right in.

1629
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:25,045
Aurens.

1630
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:29,411
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1631
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:32,930
Sir.
Ah.

1632
03:04:37,240 --> 03:04:39,129
Well, general,
I will leave you.

1633
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:42,250
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make

1634
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:46,320
about my people
and their weakness

1635
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:51,361
and the need to keep them
weak in the British interest.

1636
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:57,487
And the French interest too, of course.
We must not forget the French.

1637
03:04:57,640 --> 03:04:59,688
I told you, sir,
no such treaty exists.

1638
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:04,448
Yes, general, you have lied most
bravely, but not convincingly.

1639
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:06,682
I know this treaty
does exist.

1640
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:08,808
Treaty, sir?

1641
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:12,962
He does it better
than you, general.

1642
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:16,528
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1643
03:05:30,720 --> 03:05:32,324
You really don't know?

1644
03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:36,642
Then what the devil's this?

1645
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:41,605
It's my request for release
from Arabia, sir.

1646
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:45,685
For what reason? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1647
03:05:45,840 --> 03:05:47,251
No.

1648
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:51,169
I can guess.
Don't guess. Tell him.

1649
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:54,365
Well, now...

1650
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:57,809
Mr. Sykes is an
English civil servant.

1651
03:05:58,080 --> 03:06:01,209
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1652
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:05,570
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war,

1653
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:09,208
France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1654
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:11,204
Including Arabia.

1655
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:15,604
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1656
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:18,889
An agreement
to that effect.

1657
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:23,081
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1658
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:26,085
And let's have no displays
of indignation.

1659
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:29,489
You may not have known, but
you certainly had suspicions.

1660
03:06:29,960 --> 03:06:33,362
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1661
03:06:33,520 --> 03:06:37,969
And a man who tells lies,
like me, merely hides the truth.

1662
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:42,962
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1663
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:46,842
The truth is, I'm an ordinary man.

1664
03:06:47,320 --> 03:06:49,766
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1665
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,202
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1666
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:55,807
That's my reason
for resigning.

1667
03:06:55,960 --> 03:06:58,770
It's personal.

1668
03:06:58,920 --> 03:07:01,127
Personal?
Yes, sir.

1669
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:04,489
Personal? You're a
serving officer in the field.

1670
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:08,088
And as it happens, a damned important one.
Personal? Are you mad?

1671
03:07:08,360 --> 03:07:11,569
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1672
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:13,848
That's my reason too.

1673
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:19,131
Look, Lawrence, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month,

1674
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:21,248
and you are part of it.

1675
03:07:21,720 --> 03:07:25,406
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1676
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:29,531
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1677
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:32,362
What about your Arab friends?
What about them?

1678
03:07:32,520 --> 03:07:36,411
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1679
03:07:36,560 --> 03:07:38,847
ALLENBY: What in hell do
you want, Lawrence?

1680
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:44,131
I've told you, I just want my
ration of common humanity.

1681
03:07:44,360 --> 03:07:47,284
DRYDEN: Lawrence.
Yes?

1682
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,765
Nothing. Sorry
I interrupted, sir.

1683
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,128
That's quite all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1684
03:07:55,400 --> 03:07:57,084
Thank you, sir.

There's blood
on your back.

1687
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:09,209
Do you want a doctor?
No.

1688
03:08:10,360 --> 03:08:12,522
Tell me what happened.

1689
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:19,642

on in there?

1690
03:08:20,400 --> 03:08:22,368
Nothing
Oh, come on!

1691
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:26,042
No, really. Nothing at all.
ls the man in trouble?

1692
03:08:26,200 --> 03:08:30,171
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1693
03:08:30,440 --> 03:08:34,081
Just let me know if the man's in trouble. I've
got an interest in that man. I've got a claim.

1694
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,611
What claim?

1695
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:37,967
You've read my stuff.
I've made that boy a hero.

1696
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:40,925
When the war's over, that boy
can be anything he wants.

1697
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:45,489
Yes. Well, at the moment he
wants to be somebody else.

1698
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,810
Will you kindly
allow me to pass?

1699
03:08:49,400 --> 03:08:51,880
Walk away, Dryden,
walk away.

1700
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:54,930
Always walking
away, aren't you?

1701
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:56,764
Well, I'll tell you.

1702
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:59,924
It's a little clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

Inevitably, one of
them's half-mad

and the other,
wholly unscrupulous.

I believe your name will
be a household word,

1706

when you'd have to go to the war
museum to find who Allenby was.

1707
03:09:14,920 --> 03:09:17,810
You're the most extraordinary
man I ever met.

1708

Leave me alone.

1709
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:22,771
Leave me alone.
That's a feeble thing to say.

1710
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:25,526
I know I'm not ordinary.
That's not what I'm saying.

1711
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:28,525
All right,
I'm extraordinary.

Are you speaking
from experience?

No.

1717
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:44,089
You're guessing, then.

1718
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:46,611
Suppose you're wrong.

1719
03:09:46,840 --> 03:09:49,923
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1720
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:53,690
Yes. I said, yes.
After all--

money, not the best of them.

1725

They'll be coming for Damascus.

03:10:11,440 --> 03:10:13,488
Which I'm going to give them.

1727

That's all I want.

1728

All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1729
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:24,449
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1730
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:27,883
And when we've
got it, we'll keep it.
