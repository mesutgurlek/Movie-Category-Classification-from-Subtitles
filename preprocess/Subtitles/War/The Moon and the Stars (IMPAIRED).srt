<i>A crowd of 30,000 cheers</i>

<i>James Clavel plays Scarpia,</i>

[crowd murmuring]

25
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,399
And now, to end,
I would like to introduce

26
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,302
a young actor,
Renzo Davario,

27
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,903
who is playing Spoletta.

28
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,573
And it is very exciting
to introduce new talent

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,807
because they are,
of course,

30
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:58,142
the future of
the film business.

31
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,345
[whispering] It's the
boyfriend of the producer.

32
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,280
[flashbulbs popping]

33
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,583
Light! Ha!
[applause]

34
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,928
First film?

35
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,530
Yes. Uh--

36
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,031
Oh, Mr. Clavel?
- Yes?

37
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,165
Are you excited
to be working

38
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,867
with a great producer
like Mr. Rieti?

39
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,103
[sighs] Producers are
all the same to me, dear.

40
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,472
About as much use as
a eunuch in a brothel.

41
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,210
Kristina.

42
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,812
Otto. I didn't think
you'd have time to come.

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,781
I always have time
for you, my dear.

44
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,917
Besides, your participation
in this film

45
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,920
strengthens the relationship
between two great nations.

46
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:46,190
[laughing] That sounds like
something from a publicity handout.

47
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,394
It is. But it's
true, nonetheless.

48
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,528
Any news from Siegfried?

49
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,265
I think he's in Prague.

50
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:54,966
But, then,

51
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,101
you know that,
don't you?

52
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,036
I promised him
I'd look after you

53
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,272
whilst you are here.

54
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:05,243
If there is anything
you need during your stay,

55
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,411
call me.

56
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,213
Thank you.

57
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,250
Let me talk to Davide.
- No.

58
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,552
Fired his own wife
because--

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,220
whew-- just a moment.

60
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,193
Davide.

61
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,329
You were very crude
to that poor girl.

62
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,398
You didn't introduce her
with the rest of the cast.

63
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,232
But she only has a small part--
- No, no, no, no!

64
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,368
I want her to be seen!

65
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,736
[sighs]
All right--

66
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,071
Maria Grazia
has quite a future.

67
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,374
Quite a body, too.

68
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,242
Just gossip.

69
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,977
Then can I count on you?

70
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,813
Of course.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,848
You and I
are in the same boat.

72
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,785
And don't forget it.

73
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,590
Don't worry.

74
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,925
I've talked to Davide.
It's okay.

75
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,295
There you are, dear.
<i>Grazie.</i>

76
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,530
I just wanted to say

77
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,198
I'm very happy to
be working with you.

78
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,933
Oh, thank you.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,335
[clink]
[chuckles]

80
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,537
I hate drinking
orange juice,

81
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,138
but it's better
than standing here

82
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,540
empty-handed, hmm?

83
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,610
And, uh,
I'd better tell you

84
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,945
before anybody else does.

85
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,747
I'm a part-time alcoholic,

86
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,248
full-time morphine addict.

87
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,953
Is that what they call
the English humor?

88
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,121
Yeah. Yeah, it could be,

89
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,623
except that it's true.

90
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,394
No. Sorry.
I don't get it. Uh,

91
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,062
this is embarrassing
for me.

92
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,530
Oh, God,
don't be embarrassed.

93
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,432
No, I'm never embarrassed,

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,701
except at having
to work in movies.

95
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,503
Why do it, then?

96
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,573
The money, dear.
The money!

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,908
[laughing]
You're shocked!

98
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,478
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

99
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,547
Now-- Now, what I really
like is the theater.

100
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,148
You know?
Being on stage?

101
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,418
It's-- It's a passion.

102
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,853
It's being alive!

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,022
Mmm? Ha ha.

104
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,860
No, no.
Anybody can do movies.

105
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,227
You should have seen
my <i>Richard III.</i>

106
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,029
Audience were
with me all the way.

107
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,731
Managed to shake them off
at the station.

108
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,233
[laughing]

109
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,871
Ah, God. Movies are
second best at best.

110
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,272
You don't like film!

111
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,107
Oh, God. What's to like?

112
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:17,675
Well, it's the art
of the people!

113
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:20,445
No. People? God--

114
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,680
Frankly, meeting you

115
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,682
has been a great
disappointment.

116
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,352
Ha!

117
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,791
Thank you--
- Miss Baumgarten.

118
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:35,192
I swore I'd shoot myself
if I didn't have the courage

119
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,495
to talk to you in 10 seconds.
- And did you?

120
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,431
No, it took me 20.
See, I'm not capable

121
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,466
of dying for you.
[laughs]

122
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,868
How old are you?
- Um,

123
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,905
older than the Sphinx.

124
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,372
I have something
to tell you.

125
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,941
On day, I'll write
the conversations

126
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,309
between the voices
in my head

127
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,044
and send them to you.

128
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,879
Are you Catholic?

129
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,548
No. Protestant.

130
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,383
That's a problem.
My family have been

131
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,152
leading Catholics
for centuries.

132
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,219
But you'll convert.

133
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,922
I believe in the
teachings of the Church,

134
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,057
even though I get my mother
to go to Mass for me.

135
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,258
So we'll be all right.

136
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,260
What are you raving about?

137
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,962
Our marriage, of course.

138
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,797
Oh, you're crazy, obviously--
- How?

139
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,466
How do you know?
That's what everybody says.

140
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,568
I'm married.

141
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,970
I have a wonderful child.

142
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,237
Who the devil are you?

143
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,273
Marcantonio Altieri.

144
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,641
What do you want?

145
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,976
Nothing. I--
- Good.

146
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:28,412
Everything.
Everything!

147
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,648
Miss Baumgarten,
<i>per favore!</i>

148
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,957
Are you free
this evening?

149
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,725
Of course.

150
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,327
I thought perhaps you were
going to a fancy dress party,

151
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,497
in that costume of yours.

152
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,131
This is the uniform
of a fascist,

153
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,232
and I'm proud of it.

154
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,433
Oh, I'm only saying

155
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,703
I don't think
a black shirt suits you.

156
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,539
It's what I believe in.

157
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,741
Then why did you get me
to order you three suits

158
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,776
and a dinner jacket
from Caraceni?

159
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,378
[sighs]

160
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,580
A gifted young actor
must have a wardrobe.

161
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,383
Remember?
- Mm,

162
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,319
you are not an actor,
and you are not a fascist.

163
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,687
You know what you are.

164
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,694
I wouldn't spell it out,
if I were you.

165
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,431
No, you're right.

166
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,966
It doesn't do
to name things,

167
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,868
but I'm very
fond of you.

168
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:26,905
That's unfortunate,
isn't it?

169
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,943
Yes, it is.

170
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,751
I want a softer seam,
Daisy.

171
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,420
Well, I can take half
an inch off the hem,

172
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,255
and, ooh, tighten
this waistband,

173
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,090
get rid of these
bloody wrinkles.

174
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,959
Lengthen it an inch here.

175
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,895
Only the front.
The back's all right.

176
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,797
Well, I'm glad
something's right.

177
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,032
Ta-da!

178
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,399
Oh!

179
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,568
What do you think? Hm?

180
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,570
It's a bit tight,
but I'll lose weight.

181
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:01,839
Jamie Clavel,
you old tosspot.

182
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,541
Daisy, you horse's ass.

183
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,010
Good God. Mmmm!

184
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,445
Haven't seen you
since when?

185
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,413
[stammering]
<i>The Return of Sexton Blake!</i>

186
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,215
Another British
film classic.

187
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,817
Closer! Closer. Here--

188
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,385
What are you doing
in this hellhole?

189
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,487
Working. You get it
when and where you can.

190
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:20,391
[chuckling] Yeah. Europe's a
dangerous place to be, you know?

191
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,794
I'm English. They
wouldn't dare touch me.

192
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,796
I wouldn't
count on it, dear.

193
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:25,997
Would you have a drink later?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,032
Daisy?

195
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,001
Daisy.
- Mm--

196
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,069
Yes, I think it's fine.

197
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,437
And we can break it
down a bit.

198
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,772
Now can we see you
with James?

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,873
Yes, of course.

200
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,283
[sighs] What have you
heard of a young man

201
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,852
called Marcantonio Altieri?

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,588
Everyone in Rome's
heard of Master Altieri.

203
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,556
Yes, well,
he's pestering me.

204
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,191
He follows me
everywhere in his car.

205
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,127
I don't know what to do.

206

[chuckles]

207
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:00,331
I should accept his devotion
as a mystic offer.

208
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:02,634
His gifts will
shortly follow.

209
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,102
I don't want his gifts.

210
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,843
Uhhn!

211
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,377
What?
- He's there again.

212
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,646
I have to get out of here.

213
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:15,847
Come with me.

214
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,649
I am the master

Was it Tristan?

00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,914
Almost. Siegfried.

218
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,149
Is he a Nazi?

219
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,317
He's high up in the party.
Why do you ask?

220
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,419
Sooner or later, you and I
will end up enemies.

221
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,688
Ah, but we already are.

222
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,356
I'm Tosca, and sooner
or later, I stab you.

I won't sign

I'd rather put
my hand in a cast.

It's only Tuesday.

They'll keep us
rolling till Friday.

You must, my dear Gargano.

for Christ's sake,

237

can you get this bloody woman
to do something about this--

238
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,931
What is it, James?
- I am not--

All right. I'm sorry,

Can we do the scene,
please?

Lovely Tosca.

No, no!
Not yet. Not yet.

248
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,585
I should be playing
Cavaradossi.

249

Ligouri looks like
a car salesman.

250
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,888
If he still has his pants on
in the second scene,

251
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,158
he's in the wrong film.

252
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,293
At least you've got
some lines.

253

Now you do.

Don't look so shocked.
I told you what it was.

Well, I didn't believe you.
I thought you were joking.

Why are you looking
so surprised, anyway?

losing days of shooting!

326
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,855
The fresco
has to be repainted!

327
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:00,391
It's what I pay you
insurance for.

328
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,760
You are forgetting
it wasn't an accident.

329
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,695
And what do you call it?

330
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,464
An act of God?

331
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,400
A lunatic set fire
to the studio!

332
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,469
You can claim damages
from his family if you like,

333
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:13,103
but meanwhile, pay me!

334
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,540
The Artieri family aren't
as rich as you think.

335
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,276
We'll put in a claim.

336
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:23,146
But meanwhile, you might
have to wait for your money.

337
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,153
Funaro.

338
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,258
We have always done
business in the past.

339
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,761
And I believe we will
do business in the future.

340
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,464
Or will we?

341
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,347
You like it?

342
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,682
Uh-huh.

343
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:14,298
This will look
perfect in your bedroom.

344
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,733
You think so?

345
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,135
Isn't it a little obscene?

346
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:21,271
No. Funaro.
Art is never obscene.

347
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,541
It's true. It's true.

348
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,375
A gift.

349
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,678
And we are agreed
on the insurance.

350
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,146
Yes.

351
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,315
Perhaps
a little on account?

352
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:34,752
[snorts]
You are a great producer, Davide,

353
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,386
but my company
would go bankrupt

354
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,855
if they were all
like you.

355
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,056
[both laughing]

356
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,223
That'll be the day,

357
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,426
when an insurance company
goes bankrupt.

358
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,941
Be nice.
Oh, come here.

359
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:58,375
[bell rings]

360
00:17:58,443 --> 00:17:59,944
[Man]
Will the accident hold you up?

361
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:03,614
[Davide]
Only for a day.

362
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,415
Maria Grazia is
very disappointed.

363
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,150
Hm.
- She cries in the night.

364
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,787
Comfort her.
- She doesn't feel appreciated.

365
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,154
She wants more close-ups.

366
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,894
I'll have a word
with our director.

367
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,830
[elephant trumpets]

368
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,932
[Man]
A word of advice, old friend.

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,401
You are being too obvious
with that boy.

370
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,670
I won't allow anyone
to control

371
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,139
or have any influence
over my private life.

372
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,642
I might have to.
There's a morality campaign

373
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,110
to clean up
the film business.

374
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:34,812
So you have to be careful.

375
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,914
Don't forget, you being
a Jew makes you vulnerable.

376
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,849
Oh, you're going to protect me.
It's what I pay you for.

377
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,784
I can only protect you
up to a point.

378
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,452
So please be discreet.

379
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,421
Why do I stay in Italy?

380
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,724
The money?
- No. I could make money anywhere.

381
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,258
I stay because
I want to make films.

382
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:49,960
That's all I want to do.

383
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,729
Remember what I said.

384
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,564
We wouldn't want
to lose you.

385
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,732
I value our friendship.

386
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,734
And the income.

387
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,002
Of course.

388
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,337
That makes our friendship
even more valuable.

389
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,673
And don't forget about poor Maria Grazia!
- Mm!

390
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,742
Close-ups by the score.

391
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,577
Close-ups. Close-ups.

392
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,296
Why are you still
wearing this uniform?

393
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,066
It's become a mania
with you.

394
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,536
You have other suits.

395
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,074
Look good
and dressing well

396
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,610
is essential for
an Italian on the make.

397
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,479
I've sold them.

398
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,383
Why?

399
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,520
Gambling.

400
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,290
I still haven't paid
off all my debts.

401
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,829
I need 500.

402
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,132
If I told you
I didn't have it,

403
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,267
you wouldn't believe me.

404
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,706
Davide--

405
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,710
I need 500 now.

406
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,053
A debt for a fascist
is a question of honor.

407
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,657
Is that why
you wear the uniform?

408
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,194
To prove to the world that you
are a fascist and a man of honor?

409
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,963
Of course not.

410
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,902
But, if you
can't help me,

411
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,003
I understand.

412
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,652
Perhaps you need this
more than I do right now.

413
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,622
Thanks, Davide.

414
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,126
I'll see you.

415
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,223
Scarpia.

416
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,491
Tosca.

417
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,794
You have the safe conduct?
Of course.

[papers rustle]
Here it is.

419
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,197
Signed and sealed,
as promised.

420
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,768
When you took that letter
from me, you became mine.

421
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,570
What do you have
for me in return?

422
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,308
[gasps, moans]

423
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,578
Why did you do that?

424
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,614
Because I know
when you've had me,

425
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,082
you'll cancel the safe contact.
[gasping]

426
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,017
This way, you
won't get the chance.

427
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,186
You didn't trust me?

428
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,457
You're in the right place
to die, Scarpia.

[whimpering]

Very good!
That's a print!

Great.

You were marvelous, James.

00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,354
Thank you, László.

The fresco Christ
and the knife.

444
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:46,463
Did you see?

445
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,466
How carefully he
covers their scenes.

446
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,669
He hasn't given me
a close-up yet.

447
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,639
[Renzo] I'll have a word
with Davide about it.

448
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,140
Don't bother.

449
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,909
He doesn't give
a damn about us.

450
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,722
A quick word?
- Can't it wait?

451
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,726
Lázló, can I be
honest with you?

452
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,394
Whenever a producer
says that,

453
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,995
I break out in a cold sweat.
- No, no.

454
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,497
Everything is beautiful.

455
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,399
Every frame
is an old master.

456
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,967
But you are making
too many of them.

457
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,269
Listen, dear. Don't
teach me my profession.

458
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,939
In Hungary, cinema
is done with close-ups,

459
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,273
as in the Soviet Union.

460
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:31,575
Molnár is saying this,

461
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,811
and he learned film
language in Budapest,

462
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,646
from Curtiz.
- Now who is Curtiz?

463
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,848
You might know him
as Michael Curtiz.

464
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,783
Ah. <i>Captain Blood.</i>
A great director.

465
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,285
Yes. Also <i>The Charge</i>
<i>of the Light Brigade.</i>

466
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:45,589
<i>Robin Hood.</i> He's Hungarian.
- Lázló, stop.

467
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,157
This is very interesting.
Hmm.

468
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:50,694
But in Italy, cinema
is made with money.

469
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,429
Prieti is saying this.

470
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,865
And unfortunately, we have
less and less of it.

471
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,101
The dailies, my friend,
are beautiful. Beautiful!

472
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:00,236
[scoffs]
But you are taking too long.

473
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:01,638
If you are trying
to frighten me,

474
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,507
you are doing a good job.
- No! No.

475
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,943
No, no, no, no, no.

476
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,846
The bank has agreed
to sign the contract.

477
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,914
But we have to
stay on schedule.

478
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,549
We can't afford
any mistakes.

479
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:16,720
Germany's about
to invade Poland.

480
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,421
Nobody's interested
in making movies.

481
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,257
Oh! We'll make them interested.
- How?

482
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,893
I've got this idea.

483
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,329
In the love scenes between
Kristina and young Ligouri,

484
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,866
I'll get Kristina
to play it naked.

485
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:29,933
Naked?

486
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,802
It will be worth millions
at the box office!

487
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,570
Completely naked?

488
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,105
Yes. Almost.

489
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,107
You would see her breasts!
- Both of them?

490
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,942
Yes.
- Have you spoken to Kristina about this?

491
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,111
No! But I will!

492
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:42,278
At the right time.

493
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,680
Good luck.

494
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,916
It's mad.

495
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:50,120
But it's a mad business.
[chuckles]

496
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,626
Chop-chop!

497
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:56,827
<i>Liberté!</i>
<i>Liberté!</i>

498
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:57,928

499
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,962
Liberty!

500
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,264
And we shall die fighting!

501
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,402
[gunshots]

502
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,037
Too much smoke.

503
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,006
Kill the smoke!

504
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,306
What happened?

505
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:11,542
Are you all right?

506
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,011
Sorry! Sorry,
I'm choking--

507
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,178
Cut! Get out! Get out!

508
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,785
[screams]

509
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,359
Cut!

510
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,528
Did you get it?
- Yes.

511
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,729
Great!

512
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,566
[crew chatter]

513
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,367
Print first and last.

514
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,269
Okay!
[grunt]

515
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:40,604
I think that completes it.

516
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,006
No more close-ups.
Let's move on.

517
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,777
I picked them up from
the printers this morning.

518
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,779
You'll find they're just classical.
- Excellent.

519
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:53,183
Uh, thank you
for saving me

520
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,019
from that madman
the other day.

521
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,921
I just pointed you
to the exit.

522
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,089
Well, I'm grateful.

523
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,658
That boy's crazy
and dangerous.

524
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,926
Anyone would
have done it.

525
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:06,362
Uh, don't worry.

526
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,464
I--

527
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:08,932
I didn't see a thing.

528
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,815
Have you seen
<i>Il Tevere?</i>

529
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:26,617
Oh, I'm surprised you have
time to read that trash.

530
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,918
There's a piece about you.

531
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,419
I don't care what
they say about me,

532
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,921
as long as they
say something.

533
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,990
You should care.
You should sue them.

534
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:36,126
A Jewish producer suing a fascist rag.
That will be the day.

535
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:38,428
It says everyone
knows you are Jewish.

536
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,030
And it talks about
your private life.

537
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,699
You and Renzo.

538
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,068
Well, if <i>Il Tevere</i>
continues to publish

539
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,937
slanderous columns
about me, I will have to--

540
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,107
cancel my subscription.

541
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:51,207
It's no joke.

542
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,141
I know.

543
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,912
It accuses us of being
a cosmopolitan crew.

544
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,714
Full of degenerate
subversives.

545
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,684
They even take it out
on me for being Hungarian.

546
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,985
If they knew
the whole story--

547
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,854
What am I supposed
to do? Fire you?

548
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:07,223
No. But you can
fire Marchesini up there.

549
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,659
Marchesini? He's my
best set painter.

550
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:10,127
He's an anti-fascist!
- We all are.

551
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:12,428
I know that. But he
does something about it,

552
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:13,997
instead of sitting
on his fat ass,

553
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,198
like the rest of us,

554
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,233
complain in whispers
behind closed doors.

555
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,470
[whispers]
Shit.

556
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,862
Identification, please.

557
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,965
Visitors are reminded to
be brief and to the point.

558
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,466
The minister
has no time to waste.

559
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:52,402
Neither do I.
I'm in the middle of making a film.

560
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,636
Ah, I know!

561
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,138
My brother-in-law's
in it.

562
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,440
He's the officer who
executes Cavaradossi.

563
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:58,608
He has dialogue.

564
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,610
He says "Shoot."

565
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,813
Wasn't it enough
for you to be a Jew?

566
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,148
Did you have to be
a homosexual as well?

567
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,218
Just don't tell me
you're a Freemason!

568
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,587
You're a standing provocation
to the Secret Police.

569
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:15,258
<i>Tevere</i> reporters.
Nothing.

570
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,027
But are you sure
of Renzo?

571
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,261
What do you mean?

572
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,731
Are you sure he's not
an over-informer?

573
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,132
Are you sure of Maria?

574
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,867
What are you saying?

575
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,736
I'm saying sooner or later,

576
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,504
Maria will end up
in bed with Renzo.

577
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,373
Those two
have grandiose ideas.

578
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,109
I wouldn't be surprised
if, between them,

579
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,211
they--
they drop us both!

580
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,779
How could Maria drop me?

581
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,048
I pay you protection money!

582
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,383
Only the two of us
know that. Mm?

583
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,521
Unfortunately,
Renzo knows it, too.

584
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,023
What?

585
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,359
I talk in my sleep.

586
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:52,229
If Renzo knows,
then Maria knows, too.

587
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:53,730
[groans]

588
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,938
No. Maria won't tell.

589
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,273
You trust her?

590
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,607
I love--

591
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:09,012
I'm besotted with her,
but I don't trust her.

592
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,848
She won't tell because
she will be dead if--

593
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,449
You'd kill her?

594
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:14,717
Like that.

595
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,552
But you say you love her.

596
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,155
Ha! I do. I do.

597
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,490
For now.

598
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:23,326
But I love money
always.

599
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,732
Just make that poisonous
pen shut up about us!

600
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,635
Or it puts us all in danger,
especially the film!

601
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:36,773
Your big checks keep coming
only if the film is finished.

602
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,175
Davide.

603
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,376
The banks want to pull out.

604
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,253
Because of the article?

605
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,189
Yes. They are scared.

606
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,196
I have reviewed
the evidence.

607
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:01,097
You are an enemy
of the state.

608
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,665
The sentence
of this court

609
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,467
is that you
be taken out

610
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:05,535
and shot.

611
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,838
You call this
not an injustice?

612
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,139
No, no.

613
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,608
I call it state justice.

614
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:15,678
A different thing,
my dear friend.

615
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:16,779
Take him away.

616
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,016
You're next.

617
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,486
You will not
be tried today.

618
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,188
Why not?
- You are too well known.

619
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,289
Besides,

620
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,725
I have other
plans for you.

621
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,060
Cut!
Yeah?

622
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,062
Kristina's close-up.
Clavel and Ligouri.

623
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,129
Quick quick! Chop-chop!

624
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,464
Daisy! Daisy!
[bell rings]

625
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:35,798
Too hot here.

626
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,814
Cut! Cut!

627
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,217
Please, don't-- darling.
[laughing]

628
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,286
[bell rings]

629
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,501
[James]
Every time I come to Rome,

630
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,436
I feel as if
I'm in the middle

631
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,772
of some huge film set,
flooded with light.

632
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,841
You know, I'm starting
to feel homesick

633
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:20,910
for the gray skies
of Berlin.

634
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,713
Really? Well, I feel
quite at home here.

635
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,915
An English tea room
in the heart of Rome,

636
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,351
a stone's throw from
where Shelley used to live,

637
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,852
a hundred years ago.

638
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,656
I met a traveler from
an antique land who said,

639
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:36,792
"Two large
and limbless legs

640
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,995
of stone stand
in the desert."

641
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,997
Have you read Shelley?
- No.

642
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,467
And on the pedestal,
these words appear:

643
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,870
My name is Ozymandius,
king of kings:

644
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,974
Look on my works,
ye Mighty, and despair.

645
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,977
Nothing beside remains.

646
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,281
Round the decay
of that colossal wreck,

647
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,351
Boundless and bare,

648
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,255
the low and level sands
stretch far away.

649
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,358
I saw you do that
in a film once.

650
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,959
Oh.
[chuckles]

651
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,261
<i>Fire Over Berlin?</i>

652
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:14,564
Yes, but I do it even when
the cameras aren't rolling.

653
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:16,232
[chuckles]

654
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,334
Do you think
that rotten article

655
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,936
will cause problems
for the film?

656
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:23,039
Well, if it was authorized
by someone high up,

657
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,407
yes, we do have a problem.

658
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,943
I felt so sorry
for Rieti.

659
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,746
I mean, nobody's got the right
to trample on a person like that.

660
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:32,715
I don't suppose your husband
would agree with you.

661
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:35,185
I don't think
he'd mind so much.

662
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,053
He never listens
to what I say.

663
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,625
Do you have a wife
and children?

664
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,528
Three daughters.

665
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,030
Susan, Jennifer,
and Madeline.

666
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,669
My wife-- she's been
in a mental hospital

667
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,671
for fifteen years.

668
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,273
Madeline,
she's the eldest.

669
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,342
She looks
after the house.

670
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,545
And me,
to a certain extent.

671
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,482
Well, it's thanks to her
I've stopped serial drinking.

672
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,484
She doesn't know
about the morphine.

673
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,220
Well, at least
I hope she doesn't.

674
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:28,171
I got married
when I was 18

675
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,107
and didn't know
any better.

676
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,409
My husband is 10 years
older than me.

677
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:36,246
I looked up to him.

678
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:37,480
I work in films,

679
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,516
and Siegfried
works for the party.

680
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:43,153
We share the same roof,
that's all.

681
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,589
Why do you stay with him?

682
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,858
I don't want my son
to pay for my mistake.

683
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:51,294
And he would. The party
would see to that.

684
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,198
Oh, no. No. No. No.

685
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,500
No. Look. It's, uh--

686
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,769
look, you see?

687
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,337
It's jam first.

688
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,509
Then the cream.

689
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,578
It's a trick
you learn in England.

690
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,848
You see?

691
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,817
I'm glad you asked
for a truce.

692
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,353
Here.

693
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,456
[street chatter]

694
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,576
I'd never go to bed
with a Jew.

695
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,644
Why not?

696
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,846
They put our Lord
on the cross.

697
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,482
[laughs]
That was before my time.

698
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,785
They didn't do it to me.
That's what counts.

699
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,354
They will.

700
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,024
Davide has been
very good to me.

701
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:58,628
He picked me up
from the gutter.

702
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,998
Without him, I'd probably
be in prison by now.

703
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:06,068
You are stupid.

704
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,203
Why?

705
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:12,442
Because they take advantage
of your beauty and youth.

706
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,577
That's all they want.

707
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,713
They don't want us.

708
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,681
We're just merchandise.

709
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,383
Something they buy
and throw away

710
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,984
when they get bored.

711
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:24,186
And you are grateful.

712
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,522
I'm not grateful.

713
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,392
Merolle is a disgusting,
sweaty old pig.

714
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,028
He doesn't look like that
when you're with him.

715
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,901
[laughing]
Tell me you are jealous.

716
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,403
[soft moan]

717
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,839
What would you do to keep
Merolle away from me?

718
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:45,207
[both moan]
What would you do

719
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,876
to keep Davide from me?

720
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,980
[Maria moans]
Oh, Renzo.

721
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,316
[Renzo] Keep still.
[she moans]

722
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,221
How much did that
reporter give you

723
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,925
to tell him all that filth
about Davide and me?

724
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,662
I didn't.

725
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:08,998
But you are the only one
who knew those details.

726
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:10,900
[groans]

727
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,001
So what?

728
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,307
Shit!

729
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,241
Look!

730
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,576
Look what you've done!

731
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:21,644
I'm bleeding!

732
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,814
You deserve worse.
- You bastard.

733
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,183
Renzo, I'm poor.

734
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,353
We are both dirt-poor.

735
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,788
We understand
each other, don't we?

736
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:35,525
I understand
that you betrayed me

737
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,393
and a friend of mine.

738
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,329
Your lover
gives you nothing!

739
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:42,365
The reporter gave me
1,000 lire for this story!

740
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,768
That's 500 for you, Renzo.

741
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,705
Don't say another word.
[choking]

742
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:50,406
Or I'll kill you.

743
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,676

00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,031
I changed my mind.

[gasps]

753
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,190
Hello.

754
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:30,893
There is a saying in Rome

755
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,929
that if you're not dead,
you'll meet again,

756
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:35,765
and since we're not dead,
we meet again.

757
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,734
Get out of my bed.

758
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:42,004
I can't. I'm naked
under the sheet.

759
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,640
I threw all my clothes
out of the window,

760
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,141
except my socks.

761
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:48,911
A man with honor cannot walk
around without his socks,

762
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,247
and mine are
monogrammed.

763
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,116
You're crazy.

764
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,350
You're wrong.

765
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,620
And I have a certificate
to prove it.

766
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,956
They let me out of
the clinic this morning,

767
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,390
with the doctors
waving good-bye

768
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,593
and the nurses
throwing roses.

769
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:08,965
Who are you calling,
my love?

770
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,332
The hotel manager.

771
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,134
Then I shall leave,
singing.

772
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,535
They'll take me
to the border.

773
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,605
What border?

774
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,439
The border. The border.
There is always a border

775
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:18,774
between here and there.

776
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:20,242
They tried last year,

777
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,278
when everybody was shouting
"Long live Mussolini."

778
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:25,681
I was shouting "Long live
Mahatma Ghandi."

779
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,850
I like to provoke,
stir the blood.

780
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,218
Why?

781
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,120
Because you weren't there.

782
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:33,188
I love you, Kristina.

783
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,257
That's the explanation
for everything.

784
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:36,826
You're the light of my life.

785
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,528
Please. Will you leave?

786
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:41,731
Will you promise
to meet me again?

787
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:44,867
Hello. Yes. This is
Kristina Baumgarten here.

788
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,235
Don't turn around.
There's somebody in my room.

789
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,870
He's in my bed.
<i>- Non capisco.</i>

790
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,405
What?

791
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,541
I told you
not to turn around.

792
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:56,679
A gentleman must
never shock a lady.

793
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,048
Till we meet again, my love.

794
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:01,717
Till we meet again.

795
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:06,188
[door closes]

796
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,992
Oh! My God.

[speaking Italian]

798
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,872
I'm working for
the government,

799
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,573
and I ran into a tree.

800
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,543
Please order me a taxi.

801
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,744
Thank you.

[speaking Italian]

803
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,822
[Otto] I'm very sorry.
Is that your friend?

804
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:41,324
Yes, Otto.

805
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:42,591
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

806
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:48,497
Bad news?

807
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,499
My husband.
He's been wounded.

808
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,967
I-- oh, my God.
Badly?

809
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:53,736
No. It's not too serious.

810
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,471
Good. Are you
going to see him?

811
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,573
No. I'm staying
with the film.

812
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,210
Here.

813
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:04,179
Let me get you
back to the studio.

814
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,948
Yes. I'll breathe
easier there.

815
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:07,916
Our little bubble
of unreality.

816
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:11,987
Oh, I, uh--

817
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:13,723
I heard about your friend.

818
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,725
The loony Altieri.

819
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:16,892
Hmm.

820
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,729
Is it true? He only
had his socks on?

821
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:21,330
And a top hat.

822
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,865
[laughing]

823
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:24,633
My God.

824
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,236
A large one, I hope.

825
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:36,178
Come to here. See?

826
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,413
Yes, yes.

827
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,348
Bloody marvelous!

828
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,018
Thank you.
- Fantastic. That was fantastic.

829
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,420
Oh, really?
[laughs]

830
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,423
Kristina, I'm sorry to
hear about your husband.

831
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,492
Will you need a few days
off to go and see him?

832
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:50,993
No, thank you.
We've, uh--

833
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,395
we've talked about it.

834
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:53,863
We both feel
my duty's here.

835
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,197
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

836
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,899
You're welcome.
- Thank you. I'm very grateful

837
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:59,568
We would have been completely
lost if you decided to go.

838
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,203
Oh, well, I would
never do that.

839
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,038
When I sign a contract
or make a promise,

840
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,306
I stick with it.

841
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:05,941
Same with me.
- Uh-huh.

842
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,544
It's hard to find people
you can lean on and trust.

843
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,379
Mm.
- You can lean on me, dear.

844
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,714
Ha ha ha.

845
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,115
[Man]
Final text!

846
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:16,084
Yes. Fine. Well--

847
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:17,653
I'll be around.

848
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,459
Marchesini! Marchesini!

849
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:26,796
Uh, you dropped this.

850
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,032
Thank you, ma'am.

851
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:31,366
Thank you very much.

852
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,637
Is that your son?

853
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:35,704
Yes, it is.

854
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,873
How old is he?

855
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,207
He's 8.

856
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,377
Mine's 10.

857
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,981
It's a pity they are made
to march in parades

858
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,316
and go to war.

859
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,786
Yes.

860
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,522
It is.

861
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,123
Kristina!

862
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:56,258
We are waiting!

863
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:01,997
[Man] Quiet!
Let's go.

864
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,265
I know!

865
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,468
Let's go.

866
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,079
[bell rings]

867
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:18,146
We are losing the sun.

868
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:27,022
Good, Alfonso.
Go to your marks.

869
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,092
Camera ready?
<i>Silencio.</i>

870
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,560
Sound? Speed?
- Ready.

871
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:33,929
Roll camera!

872
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,298
230. Take 6.
[clack]

873
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,500
Action!

874
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,234
[Kristina]
Captain! Captain! No!

875
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:40,736
I have a stay
of execution!

876
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,872
A reprieve, signed
by Governor Scarpia!

877
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,541
No.
- What's wrong with it?

878
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,675
He hasn't signed it.

879
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,410
But he meant to!
Go ask him!

880
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:49,979
I can't, madam.

881
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,179
Men!
- No!

882
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,115
Resume firing positions!
- No! I won't let you!

883
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:54,917
Tosca--
- Cavaradossi, my love!

884
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,952
All right, men!
- No!

885
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,921
Ready!
- Let him go!

886
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,858
Take aim! Fire!

Beautiful.
Beautiful!

891
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,542
A good master.
- Yes.

892
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:20,976
I want lots of cover.

893
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,478
Guns. Triggers.
Flowing body blood.

894
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,047
Et cetera, et cetera.

895
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,314
Montage.

896
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:29,585
I must have an edited
sequence for Monday.

897
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,520
If Kunz is moved by it,
we're saved.

898
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,955
The bankers
will listen to him.

899
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,624
Not a dry eye.
I guarantee.

900
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,695
We're seeing him tonight.

901
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,129
Talk to him
about the film.

902
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:43,331
What do you want me to say
about my masterpiece?

903
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:44,499
No, don't say masterpiece.

904
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:45,834
Just say it'll make
a lot of money.

905
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,171
And how are you,
my dear?

906
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:50,773
I'm all right.

907
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,074
Listen, I'm having--

908
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,342
I'm giving a little party
at my house tonight.

909
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,679
I would be delighted
if you would attend.

910
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:57,980
Oh, yes!

911
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,348
It's in honor of Arthur Kunz.
The Swiss banker.

912
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,686
Oh. Is he any relation to
the pianist Charlie Kunz?

913
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:05,854
I don't think so.
- Oh...

914
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,155
He's a favorite of mine.

915
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:09,625
He wrote "Clap Hands,
Here Comes Charlie".

916
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,463
[Man]
Make up! Go now, go now.

917
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,464
Everybody--

918
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:17,933
Quiet!
Quiet, everyone!

919
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,739
Who the devil are you?

920
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:26,809
You are trespassing.
Out.

921
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:28,176
Are you the boss?

922
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,482
I'm the director.

923
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:36,619
Hmph. We are looking
for Francesco Marchesini.

924
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:41,389
Marchesini?

925
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:44,093
Marchesini?

926
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,866
There are some people
here for you--

927
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:54,937
What do you want with
Signore Marchesini?

928
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,972
[Man]
He's wanted for questioning.

929
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,076
No, we need him here.

930
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,511
I'll stand guarantee
for him.

931
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:05,447
Don't make me laugh.
[laughing]

932
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,349
I will be all right.

933
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,817
Thank you, sir.

934
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:14,123
You're coming with us.

935
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,991
You're nothing
but bully boys.

936
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,727
Have you got
something to say?

937
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,596
My mother always
taught me to be polite.

938
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,231
But there's no need
to smile at policemen.

939
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,498
You are in the real
world now, Marchesini,

940
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,766
where we can do what we like.

941
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,534
[coughs]

942
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:00,669
Take him away.

<i># [ballroom]</i>

944
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:15,750
[Davide] You are very fortunate
to spend half your time

945
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:17,752
in Rome, and keep
your base in Zurich.

946
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,888
To be safe
in Europe today,

947
00:49:19,955 --> 00:49:21,923
you have to have
two houses.

948
00:49:21,991 --> 00:49:24,159
Rome has the Vatican
to protect us,

949
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:27,095
and Zurich has the
Union of Swiss Banks.

[laughing]

951
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:29,398
Money and religion.

They both guarantee
a kind of immunity.

953
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:35,170
Have you ever thought of
migrating to safer climes?

954
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,039
No. Rome is my home.

955
00:49:37,106 --> 00:49:39,141
It's not safe
for a man like you.

956
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,542
Aren't you afraid?

957
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:43,011
It's not courage.
It's a sort of blindness.

958
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,514
A sense of
"It can't happen to me."

959
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:47,882
Why? Because you are
a film producer?

960
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,352
Yeah.
[laughing]

961
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,487
Ah. I'm gonna
suck your blood.

Would Mr. Arthur Kunz

963
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,758
dance to a song
by Mr. Charlie Kunz?

964
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:58,060
Ho ho!

965
00:49:58,127 --> 00:50:00,895
There's no relation,
as far as I know!

966
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,431
But I'll gladly dance

young woman.

he'll help, boss?

Yes. If he thinks
he can make a profit.

970

So, can you see the
ghosts in the square?

971
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:21,849
Oh...

972
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:24,386
Yes! I can.
- Mm-hm.

973
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,555
And you can stop lusting
after it, Tumiati.

974
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:27,755
It's not for sale.

00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:30,625
A good gallery owner must,
above all, be patient.

976
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:34,929
Oh, I'm sorry Kristina
couldn't be at the party.

977
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:37,332
She got word from
the German Embassy.

978
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,000
Her husband's
in active service.

979
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:40,168
He was wounded
in the leg.

980
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:43,171
Oh. Can I use that for my book?
- Certainly.

981
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,107
But the German Embassy
won't like it.

982
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:46,608
They don't like publicity

983
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:48,876
about their soldiers
being wounded or killed.

984
00:50:48,944 --> 00:50:50,212
Oh. Yes.

985
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:51,546
I understand.

986
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:52,914
So you're telling me

987
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:55,383
that the storm troopers
never die?

988
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:56,718
[both laughing]

989
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:59,254
[chatter]

990
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,629
Marchesini helped me
when I was in trouble.

991
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:08,930
He seems like a good person.

992
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:11,899
[laughs]
He isn't accused of being bad.

993
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:13,001
Just anti-fascist.

994
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,069
Well, he must have
done something wrong.

995
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,738
Mm! Oh, yes. Sorry.

996
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:18,973
I forgot I was dining
with the Marie Antoinette

997
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,675
of the Third Reich.
[laughs]

998
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:21,776
It's not that bad.

999
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,845
I don't say
they should eat cake.

1000
00:51:23,912 --> 00:51:26,114
I'm just trying to
understand what's going on.

1001
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:31,153
Ah. The real world is creeping
into our little bubble.

1002
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,489
Outside, Czechoslovakia
has been invaded by Germany.

1003
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,959
Italy's occupying Albania.

1004
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:41,229
Pretty soon, the whole
of Europe will be at war.

1005
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,864
And if we're not careful,

1006
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:45,167
some of us will be
caught far from home.

1007
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,474
Anyway,

1008
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,776
I'm still asking myself
what I'm doing here with you.

1009
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:56,778
Are you?
- Yes!

1010
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,381
I like women who laugh.
You don't laugh nearly enough!

1011
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:00,515
[giggles]

1012
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,084
I prefer blondes.
You're a brunette.

1013
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:06,754
I like women who are
medium height,

1014
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:09,757
rounded,
uncomplicated.

1015
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:13,761
You're tall, slender,
and subtle.

1016
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:16,364
Well, I-- I can't say

1017
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:20,602
a nihilistic, alcoholic
morphine addict

1018
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,671
is my kind of man.
[laughs]

1019
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:24,772
Thank you very much.
[laughs]

1020
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:27,576
So,

1021
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:29,911
what are your plans
after the film's finished?

1022
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,314
Uh, I don't know.
This, um,

1023
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:35,850
Rattigan chap's got a new
play on the West End.

1024
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:40,088
I think I rather blotted my
copy book in that department.

1025
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,393
Anyway,

1026
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,662
I don't think
that far ahead.

1027
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,997
Out of my way!
Make way

1028
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,234
for our Abyssinian heroes!

1029
00:52:54,203 --> 00:52:57,038
There goes the ambiance.

1030
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:58,607
Just pretend
they don't exist.

1031
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:00,108
Just look at me, James.

1032
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:05,947
Look at 'em. Eh?

1033
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,815
[whispering]
Bloody toy soldiers.

1034
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,456
[whistles]
[groans]

1035
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,191
No, and don't
drink so much.

1036
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,160
You said just a drop
to keep me company.

1037
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,062
This one changed
my mind, all right?

1038
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,930
[Waitress]
What would you like?

1039
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:24,666
Something special!

1040
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,134
[yelps]

1041
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,869
Karlina, you're
needed in the kitchen.

1042
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:29,971
I will take their order.

1043
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,340
[sigh]

1044
00:53:32,408 --> 00:53:33,742
James, it's all right.
Just

1045
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:36,311
look at me
and talk to me. Mm?

1046
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,212
[Soldier] Someone told us
that you had a new waitress.

1047
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,048
They didn't say
she was so pretty.

1048
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:44,352
She's not the only
beauty at this place.

1049
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,489
[whispering] See that woman over
there? That's Kristina Baumgarten.

1050
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:49,591
[all whispering]

1051
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,960
Oh, great.
[sighs]

1052
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:54,796
Now they recognize you.

1053
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:56,631
It's all right.
All they can do

1054
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,466
is ask for my autograph.

1055
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,034
Everything all right?

1056
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,070
Calm down.
Don't drink so--

1057
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:04,839
Now you're getting drunk.
- What?

1058
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,442
James, please. Just sit down.
- Don't tell me--

1059
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,177
For God's sake,
this is ridiculous.

1060
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,146
You're scum.

1061
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,648
What did you say?
Repeat it!

1062
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,617
You're scum. Again?

1063
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,452
We are heroes!

1064
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,787
[yelling]
[clattering]

1065
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:19,887
No! James!

1066
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,258
Ah! You imbecile!

1067
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:30,131
<i># [kettle drums]</i>

1068
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,066
It's sublime.

1069
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:34,602
I was at a gala
performance in Lausanne,

1070
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,872
back in 1918.

1071
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,240
What memories.

1072
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:40,842
[doorbell rings]

1073
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:42,109
Oh.

1074
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:44,779
The neighbors, protesting
about the noise.

1075
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:46,280
Renzo,
lower the volume.

1076
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,350
I'll try and
calm them down.

1077
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:50,719
Rome has become
a real bore.

1078
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:53,722
At 10:00, they
want us all in bed.

1079
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:54,823
[laughing]

1080
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,157
Ah, you should try Paris.

1081
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:58,560
Now, there they really
know how to enjoy themselves.

1082
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:00,595
[Merolle]
Ah, Paris. Yes.

1083
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:04,666
It would be a pity if we
have to destroy the place.

1084
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,735
[Kristina]
You have to do something, Davide.

1085
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:08,503
I don't know where
they've taken him.

1086
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,804
Ah, Mr. Arthur Kunz?

1087
00:55:09,872 --> 00:55:11,506
This is our very own
Kristina Baumgarten.

1088
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,475
An honor, madam.
- Nice to meet you.

1089
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:15,243
All right, something
terrible's happened.

1090
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,846
They've arrested James.
Arrested? What do you mean?

1091
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:19,614
Two policemen came
and took him to prison.

1092
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:20,749
All right.
Sit down, Kristina.

1093
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:22,049
Sit down.
Try and relax.

1094
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:24,386
Please. Now tell us
exactly what happened.

1095
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:25,720
Surely it's
a misunderstanding.

1096
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,789
No. No. There was
an argument,

1097
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,791
and James hit a man
who was staring at me.

1098
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,626
I tried to stop him,
but it was impossible.

1099
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,628
Where were you, exactly?

1100
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:35,797
In a restaurant,
in Trastevere.

1101
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,400
In Via del Matonato.

1102
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,134
But James is an actor.

1103
00:55:40,202 --> 00:55:41,436
We don't arrest actors

1104
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,671
for causing a disturbance
in a restaurant.

1105
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,507
It's the done thing.

1106
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:47,975
Luckily, I think
I know the restaurant.

1107
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:49,677
The owner is
a friend of mine.

1108
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:51,479
Where is the phone?

1109
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:52,547
In the hall.

1110
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,049
Oh, thank you so much.

1111
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:56,217
I need a cigarette.

1112
00:55:56,285 --> 00:55:58,185
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

1113
00:55:58,253 --> 00:55:59,521
Everything
will be all right.

1114
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:01,890
[all talking at once]

1115
00:56:03,158 --> 00:56:05,593
[Merolle]
Yes, yes. I understand.

1116
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:07,161
I'll take care of it.

1117
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:08,830
Thank you.

1118
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,605
So I wouldn't mind a glass
of water or something.

1119
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:20,041
Well, just, there were
these three men.

1120
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:22,911
These very big soldiers.
They were drunk.

1121
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:24,078
Well?

1122
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,513
I'm afraid
it's a little more

1123
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,348
complicated
than I thought.

1124
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,050
Your Mister James

1125
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:31,018
knocked down
a decorated war hero

1126
00:56:31,086 --> 00:56:32,854
of the Abyssinian campaign.

1127
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,756
But James is a hero, too!

1128
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,991
Oh, maybe, maybe.

1129
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,460
You only escaped arrest

1130
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,596
because you are
famous German star.

1131
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,531
James is only
an English actor,

1132
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,099
so he wasn't so lucky.

1133
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,901
I need him on
the set tomorrow!

1134
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:49,504
He'll have to stay
in jail overnight.

1135
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,740
But I should have him
out by morning.

1136
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:54,075
Let's go.

1137
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,185
[doors open]

1138
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:04,986
[speaking Italian]

1139
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,321
[doors close]

1140
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,434
[groans]
Oh, James!

1141
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:20,702
James!
Are you all right?

1142
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:22,904
I'm so sorry--
- You look terrible.

1143
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,140
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1144
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,042
What did they do to you?
- No, no. Come on--

1145
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,877
These German women.

1146
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,178
They look
as cold as ice,

1147
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,779
and then you
find out different.

1148
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:32,981
I'm just glad
we got him out.

1149
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,249
It could have cost me
a day's shooting.

1150
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:38,153
So sweet.

1151
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,988
That's so-- thank you.
Coffee?

1152
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,304
Here, James. Let me.

1153
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:11,686
Are you all right?

1154
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,854
Augh-- I--

1155
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,356
You know--

1156
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,860
I think you may be
right about Maria.

1157
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:22,230
[James]
I, uh--

1158
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,165
really must thank
both of you

1159
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,666
for getting me
out of that place.

1160
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:27,235
Thank you.

1161
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,336
It's what
producers do.

1162
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,640
Promise not to
let it happen again.

1163
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,708
Unless provoked.

1164
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,846
If you are, try not
to do it to a war hero.

1165
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,482
There haven't got
many out there.

1166
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,584
[Kristina] Come on, James.
Drink your coffee.

1167
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,861
<i>Ready! Take aim!</i>

01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:21,816

01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:24,685
<i>No!</i>

1190
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,065
[beep]
[applause]

1191
01:00:51,947 --> 01:00:54,482
It's brilliantly
done, Molnár.

1192
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:58,253
A superb piece
of moviemaking.

1193
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,287
Thank you.

1194
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,622
But there's
too much violence.

1195
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,658
Oh, this is only
a rough cut.

1196
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:06,127
And execution is violent.

1197
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,696
Without the execution,
the story is meaningless.

1198
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:09,764
Maybe.

1199
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,933
But I'm against it.

1200
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,735
I don't want to see an
execution on the screen.

1201
01:01:14,803 --> 01:01:17,738
Executions are an everyday
occurrence these days.

1202
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:20,708
Maybe that's
why I'm against it.

1203
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,311
I think you artists
can do a lot

1204
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,513
as messengers of peace.

1205
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,715
But this is
an anti-war film.

1206
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:29,917
My <i>Tosca</i> is
a hymn for freedom.

1207
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:31,886
It's against violence,
oppression, dictator--

1208
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,921
Are you mad?

1209
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:37,058
I personally guaranteed
this film to the Ministry!

1210
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,060
Take back what
you said immediately,

1211
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,928
or I will
have you deported!

1212
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:42,163
Oh, please, please, please.

1213
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,731
There's no need to
get over-excited.

1214
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,534
I'm sure Molnár can cut the
film to everybody's satisfaction.

1215
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,571
Yes. I mean, it can
always be seen as

1216
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:52,273
the heroic struggle
of Scarpia

1217
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,176
to root out anarchy
and subversion.

1218
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,479
And in doing so,

1219
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:58,846
it costs him his life.

1220
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,919
Ship is taking water
from all sides, matey.

1221
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,488
[whispers]
It's time we left for England.

1222
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,689
My friends.

1223
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:10,191
Davide.

1224
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,160
Why don't you get out?

1225
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:16,764
Hitler wants a war,
and he will have it.

1226
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:18,666
Danzig's doomed.

1227
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:20,135
France and Britain.

1228
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:22,670
Meanwhile, I have to find
a guarantee for the bank.

1229
01:02:24,406 --> 01:02:26,040
I'm willing to offer my

1230
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,709
collection of paintings
as collateral.

1231
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:30,311
[Arthur]
Is it that bad?

1232
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,879
Tell him, Gargano.

1233
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:36,017
[sighs]

1234
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:38,153
Unless we get
money from the bank,

1235
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,087
I'll have difficulty
meeting the payroll.

1236
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,190
I can't let
these people down.

1237
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,259
They work. They slave.

1238
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:47,262
They put their talent
and their guts into this film.

1239
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:49,264
The least they deserve
is to be paid.

1240
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:57,372
I'll talk with my board.

1241
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:59,307
Good work, Molnár.

1242
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,014
"Confident I can
count on your support

1243
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:09,450
"in these troubled times.

1244
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,919
"Yours, Davide Rieti."

1245
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:16,291
Lord, he's fighting
for his life, poor bugger.

1246
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:18,125
I'm surprised you
didn't get a letter.

1247
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,794
Maybe I get
special treatment.

1248
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,128
Remember, I'm a star.

1249
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,430
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1250
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:23,898
But if they don't pay you,

1251
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:25,966
you're in the same boat
as the rest of us.

1252
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:27,134
I think he'll pay.

1253
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,205
I think Davide
is an honest man.

1254
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:31,539
I'm sorry,

1255
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,141
look me in the eye.

1256
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,646
Now, tell me Davide Rieti
is an honest man.

1257
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,215
Remember, he's a producer.

1258
01:03:40,282 --> 01:03:42,149
I'm looking.

1259
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,318
Mm-hmm.

1260
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:46,153
Davide Rieti is an honest man.

1261
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,656
[chuckling]

1262
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:49,990
I believe you.

1263
01:03:50,058 --> 01:03:53,494
Why do you believe me,
James?

1264
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,531
Because you're honest.

1265
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:00,134
So let's give him
the time he needs

1266
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:01,869
to finish the film, hmm?

1267
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:05,306
I'm glad.

1268
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,791
If we don't get it today,

1269
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:26,427
we don't get it at all.

1270
01:04:28,096 --> 01:04:31,232
Daisy, where is everybody?

1271
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,302
Mr. Molnár,

1272
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:37,138
Kristina has a question.

1273
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:38,539
Oh, yes.

1274
01:04:38,606 --> 01:04:41,075
Well, this is just
an intimate scene

1275
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,110
between you
and Cavaradossi.

1276
01:04:43,178 --> 01:04:45,712
So I-- I cleared the set.

1277
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,281
Why?

1278
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:49,917
<i>Meine liebe,</i> this is
an intimate love scene.

1279
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,987
I want the audience to see

1280
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,688
what your Cavaradossi sees.

1281
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:58,059
Ohh. Like what?

1282
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:03,697
You naked in bed
with Liguori.

1283
01:05:03,765 --> 01:05:04,698
Ah.

1284
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,336
Naked?

1285
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:11,072
Not completely naked, just...

1286
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:12,440
your top half.

1287
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,944
And you really think

1288
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:18,446
this will help the picture?

1289
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:19,580
Yes.

1290
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,687
[Kristina]
You know, Daisy,

1291
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:28,856
the funny thing is
they don't seem to know

1292
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:30,557
that before being in movies,

1293
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,060
I worked in
a cabaret in Berlin.

1294
01:05:33,128 --> 01:05:35,662
[both laughing]

1295
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,798
Thank you.

1296
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:39,700
Are you married, Daisy?

1297
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:42,336
I was, to an Italian.
- Ah.

1298
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:44,305
But, um,
it didn't work out.

1299
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,539
Oh.

1300
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:46,740
Do you have
any children?

1301
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:47,908
Two.

1302
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,577
They're safe in England
with my mother.

1303
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:52,346
Have you ever noticed

1304
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:54,581
that men can fight
the bloodiest wars,

1305
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,750
but at the first sight
of a dirty nappy,

1306
01:05:56,818 --> 01:05:58,019
they scarper.

1307
01:05:58,086 --> 01:06:00,621
[chuckling]
Yes, I have noticed that.

1308
01:06:00,688 --> 01:06:02,356
[both laughing]

1309
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:05,926
So how long have you
known Mr. Clavel?

1310
01:06:05,994 --> 01:06:08,562
Jamie? Oh, for years.

1311
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,432
We've made
three movies together.

1312
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,700
He's a good man, despite--

1313
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:15,169
no, because of his vices.

1314
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,604
[low chatter]
[Daisy] He pretends that he--

1315
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:20,274
that he doesn't care, but...

1316
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,975
it's not true.

1317
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,145
Okay?

1318
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:25,846
Fine, thank you.

1319
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:27,548
Right. We're ready.

1320
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:31,785
Good.

1321
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,020
Good?

1322
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:34,788
Yeah.

1323
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:36,424
Alfonso.

1324
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:39,226
Alfonso.

1325
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:42,629
Alfonso, you are on!

1326
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:43,864
I'm here.

1327
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:45,066
What is the panic?

1328
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,167
Get out of there.

1329
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:47,301
Aie! Aie.

1330
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:49,403
[speaking Italian]

1331
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,005
[bell rings]

1332
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:01,615
What do you want?

1333
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:05,752
I want this to be
the hottest thing

1334
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,354
since Greta Garbo
and John Gilbert.

1335
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:08,822
You don't want me

1336
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,891
to fall in love
with him, do you?

1337
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:12,993
Um, no offense, Alfonso.

1338
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:15,963
No, of course not.
Just act.

1339
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,898
I know it's hard,
but try.

1340
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,402
So how much do you
want me to show?

1341
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,605
[clears throat]

1342
01:07:24,672 --> 01:07:27,841
I leave it to you,
Kristina.

1343
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:30,010
Well, is this enough?

1344
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,346
[thud]
<i>Madonna!</i>

1345
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,321
We've been friends
for years, Davide.

1346
01:07:40,388 --> 01:07:41,922
I'd be taking advantage.

1347
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,224
No, I should refuse.

1348
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,426
I don't want to,
but I have no choice.

1349
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,028
I'll sell everything
except the the Morandi.

1350
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:49,763
The market is very low.

1351
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:51,098
When people are afraid,

1352
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,566
they invest
in gold and jewels.

1353
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,135
I only have
great paintings.

1354
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,937
Yes, they are great.
You always bought the best.

1355
01:07:57,005 --> 01:08:00,574
I have to finish this film
before war breaks out

1356
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:03,444
and they put a stop
to the whole thing.

1357
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,013
I'm gambling I can
pull off one last film

1358
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,214
before the floodgates open.

1359
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:08,549
Why are you still here?

1360
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,218
You have relatives abroad.
You would be safe with them,

1361
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:12,319
and you could keep
your paintings.

1362
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:13,554
I've got to sell.

1363
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:19,993
I've never understood

1364
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:21,462
your passion
for films, Davide.

1365
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:33,574
It's a beauty.

1366
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:35,676
It's one of
Scippione's best.

1367
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:37,778
How much will you
give me for it?

1368
01:08:38,846 --> 01:08:40,614
No, you will not believe it,

1369
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:42,916
it's so ridiculous.

1370
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:45,152
I'm ashamed to tell you.

1371
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,725
I'm sorry, old friend.
That's the maximum.

1372
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:58,165
I'll take it.

1373
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:08,008
[flashbulbs popping]

1374
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:09,176
[Man]
Miss Baumgarten,

1375
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:11,478
[speaking Italian]

1376
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,280
Signor Clavel,
[speaking Italian]

1377
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:14,949
<i>Gràzie.</i>
<i>Gràzie.</i>

1378
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:17,384
[speaking Italian]

1379
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:20,587
[no audible dialogue]

1380
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,989
Thanks.

1381
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,025
Thank you, James.

1382
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:26,426
To--
- Our guest of honor,

1383
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:29,196
the great
Kristina Baumgarten.

1384
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,732
The girl I knew when
she was in her teens,

1385
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,735
and who stole
my best friend from me.

1386
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,771
Hey, you knew Siegfried.

1387
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:38,472
He was my best friend.

1388
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,275
I received a letter
from him this morning.

1389
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,544
He insists I stay
and finish the film.

1390
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:46,213
Of course. To Siegfried,
duty before anything else.

1391
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:47,848
Oh, uh,

1392
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:50,584
isn't that the tune
from your last film?

1393
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:51,786
Yes, it is.

1394
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:52,953
You were marvelous.

1395
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:54,955
Well, Sirk is
a great director.

1396
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,824
He's fled to America.
- Why?

1397
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,659
His wife is Jewish.

1398
01:10:01,763 --> 01:10:03,731
I'd like to dance, James.

1399
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,833
James.

1400
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,334
What?

1401
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:08,736
Oh. Oh, yes.

1402
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:09,970
Of course.

1403
01:10:12,974 --> 01:10:15,576
See you later, old chap.

1404
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:22,183
Our first great reception.

1405
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,517
Don't you think?

1406
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:24,618
Mmm.

1407
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:27,188
Kristina should be happy.

1408
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,590
Mmm, she is magnificent.

1409
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:32,226
I'm behind in her pay,

1410
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:35,062
and she told me
not to worry.

1411
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,363
[grunts]

1412
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,836
Excuse me, I have
to interrupt you.

1413
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,637
But the Princess wishes

1414
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:45,639
to have a word
with you, Kristina.

1415
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,241
Princess?

1416
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:53,881
Hell.

1417
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:59,120
Allow me to present
Kristina Baumgarten.

1418
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:01,889
The Princess Domitilla
Giulia Altieri.

1419
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:02,990
Uh--

1420
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,225
You're beautiful.

1421
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:06,526
No wonder my grandson

1422
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,963
has lost his head over you.

1423
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,898
Come with me.

1424
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,600
I want to talk to you.

1425
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:23,477
I must be honest
with you, sir.

1426
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,345
I don't like actors,

1427
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:26,881
especially English ones.

1428
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,015
[laughing]

1429
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,716
I could say
I don't like Germans,

1430
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,951
but I'd be lying.

1431
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:33,720
I mean, there's, what,
Beethoven, Bach,

1432
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,523
Goethe,
Thomas Mann-- Waiter.

1433
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,793
No, it's, uh,

1434
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,796
just the Nazis
I don't like.

1435
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:49,670
We wanted to meet you
to apologize in person

1436
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:52,639
for my grandson's behavior.

1437
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:54,942
He hasn't bothered me
for weeks now.

1438
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,512
Because after the display
in your hotel bedroom,

1439
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:00,815
we had him hospitalized.

1440
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:03,617
Marcantonio's ancestors

1441
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,086
were princes, statesmen,

1442
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:08,455
great soldiers.

1443
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:12,193
It's not easy for him
to live up to their level.

1444
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,493
He's too honorable

1445
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:16,230
to join in
the current rat race.

1446
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:19,533
You don't understand
a thing about me, Grandmother.

1447
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,802
My grandmother
is wrong about me.

1448
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,972
I have no wish to live up to
the history of my ancestors,

1449
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,707
warmongering thieves

1450
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:29,210
and high-class whores.

1451
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:33,647
I fell in love with you
because of your core beauty.

1452
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:35,749
I saw something else in it,

1453
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:38,986
a warmth and vulnerability
only I could see.

1454
01:12:40,088 --> 01:12:42,422
I knew we were soulmates.
[groans]

1455

01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:59,272
The moon

1621
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,808
and the stars there.

1622
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:03,943
Cut.

1623
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,878
Look at his hands.
They are too clean.

1624
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:07,080
More dirt.

1625
01:23:07,147 --> 01:23:09,115
Please, makeup, please.

1626
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:10,850
More dirt on his hands.

[sighing]

1628
01:23:12,386 --> 01:23:16,055
We must live as if it
were forever and ever.

1629
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:19,292
Even if this is
our last night on Earth,

1630
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,295
we must act as if
it is our first,

1631
01:23:22,363 --> 01:23:23,963
and be thankful.

1632
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:33,172
The sun will rise,

1633
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:34,841
and the world will be bathed

1634
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:36,943
in its morning light.

1635
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:39,479
We have to believe that.

1639
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:08,408
All right, it's a wrap.

1640
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:10,176
[cheering, applause]

1641
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:14,381
I'd like to thank everyone
for their magnificent work

1642
01:24:14,448 --> 01:24:16,082
through the whole
of this production,

1643
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,117
particularly,
the last few days.

1644
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:19,952
Now it's over, I can say

1645
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,954
that I didn't think
we could pull it off,

1646
01:24:22,022 --> 01:24:23,122
but we have.

1647
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,824
We've got something
we can be proud of.

1648
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:26,893
Oh, László, László.

1649

1653
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,371
[Daisy]
Jamie,

1654
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:40,807
Are you leaving
for London tomorrow?

1655
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:42,409
Yeah.
I'm going by Luce

1656
01:24:42,476 --> 01:24:43,610
and picking up
transport there.

1657
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:46,045
Would you mind if I tagged along?
- No.

1658
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:48,247
There are no plane
or train reservations left

1659
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,616
till Thursday.

1660
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:52,619
And I've got a gut feeling
that, you know,

1661
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,654
the sooner we Brits
clear out, the better.

1662
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,656
Well, welcome aboard,
Daisy.

1663
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,991
You did a marvelous job
on this film, László.

1664
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:00,993
Thanks. That means
a lot to me.

1665
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,995
You know, I'm catching
a train to Switzerland

1666
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:04,263
first thing in the morning.

1667
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:06,633
You left it bloody late,
Davide. You know that?

1668
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:08,034
Yes, I know, I know.

1669
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:10,937
But I wanted to see the end of the film.
- I know.

1670
01:25:11,004 --> 01:25:14,774
People like us have celluloid
for blood and brains.

1671
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:17,677
We risk our lives
for just one more shot.

1672
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,614
Well done.

1673
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:22,982
[exhales]

1674
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:29,121
So it's all over.

1675
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:30,757
[chuckling]
Yes.

1676
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:33,760
Uh, frankly, I'm amazed
they got this far.

1677
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,094
Well, it was worth it.

1678
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:37,964
I hope so.

1679
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:40,467
God, look at
all these people.

1680
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:41,801
So close for months,

1681
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:43,803
never
see each other again.

1682
01:25:49,076 --> 01:25:51,944
Don't leave me alone
tonight, James.

1683
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,082
[chuckles]

1684

[sighing]

1685
01:26:02,155 --> 01:26:03,423
No.

1686
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,893
It's too late
for us, Kristina.

1687
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,327
We'll be far away
tomorrow.

1688
01:26:10,564 --> 01:26:13,500
I don't care
what happens tomorrow.

1689
01:26:38,058 --> 01:26:39,458
Who's there?

1690
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:40,960
[Renzo]
Davide, where have you been?

1691
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:42,495
What are you doing?

1692
01:26:42,563 --> 01:26:44,196
I'm just taking
a last look around.

1693
01:26:44,264 --> 01:26:45,431
Who knows when I'll be

1694
01:26:45,499 --> 01:26:48,467
inside
a film studio again.

1695
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:51,437
[laughing]

1696
01:26:51,505 --> 01:26:52,972
It's all make-believe.

1697
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,808
Maybe that's why I love it.

1698
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:58,310
The outside world
is so rotten.

1699
01:26:58,378 --> 01:27:00,513
In here,
it's so much better.

1700
01:27:00,581 --> 01:27:02,281
Davide, you have
an early start--

1701
01:27:02,349 --> 01:27:06,686
No. This is where I'm going
to spend my last night.

1702
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:11,591
I will stay with you,
if you like.

1703
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,427
They showed <i>Ben-Hur</i> here.

1704
01:27:14,494 --> 01:27:16,930
Henry Wilcoxon
and Ramon Novarro.

1705
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:18,531
He was a homosexual too, no?

1706
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:20,332
Was he? Good for him.

1707
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,670
You know, this studio
did all the big epics.

1708
01:27:23,737 --> 01:27:26,539
The wonder of the movies
is in here.

1709
01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:29,341
Look up here,

All in their proper places.

Good.

01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:06,498
Is that all, sir?

Yes. Come back
in five minutes.

It's going to be a day
of parades and rallies.

Uh, you don't have to.

I think the scene will
play better if you don't cry.

1746

The audience will know
you want to cry.

1747

I will know you want to cry.

Carriage number 5.

01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:32,498
I prefer the front.

1792
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,669
I've never been
to Switzerland or Milan.

1793
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:38,971
Renzo, I'm sorry I can't
bring you with me,

1794
01:34:39,038 --> 01:34:41,240
but it's too dangerous.

1795
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:44,076
I don't know
where I'll end up.

1796
01:34:44,144 --> 01:34:46,379
I know.

Oh, yes.

You must be proud.

1805
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,391
He is very handsome.

Yes.

Yes, he is.

Please come with us.
