the flag up there soon,

is, we all share
General Vandergrift's feeling.

410
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,530
Everybody's asking,
"Where's the Navy?"

411
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,169
Anyone else care to speak?

412
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,207
You painted
a black picture, gentlemen.

413
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,944
It's black, all right,

414
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,782
but it can get
a hell of a lot blacker.

415
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,853
Less than a year ago we were
clobbered at Pearl Harbor

416

pushing us back ever since.

to stop them going all
the way down to Australia.

420

They'll cut
our lines of communication,

421
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,875
they'll cut
our lines of supply,

422
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,981
the war could be
prolonged for years. Or worse.

423
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,420
Guadalcanal is our
last chance.

424
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,059
I promise you
everything I've got.

425
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,327
The Navy will be there.

426
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,531
I'll get you more
air support

427
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,533
and I'll step up
your supplies.

428
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,603
But, Admiral, even if I could
scrape up enough supply ships,

429
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,573
every time there's an
air alert they have to
quit unloading and pull out.

430
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,075

<i>OFFICER ON PA: Now hear this.</i>
<i>Call away number one,</i>
<i>motor whaleboat.</i>

438
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,103
Well, you sure
made them feel better.

439
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:39,277
Admiral, where you gonna get
all that stuff you promised?

440
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,118
I don't know.

441
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,121
(BELL RINGING)

442
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,363
Now, where can
I lay my hands
on some ground troops

443
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,998
and get them
to Guadalcanal?

444
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,601
I'm afraid the bottom
of the barrel has already
been scraped bare, sir,

445
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,470
by Admiral Ghormley.

446
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,638
Are you sure?

447
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,543
What about this proposed
airstrip at in the Dai,

448
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,379
and the Army ground troops
we're sending in to build it?

449
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,648
They're committed.
They're on their way.

450
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,451
Why can't we divert them
to the island, tonight?

451
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,653
But, Admiral,
there's a specific
directive.

452
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,990
But we are faced
with one hell
of an emergency.

453
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,492
The airstrip
isn't that essential.

454
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,728
It's 205 miles
closer to Henderson
than any we've got, sir.

455
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,131
So we increase
our air search area
205 miles.

456
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,802
But that does not save
25,000 men on Guadalcanal.

457
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,138
Admiral, by the time
we went through channels
to try to change...

458
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,340
There won't be time
for channels.

459
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,242
I tell you,
unless we move now,

460
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,711
there won't be any need
for that airstrip.

461
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,213
And, Harry, there's only
one thing to do,

462
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,983
intercept those ground troops
and send them where
they'll do the most good.

463
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,019
And ignore
the directive?
We can argue with them later.

464
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,754
But, Admiral,
we can't do that.

465
00:35:56,787 --> 00:36:01,559
I think we'd be entirely wrong
to take such a decision
into our own hands.

466
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,763
Is that your best judgment?
It's my frank opinion, sir.

467
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,498
Are you prepared
for the consequences?

468
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,666
I am, sir.

469
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,837
I mean the consequences
of losing Guadalcanal?

470
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,940
Or are you concerned with
repercussions from topside?

471
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,543
It isn't just a matter of
repercussions, sir,

472
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,012
I think it would be fairer
to say, that I believe
that these things

473
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,613
have to be
properly coordinated.

474
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,425
I'm afraid you'll have to
leave that one to me, Harry.

475
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,896
Issue the necessary orders,
and advise Harmon,
Patch and Vandergrift.

476
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,599
Aye, aye, sir.

477
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,470
Harry?
Sir.

478
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,474
Ask Pulaski
to come in, please.

479
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,145
Yes, sir.

480
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,049
MALE VOICE: You know,
I missed that shot.

481
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,218
Lieutenant Pulaski,
the Admiral wants
to see you.

482
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,586
Thank you.

483
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,590
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

484
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,857
Come in.

485
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,596
Have a seat, Mike.

486
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,332
Quite a bunch out there
still waiting to see you,
sir.

487
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,600
I know.

488
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,769
The pieces beginning to
fit together?

489
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,805
Little by little.

490
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,475
Mike, just how good
is our Intelligence?

491
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,646
Well, the Polynesians resent
the Japs, so they help us.

492
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,581
Missionaries
and Australian coast-watchers

493
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,817
in hiding
along the Solomon's chain

494
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,288
tip us to Jap ships coming
down the slot and air raids.

495
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,258
I've got two men with radios,
here on Rendova.

496
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,261
One in the Shortland's,
and several, here,
in the Russell's.

497
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,962
That's right under
the Japs' noses.

498
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,531
How do they evade
capture?
Some don't.

499
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,702
I see.

500
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,772
Mike, they tell me you're
an expert on the Orient.

501
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,109
Not an expert.
Spent some
years in Japan.

502
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,345
Speak the language,
know most of their
leaders personally.

503
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,781
Tojo, Nomura,
Admiral Yamamoto...

504
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,516
What can you tell me
about Yamamoto?

505
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,453
He's the best they've got.
A fine tactician,
a brilliant strategist,

506
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,989
he commands the
fanatical loyalty of his men.

507
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,625
I understand that
when his fliers
are downed in the water,

508
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,893
they don't even
expect to be picked up.

509
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,161
That's right, sir.

510
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,398
They know he won't
spare planes for rescue.

511
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,800
Nice, very nice.

512
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,301
If you'd like
a personal note, sir,

513
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,470
I can tell you
he's quite a poker player.

514
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,372
You've played with him?
Many times.

515
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,974
When he was naval attache
in Washington.

516
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,176
And he was rough?
Very.

517
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,979
Consistently overplayed
his hand and got away with it.

518
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,349
I hear that he's hot
for naval aviation
and carriers.

519
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,984
That's right, sir.

520
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,887
I guess you know
the part he
played at Pearl?

521
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,225
Just that he was there.
He was there all right.

522
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,827
We recently learned that
it was Yamamoto

523
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,364
who planned and directed
the attack on Pearl Harbor.

524
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,934
Actually Yamamoto
was against war
with the United States.

525
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,071
He predicted that in the end
Japan would lose.

526
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,173
However once the higher-ups
overruled him,

527
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,909
he threw himself
wholeheartedly
into the effort.

528
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,278
Pearl Harbor was
his first assignment.

529
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,580
And it could've been
my last assignment.

530
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,016
If it hadn't been
for engine trouble at sea,

531
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:16,354
I'd of been caught in
the harbor with the rest
of those poor devils.

532
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,089
Well, thanks, Mike.

533
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,025
It'll be your job from
now on to read
Yamamoto's mind for me.

534
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,427
I'll do my best, sir.
I'm sure you will.

535
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,399
Are your whizz kids
making any headway
with the Japanese code?

536
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,067
Some.

537
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,569
Light a fire under them,
will you?

538
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,637
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.

539
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306
And send Andy in, please.
Yes, sir.

540
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,217
You wanted to see me,
sir?

541
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,085
Who else is waiting
out there?
Well, now, let me see.

542
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,388
There's that freighter
captain you sent for.

543
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,089
Three newspaper
correspondents,

544
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,425
a psychological
warfare officer...

545
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,993
(YAWNS)

546
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,829
A psychological
warfare officer
just in from the States.

547
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,732
Am I keeping you up?
No, sir.

548
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,567
Who else is there?
Doc Key for one.

549
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,303
He says if you don't
see him next, he's gonna
bust in here anyway.

550
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,005
Call him.
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,508
Doc, come on in.

552
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,745
Good evening, Doc.

553
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,181
Good morning might be
closer to it, sir.

554
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,483
Does the Admiral
realize he's been
cooped up in this office

555
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,254
seeing person after
person for 16
consecutive hours?

556
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,588
Is that a record?

557
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,323
No, sir,
it isn't a record,

558
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,626
if you'll pardon
my saying so,
it isn't very smart.

559
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,762
As your chief flight
surgeon, I must insist
that you get more rest.

560
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,266
They tell me there are
men on Guadalcanal
who haven't slept in days.

561
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,268
Yes, sir. But they're
not 60 years old,

562
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,137
and they're not fresh
out of a hospital.

563
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,439
Just give me
one more hour.
No, sir.

564
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,342
As long as I'm here,
there's something else
I might as well attend to.

565
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,644
What's that for?
What're you gonna do?

566
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,380
Your shots, sir.
What do I need
those for?

567
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,817
There's no telling
what you'll run
into on Guadalcanal.

568
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,719
How did you know
I was going up there?

569
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,222
I have friends
in high places.

570
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,224
You tell him?
No, sir.

571
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,859
You know me
better than that.

572
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,227
All right, if you'll just
roll up your sleeve, sir.

573
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,995
Now, wait a minute.

574
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,400
You put that ice pick away
and we'll make a deal.

575
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,869
We're not leaving
until tomorrow afternoon,

576
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,405
you can give me
the shots just
before lunch.

577
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,874
Oh, no.
I won't see
anybody else tonight.

578
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,344
I'll have Andy
clear off the office
and I'll go right to bed.

579
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,481
All right, sir.
It's a deal.

580
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,550
Andy, will you explain the
situation to the people
outside and turn in.

581
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,352
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Admiral.

582
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,720
Goodnight.

583
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,860
I thought we were taking off
to Guadalcanal at dawn.

584
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,362
We are.
Well, you just told Doc...

585
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,400
Oh, now, sir,

What's the procedure?

737
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,091
The nearest shelter
until the "All Clear."

738
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,196
And leave here
for a hole in the ground?

739
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,032
I recommend it.

740

HALSEY: Well, no thanks.

741

PULASKI: A patrol plane
has spotted an enemy fleet
sailing south from Truk,

01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,158
four carriers,
four battleships,
eighteen cruisers.

822
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:34,030
In addition, we have coast
watcher reports of Japanese
transports and auxiliaries,

823
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,467
plus cruiser escort,
moving down the Slot
from Rabul.

824
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,202
Looks like
the start.
Yes, sir.

825
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,904
I don't get it.
How can Yamamoto
launch an attack

826
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,640
while we still have
land based air
on Guadalcanal?

827
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,678
He's anticipating.
By the time his fleet
moves down to this point,

828
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,981
he assumes
he'll have Henderson Field.

829
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,484
That means Vandergrift
can look forward
to increased pressure.

830
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:58,755
And we can look forward
to the 25th or the 26th
at the outside,

831
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,356
being Zero day.

832
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,194
What's the matter, Frank?

833
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,431
I guess I didn't expect
them to try anything
like this so soon.

834
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,233
Neither did I.

835
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:14,704
We have lost the initiative
for the moment,
but I propose to get it back.

836
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,707
The
<i>Hornet</i>
 and
the
<i>Enterprise</i>

the first punch.

837
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,276
Two carriers against
his whole fleet?
Umm-hmm.

838
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,677
That's it, exactly.

839
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,048
Don't forget,
he doesn't know where
our carriers are.

840
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,682
And the trick will be
to keep him guessing.

841
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,017
It could work.

842
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,920
If Kincaid and Murray
made a wide sweep

843

east of
the Santa Cruz Islands,
beyond their search range,

844
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,360
and then cut back in time,
our carriers could
hit them coming in.

845
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:42,198
Meanwhile we give
Guadalcanal close support
with our cruiser task force.

What do you think,
Mike?

847
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,134
One thing's sure,
Admiral.

848
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,538
He'll never expect
you to come out
looking for him.

849
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,807
There's an old saying,

850
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,446
"No Captain can do very wrong
if he places his ship
alongside that of an enemy."

851
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,118
Well, that'll
hold you
for six months.

852
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,587
Let me have
the alcohol,
will you?

853
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,191
Well, Andy,

854
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,229

roll up your sleeve...

857
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,236
No, better set up

Come in, Andy.

862
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,688

of the

863
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,357

to steal a member
of my staff

864
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,960
for one of his fighter

No, sir.

You been doing
a little politicking?
Sir?

867
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,267
He asked for you
by name.

868
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,602
Oh, oh,
is that a fact?

869
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,936
Yes, that's a fact.

870
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,671
Well, sir,
I'd certainly
hate to leave you,

871
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,207
but if Captain Bailey
really needs me,
why I'm willing to go.

872
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,375
I'll bet you are,

873
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,177
I hear the big "E's"
gonna see action
in three days.

874
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,679
And if you're not
there, you're gonna
be heart-broken.

875
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,348
Yes, sir.

876
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,184
Well, you'll get
your crack
at combat, Andy.

877
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,620
But right now,
I don't think much
of your timing.

878
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,723
But, sir, what...
What purpose
do I serve here?

879
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,893
Well, unfortunately
I'm used to you.

880
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,829
Well, sir, if...
If that's all, I...

881
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,465
Oh, all right,
all right, all right,

882
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,401
on second thought,
you've been a pretty
sorry excuse for an aide,

883
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,737
so Captain Bailey
can have you.

884
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,639
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

885
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,740
Go on,
get out of here.

886
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,575
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.

887
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:36,512
Oh... Sir, I...
I wondered if...

888
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,081
If I could ask
a special favor.

889
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,583
Yes, sure, Andy.

890
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,186
Well, sir, I realize
I haven't been the world's
best aide, in many ways

891
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,722
I've slipped up on my duty,
but, sir, my conscience
would be a mite clearer

892
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:51,827
if I could leave here knowing
that I had at least performed
one part of my assignment.

893
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,296
What's that?

894
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:59,402
Well, sir,
it was my duty to see
that you got your shots.

895
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,211
Is this in the nature
of one last request?

896
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,379
Well, it's a...

897
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,216
All right.

898
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,519
Get Doc Key.

899
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,222
Yes, sir. Aye, aye, sir.

900
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,694
I'm going after Doc Key.
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

901
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,295
If anybody wants me,
I've gone for Doc Key.

902
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,865
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

903
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,334
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

904
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,375
I never saw so much
commotion about
a couple of shots.

905
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,744
Not just a couple,
Admiral. Five.

906
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,780
Five?
Five, sir.

907
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,049
Watch out for
the hook, sir.

908
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,417
(ALL LAUGH)

909
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,322
Very funny. Very funny.

910
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,825
Here comes number 1.

911
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,833
DR. KEY: Now,
here comes number 2.

912
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,707
This'll be number three.

large carrier

Issue these orders
to all task force
commanders immediately.

925
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,981
Is this all, sir?

926
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,182
That's all.

927
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,484
Yes, sir.

928

<i>to the victory.</i>

941
01:07:56,939 --> 01:08:00,743
We lost the
<i>Hornet.</i>
They damaged
the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

942
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:04,146
We lost 283 men,
killed or missing.

943
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:09,452
Aircraft,
they lost a minimum
of a hundred.

944
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:15,458
Against that,
our carrier plane losses,
from all causes, were 74.

945
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,029
That it?
That's it, sir.

946
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,466
Any discussion?

947
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,068
Harry?

948
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,538
What's there to say,
sir?

949
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,608
We got the
short end
of the stick.

950
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,811
Tactically, yes.
Strategically, no.

951
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,914
But we lost
the
<i>Hornet,</i>
 sir.

952
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,151
What was our objective?

953
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:47,289
To hang on to Guadalcanal.

954
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:51,894
I'm calling your attention
to the fact that the Marines
are still doing just that.

955
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,197
Yes, sir,
but the Japanese fleet
is still in the area.

956
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,799
We're wide open.

957
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,467
Harry's right, sir.

958
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:02,171
If they follow up today,
we have nothing
to stop them with.

959
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:03,873
Sir...

960
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,009
Go on.

961
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,145
I think it's up to
the Staff to recommend
emergency measures

962
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,382
in the event we're forced
to evacuate Guadalcanal.

963
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,354
You feel that way?

964
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:26,562
It's true
that if the Japs
follow up today,

965
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,866
and their fleet keeps
coming down the slot,

966
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,536
we can't stop them.

967
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:38,340
But I don't think
they'll do that.

968
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,178
With a hundred planes
and pilots lost,

969
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:46,015
the air groups
aboard those Jap carriers
have been cut to pieces.

970
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,951
And why should they
come further south

971
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:52,688
to place themselves
under land-based air attack?

972
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,991
And a second thing,
in our favor,
the record.

973
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,527
Ever since Pearl Harbor,

974
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:02,798
the Japs have
consistently failed
to follow up an advance.

975
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:07,603
I'm gambling that
they won't break the habit.

976
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,372
We could still arrange
evacuation measures
for insurance.

977
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,374
No. No.

978
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:16,378
If they pick up the hint
that we're even
contemplating evacuation,

979
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,782
they'll be down here
like vultures.

980
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,718
In other words,
we lash down
the safety valves.

981
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,420
We lash them down.

982
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:30,159
I want all the senior
commanders
of the services

983
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:34,897
to pool their
mechanics in an
emergency repair force

984
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,634
and work around the clock
to restore ship damage,

985
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,870
particularly the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

986
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:49,278
Well, as far as
I'm concerned, gentlemen,
the battle was a stand-off.

987
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,348
Just when we needed one.

988

A fellow by the name
of Cerella.

999

Dead?

1000

He's missing.
Same difference.

1001
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:21,537
Well, now I wouldn't
say that.
Well, I would.

1002

quite a few extra bunks
on the

 tonight.

1003
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,218
Yeah, quite a few.

1004
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,787
Did he have a family.
Huh?

1005
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,557
The man who used
to bunk up there,
did he have a family?

No, no.

Help yourself.

01:12:56,472 --> 01:13:00,375
I... I didn't get
your name.

1010
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,745
Roy Webb.
Oh, yeah.

Aren't you
Squadron Commander
of the F-11?

I won't be
when I finish this.

1013

squadron today.

1014

One half of an
entire squadron.

1015
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,792
Nine planes. Nine men.

1016
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,797
Making out
a strike report?

1017
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,599
No.

1018
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,935
From the look on your face,
I figure it's no love letter.

1019
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:30,139
I'm asking to be
relieved of command.

1020
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,709
Oh, well,
sooner or later we all
need a rest from flying.

1021
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,346
Well, I don't need
a rest from flying.

1022
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,481
I'll fly combat
again tomorrow.

1023
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:42,918
I just do not want
to command.

1024
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:46,488
I lost some guys today.
We all did.
It wasn't your fault.

1025
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,357
Now how can you tell?

1026
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,462
You know, my mother
said to me once,

1027
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:57,199
she said, "Never make
an important decision
when I was tired."

1028
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,136
I found that to be
a good piece of advice.

1029
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,572
I know what I'm doing.

Yes, sir,
she brought us home.

1032

We've fixed most of
the leaks
in the oil tanks,

1033
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,463
but the damage
to the forward
elevator's pretty bad.

1034
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,964
Admiral.

1035
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,033
Andy.
How are you?

1036
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,301
Very good, sir.

1037
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,402
Good evening, sir.
Evening.

1038
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,671
Congratulations
on those two Zeros.
Thank you.

1039
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,674
He splashed
three of them, sir.

1040
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,509
If you'll excuse me,
Admiral.
Certainly.

1041
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,578
Keep after them, Bill.

1042
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:46,415
Well, I hear your relief
is showing up.

1043
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,485
Maybe you can tell me
something about
a Commander Roy Webb?

1044
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,053
Oh, yes sir.
He's...

1045
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,689
He's Squadron Commander
on the
<i>Hornet.</i>

1046
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,325
Would he fit in?

1047
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,327
Well, he'd make
an okay pilot for you, sir.

1048
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,129
He's...
He's experienced,
he's available.

1049
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,867
We need Squadron
Commanders.

1050
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,902
Why is he available?

1051
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,473
Well, right at this time,
the pilots on the
<i>Hornet</i>
have no ship, sir.

1052
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,510
They'll be reassigned,
though.

1053
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:19,214
Andy, I'd like
a straight answer.

1054
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,953
Well, the fact is,
Admiral, Webb asked
to be detached.

1055
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:28,056
Said he was unfit
for command.

1056
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:30,859
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1057
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,160
Come in.

1058
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,198
Lieutenant Commander Webb
to see you, sir.

1059
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,633
Send him in.

1060
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,241
Webb?
Sir.

1061
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,380
I need an aide
who can double
as my pilot.

1062
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,817
Your name has been
submitted. How do you
feel about the job?

1063
01:15:55,851 --> 01:16:00,422
I'd be honored, sir.
Frankly, I think
I belong in combat.

1064
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,292
Well, according to this,
you asked to be relieved.

1065
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,028
Only from command, sir.
Not from combat.

1066
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,432
I've looked at your record,
it's a good one.

1067
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,867
Navy Cross.

1068
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,938
Every job they gave you,
you did well.

1069
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,740
What happened?

1070
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,443
Sir, I just can't give
any more orders.

1071
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,979
Well, you've been
cutting it all right.

1072
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,181
As a Squadron Commander,
yes, sir.

1073
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,583
Now I'm Senior.

1074
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,484
The Air Group Commander
is in the hospital.

1075
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,487
If he doesn't get well,
I'll be next in line
for his job.

1076
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,456
You don't want
the responsibility?

1077
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,791
No, sir.

1078
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,960
That's normal.

1079
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,129
Sir, I don't think
you have the whole...
Sit down.

1080
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,737
I can think of
some wonderful speeches
I could make right now.

1081
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:53,442
Probably have
both of us in tears.

1082
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,878
But I just don't
have the time for
such performances.

1083
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,914
Webb...

1084
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,452
Where do you think our
group commanders come from?

1085
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:07,623
I don't know, sir.
All I do know is that
I'm not the man for the job.

1086
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,158
You think the job requires
a great man?

1087
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,528
Yes, sir.
Well, I have news for you.

1088
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,397
There aren't any great men.

1089
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,698
There are just
great challenges

1090
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,800
that ordinary men
like you and me

1091
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,870
are forced
by circumstances to meet.

1092
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,507
Now, you've proved
you can get the job done.

1093
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,076
You're hooked
by your own record.

1094
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,147
In short,
you don't have any choice.

1095
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,616
Sir, I lost
nine planes yesterday.

1096
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:42,657
I lost those same
nine planes
and 17 others to boot,

1097
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:47,896
plus one destroyer,
two submarines
with all hands,

1098
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:52,868
two LST's, and God knows
how many ground troops.

1099
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,903
Do you want me to go on?

1100
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,440
No, sir.

1101
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,746
I guess I... I just had
the feeling I was alone.

1102
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,419
You were,
and you will be.

1103
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,291
Good luck, Roy.
Thank you, sir.

1104
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,932
You better
step on it, Frank.
The boat's waiting

1105
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,367
and the old man's
raring to go.

1106
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,702
What do you mean?
It's your turn today,

1107
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:30,238
I swam a mile
with him Tuesday.
It's Murphy's turn.

1108
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,573
Murphy's pulling OD.

1109
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,209
So that makes it
your turn.

1110
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,578
Look, I'm still
waterlogged
from Tuesday.

1111
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,613
The Chaplain's
right down the way.

1112
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,717
Doc, couldn't you
take him today?

1113
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,819
Well,
for a consideration.

1114

of scotch?

1118
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:16,685
Nice work, Doc.
Nice work.

1119
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,253
Where's the old man?

1120
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,355
Well, he's half way
to Japan the last time
I saw him

1121
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,257
and still going
strong.

1122
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:26,428
I said to him,
"Admiral, I think
we've gone far enough.

1123
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,763
"I think it's time
we turned around
and went back."

1124
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,966
He said, "Is that
a medical opinion?"

1125
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,634
I said, "No, sir.

1126
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,937
"It's just the opinion
of a drowning man."

1127
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,105
Doc, I'll make
a deal with you.

1128
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,707
You give me back
my fifth of Scotch,

1129
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,609
I'll give you
some artificial
respiration.

1130
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,612
He's coming in now.
Look at him
kick and splash.

1131
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,348
I wouldn't be
surprised if
he's part walrus.

1132
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,682
I'll tell you
one thing,

1133
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,218
I go with him again,
it's gonna be in
a row boat.

sir?

for what ails you.

1137
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,000

forced to testify
against himself, sir.

will be back, Mike?

1177
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,187
should shape up
as follows.

1178
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,958
Kelly Turner's transports
should be finished
unloading by nightfall.

1179
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,959
That will free
his escort
to move here

1180
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,463
South of Savo Island,
to reinforce
Scott and Callaghan

1181
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,399
if a night action
should develop.

1182
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:55,670
Callaghan's cruiser force
and Scott's cruiser force
will be here.

1183
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,842
Kincaid's force
of battleships
and heavy cruisers

1184
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:04,045
will have escorted
the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 to within
flying range of the enemy,

1185
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,314
about a hundred
or so miles
to the south,

1186
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,217
depending on
when the
<i>Enterprise</i>
is ready to sail.

1187
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,486
I just talked to Bailey,
sir.

1188
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,054
Repairs on
the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 definitely

1189
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,256
will not be
completed on time.

1190
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,492
Then she'll have to
sail as is.

1191
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,027
Half a carrier
is better than none.

1192
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,363
HARRY: Admiral,

1193
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,498
Frank has been going
round and round
with me on this,

1194
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,735
he feels very
strongly that...
Sir...

1195
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,870
Is the plan still open
for discussion?

1196
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:29,938
Certainly.

1197
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,041
Sir, following
the last engagement,

1198
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:37,212
you correctly estimated
that their fleet
would withdraw.

1199
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,749
The rest of us were
a little wrong
about that one.

1200
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,551
This time we know
they're coming all the way.

1201
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,420
And if we lose this one,

1202
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:48,356
Guadalcanal is going
to be another Bataan.

1203
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,459
Impossible to reinforce,
impossible to relieve.

1204
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,730
Vandergrift will wind up
another Wainwright.

1205
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,032
If we lose.

1206
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,468
Well, before we send
Callaghan and Scott

1207
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,871
into those narrow waters,
Admiral,

1208
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,939
let's see what we've got.

1209
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,742
Three cruisers,
a handful of destroyers.

1210
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,645
Now, let's take a look at
what they've got.

1211
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,048
The latest estimate
shows that they'll
have four battleships,

1212
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,484
five heavy cruisers,
two carriers,

1213
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,487
and about
30 destroyers.

1214
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,589
The least we can do
is detach Lee's battleships

1215
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,159
from the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 and
send them on ahead to help.

1216
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,228
The battleships will have to
protect our one carrier

1217
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,798
till she gets within range.

1218
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,099
I may detach them later.

1219
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,569
Well, sir, how long can three
cruisers and a few destroyers

1220
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,338
delay a force
more than twice their size?

1221
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,409
Dan Callaghan
and Norm Scott...

1222
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,744
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1223
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,012
Come in.

1224
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,984
Admiral Callaghan
and Admiral Scott
are here, sir.

1225
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,957
Send them in.
Aye, aye, sir.

1226
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:03,898
Good evening, sir.
Dan. Norm.

1227
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,102
You know
Harry Black?

1228
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,770
Frank Enright.
Gentlemen.

1229
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:11,172
Mike Pulaski.
How are you,
gentlemen?

1230
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,641
I won't
keep you long.

1231
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:16,845
I just wanted to
wish you good luck
before you shoved off.

1232
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:19,881
We'll probably need
a little luck, sir.

1233
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,916
Looks like
a real brawl.

1234
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,286
I wish I could
change places
with you two.

1235
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,555
We know you do,
sir.

1236
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,724
I don't look for
a carrier action this time.

1237
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,026
I think it'll be
a surface battle.

1238
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,328
Guns and torpedoes.

1239
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,464
Like Norm said,
a brawl.

1240
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:39,734
And you can count on a real
loud rooting section up there.

1241
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,003
Archie Vandergrift
and his Gyrenes.

1242
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:45,406
Sir, we can't promise
Archie the Jap fleet
won't get through.

1243
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,809
But if it does,
Norm and I guarantee

1244
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:51,079
there won't be much left
afloat behind it.

1245
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,581
Is that what you
had in mind, sir?

1246
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,619
All I know is,
the job is in the right hands.

1247
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,954
Thank you, sir.

1248
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:02,690
BLACK: Goodbye, sir.
ENRIGHT: Good luck.

1249
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:05,059
Good luck.
Goodnight, gentlemen.

1250
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,198
Captain Black, sir?

1251
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,102
No word?

1252
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,139
No word.

1253
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:29,017
Sir, there's something
I better tell you.

1254
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:33,621
We've been waiting
for word on a float plane
overdue on a hop to Efate.

1255
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:39,894
Your son is one
of the passengers.

1256
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:59,480
HARRY: I'm going to
set up a special search.

1257
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:02,016
No, no.

1258
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,454
You will conduct
a routine search.

1259
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:10,458
Thorough, but routine.

1260
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,927
HARRY: Very well, sir.

1261

<i>NARRATOR: 1,500 miles</i>

1262

Come in.

1328
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:57,638
Sorry to disturb you, sir,
but I've got one or two...

1329
01:32:57,672 --> 01:33:01,108
All right,
let's have it, Harry.

1330
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,412
These are for signature,
and this batch I thought
I could take care of myself

1331
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:05,646
with one or two
exceptions.

1332
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,114
Oh, Pearl has asked
for another report.

1333
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,183
Any word?
No, sir.

1334
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:11,819
No contact?
None reported, sir.

1335
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:14,622
There should've been
a contact at 2300

1336
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,691
if they'd maintained
course and speed.

1337
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,695
Well, that last sighting
report may have been
inaccurate, sir.

1338
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,463
We had trouble
with communications.

1339
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:24,932
We were guessing
at some of the figures.

1340
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:28,436
Harry, will you tell me
what the hell they want with
all these damn statistics?

1341
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:31,005
Your signature goes
right there, sir.

1342
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:36,711
Who has the duty
in the Com office?

1343
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:38,279
Murphy's the
duty officer, sir.

1344
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:41,816
And his orders are to get
all the dope up to us pronto.

1345
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:44,819
One more, sir.
Thanks.

1346
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:58,299
Is there any
hot coffee out there?

1347
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:00,568
I'll send Manuel
right in, sir.

No cake.

Oh, Harry, you said
something this afternoon
about a dispatch from Pearl.

1373
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,156
On the problem of
unloading.
What was that?

1374
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,624
Oh, yes sir.

1375
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:06,694
Here it is.

1376
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:09,597
"Delay in unloading ships
at Noumea is alarming.

1377
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,966
"It is noted that some ships
have been at Noumea harbor

1378
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:14,935
"waiting to be unloaded
for three months.

1379
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:16,604
"We unload ships
at San Francisco

1380
01:36:16,637 --> 01:36:18,239

Now that's mighty damn
smart of them.

1382
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,982
You send them a message.

1383
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:32,286
Tell them if they'll give us
the unloading facilities
they have at San Francisco,

1384
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,455
we'll unload a ship

1385
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,123
Shall I hold that

1386
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:37,458
No, send it.

1387
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:40,327
The Admiral might
change his mind.

1388
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:44,064
That's the second time
somebody has said that
to me tonight.

1389
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:46,600
Change my mind.

1390
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:53,174
Yeah, you're right,
I might do just that.

1391
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:59,980
You don't change your mind,

1392
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:03,350
although I know some minds
that could stand changing.

1393
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:07,021
And I won't
exclude my own.

1394
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:13,994
You change the direction
in which you're going.

1395
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:16,197
You don't change your mind.

1396
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:19,667
As you go along
and get higher up

1397
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:23,671
in this organization
or any organization,

1398
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:28,042
each time you change
direction you take more...
More people with you.

1399
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:33,480
More of your fellow men.

1400
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:38,519
It'd be a whole lot easier
if you could go alone,
wouldn't it, Harry?

1401
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:39,820
Yes, sir.

1402
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:44,792
But I...
I don't suppose

1403
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:48,929
anybody ever goes
completely alone,
do you?

1404
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:51,398
Sir?

1405
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:56,904
There aren't very many things
you can really count on,

1406
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:58,305
not really.

1407
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:02,243
I recall a fellow,
end of a long life,

1408
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:04,912
who said he learned
only three things.

1409
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:07,481
He said,

1410
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:10,784
"I believe it's better
to tell the truth than to lie.

1411
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:16,257
"I believe it's better to know
than to be ignorant.

1412
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:21,595
"I believe it's better
to be free

1413
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:24,832
"than to be a slave."

01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:32,706

Yes, sir.

your son and his crew

is still very young, sir.

Just one more.

1457
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:36,483
They're giving me
another star.

Sets of four stars
are in short supply,
hereabouts, sir.

I had a machinist mate
fix up a homemade pair.

1460
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,659
A machinist mate?
Yes, sir.

Well that's...
That's very nice.

Tomorrow?
Yes, sir.

to do me a favor?

What's that, sir?

personally

01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,240
with the message,

1472
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:37,144
that their husbands
earned me my new stars.

1473
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:38,946
Yes, sir.

1474
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:42,115
May I add
my warmest
congratulations, Admiral?

1475
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:46,386
Not only on the promotion,
but on the turn of events
at Guadalcanal.

1476
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,723
Even Frank Enright thinks
we may have them licked.

1477
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,291
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1478
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:05,572
Yamamoto doesn't seem
to know
that he's licked.

1479
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:09,409
The rest of their force
is continuing down
the Slot on schedule.

1480
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:12,879
Herding 20 transports
loaded with
invasion troops.

1481
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:16,850
According to the book,
we don't send battleships

1482
01:44:16,883 --> 01:44:20,320
into waters
as narrow as those,
especially at night.

1483
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:23,657
Forget the book?
Forget the book.

1484
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,259
Detach Admiral Lee's
force from the
<i>Enterprise</i>
and send it ahead tonight.

1485
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:27,427
Yes, sir.

1486
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:28,962
HALSEY: The
<i>Enterprise</i>
planes can
follow up tomorrow.

1487
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:30,297
Yes, sir.

1488
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:34,001
May I see the Admiral?

1489
01:44:34,034 --> 01:44:35,702
What is it, Mike?

1490
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,315
We've broken
the Jap code.

1491
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:51,284
Yes, sir.
That was intercepted
from the Shortlands area.

1492
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:54,321
Yamamoto's plane
is due to land
at the Jap air base in Kahili

1493
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,556
at 11:35 on the 18th.

1494
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,959
We've hit the Jackpot.
You think so?

1495
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:01,528
Admiral, this was
made to order.

1496
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:03,463
That's what bothers me.

1497
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:06,266
HARRY: Admiral Lee
has been notified, sir.

1498
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,536
A chance to
get Yamamoto.

1499
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:12,205
Not only Yamamoto
but his whole Staff.

1500
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:16,643
About 750 miles.

1501
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:17,911
That's out of range
for anything we've got,

1502
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:20,347
but the Army P-38's
could make it.

1503
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:26,420
We break the Jap code
at just the right minute.

1504
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:33,694
Then this message falls
into our lap
at just the right minute.

1505
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:39,700
How do we know
this isn't a trap?

1506
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,268
We don't, sir.

1507
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:45,338
On the other hand,
if it is a trap,

1508
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:48,709
wouldn't they go
about it a little
more subtly?

1509
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:51,378
Washington leaves that
up to you, sir.

1510
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,948
Advise
Archie Vandergrift
and Geiger

1511
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:56,516
I'm leaving
for Guadalcanal now.

1512
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:57,884
Yes, sir.

1513
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:05,392
(SIRENS BLARING)

1514
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:26,079
I see no point,
none at all in
speculating about a trap.

1515
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:29,116
If Yamamoto
doesn't show,

1516
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:32,819
the P-38's will refuse
combat and hightail it.

1517
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:36,289
The question is,
what's the best
plan of attack?

1518
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:39,226
Well, sir, I don't think
that we should try
to get him in the air.

1519
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,461
There's too many variables,
the weather conditions,

1520
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:43,997
he may be late,
he may be early,
we might miss him.

1521
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,332
How would you do it,
Andy?

1522
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:47,234
Well, hit him
when he's most vulnerable.

1523
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:49,002
After he's landed
on Ballale island,

1524
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:53,340
he's scheduled
to take a sub chaser
from there to Buin.

1525
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:56,376
ANDY: I say strafe him
when he's on the water.

1526
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,080
What do you say, Lamphier?

1527
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:04,184
Oh. Well,
no pun intended, sir,

1528
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:06,987
but I think
that approach is all wet.

1529
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,955
Could you be a little bit
more explicit, Captain?

1530
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:10,924
Sure.

1531
01:47:10,957 --> 01:47:14,995
Now Army pilot's
are gonna carry the ball
in this thing, correct?

1532
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:16,930
Well, I hate to
embarrass anybody,

1533
01:47:16,963 --> 01:47:19,966
but the plain fact is
that Army pilots,
including yours,

1534
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,936
truly, are not so hot
on Naval identification.

1535
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:25,939
Based on past performance
I'd say there's
a strong possibility

1536
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:29,009
that we might
pick out something else
instead of the sub chaser.

1537
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:30,944
Oh, now looky here...

1538
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:32,646
I'm not through.

1539
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,615
If we do strafe
the right boat,

1540
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:39,352
we could miss Yamamoto,
or maybe just wound him.

1541
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:42,956
And if we sink the boat,
what's the guarantee
that he won't swim away?

1542
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:47,160
Well, there's no guarantee
that you're gonna get him
in the air, either.

1543
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:52,632
Your way might work,
Andy, but...

1544
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:56,670
I think the fellow
who has to do the job
should call the play.

1545
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:00,006
We'll go for him in the air.

1546
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:08,114
(PLANES HOVERING)

1547
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:29,169
I counted
only 14, sir.

1548
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:30,570
Must've been
some mechanical trouble.

1549
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:33,406
Four of those P-38's
didn't get off.

1550
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,508
18 was little enough.

1551
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:37,777
Signal from
Admiral Lee, sir.

1552
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,883
Lee's lost two destroyers,
but he sank the
<i>Kirishima.</i>

1553
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,417
The Japs have
reversed course.

1554
01:48:44,451 --> 01:48:46,519
Sounds like our chance
for a field day.

1555
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:48,255
And we're gonna
make the most of it.

1556
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:49,456
Clear the decks at
daybreak and go after

1557
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:50,857
those two transports.
Yes, sir.

1558

I want your B-17Ts
in on this.
Yes, sir.

1559

And notify
the

1560
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:55,862
I want her boys
in on this, too.

1561
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:56,897
Yes, sir.

1562
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:05,038
They're landing
and taking off again

1563
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:07,641
as fast as they can
rearm and refuel.

1564

It's becoming
a shuttle run.

1565
01:49:12,245 --> 01:49:15,649
The Jap escorts
are abandoning
the troop ships.

1566
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:19,586
Well, from here on end
it'll be like shooting
fish in a barrel.

1567
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,088

If Yamamoto was
on schedule,

1575
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,010
they should have
intercepted him at 9:50.

That was
40 minutes ago.

to get well
out of the area

still a little
early for that.
