DILIOS:
They shout and curse...

660
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,503
... stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.

661
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,215
They make a wondrous mess of things.

662
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,011
Brave amateurs, they do their part.

Immortals.

664
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:30,271
They fail our king's test.

665
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,358
And a man who fancies himself a god...

666
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:39,030
... feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.

667
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,289
To our king!

And our honored dead.

Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!

There's nothing that can stop us now!

671

Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.

672
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,556
Such mad hope, but there it is:

673
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:10,395
"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.

674
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,314
We can hold the Hot Gates.

We can win."

Whips crack. Barbarians howl.

679

Those in front cry, "Back!"

680
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,974
Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...

681
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:52,270
... coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.

682

When muscle failed...

683
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,116
... they turned to their magic.

01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,956
One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.

685

Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.

686
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,913
They fall by the hundreds.

687
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:39,711
We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.

King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.

689
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,234
He disciplines them.

690
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:24,505
Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.

691

They"re clumsy beasts...

... and the piled Persian dead are slippery.

- Somebody's gotta watch your back.

We lose few...

702
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:55,114
... but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.

703
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:01,245
And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...

704
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,247
... the captain breaks rank.

705
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:06,876
He goes wild, blood-drunk.

706
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,986
The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...

707
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:37,907
... are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.

708
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:42,078
It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.

The day is ours.

No songs are sung.

711
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:32,503
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.

712
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,215
The Spartans, too...

713
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,844
... were cruel to reject you.

714
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,141
But I am kind.

715
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,774
Everything you could ever desire...

716
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,777
... every happiness you can imagine...

717
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:03,576
... every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...

718
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,662
... I will grant you.

719
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:10,333
For I am kind.

720
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,558
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.

721
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,394
Yes.

722
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:36,692
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that empties behind the cursed Spartans...

723
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,111
... and your joys will be endless.

724
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:50,748
Yes! I want it all.

725
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,752
Wealth. Women.

726
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,422
And one more thing...

727
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,261
... I want a uniform.

728
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,476
Done.

729
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,813
You will find...

730
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,357
... I am kind.

731
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:21,737
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...

732
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,533
... I require only...

733
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,702
... that you kneel.

734
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:57,314
Beautiful night.

735
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:02,737
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.

736
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,489
You can be sure of that.

737
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,535
You never spared words with me.

738
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,372
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?

739
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,374
Is it poison?

740
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,544
I"m sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.

741
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,515
I"m told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.

742
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,893
Yes.

743
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,438
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.

744
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,648
Yes.

745
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,860
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.

746
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:47,406
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.

747
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,201
But why would I want to do that?

748
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,164
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.

749
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,082
True.

750
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,085
But this is politics, not war.

751
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,921
Leonidas is an idealist.

752
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:06,258
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.

753
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:11,347
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.

754
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:16,143
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.

755
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,647
- I"m simply a realist.
- You"re an opportunist.

756
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:24,902
You"re as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.

757
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,657
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

758
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,746
I admire your passion.

759
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,791
But don't think that you...

760
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,585
... a woman, even a queen...

761
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:45,673
... can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.

762
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,259
I own that chamber...

763
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,511
... as if it were built with these hands.

764
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,519
I could crush
the life out of you right now.

765
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:03,274
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.

766
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:09,196
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...

767
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,324
... he will go to jail or worse.

768
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:17,538
Do you love your Sparta?

769
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,748
Yes.

770
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:22,167
- And your king?
- I do.

771
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:31,719
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.

772
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,680
What do you have to offer...

773
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,434
... in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?

774
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,065
What does a realist want with his queen?

775
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:51,405
I think you know.

776
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,547
This will not be over quickly.

777
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,092
You will not enjoy this.

778
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,887
I"m not your king.

779
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:41,497
Dilios.

780
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,544
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?

781
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,714
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.

782
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:54,093
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.

783
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,888
My captain?

784
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:03,018
Curses the gods and mourns alone.

785
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,939
Leonidas!

786
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,151
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.

787
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,736
Daxos, calm yourself.

788
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,532
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' Immortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.

789
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:19,743
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

790
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:25,165
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.

791
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:29,712
By morning, the Immortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.

792
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:34,717
Spartans! Prepare for glory!

793
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,095
Glory? Have you gone mad?

794
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,805
There is no glory to be had now.

795
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:44,018
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.

796
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,354
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.

797
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:53,027
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

798
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,738
Go spread the word.

799
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,616
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

800
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:02,619
Let each among them
search his own soul.

801
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:08,459
And while you"re at it, search your own.

802
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,260
My men will leave with me.

803
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,809
Godspeed, Leonidas.

804
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,734
Children!

805
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,028
Children.

806
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,073
Gather round.

807
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,203
No retreat, no surrender.

808
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:48,248
That is Spartan law.

809
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,545
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...

810
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,714
... and die.

811
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,679
A new age has begun.

812
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,518
An age of freedom.

813
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,272
And all will know that 300 Spartans...

814
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,692
... gave their last breath to defend it.

815
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,756
My friend.

816
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:46,890
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

817
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:56,191
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.

818
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:01,947
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.

819
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,410
That he stood by me with honor.

820
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,789
That he was all that was best in me.

821
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,426
My heart is broken for your loss.

822
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,887
Heart?

823
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:33,061
I have filled my heart...

824
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:34,938
... with hate.

825
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,777
Good.

826
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,747
Dilios...

827
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,584
... let's take a walk.

828
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,129
Yes, my lord.

829
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:04,176
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.

830
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:07,471
That you are, one of the finest.

831
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:11,391
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

832
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,522
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...

833
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,192
... with force and verve.

834
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,988
Tell them our story.

835
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:29,660
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

836
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,163
You'll have a grand tale to tell.

837
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,667
A tale of victory.

838
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,877
Victory.

839
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,925
Yes, my lord.

840
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:52,975
Sire, any message... ?

841
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,187
For the queen?

842
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:22,087
None that need be spoken.

843
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,604
Hundreds leave.

844
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,691
A handful stay.

845
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,490
Only one looks back.

846
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:03,003
Spartans!

847
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,257
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...

848
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:11,345
... for tonight we dine in hell!

849
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,898
May I give the floor now...

850
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:27,486
... to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.

851
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,957
- What's this?
- This is nothing.

852
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,959
Councilmen...

853
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:46,880
... I stand before you
not only as your queen.

854
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,467
I come to you as a mother.

855
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:54,137
I come to you as a wife.

856
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,475
I come to you as a Spartan woman.

857
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:06,608
I come to you with great humility.

858
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:12,447
I am not here to represent Leonidas.

859
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,367
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

860
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:18,120
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

861
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,831
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

862
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:23,959
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...

863
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,587
... and for the very principles
this room was built upon.

864
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:30,298
We are at war, gentlemen.

865
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,260
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...

866
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,513
... in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.

867
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,225
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.

868
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,727
Send it for justice.

869
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:44,521
Send it for law and order.

870
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:47,274
Send it for reason.

871
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:51,528
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.

872
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:55,282
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.

873
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,536
That their courage bonds us together.

874
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,039
That we are made stronger
by their actions...

875
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:08,170
... and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

876
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,756
Three hundred.

877
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:15,927
We must send them.

878
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,558
Moving...

879
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,769
... eloquent, passionate.

880
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:29,357
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

881
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:31,943
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...

882
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,571
... and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.

883
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,490
The Persians will not stop...

884
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:40,035
... until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.

885
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:44,164
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.

886
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,875
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

887
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,127
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?

888
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,964
Honor. Duty. Glory.

889
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:58,261
You speak of honor, duty and glory?

890
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,805
But what of adultery?

891
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,433
- How dare you.
- How dare l?

892
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:06,895
Watch her carefully.

893
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:10,023
She is a trickster in true form.

894
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,360
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.

895
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,613
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.

896
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:21,243
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.

897
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:24,412
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!

898
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,582
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...

899
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,961
... in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?

900
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,921
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

901
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:36,841
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?

902
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:42,013
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?

903
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:48,144
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...

904
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,606
... while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

905
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,735
He speaks truth.

906
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,531
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...

907
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,783
... my little whore queen.

908
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:08,331
What queen-like behavior.

909
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:13,169
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...

910
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,339
... with her inglorious and shabby self.

911
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,764
This will not be over quickly.

912
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,644
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.

913
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,710
Traitor.

914
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:59,049
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

915
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,593
Traitor!

916
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:44,636
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.

917
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:48,473
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.

918
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,643
Despite your insufferable arrogance...

919
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:55,980
... the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.

920
01:34:56,732 --> 01:34:58,108
You will make a mighty ally.

921
01:34:58,275 --> 01:34:59,984
Yield, Leonidas.

922
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:04,030
Use your reason. Think of your men.

923
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,493
I beg you.

924
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,037
Listen to your fellow Greek.

925
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,916
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.

926
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:19,546
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...

927
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:23,633
... the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...

928
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,928
... and more, to reward your service.

929
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:28,513
You fight for your lands.

930
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,057
Keep them.

931
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:33,727
You fight for Sparta.

932
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:37,897
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.

933
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:40,024
You fight for your kingship.

934
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:43,903
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...

935
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:48,366
... answerable only
to the one true master of the world.

936
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:53,496
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...

937
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:56,249
... if you but lay down your arms...

938
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,586
... and kneel to holy Xerxes.

939
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:35,038
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.

940
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,751
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...

941
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:45,089
... only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.

942
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:50,678
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.

943
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,347
Gulls cawing...

944
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:56,726
... complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.

945
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:03,399
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...

946
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:07,654
... ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.

947
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,616
Every one of them...

948
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,036
... ready to die.

949
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,471
His helmet is stifling.

950
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,995
His shield is heavy.

951
01:38:04,628 --> 01:38:05,962
Your spear.

952
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:16,222
You there...

953
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,641
... Ephialtes.

954
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,024
May you live forever.

955
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,742
Leonidas, your spear.

956
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,560
Stelios!

957
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:56,197
Slaughter them!

958
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:01,160
His helmet was stifling.

959
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:04,455
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.

960
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:09,627
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...

961
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,464
... and his target is far away.

962
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:22,617
The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.

963
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:28,414
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.

964
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,710
His roar is long and loud.

965
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,408
My king.

966
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:20,299
It's an honor to die at your side.

967
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:26,389
It's an honor to have lived at yours.

968
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,412
My queen!

969
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:59,380
My wife.

970
01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:12,602
My love.

971
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:41,167
"Remember us."

972
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,255
As simple an order as a king can give.

973
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:51,052
"Remember why we died."

974
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:57,099
For he did not wish tribute or song...

975
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:03,105
... nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.

976
01:46:05,984 --> 01:46:08,277
His wish was simple.

977
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:15,743
"Remember us"...

978
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:18,496
... he said to me.

979
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:22,375
That was his hope.

980
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:26,295
Should any free soul
come across that place...

981
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:30,424
... in all the countless
centuries yet to be...

982
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:33,427
... may all our voices...

983
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:37,640
... whisper to you
from the ageless stones.

984
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:42,269
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...

985
01:46:42,604 --> 01:46:48,484
... that here, by Spartan law, we lie.

986
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,948
And so my king died...

987
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,451
... and my brothers died...

988
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,289
... barely a year ago.

989
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:11,465
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.

990
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,343
Time has proven him wise.

991
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:18,264
For from free Greek to free Greek...

992
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:23,018
... the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...

993
01:47:23,186 --> 01:47:25,187
... so far from home...

994
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:28,774
... laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...

995
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:32,736
... but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.

996
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:38,701
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...

997
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:43,873
... Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!

998
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:48,961
Just there the barbarians huddle...

999
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:54,008
... sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...

1000
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:56,051
... with icy fingers...

1001
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:59,472
... knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...

1002
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,183
... at the swords and spears of 300.

1003
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:09,148
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...

1004
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:12,610
... commanding 30,000 free Greeks!

1005
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:23,329
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.

1006
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,623
Good odds for any Greek.

1007
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:31,045
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...

1008
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:35,591
... and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.

1009
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,514
Give thanks, men...

1010
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:45,976
... to Leonidas and the brave 300.

1011
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:48,896
To victory!

1012
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:28,063
