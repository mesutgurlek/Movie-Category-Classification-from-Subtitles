- No, Your Majesty.
- Ah, well, that's your problem, you see?

You don't observe nature.

141
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,245
Look, it begins by laying the loss

It compares you to the demon Ba'al.

00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,602
Your man Culpeper on Long Island,

166
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,299
what word from him?

167
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,639
Well, it's... it's Culper, sir.

168
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,338
And it's still too
dangerous to make contact.

169
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:41,505
I require a full report on New York
Harbor before we move camp.

170
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,375
<i>You shall engage Culper</i>

171
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,976
or recommend to me a new head

172
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,810
of intelligence.

173
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,713
Yes. Yes, sir.

174
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,451
My courier is in the camp as we speak

175
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:59,354
and he'll be ready to set sail tonight.

176
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,189
- (Drumming)
- Right here, you.

177
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,391
Come on! Right here, you.

178
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,293
Right in my lily-white nut sack.

179
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,094
Huh? Come on, you savage.

180
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,062
Make your people proud. Right here!

181
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,565
Come on!

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,735
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

183
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,905
Drinks on me, fellas.

184
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,774
What did I tell you? Huh?

185
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:22,743
What did I tell you? Right here.

186
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:25,379
(Speaking Oneida) Right?

187
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,414
I assume you put in the proper
request for all these supplies?

188
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,248
Huh? Request? No.

189
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,085
No, these are my gifts for the cause.

190
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,689
Oh, I see. The black market, then.

191
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,092
Yeah, you do see.

192
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:42,532
Well, perhaps you might be getting the itch

193
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,867
to make another trade tonight.

194
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:46,502
Maybe visit our old hometown,

195
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:48,338
visit an old friend.

196
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,674
Nah, not tonight.

197
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,077
I... I'm afraid this is
not a request, Caleb.

198
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,179
It is an order.

199
00:09:58,213 --> 00:09:59,946
- An order?
- That's right.

200
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,614
I think I'm done with those.

201
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,418
- Done?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,087
What, done with orders?

203
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,790
Orders, Culper, army.

204
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,827
I mean, it's all a bit
of a tail chaser, yeah?

205
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,229
But with this here, whale oil,

206
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,931
plucked from a fat Tory
skiff off of New Haven

207
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,434
and resold for ã12 on Devil's Belt...

208
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:23,069
that's the kind of profit that can make
a man think about quitting the army

209
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,605
and applying to Congress
for a license to privateer.

210
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,179
Loyal subjects harass at my pleasure

211
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,978
and make a bit of coin on the side.

212
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,144
And the best part... the best part

213
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,980
is the only one I'm risking

214
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,647
is me.

215
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,014
Han Yerry! (laughs)

216
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,913
Look, Caleb, this is not my order.

217
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:52,183
- It's Washington's.
- Oh, Washington.

218
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,552
Well, you'll just have to tell him
that you're following protocol.

219
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,418
See, Culper doesn't signal unless it's safe,

220
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,154
and he ain't signaled in two months.

221
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,222
- So it ain't safe.
- Caleb, listen to me.

222
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,622
I am listening, Ben.

223
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,325
I'm listening now like I
should have listened before.

224
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,358
Like when you ordered to let Simcoe live,

225
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,895
I should have listened to reason
and put my hatchet in his head.

226
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,696
But I didn't.

227
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,599
And he survived long
enough to kill my uncle.

228
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,236
Now that's on me.

229
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,970
You want to get Abe killed?

230
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,905
That's on you.

231
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,408
Caleb.

232
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,949
<i>(Music playing)</i>

233
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,354
Two more here

234

and we shall collect
whatever drinking glasses

235

before we seat for dinner.

236
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,326
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,760
<i>(Soft chatter)</i>

238
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,128
- Circle, circle.
- (Chuckles)

239
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,529
Everything comes round.

240
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,633
Thomas, do be careful with Grandfather.

241
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,164
- Don't lean on him so.
- He's fine. So am I.

242
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,432
You're still recovering.

243
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,799
Mary, there is perfection
and then there is obsession.

244
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,534
Whitehall has been without a
wife's care for far too long.

245
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,471
And that was before it became home
to soldiers and bachelors alike.

246
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,003
Well, I think you've done a miracle.

247
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,874
I agree. In fact, I was
trying to relate to Sarah

248
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,874
the extraordinary circumstance
of your journey here,

249
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,977
<i>but I just couldn't do it justice.</i>

250
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:24,514
Will you please tell Sarah
the story of the rebel raid?

251
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:27,283
<i>The night they burned your husband's farm.</i>

252
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,921
If only as an example
of how to survive such.

253
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,989
We've had no raids in Oyster Bay,

254
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,324
not since the regulars took the island.

255
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,495
And we're as safe here on Long Island

256
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,200
as any can hope to be in the colonies.

257
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:46,069
But these rebels, they have no fear.

258
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,874
Or they have so much, they're numb to it.

259
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,377
<i>They feel as if they have</i>

260
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:56,547
<i>nothing left to lose and
they hate us who do.</i>

261
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:02,921
So after Ben Tallmadge made
his retreat from our town,

262
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,920
some of his men stayed behind

263
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:07,089
to plunder what they could on the way out.

264
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,022
Abraham and I thought they'd gone.

265
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,259
<i>And so we returned home that night.</i>

266
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,926
<i>Abe had just taken Thomas out to the privy.</i>

267
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,327
<i>We were spent and just wanted to sleep</i>

268
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>when five men showed up</i>

269
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,692
<i>vowing revenge on the son of the magistrate.</i>

270
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:29,430
Brave Ensign Baker stood against all five.

271
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,295
And they shot him dead.

272
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,029
- (Gunshot)
- <i> (Mary screams)</i>

273
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,296
Mr. Baker!

274
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,529
Mary: <i>They couldn't find Abraham</i>

275
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,932
<i>as he was protecting Thomas.</i>

276
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:50,735
<i>So they set fire to the house and fled.</i>

277
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,082
How awful. Everything gone.

278
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,950
No, not everything.

279
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:25,686
<i>We had each other.</i>

280
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,721
<i>And together, Abraham and I
have vowed to move forward</i>

281
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,123
<i>and leave the past where it lay.</i>

326
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,856
I betrayed my husband, sir.

327
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,890
<i>It was his boat I jumped from.</i>

328
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:29,960
You chose loyalty to your king.

329
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:32,961
There can be no nobler sacrifice.

330
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,165
I doubt the Woodhulls will see it that way.

331
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,536
It was Abraham who reminded
me of your right action

332
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,104
and who inspired me to take my own.

333
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:45,636
Abraham Woodhull

334
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,772
suggested you invite me to his home?

335
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,743
No, that was my idea.

336
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,810
But he did acknowledge the difficulties
that your families have had

337
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:55,977
and felt that it's time for all differences

338
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,381
to be put aside and for common
bonds to be strengthened.

339
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,545
His words, not mine.

340
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,821
(Music playing)

341
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,691
- Good evening.
- A pleasure.

342
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,692
Mr. DeJong.

343
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,529
Father, please sit down. Mary
and I can greet the guests.

344
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,766
I'm fine. Will you please
stop fussing, Abraham?

345
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,203
- All right, all right.
- <i> (Door opens)</i>

346
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,143
Anna.

347
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,878
Ah, there you are.

348
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:37,951
You all know Mrs. Strong, of course.

349
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,252
You look fine, madam. Very fine.

350
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,987
Anna: <i>Thank you.</i>

351
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,225
Ah, yes.

352
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,268
And thank you all for having me.

353
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:52,939
- I think I may have that sit now after all.
- Absolutely.

354
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,774
I'll... I'll help you, Father.

355
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:59,477
Major, perhaps a viewing of the Loch Lomond.

356
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:02,048
Hmm. Mrs. Strong, would you care

357
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,452
to view Loch Lomond before
dinner gets underway?

358
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,718
There's nothing like it in
Setauket. You really should.

359
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,720
By all means, then.

360
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,722
This way.

361
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:22,693
Father.

362
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,296
The major wants to chime in on
the wine choice for tonight.

363
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,496
We have Madeira, claret, and Virginia white.

364
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,564
He can arrange them in
whatever sequence he wishes.

365
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:31,732
All right, don't kill the messenger.

366
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,501
No, actually, pork.

367
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:36,305
- Who is the artist?
- Jacob More.

368
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:38,108
Specializing in portraiture,

369
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,379
but a trip to Florence has
broadened his intentions, it seems,

370
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:45,484
and perhaps made him long for home.

371
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:47,550
(Knocks)

372
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,553
Major, our esteemed magistrate

373
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,488
wishes you to consult on a wine strategy.

374
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:53,991
(Chuckles) Ah, indeed.

375
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,827
To battle, then.

376
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,197
Ah, ah.

377
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,338
- Signal Caleb.
- What?

378
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,440
- Where have you been?
- She's been watching.

379
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:13,573
- If not her, then her sewing circle.
- It's been over a month.

380
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,842
I've hado play my part, but I'm ready now.

381
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,744
For what?

382
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,613
This is for Ben.

383
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,645
It's instructions for a new code book.

384
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,648
It explains about Ensign Baker.

385
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,685
How he found the book, how I shot him,

386
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,985
how I fired my farm and said
Tallmadge's men were to blame.

387
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,484
You want to tell Ben the truth?

388
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,822
- What about Mary?
- Everything except Mary.

389
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,657
Excuse me.

390
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,995
Abe:<i> If Washington finds out that she
knows, he may think me compromised.</i>

391
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,799
You are compromised. She does know.

392
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,266
Just take it to the drop.

393
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,836
Signal Caleb. I have the rest in hand.

394
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,606
Wait.

395
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,613
It's a stiletto blade.

396
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,957
I have to get used to
wearing it under the suit.

397
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:02,728
It's the one I'll be taking to New York.

398
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,266
New York? How?

399
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,402
You've no cabbage to
sell and no hogs to trade

400
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:09,338
as you've burned your bridges
with the quartermaster.

401
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,141
What excuse could you possibly...

402
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,580
You'll see tonight.

403
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,113
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

404
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,257
<i>(door opens)</i>

405
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,799
- (chatter)
- (Clinking glass)

406
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,734
- <i> (chatter stops)</i>
- Ah.

407
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:52,239
Tonight we celebrate the
victories in our king's name

408
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:56,077
and we honor the sacrifice
made along the way.

409
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:59,613
This year I learned the power of loss.

410
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,085
And I'm not speaking of my farm,

411
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,720
but of when I nearly lost
my father to a rebel bullet

412
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,723
and our town nearly lost its magistrate.

413
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,293
A possibility which
should terrify all of you

414
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,961
considering it was I who had
to prosecute in his stead.

415
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:16,132
- You performed admirably.
- Father, I lost the case.

416
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,803
That happens. Not to me so much, but...

417
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,771
(all laughing)

418
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:23,508
No.

419
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,611
Loss begets gain.

420
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,344
It inspires change.

421
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:30,244
<i>Your near loss pushed me
to take up the law again</i>

422
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,614
and my loss at trial
pushed me to want to win.

423
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,881
Especially against those who rape

424
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,451
and murder in the name of independence.

425
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:42,618
My toast to you tonight is a promise.

426
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,892
I am to finish what I
began at King's College.

427
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,222
<i>I aim to study the law by your example.</i>

428
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:54,659
And come one day,

429
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,229
I will set out for New York

430
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:58,964
to seek an apprenticeship to a barrister.

431
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,200
And even if it takes me a
year of going there and back,

432
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:05,037
I will see it through.

433
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:07,073
I've found my calling.

434
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,613
And you have made your father very proud.

435
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,815
Hewlett: <i>Hear, hear. Hear, hear.</i>

436
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:14,882
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

437
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,751
<i>Shall we eat? Let's eat.</i>

438
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:19,856
(voices echo)

439
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,698
No, no. I... no. I'm sorry.

440
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,934
I'm sorry, Abraham. I can't let you do that.

441
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,070
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,543
Mary, what are you...
what are you talking about?

443
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,745
You know why you can't go to New York.

444
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:51,116
The rebels burned your farm.
They shot your father.

445
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,318
You are the son of the magistrate

446
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,219
and they hate you for that.

447
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:58,056
You were a target of the
Patriots and they will try again.

448
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,460
(Stammering) You think that
I'm in danger of some kind?

449
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:05,096
There have been tales of... of kidnapping

450
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,232
<i>and killing of prominent Tories</i>

451
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,801
all over Long Island.

452
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,070
Ensign Baker died defending your farm.

453
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:13,939
<i>You yourself were beaten and robbed</i>

454
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,441
on the way to York City and
you wish to try again alone?

455
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,177
Mary.

456
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,212
I agree with you, madam.

457
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:23,983
<i>And that is why I shall
guarantee his safety.</i>

458
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:26,319
He shall be granted an escort.

459
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,754
Richard: <i>Now that is wise.</i>

460
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,255
I hire two every trip.

461
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,329
No, Major, I couldn't possibly
afford to pay for such a...

462
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:35,830
There is no need.

463
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,730
I shall provide a top
man from my own regiment

464
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:40,467
<i>who will go with you to the
city and stay by your side</i>

465
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:42,170
<i>till your journey is over.</i>

466
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,338
<i>That way, all of our
minds can be put at ease.</i>

467
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:47,605
No, I do not need...
I do not need an escort.

468
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,476
There's no shame in it. It's
a dangerous world out there.

469
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:56,479
Thank you, sir. That's
very generous of you, sir.

470
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,579
It is my pleasure.

471
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,781
It's done. Let's eat.

472
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:06,685
- Hewlett: <i>Worth waiting for.</i> 
- Richard:<i> Yes, isn't it?</i>

473
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,458
"I believe that it is better
to die honorably in the field

474
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,572
- than in a stinking hospital." 
- I concur with that.

475
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,373
Men: Cheers.

476
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,488
And this, this here, truer still.

477
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:24,857
Listen. "I believe that the
proper methods of attacking,

478
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:26,527
beating and conquering the enemy

479
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,198
has never as yet been adopted
by the commander-in-chief."

480
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,602
I couldn't have said it better myself, boys.

481
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,272
Who do you think is the author?

482
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,941
<i>Someone fed up,</i>

483
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,878
armed with common sense and
the courage to speak out.

484
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,616
Oi, Bradford.

485
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,255
You might want to be more careful with that.

486
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:45,187
Your anonymous hero makes common sense

487
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,889
sound a bit like treason.

488
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:48,860
<i>That's your commander</i> <i>that he's hacking at.</i>

489
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:50,599
Not for much longer, I think.

490
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,067
What? What did you just say?

491
00:26:56,873 --> 00:27:00,940
This letter is well-formed
opinion based on fact.

492
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,609
<i>Our esteemed commander</i>

493
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:06,247
left his flank wide open at Brandywine.

494
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:09,683
He lost the battle, cost
America her capital city.

495
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,318
Is it treason to speak the
facts in this army now?

496
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,919
Fine. So...

497
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,584
who would you see as commander?

498
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,352
Congress would likely choose Gates.

499
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,155
Gates, right.

500
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,826
Sure, or perhaps your man

501
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,032
- Charles Lee.
- Stand back.

502
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:30,168
Who was captured while
with his mistress... fact.

503
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,138
Who escaped the enemy on his own.

504
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,376
What was she, a tavern wench?

505
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,445
No wonder he's been so absent in the field.

506
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,547
He's too busy playing with his whore pipe.

507
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,317
At least he has one.
And the sons to prove it.

508
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:44,389
While poor George must content
himself with collecting young men.

509
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,459
Why, you...

510
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,474
Hold him down. Hold him down.

511
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,446
Now we're gonna shut that pretty mouth.

512
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,115
With respect, sir,

513
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,250
the only one who punches my friend is me.

514
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,484
Hey.

515
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,586
(Groans)

516
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,895
You like that, huh?

517
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,105
(Spits)

518
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:31,117
Wait, Caleb. Hey there, boy.

519
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:35,861
Thank you.

520
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,564
And you were right. You
were right about Culper.

521
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,301
It's not safe to make
contact unless he's signaled.

522
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:45,638
I won't move without you, all right?

523
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,109
Are you all right?

524
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,812
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

525
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,983
Are you all right, though?

526
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,155
What, have I really been such an ass?

527
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,392
Well, yeah. You have.

528
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,994
(laughs)

529
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,832
I wish I could just walk up
and ask that of Washington.

530
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,631
"Are you all right, sir?"

531
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:11,369
The man won't stand up for
himself against his detractors.

532
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,471
I cannot for the life of me understand why.

533
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,576
Well, you know these officer types.

534
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,345
Hmm?

535
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:21,877
Always under pressure, shouldering burdens

536
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,549
us foot-wobblers don't know or can't see.

537
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,285
Huh?

538
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,685
Maybe give him some slack.

539
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,227
(Singing drunkenly)

540
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,929
Shh. Thomas.

541
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:38,934
I just don't understand, Richard,

542
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,871
why we haven't done this before.

543
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,206
You didn't want to be celebrated.

544
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,610
Ah, well, I am lifting the embargo on that.

545
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,378
In the meantime, God night.

546
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,515
- And good bless.
- (Laughs)

547
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,816
Where's Thomas?

548
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,952
He's asleep downstairs. Aberdeen's with him.

549
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,021
Don't you think we should talk?

550
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:33,224
I think everyone had a splendid evening.

551
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,492
Just a splendid evening, wouldn't you agree?

552
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:37,626
<i>Almost everyone.</i>

553
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,627
<i>Well, I know I did.</i>

554
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,665
Dinner, drinks, and the
theater all in one night.

555
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:46,067
I thought your performance was excellent.

556
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:48,134
I learned from the best.

557
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:49,667
Touché.

558
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,105
(Clears throat)

559
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,782
An armed escort with me at all times.

560
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:04,350
Very clever.

561
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:08,786
Abraham, please.

562
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,222
I don't feel very clever and I
don't wish to be your adversary.

563
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,761
Oh, no, don't be hasty
'cause you got a talent for it.

564
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:15,232
And I mean that to your credit.

565
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,599
You're much more than the blushing rose

566
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,132
my brother first told me about.

567
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,800
And you, you are a far
more interesting husband

568
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,536
than the cabbage farmer that I was wed to.

569
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,871
Well, then we make a
perfect couple, don't we?

570
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:31,409
If you hate me, just say it straight out.

571
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:33,977
There's no longer a need to be
hiding the truth from each other.

572
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,678
We've both suffered the consequence of that.

573
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:44,650
You're a God-fearing man.
I know that, Abraham.

574
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:48,286
Our savior has tested us and
has given us a second chance.

575
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,219
And I had hoped and I had prayed

576
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,654
that the death of Ensign Baker, a good man,

577
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,491
- an innocent man...
- Mary, we're...

578
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,257
would have opened your eyes
to the folly of these schemes.

579
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,726
We are not talking about
Ensign Baker right now.

580
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,496
Did his death mean nothing to you?

581
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,999
No, his death meant everything!
It changed everything!

582
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:06,603
I had tried at every step to do right,

583
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:09,905
to protect my family,
to stand for my principles,

584
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,609
to stay out of the fight and true to myself.

585
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,977
And Baker is the bloody
proof that I cannot do both.

586
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:17,811
Now, if I stop now, his
death will mean nothing.

587
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,580
Abraham, please, you're hurting me.

588
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:21,282
He should never have been in our house

589
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,750
just as Hewlett should not be now.

590
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,251
We do not need their laws,

591
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,786
their taxes, or their protection.

592
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,457
And I will not stop my
mission for Washington

593
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,393
until the last king's man
has set sail back to England.

594
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,394
Now, do you understand?

595
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,035
Who will protect us from King Louis

596
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:40,670
when his ships return to reclaim New France?

597
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,104
You've been speaking to my father again.

598
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,606
You asked what I believe in.

599
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,273
Then why don't you just turn me in?

600
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:48,240
Abraham, don't you know?

601
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,245
Sometime during that night while
I was watching our house burn,

602
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,049
it became clear to me
and it brought me peace.

603
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,686
I love you, Abraham.

604
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,889
I love your strength to stand on your own

605
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:04,493
no matter what anyone else thinks.

606
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:07,197
I love the way that you care for our son.

607
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,136
I love your lips and I love your eyes.

608
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,272
And I will do what I must to protect you.

609
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:19,775
Even if that means
protecting you from yourself.

610
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,276
Mary...

611
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:28,148
I don't feel the same.

612
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,949
I know.

613
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,650
I know.

614
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,921
It's not as bad as I feared.

615
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:44,725
And I did fear that for so long.

616
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:54,101
You may go to New York to
study the law, Abraham.

617
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:57,071
But I'm afraid that's all
you'll have time for there.

618
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,231
- Woodhull.
- Corporal Eastin.

619
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,569
On your way to post?

620
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,235
You are my post.

621
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,972
I'm your new escort per Major Hewlett.

622
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,376
Oh, excellent. I see.

623
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,214
Well, when I'm ready to travel,
I'll be sure to let you know.

624
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,615
My orders are to not
let you out of my sight.

625
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,249
For your own safety.

626
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:45,019
I think I'm safe here in Setauket.

627
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,058
Are you?

628
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,875
(Chatter)

629
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:14,881
"That the enemy has been greatly deceived

630
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:19,454
having no reason to
expect so valuable a prize

631
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:21,291
<i>as the city of Philadelphia</i>

632
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:24,261
<i>with so few broken bones."</i>

633
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:26,432
Tell me, monsieur,

634
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,807
do you have gutter
journalists in your country?

635
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:35,082
In France we would have
them thrown in the Bastille.

636
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:38,753
General Lee, what do you read there?

637
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,157
Lee: <i>What, this?</i>

638
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:45,130
Just a complaint, sir.

639
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:47,565
<i>Factional, anonymous.</i>

640
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,833
You don't want to read it, trust me.

641
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:51,800
You read it, then.

642
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,068
Please.

643
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,539
Lee:<i> Sir.</i> <i>(clears throat)</i>

644
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:02,776
"I believe that some people

645
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:06,045
have too much interest in
the continuance of the war

646
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,652
and that the head cannot possibly be sound

647
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:13,191
<i>when the whole body is disordered.</i>

648
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:16,363
<i>That Washington, the bastard of Brandywine,</i>

649
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,435
<i>should be flogged for his failure.</i>

650
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,272
That the people of America
have been guilty of idolatry

651
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,077
by making a man their god.

652
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:29,481
<i>And the God of heaven and earth</i>

653
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:32,218
will convince them by woeful experience

654
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:33,887
that he is only a man."

655
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:36,623
<i>(footsteps)</i>

656
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:41,060
Forgive me.

657
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:44,062
Please, do continue.

658
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:47,798
<i>A greater load of horseshit
I've not heard dropped in years.</i>

659
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,299
Here.

660
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,567
Let me. (scoffs)

661
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:55,969
"That the honorable Congress... " ha!

662
00:36:56,003 --> 00:37:00,405
"... In many cases has been too much led

663
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,140
by military men."

664
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,408
Do you agree with that, Charles?

665
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,410
(Scoffs) Of course not.

666
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:09,111
Man: <i>No? Oh, I do.</i>

667
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:12,248
Those squeeze crabs in Congress

668
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:15,319
have been misled by military men,

669
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:16,889
just the wrong kind.

670
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:19,123
<i>They'd be better off listening to a man</i>

671
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:21,760
who'd venture into a cold night
and come back with a victory.

672
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,466
But don't take my word for it.

673
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm just the poor son of a drunkard.

674
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:30,207
A mere pharmacist's apprentice

675
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:33,310
and thveteran of only 11 battles

676
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:36,313
<i>in this conflict for our freedom.</i>

677
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:39,050
Now, of course, we cannot know

678
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:42,252
who wrote this grub shite,

679
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:45,456
but I would gamble he is
not the equal of a commander

680
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,523
<i>who rides headlong in the fray</i>

681
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,524
and yet has never been shot nor captured.

682
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:54,224
An endorsement by the
God of heaven and earth

683
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,792
- if there ever was one.
- Hear, hear!

684
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:59,026
(Pounding)

685
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:07,299
Monsieur, may I introduce to you

686
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,935
General Benedict Arnold.

687
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,103
General, this is Theveneau de Francy

688
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:16,108
of the Roderigue Hortalez Company.

689
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,412
Bonjour.

690
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,881
Will you join us, General?

691
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,822
Oh, sir, please.

692
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:35,166
It is an honor, sir.

693
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,906
Do you still have an appetite?

694
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,405
Always.

695
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:58,516
<i>(Thunder crashing)</i>

696
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:04,181
There is something I did not say

697
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:07,484
when I made my proposal to go to New York.

698
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:11,085
Something I kept hidden
and you should know it.

699
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,655
You should know that I intended

700
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,754
to undertake a completely different task.

701
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,526
One far more dangerous
and far less honorable.

702
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,131
<i>As you may know,</i>

703
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,401
<i>I never graduated King's College.</i>

704
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:33,476
What you may not know,
what no one knows is...

705
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,277
while at King's I had a connection.

706
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,883
A shameful, misguided friendship

707
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:43,052
with several members of a
secret group of Patriots.

708
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:47,824
They called themselves the Sons of Liberty.

709
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,761
It's not a past that I am proud of.

710
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:55,432
But it is one that could be of use now.

711
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,172
You were right

712
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:04,974
<i>about the danger that we face.</i>

713
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:07,879
<i>There are traitors everywhere.</i>

714
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,083
Now I wish to uproot them from the ground

715
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,185
before they strike my family again.

716
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,122
Uproot them how?

717
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:18,028
I believe that the Sons of Liberty
may still be operating in New York,

718
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,663
albeit concealed underground.

719
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,932
If I can find them,

720
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,701
convince them that I'm still on their side,

721
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:30,108
I can deliver you the
names of the whole group.

722
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,341
You wish to act the Patriot?

723
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:38,345
In order to catch traitors,
I must play one myself, yes.

724
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,423
Of course, it...

725
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:49,094
it won't do to have Corporal Eastin
standing guard while I do so.

726
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:50,895
He may still accompany me to the city,

727
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,797
but in order to keep up appearances,

728
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,934
I must act alone.

729
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:59,370
Are not the Sons of Liberty

730
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:02,340
the same cabal that sparked
the Liberty Pole Riots?

731
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:06,510
The same men who murdered
your older brother Thomas?

732
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,980
Well, you see now why I must do this.

733
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:11,616
<i>And why I beg you not to tell my father.</i>

734
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,119
<i>He may never speak to me again
if he were to learn of my past.</i>

735
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:16,554
He may never speak to you
again if you should die

736
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,157
while exposing the rebels or
while masquerading as one.

737
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,259
I will not sit home in safety and comfort

738
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:23,260
while others are dying for their beliefs.

739
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,363
I took an oath in your presence

740
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:28,234
swearing to defeat any treasonous
conspiracies made against the king.

741
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,569
Now, please...

742
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:34,705
let me fulfill my oath.

743
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,730
- <i> (Footsteps)</i>
- <i> (Horse neighs)</i>

744
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,032
A wee bit late for visitors, isn't it?

745
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:03,466
You wish to see His Majesty or not?

746
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,757
Your Majesty,

747
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,725
it is a most distinguishing honor

748
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,896
to stand in your royal presence once more.

749
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,068
I do hope you recall the warm spirit

750
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:50,740
of my prior audience just 14 years ago.

751
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:54,345
The same season you enjoyed my accounts

752
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,753
of the methods used to trap a black bear

753
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:01,858
in his winter den, eh? (laughs)

754
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:07,734
I also hope that you recall

755
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:10,338
<i>my petition.</i>

756
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,809
That being the discovery

757
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,876
of the Northwest Passage

758
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,980
and claiming it for England.

759
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:21,649
I humbly submit to you

760
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:24,150
this proposal tonight.

761
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:28,718
It is said that you are the best
hunter and tracker in America

762
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:31,119
and that you are a...

763
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:34,354
killing gentleman.

764
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:39,257
You will be granted a charter to
discover the Northwest Passage.

765
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,161
You will be appointed
command to raise troops.

766
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:45,527
<i>You will serve on full pay as a major.</i>

767
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:49,932
And all your debts will
be cleared by the Crown.

768
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:53,768
There is a valuable piece of royal property

769
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:56,237
on a ship bound for New York.

770
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:59,907
It is concealed inside a waxwork.

771
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,576
- Concealed?
- It was stolen from the palace,

772
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,012
and must be recovered before it falls

773
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:08,417
<i>into the hands of the rebel army.</i>

774
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:11,686
And it must never fall
into the hands of France.

775
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,556
Never.

776
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:18,324
You are to find it and destroy it

777
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,429
along with anyone else
that may have seen it.

778
00:44:42,325 --> 00:44:44,690
By my honor,

779
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,891
I will see it done.

780
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:58,230
- (chatter)
- (Seagulls screeching)

781
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:05,081
__

782
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:08,152
Abe's voice: <i>Brooklyn Ferry, October 14.</i>

783
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:10,930
<i>Troop number is lower since my last trip,</i>

784
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,765
<i>but naval presence still strong.</i>

785
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,705
<i>I count two dozen warships in the harbor,</i>

786
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,475
<i>including one ship of the line...</i>

787
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,377
<i>the Eagle, Lord Howe's
flagship with 60 guns.</i>

788
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:23,712
<i>The rest are lesser armed
frigates and sloops.</i>

789
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,245
Mr. Woodhull.

790
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,313
Abe's voice: <i>Land defenses on
the Brooklyn side include...</i>

791
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:28,914
- Mr. Woodhull, sir!
- Hmm?

792
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:31,183
He wants your papers.

793
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:33,052
Oh, yeah.

794
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:36,858
There you go.

795
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:40,895
As you can see, I have permission

796
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:42,930
from Major Hewlett of
Setauket to enter the city.

797
00:45:42,964 --> 00:45:46,034
"For legal studies," eh?

798
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,442
The next ferry should be here soon.

799
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:53,277
You can wait over there.

800
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,578
Don't see why I've got to lurk about here

801
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:58,315
when I could be getting my
Thomas milked in holy ground.

802
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,250
I'm afraid your pilgrimage
will have to wait.

803
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:02,984
My bag, please.

804
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:05,385
Seems odd you need
protecting all the way here

805
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,453
only to hoof it about alone in the city.

806
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,056
Makes me wonder what you're really up to

807
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,760
with your legal studies.

808
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,233
Don't wonder too hard.
You might hurt yourself.

809
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,436
My bag.

810
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:18,972
If Captain Simcoe were here...

811
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:21,475
Your orders are from Major
Hewlett, not Captain Simcoe.

812
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:22,776
And I suggest you follow them

813
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:25,011
unless you want to end up like him.

Man: Your attention, please!

820
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:09,506
It seems we have a poet in our midst.

821
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:13,979
Shall we pause in our labors

What a mess you've made.

All those forms will have to be redone.

838
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:11,508
This came for you.

839
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:14,209
Perhaps it's your true
love writing you back.

840

<i>(laughing)</i>

847
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:38,221
So, I showed her the silk.

848
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:40,057
Said there's more where that came from.

849
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:42,859
(Whistles) Never saw a woman
drop her knickers so fast.

850
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,332

Posthaste. That means immediately.

I'm afraid I won't be able

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,571
<i>(music continues)</i>

864
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,162
Franklin calls it an armonica.

865
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,267
It mechanically recreates the tones

866
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:14,205
made by rubbing a wet finger
around the rim of a wine glass.

867
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,707
So he mechanized a parlor trick.

868
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:19,312
Perhaps, but this parlor

869
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:21,915
is testament to the man's
genius and industry.

870
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,716
Take his lightning rod. Placed on a roof,

871
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,285
it guides the energy from a
bolt harmlessly to the ground.

872
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,953
And these eyeglasses.

873
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,486
The lenses are split,

874
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:33,688
offering corrections for both close

875
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:35,726
and distant viewing.

876
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,493
You can have the house, John.

877
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:41,628
I had no idea you admired
the man so ardently.

878
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:44,126
What I admire is how he imposes no bounds

879
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:47,795
on either his curiosity or his invention.

880
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,396
And now he wants to invent
an alliance with France,

881
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:53,364
which could turn this little
rebellion into a genuine war.

882
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,000
Not if I have any say in the matter.

883
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,868
<i>(Door opens)</i>

884
00:50:56,903 --> 00:50:59,804
Ah, here are our libations.

885
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,273
Good. Enough anticipation.

886
00:51:03,307 --> 00:51:06,011
I'd like a report with my port.

887
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:10,449
<i>Starting with your mole in
the rebel camp, Charles Lee.</i>

888
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,585
(sighs)

889
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,089
I admit, General Lee was a poor investment.

890
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:18,723
I may yet use him, but for now

891
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:20,757
I have my sights set on a bigger fish.

892
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,824
Thank you, Abigail. That'll be all.

893
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,164
André: <i>Trust me, General...</i>

894
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:36,603
I realized what we need
isn't a rival to Washington,

895
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,908
but a man who has his trust, a friend.

896
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:44,444
Indeed, such friends as only the
comradeship of war can make.

897
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:48,181
And who might this friend be?

898
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:51,849
A man whose leadership inspires both respect

899
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:54,082
<i>and affection.</i>

900
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,018
General Benedict Arnold.

901
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:58,788
<i>(Scoffs) Ridiculous.</i>

902
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:01,491
Unlikely.

903
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:04,263
Arnold is the best field
commander the rebels have.

904
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:07,998
Yes, but as with many men driven
to succeed on the battlefield,

905
00:52:08,032 --> 00:52:10,800
his virtues are often matched by his flaws.

906
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:13,669
Consider this. It's a report
from one of my field agents

907
00:52:13,703 --> 00:52:17,673
detailing Arnold's role in
the rebel victory at Saratoga.

908
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,843
"We were on the verge of winning the battle

909
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:22,717
when Arnold, forced to
serve under General Gates,

910
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:24,284
<i>asked to lead a last charge.</i>

911
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,253
<i>When Gates ordered him to stay in camp,</i>

912
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,689
<i>Arnold disobeyed."</i>

913
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,559
Clinton: <i>The man is insubordinate.</i>

914
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:34,660
(chuckles) To Burgoyne's misfortune.

915
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:36,429
"Ignoring a volley of fire,

916
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:39,466
<i>he single-handedly rallied the rebel troops,</i>

917
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,737
<i>turning a rout into a win."</i>

918
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,239
Clinton: <i>Poor Johnny Burgoyne.</i>

919
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:46,241
<i>Whipped by an apothecary.</i>

920
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,047
But here's the rub. Gates took
full credit for the victory.

921
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:53,416
What did Arnold get for his troubles?

922
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,016
He was shot in the same leg

923
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,317
he'd already been wounded in twice before.

924
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,424
<i>It'll be some time before
Arnold sees another battlefield.</i>

925
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:09,726
Time enough for that wound to heal,

926
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:13,062
<i>but for the many slights to his vanity</i>

927
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:15,268
to fester.

928
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:19,406
Well, supposing he is ripe for turning,

929
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,508
how will you turn him?

930
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,314
I think of it as a dance.

931
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,116
Right now I'm just trying
to select the proper music.

932
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,918
Speaking of which, there's an affair

933
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:30,386
at the house of Edward Shippen this week.

934
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,154
- Will you be attending?
- Yes, yes.

935
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:34,290
Well, that is a dance, this is war.

936
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,292
- There is a difference.
- Trust me, General.

937
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:39,226
The key to victory is having the right man.

938
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,662
<i>Our man in the heart of the enemy camp.</i>

939
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:46,300
Abe's voice: <i>York City.</i>

940
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:50,605
<i>The city feels changed.</i>

941
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,606
<i>Petty vice and deeper corruptions
have taken their toll.</i>

942
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,576
<i>That should work in my favor.</i>

943
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,983
(chatter)

944
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:01,984
Abe's voice: <i>An acquaintance from Oyster Bay</i>

945
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:05,689
<i>recommended a modest boardinghouse.</i>

946
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:08,058
<i>I figured breakfast was
as good a time as any</i>

947
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,227
<i>to get the lay of the land.</i>

948
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:25,341
Morning.

949
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,944
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

950
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,448
A dozen?

951
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,015
Yeah, I got a lot of books to read.

952
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,949
These help me get through the
long afternoons in the library.

953
00:54:35,016 --> 00:54:36,617
Thank you, sir.

954
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:44,859
Abe's voice: <i>The city's
inhabitants seem tired, on edge.</i>

955
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:48,231
<i>By my estimate, a sudden attack of 5,000 men</i>

956
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:51,769
<i>could take them all and end the war.</i>

957
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,236
- Here you are, Mr. Woodhull.
- Thank you.

958
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,778
The last time I was here,
you couldn't take a step

959
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,909
without tripping over a soldier.

960
00:55:04,943 --> 00:55:08,178
Now there are so few, a man
barely feels safe on the streets.

961
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:09,881
Where are they all hiding?

962
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,820
Best to keep to your porridge, sir.

963
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:20,125
Damn! Not again.

964
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:28,502
May I make a suggestion?

965
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,503
You could hardly make things worse.

966
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:33,674
My father used to make me
cry over this game all the time

967
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,211
until I learned a few tricks for myself.

968
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,212
He'll take my piece.

969
00:55:38,246 --> 00:55:40,350
Sacrifice for the greater good.

970
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:45,857
(laughs)

971
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,830
King me, you unlucky bastard.

972
00:55:57,468 --> 00:56:00,101
I don't know about any soldiers,

973
00:56:00,135 --> 00:56:02,837
but those sailors, as you say,

974
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:04,105
are on a tear.

975
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:06,274
- Navy, huh?
- Mm.

976
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:08,678
Building new ships over at the west wharf.

977
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,716
Making it hard for a man
to get his goods to market.

978
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:14,453
Well, I'll steer clear of the west wharf.

979
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:16,590
I like to study in quiet.

980
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,260
Good luck.

981
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:22,696
Thank you. And have fun with your books.

982
00:56:32,168 --> 00:56:36,859
__

983
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:39,526
What a lovely cross-stitch.

984
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:41,260
Isn't it lovely, Rachel?

985
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:43,028
Yes, very.

986
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:45,162
I'm so glad Mary invited you to join us.

987
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:47,362
It was Major Hewlett's suggestion.

988
00:56:49,396 --> 00:56:51,866
I had... I had assumed that
Mrs. Strong was too busy

989
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,032
to be frittering away time with us.

990
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:58,671
You poor thing. You must be overwhelmed.

991
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:02,073
I can only imagine how hard it
was to abandon your husband

992
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:05,978
and be forced to serve as a barmaid
in the tavern he used to own.

993
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:12,350
I didn't mean to sound disparaging.

994
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:14,353
Honest work is honest work.

995
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:16,956
No offense taken.

996
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,358
And as for my husband,

997
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:21,892
I could hardly have gone
on living with a traitor.

998
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,766
All men are rebels at heart.

999
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,665
It takes a strong woman to steer them

1000
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,169
<i>toward a proper understanding
of their obligations.</i>

1001
00:57:31,203 --> 00:57:34,341
- But such is our burden.
- <i>(Women laugh)</i>

1002
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:38,812
I had an idea last night.

1003
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,450
I think that we should organize a charity.

1004
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:42,650
A charity?

1005
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:45,384
<i>To buy provisions for families of soldiers</i>

1006
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,686
who've died during battle

1007
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,688
such as poor Ensign Baker.

1008
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:50,155
What sort of provisions?

1009
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:52,659
Basic necessities... flour, salt,

1010
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:54,894
<i>good cloth, Bibles, perhaps.</i>

1011
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,130
I think that's a wonderful idea.

1012
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,067
Still, I wonder how far our money will go

1013
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,772
<i>with everything so dear these days.</i>

1014
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:06,177
Lydia: <i>It's a pity about the poor soldiers.</i>

1015
00:58:06,211 --> 00:58:09,547
But more the pity for us if
our own families suffer for it.

1016
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:15,553
There could be a way to lighten the burden.

1017
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:18,558
As you all know, my employer

1018
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:21,428
Mr. DeJong is tight with his guineas.

1019
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:23,633
The man makes a vice of frugality.

1020
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,202
Which is why he also buys his rum
and supplies from a privateer.

1021
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:29,338
A privateer? You mean a pirate?

1022
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,407
A privateer is licensed by the British

1023
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:35,209
to prey on rebel shipping,
so it's all quite legal.

1024
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:38,012
<i>We could use Mr. DeJong's contact</i>

1025
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:39,880
and with the money we save,

1026
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:42,349
the cost of Mary's charity
could be quite manageable.

1027
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:44,885
I don't approve of consorting with thieves

1028
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,288
no matter what they call themselves.

1029
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:50,759
Surely you approve of
helping widows and orphans.

1030
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,595
(Chuckles nervously)

1031
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,933
It's settled, then.

1032
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,905
Good day, ladies.

1033
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,908
Um, Mary,

1034
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:06,510
has there been a delivery
of a package for me?

1035
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,977
What type of package?

1036
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,114
I've been eagerly awaiting the delivery

1037
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:12,451
of an item from London by way of New York.

1038
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:15,254
It would be quite heavy.

1039
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,222
Not yet, but I will keep an eye out for it.

1040
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:19,558
Thank you.

1041
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:23,662
And I am very pleased to see you

1042
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:26,963
among this august company, Mrs. Strong.

1043
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,431
Thank you, Major.

1044
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,333
I'm very pleased to be here.

1045
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:38,135
(Women giggle)

1046
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:41,039
It seems Anna has an august admirer.

1047
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,875
(laughing)

1048
00:59:54,985 --> 00:59:56,318
Hello.

1049
00:59:57,987 --> 00:59:59,755
Have you seen Major André?

1050
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,157
No, I'm sorry. I was at the market.

1051
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:03,660
I'd like to know when he'll see me.

1052
01:00:03,694 --> 01:00:06,031
I've already been waiting an hour.

1053
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,301
I'll go find out, sir.

1054
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,102
Setauket.

1055
01:00:10,137 --> 01:00:12,542
That's where I know you from.

1056
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,810
You were working at Strong Manor.

1057
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:19,046
Tell me, do you miss Long Island?

1058
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:21,648
No, sir.

1059
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,416
I'm happy here.

1060
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,020
I do.

1061
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:29,153
I can picture it in my mind even now.

1062
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:41,868
The last time we met, you stabbed a
man in the neck with this over dinner.

1063
01:00:41,902 --> 01:00:45,407
An enemy spy I was hoping to turn double.

1064
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,711
Your behavior was savage.

1065
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:51,547
It was that same savagery, apparently,
that landed you a court-martial.

1066
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,816
Thank you, sir.

1067
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,451
There's no need to remind me of that night.

1068
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,152
It's still fresh in my mind.

1069
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,222
- But...
- Yes?

1070
01:00:58,256 --> 01:01:01,927
I must confess to wondering why
you've summoned me here today.

1071
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:03,963
The Queen's Rangers lack a commander.

1072
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,799
The last murdering savage who
had that job went rogue on me,

1073
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,367
so I need a new one.

1074
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,102
<i>Someone who can bridle these men</i>

1075
01:01:10,136 --> 01:01:12,737
and ready them for a special
mission I'm planning.

1076
01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:18,776
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

1077
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,124
A demotion?

1078
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,627
The Queen's Rangers are
provincial forces, aren't they?

1079
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,064
Don't touch that.

1080
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:46,035
If I accepted that post, I'd
no longer be a royal officer.

1081
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,968
You'll retain your rank, Captain.

1082
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:50,236
But not my uniform.

1083
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,703
And at the risk of sounding mercenary,

1084
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:53,940
I imagine my pay will be cut as well.

1085
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:56,606
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

1086
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,553
Would you rather go back to the commissary?

1087
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:14,489
I'm offering you one last
chance at resurrection.

1088
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,658
I suppose that depends
on how you look at it.

1089
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,393
It seems to me that while murdering savages

1090
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:22,960
can be purchased on any corner,

1091
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:26,264
those that can command
other murdering savages

1092
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:27,900
are a rarer commodity.

1093
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:30,136
What do you want?

1094
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,040
Whilst we await this special mission,

1095
01:02:33,074 --> 01:02:35,709
may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?

1096
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:37,310
You'll have a ship at your disposal,

1097
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:38,847
so as long as I can
reach out to you quickly,

1098
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,350
that shouldn't be a problem.

1099
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,421
Then consider me at your disposal.

1100
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:45,358
I already do. You may leave at once.

1101
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:48,229
Oh, and good luck with your new men.

1102
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:51,794
Rogers trained them to hate British
officers even more than the rebels.

1103
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:53,898
I suppose I'll have to charm them.

1104
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,598
Thank you, Major.

1105
01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:14,540
I'll tell your former mistress
that you're happy here.

1106
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,280
André: <i>A detestable man.</i>

1107
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:25,583
But sadly sometimes such
men can serve a purpose.

1108
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:29,220
<i>Abigail?</i>

1109
01:03:29,254 --> 01:03:30,488
You want something?

1110
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:33,290
Sir, I bought this at the market

1111
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:35,224
with the money you paid me.

1112
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:36,925
It's for my son.

1113
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,527
He's never had anything so fine.

1114
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,628
- <i>I was hoping...</i>
- Say no more.

1115
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,196
I'll have it sent out at once

1116
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,934
with a dispatch rider headed for New York.

1117
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:45,368
Thank you, sir.

1118
01:03:45,402 --> 01:03:47,602
I'll wrap it up right away.

1119
01:03:55,922 --> 01:03:57,823
Abe's voice: <i>October 16.</i>

1120
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:05,634
<i>My fellow boarder's tip proves well-founded.</i>

1121
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:08,502
<i>Heavy naval activity at the west wharf.</i>

1122
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:17,882
<i>Cannon emplacements at the Battery.</i>

1123
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,716
<i>Nine-pounder on a naval carriage</i>

1124

<i>Two frigates, the 32-gun Alarm</i>

<i>Hessians, 200 foot.</i>

<i>More cannon on the Battery.</i>

1141

<i>A dozen 24-pounders and

<i>No doubt to wound men

<i>Troop barges moored at Old Slip.</i>

<i>They're secured by chains and

1148
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,142
- Hello there. Ahem.
- Oh, pardon.

1149
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:57,945
This isn't... your room is the next one.

1150
01:06:02,186 --> 01:06:04,021
Is, uh...

1151
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:06,790
is there something wrong with
the eggs I've boiled for you?

1152
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:10,459
No, I just...

1153
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,928
I like my eggs warm.

1154
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,305

<i>(knocking)</i>

01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:04,214
Who is it?

1158
01:07:04,249 --> 01:07:06,651
<i>Major Hewlett.</i>

1159
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:13,021
Ah, Mrs. Strong.

1160
01:07:13,056 --> 01:07:17,024
I was afraid it would be too late,
but then I saw your light.

1161
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:19,425
How can I help you, Major?

1162
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:21,726
I have received a package

1163
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:24,797
from Major André from Philadelphia.

1164
01:07:24,831 --> 01:07:26,698
I believe it to be another gift

1165
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:29,701
from your former slave Abigail to her son.

1166
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:32,866
Cicero is asleep now, but I'm sure
he'll be very excited to receive it.

1167
01:07:32,901 --> 01:07:35,436
I thought to bring it personally
because I have some news

1168
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,004
which I think you'll be pleased to hear.

1169
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,171
Yes?

1170
01:07:39,205 --> 01:07:43,311
Seeing you with Mrs. Woodhull's
coterie made me realize anew

1171
01:07:43,345 --> 01:07:46,148
how difficult this ordeal
must have been for you.

1172
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:49,686
Forced from your home
and unable to take part

1173
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:52,523
in the ordinary life of the town,

1174
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:54,558
all by the treachery of a man

1175
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:59,397
whose name you have to drag
behind you like a sea anchor.

1176
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,197
So, I saw the judge.

1177
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:06,839
And he sees no impediment
to you securing a divorce.

1178
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,540
Oh.

1179
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,375
You can argue desertion.

1180
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:13,846
I hadn't considered it yet,
but here, let me...

1181
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,479
The only caveat is that it
might take more than a year.

1182
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:20,282
And so in the meantime, I thought

1183
01:08:20,317 --> 01:08:23,749
that I might make you a proposal.

1184
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,586
A proposal?

1185
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:29,088
I of course don't mean

1186
01:08:29,123 --> 01:08:31,953
in the formal sense of the word.

1187
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,788
I, um...

1188
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:38,126
thought that if perhaps you might be open

1189
01:08:38,161 --> 01:08:41,695
to establishing a friendship.

1190
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:44,066
Entirely platonic, of course.

1191
01:08:44,101 --> 01:08:45,935
"Play-tonic"?

1192
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,070
Yes, owing to the ideals of Plato

1193
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:50,475
that is attributed to his feelings

1194
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,411
with the prophetess Diotima.

1195
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:54,748
Feelings, he felt,

1196
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:57,253
unencumbered by the base Eros,

1197
01:08:57,287 --> 01:09:01,221
was a surer way to the
contemplation of the divine.

1198
01:09:01,256 --> 01:09:02,923
Major.

1199
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:08,030
Yes.

1200
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:10,333
Yes, of course.

1201
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:14,704
I didn't mean to presume.

1202
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:16,973
<i>Uh, good night.</i>

1203
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:19,640
Major.

1204
01:09:19,674 --> 01:09:22,111
Abigail's gift.

1205
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:24,651
Oh.

1206
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:26,686
Yes, how foolish of me.

1207
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:32,263
Good night.

1208
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,973
__

1209
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:12,704
__

1210
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:15,440
Clinton: <i>Ah, a whiff of civilization.</i>

1211
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:19,745
- Why, it almost reminds me of Paris.
- London.

1212
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:22,482
Tell me about our host in case
I'm forced to converse with him.

1213
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:24,753
The Shippens are the cream
of Philadelphia society.

1214
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,458
This ball is their way of welcoming us.

1215
01:10:27,493 --> 01:10:30,532
So clearly there can be no
doubt about their loyalties?

1216
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:32,235
Actually, it is a bit unclear.

1217
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,905
Judge Shippen opposed the
extension of royal authority,

1218
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,874
at least where taxation is concerned.

1219
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:41,208
But he also opposed last year's
Pennsylvania constitution.

1220
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,612
Though perhaps because it
threatened his own authority

1221
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:44,914
as much as the Crown's.

1222
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:47,049
So is the man for us or against us?

1223
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:50,824
Families such as the Shippens
imagine they are above us, sir.

1224
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:53,293
Well, above you, maybe.

1225
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:57,399
<i>And yet, with hair like that,
they can't help but tower.</i>

1226
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:58,968
It's a miracle it doesn't topple.

1227
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,705
- Who is...
- Margaret Shippen, their youngest.

1228
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:05,577
And as for the high roll,
it's the latest fashion.

1229
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:07,345
Looks French to me.

1230
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:09,714
Oh, there's Cornwallis.

1231
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,818
I can't resist a chance to tweak Charlie

1232
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:15,623
about how Washington foxed him at Trenton.

1233
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:32,516
A pleasure, Lieutenant.

1234
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,252
Likewise, Miss Shippen.

1235
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:38,425
The very instant I saw you did
my heart fly to your service.

1236
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:41,327
Do you quote Shakespeare to all the ladies?

1237
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:44,965
Only the ones that stir
a tempest in my heart.

1238
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,936
I think you do, for that was well-rehearsed.

1239
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,104
(Women giggli)

1240
01:11:52,737 --> 01:11:55,035
At least they don't kiss
in the continental style.

1241
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,504
It disorders one's high roll,

1242
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:58,975
and I've already put poor
Freddy through enough today.

1243
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:01,812
Have a care, Peggy. You'll
scare off all the eligible men.

1244
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:05,552
- Freddy: She's right.
- That's because to Becky all men are eligible.

1245
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,821
And I expect when we're her
age, we'll feel the same.

1246
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:09,723
- Thank you, Becky.
- You're welcome, Becky.

1247
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,192
By the time I'm Miss Redman's age,

1248
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,463
I expect to be on my second husband.

1249
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:15,231
Ever the romantic.

1250
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:18,168
But first you may want to find number one.

1251
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:21,874
And who would you pick, Freddy,
from this pool of too eager candidates?

1252
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:24,745
I guess that depends on
what one looks for in a man.

1253
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,783
If I were Peggy,

1254
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:30,154
I would choose someone

1255
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:32,924
tall and dashing.

1256
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,331
Maybe someone with an elegant little braid.

1257
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:38,299
Then again, I'm sure our Peggy is immune

1258
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,438
to such superficial inducements.

1259
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:49,846
Why, Peggy, he didn't even smile at you.

1260
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,885
A man immune to the
charms of Margaret Shippen.

1261
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,486
What has the world come to?

1262
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:57,820
I suspect he's more Freddy's type after all.

1263
01:12:57,854 --> 01:12:59,589
One can dream.

1264
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:02,530
It's your deal, Becky.

1265
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:04,935
Age before beauty.

1266
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:06,370
Youth before wisdom.

1267
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:08,640
I'll deal.

1268
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,484
Now what is that infernal man doing?

1269
01:13:17,587 --> 01:13:19,523
(Playing up-tempo music)

1270
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:21,622
Killing the ambiance, apparently.

1271
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:28,427
Not so, apparently.

1272
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,672
Major John André at your service, ladies.

1273
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:50,939
What service are you offering, Major?

1274
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,472
Why, a dance, of course.

1275
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,909
May I have the pleasure?

1276
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:09,123
May I have the pleasure, Miss Franks?

1277
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:21,936
General, I heard a rumor

1278
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,371
that you can lead a minuet
as expertly as a charge.

1279
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:26,173
- Is it true?
- Perhaps.

1280
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,341
But would your father approve, Miss Shippen?

1281
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,175
Do you require his approval?

1282
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,310
I thought you were the
highest authority in this room

1283
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,178
if not this city.

1284

1287
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,670
Major André.

1288
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:32,605
Miss Shippen.

1289
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:34,709
So you know my name after all.

1290
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,679
I know your family quite well.

1291
01:15:36,714 --> 01:15:38,616
Or of them anyway.

1292
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,886
And I know nothing of you.

1293
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,156
Except perhaps that you
asked my friend to dance

1294
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,725
in an attempt to induce jealousy.

1295
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,962
Do you really think women
are so easily manipulated?

1296
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:50,466
We're dancing, aren't we?

1297
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,301
There's a fine line between
confidence and arrogance, Major.

1298
01:15:54,335 --> 01:15:56,435
I'm sure you'll tell me if I cross it.

1299
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,572
I'm reserving judgment.

1300
01:15:59,606 --> 01:16:04,138
Still, why not aim directly
at what you're after?

1301
01:16:04,172 --> 01:16:07,310
When I saw you turn away other men,
I knew a stratagem was called for.

1302
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:10,078
If not to pique your jealousy,
then at least your curiosity.

1303
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:12,113
You like to play games, don't you?

1304
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:13,215
As do you.

1305
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:14,719
This may be a game to a man,

1306
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:16,719
but to a woman, the stakes are very real.

1307
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,591
Even to a very lovely young woman?

1308
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,692
A woman's allure rests on her saying no.

1309
01:16:21,726 --> 01:16:24,962
But no matter how lovely,
she can only say no for so long

1310
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:28,299
or she ends up like my poor
Becky, an old maid at 26.

1311
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,100
<i>(Music ends)</i>

1312
01:16:30,135 --> 01:16:31,702
You may have won this dance, Major,

1313
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:34,237
but who's to say there'll be another?

1314
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:38,139
Is this the fate of every
man to fall under your spell?

1315
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:40,672
One whirl around the dance
floor and then oblivion?

1316
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:43,042
How many others do you
think there have been?

1317
01:16:43,076 --> 01:16:45,445
I won't hazard a guess,
but I'm sure you entertained

1318
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:47,614
some rebel officers before we came to town.

1319
01:16:47,648 --> 01:16:50,517
More tolerated than entertained.

1320
01:16:52,153 --> 01:16:55,622
What about that scamp who gave
us so much trouble at Saratoga?

1321
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:58,025
Benedict Arnold.

1322
01:16:58,059 --> 01:17:00,260
I hear he once stayed at your house.

1323
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:02,462
When I was 14.

1324
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,298
If my eyes are any judge,

1325
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:06,834
I imagine he must still think of you.

1326
01:17:06,868 --> 01:17:09,038
Do you?

1327
01:17:10,241 --> 01:17:12,840
I wonder, what games are we playing now?

1328
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:16,809
<i>(Music resumes)</i>

1329
01:17:16,844 --> 01:17:18,912
Boccherini's minuet.

1330
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:20,847
Dare I request another dance?

1331
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:25,785
Just one more, perhaps.

1332
01:17:32,406 --> 01:17:34,608
No breakfast? You paid for it.

1333
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:37,611
Uh, no. I can't, I'm afraid. Long trip back.

1334
01:17:37,645 --> 01:17:39,079
Best be on my way.

1335
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:41,746
How about some bread for the road?

1336
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,845
Fine.

1337
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:47,684
Let's see.

1338
01:17:47,718 --> 01:17:49,985
Here you go.

1339
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,855
Law studies off to a good start?

1340
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:53,591
I hope so.

1341
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,093
It's not really for me to judge.

1342

<i>For a man cocooned with his books,</i>

1343

you managed quite a sunburn.

1344
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:03,766
Old habits, I suppose.

1345
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,336
I was a farmer before I took up the law.

1346
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,406
I thought why waste the
whole of a lovely day indoors

1347
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,508
when I could be out committing
my case to memory?

1348
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:12,377
Thank you.

1349
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:13,912
I had a lovely stay.

1350
01:18:13,947 --> 01:18:17,347
And I expect I'll be back soon.

I think the law agrees with me.

I'm glad someone enjoyed himself.

Well, you keep dreaming of
holy ground, Mr. Eastin.

Someday you'll get your just reward.

1357

Hold on there. Need to see those bags first.

1358
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,444
Right.

1359
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:50,347
There you go.

1360
01:18:57,621 --> 01:18:59,553
What's this?

1361
01:18:59,588 --> 01:19:02,089
- Lunch.
- Let's see it.

1362
01:19:02,992 --> 01:19:04,726
If you must.

1363

Looks like someone's robbed the henhouse.

Can you spare a couple?

Help yourself.

1366
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:18,905
Just avoid the brown ones,
though. They're a little sour.

1367
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:22,643
What brown ones? All
right, then. Off you go.

1368
01:19:25,514 --> 01:19:28,515
- Hyah. Hyah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

Yeah.

1374
01:19:53,218 --> 01:19:55,221
I think I left something in my room.

1375
01:19:55,255 --> 01:19:58,295
It's already been rented out.

1376

- Oh.
- You don't look well, sir.

Here you go. I still owe you breakfast.

1378
01:20:24,388 --> 01:20:26,123
I didn't order this.

1379
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:29,792
I know, but you didn't stick to
your porridge either, did you?

1380
01:20:43,002 --> 01:20:45,669
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

It was hard-boiled.

01:21:12,512 --> 01:21:15,980
That one had a bitter taste.
I couldn't serve it.

1386
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:17,848
Then why did you take it in the first place?

Would you rather I had
served it to that gentleman?

I'm sorry, I... I never got your name.

The name's Townsend. Robert Townsend.

Boy.

1393

My name ain't boy.

1394
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,470
You calling me a liar, boy?

Oh, yeah, it's Aak... Aak-in-balls, right?

Akinbode.

1397

Major Rogers' pet monkey.

01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,246
You and that Indian.

1399
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,184
What was his damn name?

- Awass-hole.
- Awass-hole.

1401
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:27,192
Aak-in-balls and Awass-hole, that's right.

1402
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:29,395
Only the Indian left when Rogers did.

1403
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:32,134
But you're still here.
Why are you here, boy?

1404
01:22:32,168 --> 01:22:35,135
I earned my place just like the rest of you.

1405
01:22:35,169 --> 01:22:37,669
Right.

My name is Captain John Graves Simcoe

01:23:34,126 --> 01:23:36,293
than you have to serve
under a royal officer.

01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:41,464
These are my orders and
yours are to obey mine.

1425
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:44,132
If you do, I promise to mold you

1426
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,268

01:24:40,494 --> 01:24:43,561
You could kill me and then stuff
my body in some animal's burrow

1440
01:24:43,596 --> 01:24:45,465
<i>and say you never saw me.</i>

1441
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:49,001
That is, of course, if you can kill me.

1442
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,521
(Grunts)

1443
01:25:04,555 --> 01:25:07,627
- (cracks)
- (Screams)

1444
01:25:07,662 --> 01:25:09,896
(grunts)

1445
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,568
- (groans)
- Thank you.

1446
01:25:13,836 --> 01:25:15,236
(Screams)

1447
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,736
One more for your collection.

1448
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:27,147
Now then, where were we?

1449
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,015
No!

1450
01:25:32,484 --> 01:25:34,552
(Groaning)

1451
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:37,623
My hope, of course,

1452
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:41,227
is that our lessons won'.

1453
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:42,261
<i>(Pistol cocks)</i>

1454
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:44,664
(gunshot)

1455
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:58,375
Now, let's try this again.

1456
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:06,882
Fall in.
