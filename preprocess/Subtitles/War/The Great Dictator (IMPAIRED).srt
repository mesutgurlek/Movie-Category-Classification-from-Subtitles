Never mind. We can start again.

01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:32,000
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.

Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.

Wonderful green fields,
and they grow apples and grapes.

975

Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard
in Osterlich.

And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there,
he said he'd take me with him.

Now we can all go together.

It'll be wonderful living in the country.

Much better than a smoky old city.

980
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:57,442
And if we work hard and don't eat much,
we can save money.

01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,612
We can buy a chicken farm.

There's nice money

The coast is clear. Listen.

Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

What?

What does this Commander Schultz
want of us?

He wants us to blow up the palace.

999
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,685
What?

1000
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,189
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

1001
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,901
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such
a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.

1002
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,153
I knew he was up to some mischief.

1003
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,863
Sure, he is!

1004
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,574
I came in the kitchen this evening...

1005
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,368
and found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

1006
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,913
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?

1007
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,666
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:41,463
[Schultz] Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

1009
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,967
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

1010
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,596
In order to carry out this plan,
one of us must die.

1011
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,061
In ancient times,
the Aryan tribe of Langobardians...

1012
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,022
made human sacrifice to the god Thor.

1013
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,318
At a feast by lottery
the victim was chosen.

1014
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,988
Tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen.

1015
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,078
Each man will receive a pudding.

1016
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,622
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

1017
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,959
Whoever gets that coin must give up his
life for the liberation of his people.

1018
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:23,755
But he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs...

1019
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,592
and will rid his country of a tyrant.

of all of us...

to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.

1027
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,791
It must be done by somebody like us.

1028

I can't see it like that.

1029

Gentlemen, if this is a question of
my honor, it's very embarrassing.

Commander Schultz,
l apologize for my friend.

And let me say on behalf
of myself and the others...

01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,893
that we consider it a great privilege
to die for our country.

1033
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:24,107
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now
retire until fate has chosen the liberator.

Until then, hail Hynk...

Let me tell you.

If Commander Schultz is found
in this house...

Then get rid of him.

You can't throw him out.

Of course not.

upon him the force of your personality.

we must put him in his place.

- By means of applied psychology.

by making him feel inferior.

This can be done in many subtle ways.

For instance, at this interview,
l have so arranged...

01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,305
that he will always be
looking up at you...

At all times his position
will be inferior.

Mmm. Excellent.

Then again, we shall seat him here
beside your bust...

1349
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,277
so that if you relax,
that will always be glaring at him.

that he shall enter
from the far end of the room.

[Officer]
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

1725
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:31,502
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

1726
01:57:36,341 --> 01:57:38,384
"Corona veniet delectis."

"Victory shall come to the worthy."

1728
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:46,767
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1729
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:49,562
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1730
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:51,230
They stand in the way of action.

1731
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,232
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1732
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:58,904
In the future, each man will serve the
interest of the state with absolute obedience.

1733
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,031
Let him who refuses beware.

1734
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:05,494
The rights of citizenship will be taken
away from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1735
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:08,914
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1736
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:12,418
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1737
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:16,672
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1738
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:20,551
and the people of this nation will obey the
laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

1739
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:26,098
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

1740
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:30,060
the future emperor of the world.

1741
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:32,813
You must speak.

1742
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:35,274
I can't.

01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:37,943
You must. It's our only hope.

01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:31,497
I'm sorry...

1746
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:33,499
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1747
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,668
That's not my business.

1748
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,253
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1749
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,255
I should like to help everyone,
if possible...

1750

Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1751
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:47,262
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1752
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:50,599
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1753
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:53,102
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

1754
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:56,355
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

1755
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:58,357
and can provide for everyone.

1756
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:01,485
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1757
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:03,612
But we have lost the way.

1758
02:00:03,697 --> 02:00:06,240
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1759
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:08,617
has barricaded the world with hate...

1760
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:11,620
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1761
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:15,082
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1762
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:18,210
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1763
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:22,214
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1764
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:25,134
We think too much and feel too little.

1765
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:27,803
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1766
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:31,473
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1767
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:35,811
Without these qualities, life will
be violent, and all will be lost.

1768
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:38,605
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1769
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:41,900
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1770
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:45,404
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1771
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:48,490
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1772
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:51,785
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1773
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:56,874
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1774
02:00:56,958 --> 02:01:00,335
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1775
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:03,589
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1776
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:07,426
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1777
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:10,804
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1778
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:14,433
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1779
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:18,312
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1780

Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

who drill you, diet you, treat you
like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!

Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men...

machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

1786

You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

1788

You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

1789
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:49,802
The unloved and the unnatural.

fight for liberty!

it is written...

1792
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,226
"The kingdom of God is within man."

1793
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:00,896
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men... in you!

1794
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,023
You the people have the power...

the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

1796

to make this life free and beautiful...

to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1798
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,327
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

Let us all unite!

Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

that will give men a chance to work...

1802
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:25,420
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1803
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:28,465
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1804
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:32,427
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

1805

but they enslave the people.
