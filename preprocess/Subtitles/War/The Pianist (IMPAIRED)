I came specially to meet you. I love your playing.

Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

I don't know what to take. You always take too much.

I've been worried sick. I told her not to worry.

00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,652
Mama, what is it?

168
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:13,522
Twenty zlotys.

169
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:17,961
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

170
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,963
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

171
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:30,070
I am sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.

172
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:40,081
That's the price. That's what I'm offering.

173
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:43,554
My advice is to accept. You won't get more from anyone else.

174
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,753
But it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa. 2,000... and my advice is to take it.

175
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,989
What are you gonna do when you're hungry, eat the piano?

176
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,931
Get out, you dirty bastard! What's the matter with you?

177
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,696
We'd rather give it away! Go on, get out! Haven't you eaten today?

178
00:13:56,804 --> 00:14:00,069
What're you suffering from?

179
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,642
You people are crazy.

180
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,543
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand, and I'm paying for the removal.

181
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,207
I'm not even charging for the removal!

182
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,216
You haven't eaten today.

183
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,753
You're crazy. Take it.

184
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,346
Dorota.

185
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,493
Hi.

186
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,962
I didn't want to come.

187
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,799
I didn't want to see all this, but I-- I couldn't stop myself.

188
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,929
How are you doing? Fine.

189
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,099
Good.

190
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:12,008
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.

191
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,548
Jurek says they'll let him out.

192
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,015
This is disgraceful.

193
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,518
It won't last long. Don't worry.

194
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,988
That's what I said, it's so--

195
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,525
It's too absurd.

196
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,132
I, uh, I should--

197
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:40,437
Well, I'll-- I'll see you... soon.

198
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,879
Good-bye.

199
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:05,661
Well, to tell you the truth,

200
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:08,428
I thought it would be worse.

201
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:15,841
Where will we sleep?

202
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,377
I'll sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

203
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,676
You, Henryk and Papa in here.

204
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,278
Look!

205
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,547
Come and look.

206
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,414
Go away, go away!

207
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,289
Papa? Papa?

208
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,693
Papa!

209
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,698
Papa.

210
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,476
Sell anything? Just one. Dostoyevsky, The Idiot. Three zlotys.

211
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:34,076
It's better than yesterday. Three lousy zlotys.

212
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,122
And there are people here making millions. I know.

213
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,419
You don't know, believe me.

214
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,689
They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye.

215
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:47,199
They're bringing in cartloads: food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

216
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,861
And the poor are dying all around them, they don't give a damn.

217
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,804
Excuse me. Have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?

218
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,343
A tall, handsome man with a little gray beard.

219
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,344
No? Afraid not.

220
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,505
All right, excuse me.

221
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,947
Good-bye. Sleep well.

222
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:09,114
But, but if you see him, write to me. Yes? Izaak Szerman.

223
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,498
Why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area?

224
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,667
Why can't they go around?

225
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:34,440
Don't worry about it. They're about to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

226
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,641
A bridge? A bridge? A shmidge.

227
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,379
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

228
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:44,082
You know what I think? I think they are totally stupid.

229
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,158
I have a family to feed.

230
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,785
I spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through.

231
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:53,196
Why do they think I come here? To listen to the music?

232
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,204
Come. Come. Dance!

233
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,820
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:29,123
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.

235
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,968
What's this about? Sit down, have tea.

236
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,561
I'll start lunch when the girls get back.

237
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,775
So, what are you doing here? He brought cakes.

238
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:54,582
His father's back in the jewelry business. He's doing well, eh?

239
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:59,886
Amazing.Jewelry.

240
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,120
We're recruiting. Who's recruiting?

241
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,130
Don't be clever with me. I've come here as a friend.

242
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,223
They're bringing Jews in from all over the country.

243
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:10,531
Soon there'll be a half-million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police.

244
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,606
Oh! More Jewish police.

245
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,370
You mean you want me to beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!

246
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,139
Somebody's got to do it, Henryk. But why me?

247
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,738
I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers.

248
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,147
Look at my father. Look at us. I mean--

249
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,152
Yes, I'm looking! That's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life.

250
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,952
- You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books? - Yes, please.

251
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:37,326
I'm doing you people a favor. What about you, Wladek?

252
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,899
You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,865
They'd welcome you with open arms.Join us.

254
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,402
You've got no work. Thank you. I've got work.

255
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:31,545
Right. Yes, of course.

256
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,711
I'm sorry, Wladek, he wants you to stop.

257
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,656
Who wants me to stop?

258
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,106
I always say, look on the bright side! You're in the small ghetto.

259
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:38,673
Intellectuals, professional people. You're better off than us.

260
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,619
Here in the large ghetto, it's a cesspool. Jehuda, give me something to do.

261
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:46,658
You're an artist. You keep people's spirits up. You do enough.

262
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:50,422
But I want to help. I want to do something. You're too well-known.

263
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,467
And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators.

264
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,938
You're too... too... musical!

265
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,076
What was that?

266
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,546
Symche. Majorek.

267
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,483
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.

268
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,714
There are always notices going up. Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,256
Dolek. Mrs. Zyskind.

270
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,889
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:29,025
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,229
Wladyslaw Szpilman. Meet Majorek.

273
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,273
I know your name.

274
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:36,342
I've never heard you play.

275
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:39,571
Majorek used to be in the army. Brilliant man.

276
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,874
The only thing I've got against him is he's not a socialist.

277
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,852
You better go now, Wladek. It's nearly curfew.

278
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,981
You know how many copies we print of our newspaper?

279
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,059
Five hundred.

280
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,687
You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.

281
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,561
That makes 10,000 readers.

282
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,897
These will start the uprising.

283
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,733
Majorek hides them in his underpants, and leaves them in toilets.

284
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,238
Toilets, huh?

285
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,674
As many toilets as I can find. Germans never use Jewish toilets.

286
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,576
They're too clean for them.

287
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,711
Please. Please, help, sir.

288
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:02,719
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,227
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

290
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:10,269
Come on, boy.

291
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:18,641
Stand up. Stand up! Stand up!

292
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,645
Stand up. Stand up.

293
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:53,710
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about.

294
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,747
Enjoy our meal.

295
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:59,285
Fine. Then I'll tell you something funny. Do you all know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?

296
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:03,412
- The surgeon? - The surgeon. For some reason-- don't ask me why--

297
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,081
the Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation.

298
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:09,957
On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew?

299
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,896
He got a pass. That's all I know. Anyway.

300
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,627
He puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation.

301
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,169
He's just made the first incision when the SS burst in,

302
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:22,901
shoot the patient on the table, then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there.

303
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,978
Isn't that a laugh?

304
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,881
The patient didn't feel a thing, he was anesthetized.

305
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,851
I said nothing bad, Henryk.

306
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:38,356
What's the matter with you all? Huh? Huh? You lost your sense of humor?

307
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,449
It's not funny.

308
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:44,723
You know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.

309
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:49,131
What are you talking about my tie for? What does my tie have to do with anything?

310
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,635
I need this tie for my work. Your work?

311
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:56,038
- That's right, I work. - Yes. Playing the piano for the parasites in the ghetto.

312
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:59,407
- Parasites. - Boys. Boys!

313
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,675
- They don't give a damn about people suffering. - You blame me for their apathy.

314
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,945
I do. I see it every day. They don't even notice what's going on around them.

315
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,077
- I blame the Americans. - For what? For my tie?

316
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:12,089
American Jews, and there are lots of'em.

317
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,160
What have they done for us? What do they think they're doing?

318
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:18,788
People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat.

319
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:23,301
The Jewish bankers there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany.

320
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,646
Lights, lights!

321
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,379
You!

322
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,642
Up!

323
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,760
Shh, Mama.

324
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,925
What? Oh, my God. Shh.

325
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:04,060
Oh, my God.

326
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,343
Excuse me. I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.

327
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,886
Yes, go in. Not you.

328
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:51,333
What's happened? What? God. It's terrible.

329
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:55,505
They're hunting people in the streets. They've taken Henryk.

330
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,118
Go home, all right? Go home.

331
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,187
I'll take care of it.

332
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:16,833
Excuse me. Have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?

333
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,633
I'm afraid not. He's tall, handsome, a little gray beard.

334
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,574
If you see him, write to me. Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

335
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,320
What happened here?

336
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:40,518
They've got my grandson. They pick him up. They take him away.

337
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,585
What do they do to them? I've stopped believing in God.

338
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,894
Excuse me. Excuse me.

339
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,458
Yitzchak?

340
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:54,335
Yitzchak.

341
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,204
Wladek Szpilman.

342
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,977
Henryk's in there. I haven't seen him.

343
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,848
Believe me, they've picked him up. Tough luck.

344
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,915
Can you help?

345
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,222
Ha! Now you need me. Yes, now you need me.

346
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,924
- Can you help us? - It costs.

347
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,966
I've no money.

348
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,798
Then there's nothing I can do. You should've joined us when you had the chance.

349
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:27,771
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.

350
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:30,365
Who told you? People.

351
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,138
People I know. They said you're an important man.

352
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,714
Yitzchak?

353
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:02,297
Bandit! Boom! Boom! Kaput.

354
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,208
Kaput!

355
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:12,114
Zigarette? Mm. Danke schoen.

356
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:37,338
Help! Help!

357
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:41,277
A snatcher! A snatcher! Help! Help! A snatcher!

358
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:38,062
Why'd they pick you up? So you go to Yitzchak Heller.

359
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,731
Did I ask you to talk to him? You're out, aren't you?

360
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:47,336
Did you beg? Did you grovel to that piece of shit? No, I asked him to help you.

361
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,437
What did you pay him?

362
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,276
With what could I pay him? With what?

363
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:57,321
Every zloty I earn we spend on food. I can look after myself.

364
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,653
They were taking you away. It's got nothing to do with you!

365
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,694
It's me they wanted, not you.

366
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,162
Why do you have to interfere with other people's business?

367
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:10,599
You're mad. That's your trouble, is you're mad. That's also my business.

368
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:21,379
Hold it. What's the matter?

369
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,005
What's the matter? Are you sick?

370
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,880
Hungry.

371
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,619
Employment certificate?

372
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:39,129
What's that mean, no employment certificate?

373
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,631
You have to have an employment certificate...

374
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,895
to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise--

375
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,801
Otherwise, what? You will be deported.

376
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:50,535
So the rumors are true. They're going to resettle us.

377
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:54,477
Send us to labor camps in the East.

378
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,606
And they're closing the small ghetto.

379
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,584
My God.

380
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,768
Wladek? Wladek?

381
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,602
I thought you'd be off on tour playing London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

382
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,641
Not this week. You look terrible.

383
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:27,804
Have you heard the rumors? They're going to resettle us in the East.

384
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:32,213
Rumors! You take it all too much to heart. What's the trouble?

385
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:36,754
I've been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father.

386
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,790
I've managed to get one for me and the rest of my family.

387
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:41,758
But I need another one for my father. I've been to all the firms and shops.

388
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,091
Why didn't you come to me?

389
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:47,791
I didn't know you were in the certificate business. I'm not, but Majorek is.

390
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,269
Can you help? I have no money.

391
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:56,671
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?

392
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:59,336
Be at the Schultz Workshop tomorrow, 4:00.

393
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,380
See what a wonderful piece of luck you've had today?

394
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,006
That's the historical imperative in action.

395
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:09,019
That's why I always say, look on the bright side. The bright side. Yes, I know.

396
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,900
How's your back?

397
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:27,063
Better. Better?

398
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,141
Better than last week.

399
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,886
Thank you.

400
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:47,322
My pleasure. It won't help you anyway!

401
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,028
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

402
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,200
Well, at least we got work in the ghetto.

403
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,966
At least we're still together.

404
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,370
Du.

405
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,538
Du. Du.

406
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,717
Du.

407
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,278
Du.

408
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,792
Du.

409
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,736
I'm sorry. I did my best.

410
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,036
I thought the certificates would save us.

411
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:52,007
Stop it, Wladek!

412
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:55,205
Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off.

413
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:25,332
Where will we be going? You're going to work.

414
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:28,777
You'll be much better off than in this stinking ghetto. Move.

415
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:35,315
Why did I do it?

416
00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:38,116
Why did I do it, huh?

417
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:41,317
Why did I do it?

418
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:44,988
Why did I do it?

419
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:47,964
Why did I do it?

420
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,570
Why did I do it?

421
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:58,234
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

422
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,806
Why did I do it?

423
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:06,180
Why did I do it?

424
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:33,670
Don't you have a drop of water?

425
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,009
He's dying. My child's dying of thirst.

426
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:38,447
No. I'm sorry. I beg you. I beg you.

427
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,041
Don't you have a drop of water? I beg you.

428
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:44,121
Can you hear what I'm saying? I'm telling you it's a disgrace!

429
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:47,158
I can hear you! We let them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

430
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,523
Not so loud. Why don't we attack them?

431
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:53,291
There's half a million of us here. We could break out of the ghetto.

432
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:56,061
At least we could die honorably, not as a stain on the face of history.

433
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:59,069
Why are you so sure they're sending us to our death? I'm not sure!

434
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:03,631
You know why I'm not sure? Because they didn't tell me. They're gonna wipe us all out.

435
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:08,338
What do you want me to do? Do you want me to fight? To fight you need organization--

436
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:12,042
He's right. What do you think I can do, fight them with my violin bow?

437
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,813
The Germans will never squander a huge labor force like this.

438
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,387
They're sending us to a labor camp. It's obvious.

439
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,481
Oh, sure! Look at that cripple there.

440
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:23,686
Look at the old people, the children. They're gonna work?

441
00:44:23,796 --> 00:44:27,857
Look at you? You gonna carry iron girders on your back?

442
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,802
Henryk! Halina! Henryk!

443
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:15,402
Halina! Henryk!

444
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:25,051
We heard you were here.

445
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,648
We wanted to be with you.

446
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,634
We wanted to be with you.

447
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:41,035
Stupid, stupid.

448
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,736
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

449
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:48,642
She's getting on my nerves.

450
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:55,452
What did she do, for God's sake?

451
00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:57,954
She smothered her baby.

452
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:03,690
They prepared a hiding place, so, of course, they went there.

453
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,696
But the baby cried just as the police came.

454
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:08,891
She smothered the cries with her hands.

455
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,866
The baby died.

456
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,870
Apoliceman heard the death rattle,

457
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,497
found where they were hiding.

458
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:32,588
Mama.

459
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,463
What are you reading?

460
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:48,304
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?

461
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,841
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

462
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:53,309
"If you poison us, do we not die?

463
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:56,677
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"

464
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:07,625
Very appropriate. Yes, that's why I brought it.

465
00:47:25,244 --> 00:47:28,236
Idiot. What's he think he's going to do with the money?

466
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:30,781
Hey, boy?

467
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:32,907
Come here.

468
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:35,281
Come here.

469
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,883
How much for a caramel? Twenty zlotys.

470
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:42,358
What, for one caramel? What do you think you're going to do with the money?

471
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:44,655
Twenty zlotys.

472
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:48,830
Have we got 20 between us?

473
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:51,494
I got ten, I think.

474
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:04,582
Why?

475
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,245
Why did I do it?

476
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:36,680
Why did I do it? Why did I--

477
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,600
Halina? What?

478
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:26,409
It's a funny time to say this, but-- What?

479
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:32,050
I wish I knew you better.

480
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:38,083
Thank you.

481
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,808
Szpilman!

482
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,844
Szpilman.

483
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,817
Fuck off, stupid. Go!

484
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,752
Papa. Papa!

485
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:09,982
Papa!

486
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,059
Mama! Halina!

487
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:15,823
Halina! Mama!

488
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,830
What do you think you're doing, Szpilman?

489
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,594
I've saved your life! Now, get out! Just go. Go!

490
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:26,205
Don't run!

491
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,538
Mama! Mama!

492
00:50:32,647 --> 00:50:34,808
Mama!

493
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:57,471
Well, off they go to the melting pot. Ja.

494
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:11,544
What are you doing? She's pregnant!

495
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,152
Left-Hut!

496
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,330
Forward!

497
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,999
Wladek!

498
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:00,916
Why are you here, Wladek?

499
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:05,086
It's like this, I-- I--

500
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:08,662
We--

501
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:13,759
All of them. All of them.

502
00:54:13,868 --> 00:54:15,836
All of them.

503
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:20,266
Perhaps they are lucky. The quicker, the better.

504
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:24,811
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here for a couple of days...

505
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:26,971
until things die down.

506
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:30,050
I've bribed a policeman. He'll come when it's over.

507
00:54:50,604 --> 00:54:54,404
My God. I haven't been outside in-- it must be two years.

508
00:54:54,508 --> 00:54:57,375
Don't get overexcited.

509
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:16,321
Gold. A very good price.

510
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,651
Someone you know?

511
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,017
A beauty. Who is she?

512
00:55:42,122 --> 00:55:44,522
She's a singer. I know her well, actually.

513
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:47,526
Her husband's an actor. They're good people.

514
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:51,758
I'd like to talk to her. Don't forget, they hang them for helping Jews.

515
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:48,080
Achtung!

516
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:33,253
How long have you been here?

517
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,328
Since last night.

518
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,490
I was pleased to see you.

519
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,128
They're going to start a final resettlement now.

520
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,708
We know what it means.

521
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:55,078
We sent someone out-- Zygmunt. A good man.

522
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:01,017
His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw.

523
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,419
He got to Sokolow.

524
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,518
A local railway man told him the tracks divided,

525
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,596
one branch leading to Treblinka.

526
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:15,196
He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw...

527
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:18,429
branched off to Treblinka and returned empty.

528
00:59:18,572 --> 00:59:21,598
No transports of food are ever seen on that line.

529
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,911
And civilians... are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station.

530
00:59:31,018 --> 00:59:32,986
They're exterminating us.

531
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:39,159
It won't take them long.

532
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,993
We're 60,000 left out ofhalf a million.

533
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,667
Mostly young people.

534
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,504
And this time we're gonna fight.

535
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:57,971
We're in good shape, organized.

536
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:01,440
We're prepared.

537
01:00:01,548 --> 01:00:03,482
If you need help, I--

538
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:27,164
You! Come here!

539
01:00:27,307 --> 01:00:29,207
Oh, Shit. Shit.

540
01:00:37,918 --> 01:00:42,787
Sorry. I'm sorry. I-- I-- I don't know what I was thinking.

541
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:49,890
No. Please, don't. Please.

542
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:51,965
Please.

543
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:56,161
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig!

544
01:00:56,303 --> 01:01:00,330
Und zag! Und zig! Und zag! Und zig!

545
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:05,138
Und zag! Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!

546
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,545
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!

547
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:33,671
I hope you play the piano better than you carry bricks.

548
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,712
He won't last long if he goes on like this.

549
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:41,713
I'll see if I can get him something better.

550
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:06,171
Trouble.

551
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:12,636
Fall in! Only the Jews!

552
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:15,772
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!

553
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,148
I have good news for you.

554
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,819
There are rumors go around...

555
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:32,365
that we like to, uh-- Umsiedlung--

556
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:34,366
resettle you.

557
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:40,803
I promise you that now and in the future,

558
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:43,876
nothing else is plan-ned.

559
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,412
Ja?

560
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,607
For this reason,

561
01:02:49,716 --> 01:02:52,617
we put information posters on the wall.

562
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:57,088
To show you our goodwill,

563
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,590
you should vote one of you...

564
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:04,357
to be allowed-ed to go in town daily...

565
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:08,958
and bring three kilos kartoffel--

566
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:11,093
potato, ja?

567
01:03:11,238 --> 01:03:13,638
And one loaf of bread...

568
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,708
for each of your workers.

569
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:19,334
So, why should we do something else like this...

570
01:03:19,446 --> 01:03:21,346
if we would resettle you?

571
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:25,345
You can make good business...

572
01:03:25,452 --> 01:03:27,477
out of the things you don't eat.

573
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:33,116
Isn't that something where you Jews are good in?

574
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,126
Make money?

575
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,782
That one-- with the string.

576
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:01,353
The others are tied by wire.

577
01:05:09,356 --> 01:05:11,654
Now.

578
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:50,020
Majorek.

579
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:53,698
I've a favor to ask.

580
01:05:55,235 --> 01:05:57,430
I want to get out of here.

581
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:02,907
It's easy to get out.

582
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:05,239
It's how you survive on the other side that's hard.

583
01:06:05,345 --> 01:06:08,143
I know. I know.

584
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:12,241
Last summer I worked for a day in Zelanzna Brama Square.

585
01:06:12,352 --> 01:06:15,753
I saw someone I knew. She's an old friend.

586
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:17,914
A singer. Her husband's an actor.

587
01:06:21,027 --> 01:06:23,291
I've written their names down and their address--

588
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,296
if they're still there.

589
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,094
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.

590
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,134
They're good people.

591
01:06:31,304 --> 01:06:33,397
Would you try and make contact?

592
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,472
They go to town. Would you just ask them?

593
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,308
Ask them if they'll help me get out of here.

594
01:08:02,796 --> 01:08:04,764
Uh--

595
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,346
I, uh--

596
01:09:21,274 --> 01:09:23,174
I tried your friends.

597
01:09:23,276 --> 01:09:26,074
They don't live there anymore. But... you made contact?

598
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:29,573
Be ready to leave. When?

599
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:31,582
Soon. Halt!

600
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:35,814
Oh, shit. Shit.

601
01:09:38,024 --> 01:09:40,458
- Und zig! Und zag!

602
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,587
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!

603
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:47,666
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!

604
01:09:58,178 --> 01:10:02,239
- Nein.

605
01:10:11,658 --> 01:10:13,751
Achtung! Marsch!

606
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,034
? Their ranks unite ?

607
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,161
? And follow the white eagle ?

608
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,273
? Stand up and fight ?

609
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,432
? Our mortal enemies ?

610
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:31,567
? Rifle, grenade ?

611
01:10:31,678 --> 01:10:33,578
? Let's give them fire and brimstone ?

612
01:10:35,682 --> 01:10:37,707
Now.

613
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,896
I'm sorry. I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

614
01:13:06,032 --> 01:13:08,500
We haven't much time. Come on.

615
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:18,241
- We must hurry.

616
01:13:18,344 --> 01:13:20,244
Here. See if these fit.

617
01:13:20,346 --> 01:13:22,906
Going to have to keep moving.

618
01:13:23,016 --> 01:13:25,644
Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now.

619
01:13:25,752 --> 01:13:28,812
Jews, non-Jews. Anybody. Everybody.

620
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:31,321
Oh, and, uh, Wladek, better shave.

621
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:33,392
Use my razor on the shelf.

622
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:50,876
You'll be looked after by Marek Gebczynski.

623
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,103
He's on the other side of town.

624
01:13:53,212 --> 01:13:55,772
You'll stay there tonight, then we'll find you somewhere else.

625
01:13:57,784 --> 01:13:59,547
I'll bring you food.

626
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:01,950
All right. Let's go.

627
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,120
I'll show you where you're going to sleep.

628
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,691
You have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.

629
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:20,698
We have a flat for you near the ghetto wall.

630
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,825
But it's safe.

631
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,976
It's not going to be very comfortable.

632
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:35,138
I'll be fine.

633
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,258
Thank you.

634
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:05,906
I'll take it. Yeah. Give it to me.

635
01:16:06,012 --> 01:16:08,742
Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section.

636
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:03,260
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

637
01:17:09,342 --> 01:17:11,401
But you leave them open during the daytime.

638
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,478
Don't forget.

639
01:17:15,181 --> 01:17:19,345
Must feel better of this side of the wall, huh?

640
01:17:19,452 --> 01:17:22,353
Yes.

641
01:17:22,455 --> 01:17:25,583
But sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

642
01:17:28,828 --> 01:17:32,093
Some bread... potatoes, onions.

643
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:34,098
I will come again.

644
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,100
And Nina Bogucki will visit twice a week,

645
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,260
bring more food, see how you are.

646
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,769
Luck.

647
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,401
Oh. This is very important.

648
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:48,844
In case of emergency-- I mean, emergency--

649
01:17:48,948 --> 01:17:50,916
go to this address.

650
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:10,302
Ohhh.

651
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:29,821
Ohhh.

652
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:36,417
Puppy-dog, what do you mean you forgot?

653
01:18:36,529 --> 01:18:39,327
What do you think I mean, kitten. I forgot, that's what I mean.

654
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:42,128
You know what? You treat me like dirt.

655
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:44,964
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.

656
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:47,629
Pig. Pig!

657
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,673
Bitch! Dirty pig!

658
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:53,609
You are a dirty pig. Takes one to know one, pig!

659
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:00,010
Mmm. You play like an angel, kitten.

660
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:02,679
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?

661
01:19:02,788 --> 01:19:05,018
I was listening, kitten. Liar.

662
01:19:05,124 --> 01:19:07,524
You fell asleep. Pig.

663
01:20:23,769 --> 01:20:25,703
- Fire! - Fire!

664
01:21:54,193 --> 01:21:56,320
Schiessen.

665
01:22:20,419 --> 01:22:22,387
Thank you.

666
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,652
I wanted to come earlier, but-- No, no, no. Thank you.

667
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,999
No one thought they'd hold out so long.

668
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,135
I never should have come out.

669
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,262
I should have stayed there and fought with them. Wladek, stop that.

670
01:22:41,407 --> 01:22:43,307
It's over now.

671
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:45,934
Just be proud it happened.

672
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,673
My God, did they put up a fight.

673
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,079
Yes, well,

674
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:53,083
so did the Germans.

675
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:56,916
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it.

676
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,581
Jews fighting back.

677
01:23:00,693 --> 01:23:02,593
Who would've thought?

678
01:23:02,695 --> 01:23:05,596
Well, what good did it do?

679
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:07,757
What good?

680
01:23:07,866 --> 01:23:10,596
Wladek, I'm surprised at you.

681
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,170
They died with dignity, that's what good it did.

682
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,434
And you know something else?

683
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:18,476
Now the Poles will rise.

684
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:20,511
We're ready.

685
01:23:20,613 --> 01:23:23,548
We'll fight too. You'll see?

686
01:23:38,063 --> 01:23:41,226
Get your things together. You have to leave.

687
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:44,860
What? What's happened?

688
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,005
I'm on the run. Why? What's happened?

689
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,098
The gestapo found our weapons.

690
01:23:51,677 --> 01:23:53,838
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

691
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:57,973

704
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,071
- Let me see your identity card! - Yes. Of course.

705
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:29,582
- I want to see your identity card! - What's happening?

706
01:28:29,688 --> 01:28:34,022
He's a Jew! A Jew! Stop the Jew!

707
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,828
Don't let him out! Stop him!

708

I've... been in hiding.

723
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,228
I need somewhere to stay.

724
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,525
He'll be here soon.

725
01:30:56,735 --> 01:30:59,898
How long have you been married? Just over a year.

726
01:31:02,908 --> 01:31:04,842

727

This is not a good time to have children, but then--

733
01:31:24,596 --> 01:31:27,997
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.

734

Oh, yes. I remember.

Uh, don't worry now.

Oh. Excuse me.

740
01:32:03,235 --> 01:32:05,499
I'm sorry. Could I have a piece of bread?

741
01:32:05,637 --> 01:32:08,333

01:37:07,205 --> 01:37:09,469

This is Antek Szalas.

01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,580
He will be looking after you.

755
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:21,345
How do you do? Thank you. Oh. How do you do?

756
01:37:21,453 --> 01:37:24,354
I've given him a second key.

757
01:37:24,456 --> 01:37:27,084
He'll bring you food, see that you're all right.

758
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:29,319
He's with the underground. He's a good man.

759
01:37:33,698 --> 01:37:38,362
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman. No. I don't think so.

I'll get a doctor. You can't. It's too dangerous.

797
01:41:27,812 --> 01:41:29,712
I'll get Doctor Luczak. We can trust him.

798
01:41:29,814 --> 01:41:33,341
Dorota, don't be ridiculous. He's a pediatrician. He's still a doctor.

799
01:41:33,484 --> 01:41:37,079
No. You stay. I'll go.

There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now.

804
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:29,563

He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw.

806
01:42:34,145 --> 01:42:37,581
Apparently, people gave generously.

807
01:42:37,715 --> 01:42:39,649
So he collected a tidy sum.
