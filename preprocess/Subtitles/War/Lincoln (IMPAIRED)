[Terrible battle and  cannons noise]

00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,331
HAROLD GREEN:  Some of us
was in the Second Kansas Colored.

4
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,779
We fought the rebs at
Jenkins’ Ferry last April,

5
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:12,728
just after they’d killed every Negro
soldier they captured at Poison Springs.

6
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,234
So at Jenkins’ Ferry,

7
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,745
we decided warn’t taking no reb prisoners.

8
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,044
And we didn’t leave a one of ‘em alive.

9
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,748
The ones of us that didn’t die that day,

10
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,077
we joined up with the116th U.S.
Colored, sir.

11
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,915
From Camp Nelson Kentucky.

12
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,508
LINCOLN: What’s your name, soldier?

13
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,477
Private Harold Green, sir.

14
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,547
I’m Corporal Ira Clark, sir.

15
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,252
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.

16
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,309
We’re waiting over there.

17
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,809
We’re leaving our horses behind,

18
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,584
and shipping out with the 24th Infantry

19
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,010
for the assault next week on Wilmington.

20
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,798
LINCOLN: How long’ve you been a soldier?

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,460
Two year, sir.

22
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,526
LINCOLN: Second Kansas Colored Infantry,

23
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:59,198
they fought bravely at Jenkins’ Ferry.

24
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,421
That’s right, sir.

25
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,479
They killed a thousand
rebel soldiers, sir.

26
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,488
They were very brave.

27
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:08,009
And making three dollars less
each month than white soldiers.

28
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,159
Us 2nd Kansas boys...

29
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,141
Another three dollars subtracted
from our pay our pay for our uniforms.

30
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,107
That was true, yes sir, but....

31
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,611
Equal pay now, but still no
commissioned Negro officers.

32
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,332
LINCOLN: I am aware of that, Corporal Clark.

33
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,740
Yes, sir, that’s good you’re aware, sir.
It’s only that...

34
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,241
LINCOLN: Do you think
the Wilmington attack...

35
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,146
Now that white people have
accustomed themselves

36
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:28,165
to seeing Negro men with guns,
fighting on their behalf,

37
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,950
and now that they can tolerate
Negro soldiers getting equal pay,

38
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:36,723
maybe in a few years they can abide the
idea of Negro lieutenants and captains.

39
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,970
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.

40
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:43,498
In a hundred years... the vote.

41
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:50,102
What’ll you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?

42
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,493
CLARK: Work, sir.
Perhaps you’ll hire me.

43
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,066
Perhaps I will.

44
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:00,291
But you should know, sir, that I get sick

45
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,035
at the smell of boot black
and I cannot cut hair.

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,266
I’ve yet to find a man could cut
mine so it’d make any difference.

47
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,879
CLARK: You got springy hair for a white man.

48
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,910
Yes, I do. My last
barber hanged himself.

49
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,277
And the one before that.

50
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,419
Left me his scissors in his will.

51
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,444
[Green laughs]

52
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,851
– FIRST WHITE SOLDIER: President Lincoln, sir?
– Evening, boys.

53
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,465
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER:
We saw you at, um, we...

54
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,312
– We were at, uh, at...
– We was at Gettysburg!

55
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:29,838
You boys fight at Gettysburg?

56
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,568
Naw, we didn’t fight there.
We just signed up last month.

57
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,795
We saw him two years ago
at the cemetery dedication.

58
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,962
Yeah, we heard you speak,
we, uh... ah damn, damn damn!

59
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:39,915
Uh, hey, how tall are you anyway?!

60
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,361
Jeez, shut up!

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,601
Could you hear what I said?

62
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,926
FWS: No, sir, not much.
It was....

63
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,435
“Four score and seven years ago,

64
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,861
our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation,

65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,315
conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition

66
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:53,740
that all men are created equal.

67
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,275
That’s good, thank you.

68
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:57,101
FWS: “Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

69
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,275
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived

70
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,332
and so dedicated can long endure.

71
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,918
We are-we are-we are met
on a great battlefield of that war.”

72
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:05,909
That's good, thank you.

73
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,286
SWS: “We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field

74
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,721
as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives

75
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,050
that that nation might live.

76
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,634
– It is...”.
– His uncles,

77
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,406
they died on the second day of fighting.

78
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,173
I know the last part. “It is...

79
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,601
– <i>VOICE: Company up! Move it out!</i>
– it is rather...

80
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:22,627
LINCOLN: Boys, best go and
find your company. Thank you.

81
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,642
Thank you, sir.
God bless you.

82
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:26,283
LINCOLN: God bless you too.

83
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,248
CLARK: “That we here highly resolve

84
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,079
that these dead shall
not have died in vain.

85
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,664
That this nation, under God,

86
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:51,136
shall have a new birth of freedom,

87
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,886
and that government of the
people, by the people,

88
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:58,940
for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.

89
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:28,867
LINCOLN: It’s nighttime.

90
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,494
The ship’s moved by some terrible
power, at a terrific speed.

91
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,836
Though it’s imperceptible in the darkness,

92
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,823
I have an intuition that we’re
headed towards a shore.

93
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,587
No one else seems to be
aboard the vessel and I...

94
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,491
I'm kinny aware of my aloneness.

95
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:55,351
LINCOLN: I could be bounded in a nutshell
and count myself a king of infinite space

96
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,858
were it not that I have bad dreams.

97
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,271
I reckon it’s the speed
that’s strange to me,

98
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,724
I’m used to going a deliberate pace.

99
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,572
I should spare you Mary,
I shouldn’t tell you my dreams.

100
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:13,036
MARY: I don’t want to be spared if you aren’t!

101
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,247
And you spare me nothing.

102
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,660
MARY: Perhaps it’s...

103
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,908
it’s the assault on Wilmington port.

104
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:26,937
You dream about the ship
before a battle, usually.

105
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,715
How’s the coconut?

106
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,758
Beyond description.

107
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,499
Almost two years, nothing mends.

108
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,414
Another casualty of the war.

109
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:45,551
Who wants to listen to a useless woman
grouse about her carriage accident?

110
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,714
– I do.
– Stuff!

111
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:52,320
You tell me dreams, that’s all,
I’m your soothsayer,

112
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,829
that’s all I am anymore,
I’m not to be trusted...

113
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,754
Even if it wasn’t a carriage accident,

114
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,310
even if it was an attempted assassination.

115
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,747
– It was most probably an ass...
– MARY: It was an assassin,

116
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,003
whose intended target was you.

117
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:13,238
How’s the plans coming along
for the big shindy?

118
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,640
I don’t want to talk about parties.

119
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,311
MARY (CONT'D): You don’t care about parties.

120
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:21,116
Not much but they’re a
necessary hindrance.

121
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,924
I know...

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,398
I know what it’s about, the ship.

123
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:38,336
It's not Wilmington Port,
it’s not a military campaign!

124
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,248
It’s the amendment to abolish slavery!

125
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:47,171
Why else would you force me to invite
demented radicals into my home?

126
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:53,907
MARY: You’re gonna try to get the amendment
passed in the House of Representatives,

127
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,903
before the term ends,
before the Inauguration.

128
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:59,527
Don’t spend too much money
on the flub dubs.

129
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,265
No one’s loved as much as you,

130
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:08,350
no one’s ever been loved
so much by the people,

131
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,349
you might do anything now.

132
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:15,556
Don’t, don’t waste that power on an
amendment bill that’s sure to defeat.

133
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,002
MARY: Did you remember Robert’s
coming home for the reception?

134
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,767
I knew you’d forget.

135
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,912
That’s the ship you’re sailing on.
The Thirteenth Amendment.

136
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,845
MARY: You needn’t tell me I’m right,
I know I am.

137
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,969
Oh it’s late, Mrs. Keckley.

138
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,966
She needs this for the grand reception.

139

00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:06,003
far from guaranteed, since when has
our party unanimously supported anything?

158
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:09,508
but say all our fellow
Republicans vote for it,

159
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,584
We’d still be twenty votes short.

160
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,023
– Only twenty?
– Only twenty!

161
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,336
We can find twenty votes.

162
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:19,527
Twenty House Democrats
who’ll vote to abolish slavery,

163
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,217
in my opinion...
– To which I always listen.

164
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:25,598
– Or pretend to.
– With all three of my ears.

165
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:30,132
We’ll win the war soon.
It’s inevitable, isn’t it?

166
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,548
LINCOLN: Ain’t won yet.

167
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:36,573
You’ll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.

168
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,581
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring!

169
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:43,200
Why tarnish your invaluable luster
with a battle in the House?

170
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,133
It’s a rats’ nest in there,

171
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:48,074
the same gang of talentless
hicks and hacks who

172
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:51,142
rejected the amendment
ten months ago. We’ll lose.

173
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,064
I like our chances now.

174
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,371
SEWARD: Well, consider the
obstacles we would face.

175
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:04,378
The aforementioned two-thirds majority
needed to pass an amendment.

176
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,765
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than fifty percent.

177
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:09,330
LINCOLN: Fifty-six.

178
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,964
We need Democratic support.

179
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,462
There’s none to be had.

180
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,521
Since the House last voted on
the amendment, there’s been an election.

181
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:21,231
Sixty-four Democrats lost their
House seats in November, that’s...

182
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,929
sixty-four Democrats looking for work

183
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,217
come March
– I know.

184
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:26,983
They don’t need to worry
about re-election,

185
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:28,406
they can vote however it suits ‘em.

186
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:29,760
But we can’t, um...
[knocks on door]

187
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,708
buy the vote for the amendment,
it's too important.

188
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,847
[Knocks on door]

189
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:35,747
LINCOLN: I said nothing of buying anything.

190
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:38,285
We need twenty votes was all I said.

191
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,518
Start of my second term,
plenty of positions to fill.

192
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:49,690
NICOLAY: Mr. President, may I present Mr.
and Mrs. Jolly who’ve come from Missouri to...

193
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,481
MR JOLLY: From Jeff City, President.

194
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,044
LINCOLN: Mr. Jolly.
Ma'am.

195
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,665
This by the fire’s
Secretary of State Seward.

196
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,421
Jeff City.

197
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:10,582
I heard tell once of a...
Jefferson City lawyer,

198
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:14,560
who had a parrot
that’d wake him each morning,

199
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:17,822
crying out, “Today is the day
the world shall end

200
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,650
as scripture has foretold.”

201
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:25,606
And one day...
the lawyer shot him

202
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,994
for the sake of peace
and quiet, I presume,

203
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,998
thus fulfilling, for the
bird at least, its prophecy.

204
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:46,453
There’s only one tollbooth in Jeff City,
to the southwest,

205
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,472
and this man Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla

206
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,989
been in illegal possession
for near two year, since

207
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,009
your man General Schofield
set him up there.

208
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:58,768
But President Monroe give
that toll gate to my granpap

209
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,638
and Quincy Adams...

210
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:04,667
give my pap a letter saying
it’s our’n for keeps.

211
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:06,398
Mrs. Jolly got the...

212
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,745
Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams letter.

213
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:12,834
LINCOLN: That’s unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.
Just tell me what you want from me.

214
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,337
Mr. Jolly’s emphysema
don’t care for cigars.

215
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:22,652
Madame. Do you know about the proposed
Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution?

216
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,002
Yes sir, everybody knows of it.
The President favors it.

217
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,691
– But do you?
– We do.

218
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,848
You know that it abolishes slavery?

219
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,147
Yes sir. I know it.

220
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:33,579
And is that why you favor it?

221
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,785
What I favor is ending the war.

222
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:40,966
Once’t we do away with slavery,
the rebs will quit fighting,

223
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,797
since slavery’s what they’re fighting for.

224
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,248
Mr. Lincoln, you always say so.

225
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,679
MRS JOLLY: With the amendment,
slavery’s ended and they’ll give up,

226
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,292
the war can finish then.

227
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:56,590
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery,

228
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,974
would...
– President Lincoln says

229
00:16:57,988 --> 00:16:59,571
the war won’t stop unless

230
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:01,149
we finish slavery...
– But...

231
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,351
if it did.
The South is exhausted.

232
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:08,893
SEWARD: If they run out of bullets and men,

233
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,943
would you still want your, uh...

234
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:13,463
Who’s your representative?

235
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:16,445
LINCOLN: Jeff City? That’s, uh,
Congressman Burton?

236
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,845
“Beanpole” Burton. I mean,
Josiah Burton, yes.

237
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:24,287
LINCOLN: Republican. Undecided on the
question of the amendment, I believe.

238
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,218
Perhaps you could call on him
and inform him of your enthusiasm.

239
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,001
– Yeah...
– SEWARD: Madam?

240
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,847
If the rebels surrender next week,

241
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,889
would you, at the end of this month,

242
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,811
want Congressman Burton to vote
for the Thirteenth Amendment?

243
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,993
If that was how it was,
no more war and all,

244
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:50,929
I reckon Mr. Jolly’d much prefer not
to have Congress pass the amendment.

245
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:56,864
SEWARD: And, uh... why’s that?

246
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,531
Niggers.

247
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:02,688
MRS. JOLLY: If he don’t have to let
some Alabama coon come up to Missouri,

248
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:05,731
steal his chickens and his job,
he’d much prefer that.

249
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:13,341
The people! I begin to see why you’re
in such a great hurry to put it through.

250
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,470
Would you let me study this letter,
sir, about the tollbooth?

251
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:22,154
LINCOLN: Come back to me in the morning,
and we’ll consider what the law says.

252
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,590
LINCOLN: And be sure to visit “Beanpole”,

253
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,403
and tell him that you support
passage of the Amendment,

254
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:34,000
as a military necessity.

255
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,381
NICOLAY: Thank you.

256
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,345
LINCOLN: Oh, Nicolay,
when you have a moment...

257
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:22,151
If procuring votes with offers
of employment is what you intend,

258
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,318
I’ll fetch a friend from Albany
who can supply the skulking men

259
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:27,747
gifted at this kind of shady work.

260
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,817
Spare me the indignity of
actually speaking to Democrats.

261
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,987
Spare you the exposure and liability.

262
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,213
LINCOLN: Pardon me, that’s a distress signal,

263
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:43,697
which I am bound by
solemn oath to respond to.

264
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:50,627
Tom Pendel took away the glass camera
plates of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over

265
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,646
because Tom says mama says
they’re too distressing, but...

266
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,304
You had nightmares all night,
mama’s right to...

267
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:57,023
I’ll have worse nightmares, if you
don’t let me look at the plates again!

268
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,972
LINCOLN: Perhaps.

269
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:05,167
SEWARD: We can't afford a single
defection from anyone in our party,

270
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,917
not even a single Republican
absent when they vote.

271
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,494
You know who you’ve got to see.

272
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,939
Send over to Blair House.

273
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:21,246
Ask Preston Blair can I call on him
around five o’clock.

274
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:23,235
God help you.

275
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,444
God alone knows what
he’ll ask you to give him.

276
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:32,339
If the Blairs tell ‘em to, no Republican
will balk at voting for the amendment.

277
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,844
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: No conservative
Republican is what you mean.

278
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,335
PRESTON BLAIR: All Republicans
ought to be conservative,

279
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:39,855
I founded this party
in my own goddamned home

280
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:43,449
to be a conservative antislavery party,

281
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,983
not a hobbyhorse for
goddamned radical abolitionists.

282
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:49,425
ELIZABETH BLAIR: Damp down the
dyspepsia, daddy, you’ll frighten the child.

283
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,928
MONTGOMERY: You need us to keep the
conservative side of the party in the traces

284
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:56,561
while you diddle the radicals and
bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens’s gang,

285
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:59,494
you need our help.
– Yes, sir, I do.

286
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,769
– Well, what do we get?
– Whoo! Blunt!

287
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:06,020
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln...

288
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,085
pushed you out of his cabinet.
– PRESTON: He was pushed out.

289
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,013
– I wasn’t pushed.
– Oh of course you weren’t.

290
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,569
– MONTGOMERY: I agreed to resign.
– PRESTON: He was pushed out

291
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,155
to placate the goddamn
radical abolishonists!

292
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,421
ELIZABETH: Oh Daddy, please!
Daddy.

293
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,235
Oh. You don’t mind, boy, do you?

294
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,061
He spends his days with soldiers.

295
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:26,085
– They taught me a song!
– Did they?

296
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:29,139
PRESTON: Soldiers know
all manner of songs.

297
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,625
PRESTON: How’s your brother Bob?

298
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,685
He’s at school now, but he’s coming
to visit in four days. For the shindy!

299
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:37,123
PRESTON: t school? Ain’t that fine!

300
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:38,912
Good he’s not in the army!

301
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:40,734
TAD: He wants to be,
but mama said he can’t...

302
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,672
Dangerous life, soldiering.

303
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:45,589
Your mama is wise to
keep him clean out of that.

304
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:51,264
Now... your daddy knows that what I want,
in return for all the help I give him,

305
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,643
is to go down to Richmond like he said
I could, as soon as Savannah fell,

306
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,389
and talk to Jefferson Davis.

307
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:02,970
PRESTON: Give me terms I can
offer to Jefferson Davis

308
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:06,423
to start negotiating for peace,
he’ll talk to me!

309
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,959
Conservative members of your party

310
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:14,419
want you to listen to overtures
from Richmond. That above all!

311
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,907
They’ll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment

312
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:22,482
only if every other
possibility is exhausted.

313
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:25,167
Our Republicans ain’t abolitionists.

314
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:28,683
We can’t tell our people they can vote yes

315
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:32,846
on abolishing slavery unless
at the same time we can tell ‘em

316
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,107
that you’re seeking a negotiated peace.

317
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,140
ELIZABETH: Leo, it’s a
hundred miles to Richmond.

318
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,421
Get him drunk so he can sleep.
– Yes ma'am.

319
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:52,590
Here, daddy.

320
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:56,147
– Oh. Thank you.
– Let’s fix this up...

321
00:22:56,998 --> 00:22:59,694
– Where’s my hat?
– Leo has your hat.

322
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:04,057
All right?
Go make peace.

323
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:18,734
Thunder forth, God of War!

324
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,461
STANTON: We’ll commence our
assault on Wilmington from the sea.

325
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,176
Why is this burnt?

326
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,819
Was the boy playing with it?

327
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,133
LINCOLN: It got took by
breeze several nights back.

328
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,006
This is an official War Department map!

329
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,405
SEWARD: And the entire cabinet’s
waiting to hear what it portends.

330
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,290
WELLES: A bombardment.

331
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,606
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.

332
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,281
LINCOLN: Old Neptune,
shake thy hoary locks!

333
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:50,254
WELLES: Fifty-eight ships are underway,
of every tonnage and firing range.

334
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:53,001
STANTON: We’ll keep up a steady barrage.

335
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,968
Our first target is Fort Fisher.

336
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,562
It defends Wilmington Port.

337
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,929
JAMES SPEED: A steady barrage?

338
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,689
A hundred shells a minute.

339
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,124
Till they surrender.

340
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:05,830
– WILLIAM FESSENDEN: Dear God.
– WELLES: Yes, yes.

341
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,862
LINCOLN: Wilmington’s their
last open seaport. Therefore...

342
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,992
STANTON: Wilmington falls,
Richmond falls after.

343
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,563
SEWARD: And the war is done.

344
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,768
JOHN USHER: Then why, if I may ask,

345
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:23,364
are we not concentrating
the nation’s attention on Wilmington?

346
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:26,759
Why, instead, are we
reading in the Herald,

347
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,583
that the anti-slavery amendment
is being precipitated

348
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,288
onto the House floor for debate?

349
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:35,142
Because your eagerness, in what seems
an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive

350
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:38,290
into Legislative prerogatives,
is compelling it to it’s...

351
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,486
to what’s likely to be
its premature demise.

352
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:42,519
You hear?

353
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,777
You signed the Emancipation
Proclamation, you’ve done

354
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:47,091
all that can be expected.
– The Emancipation Proclamation’s

355
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:49,345
merely a war measure.
After the war the courts will make

356
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:50,463
a meal of it.
– When Edward Bates

357
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:52,106
was Attorney General,
he felt confident in it enough

358
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,371
to allow you to sign.
– Different lawyers, different opinions.

359
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,411
It frees slaves as a military
exigent, not in any other...

360
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,328
LINCOLN: I don’t recall Edward
Bates being any too certain

361
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,322
about the legality of my Proclamation...

362
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,945
just it wasn’t downright criminal.

363
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,419
Somewhere’s in between.

364
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:17,222
Back when I rode the legal
circuit in Illinois,

365
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:20,386
I defended a woman from Metamora named

366
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:24,256
Melissa Goings, 77 years old.

367
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:28,148
They said she murdered
her husband, he was 83.

368
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,302
He was choking her, and, uh, she

369
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:34,138
grabbed a hold of a stick of fire wood and

370
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:36,946
fractured his skull, ‘n he died.

371
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,174
In his will he wrote:

372
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:44,788
“I expect she has killed me.

373
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:51,237
If I get over it, I will have revenge.

374
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,045
No one was keen to see her convicted,
he was that kind of husband.

375
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,080
I asked the prosecuting attorney
if I might have a short conference

376
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,933
with my client.
And she and I

377
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:11,726
went into a room in the courthouse,
but I alone emerged.

378
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:14,173
The window in the room
was found to be wide open,

379
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,011
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.

380
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,631
I told the bailiff...

381
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,101
Right before I left her in the room,

382
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:25,275
she asked me where she could get
a good drink of water,

383
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,689
and I told her Tennessee.

384
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:32,579
Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora.

385
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,737
Enough justice had been done.

386
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,334
They even forgave the bondsman her bail.

387
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,281
– JOHN USHER: I’m afraid I don’t see...
– LINCOLN: I decided

388
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,644
that the Constitution gives me war powers,

389
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,087
but no one knows just exactly
what those powers are.

390
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:54,268
Some say they don’t exist.
I don’t know. I decided,

391
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:58,893
I needed them to exist to uphold
my oath to protect the Constitution,

392
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,955
which I decided meant that I could
take the rebels’ slaves from ‘em as

393
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,467
property confiscated in war.

394
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,546
That might recommend to suspicion
that I agree with the rebs

395
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:11,552
that their slaves are property in
the first place. Of course I don’t.

396
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,959
I never have, I’m glad to see any man
free, and if calling a man property, or

397
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:22,066
war contraband, does the trick,
why I caught at the opportunity.

398
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:26,231
Now here’s where it gets truly slippery.

399
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,021
I use the law allowing for
the seizure of property

400
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:33,648
in a war knowing it applies only to
the property of governments and

401
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,666
citizens of belligerent nations.
But the South ain’t a nation.

402
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,284
That’s why I can’t negotiate with ’em.

403
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:44,556
So if in fact the Negroes are
property according to law,

404
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,043
have I the right to take the
rebels’ property from ‘em,

405
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,630
if I insist they’re rebels only,
and not citizens of a belligerent country?

406
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,919
And slipperier still: I maintain it ain’t
our actual Southern states in rebellion,

407
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,931
but only the rebels
living in those states,

408
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:02,763
the laws of which states remain in force.

409
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:06,395
The laws of which states remain in force.

410
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:08,830
That means, that since it’s
states’ laws that determine

411
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:12,454
whether Negroes can be sold
as slaves, as property,

412
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:15,856
the Federal government
doesn’t have a say in that,

413
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,345
at least not yet,

414
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:22,802
then Negroes in those states
are slaves, hence property, hence

415
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:26,977
my war powers allow me to confiscate‘em
as such, so I confiscated ‘em.

416
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:29,166
LINCOLN:(CONT’D): But if
I’m a respecter of states’ laws,

417
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:32,426
how then can I legally free‘em
with my Proclamation as I done,

418
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,340
unless I’m cancelling states’ laws?

419
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,923
I felt the war demanded it.

420
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,443
my oath demanded it,

421
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:51,087
I felt right with myself, and I
hoped it was legal to do it

422
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:52,502
I’m hoping still.

423
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:58,893
Two years ago I proclaimed
these people emancipated,

424
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:03,079
" then, thenceforward and forever free.”

425
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:06,848
But let’s say the courts decide
I had no authority to do it.

426
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,905
They might well decide that.

427
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,556
Say there’s no amendment
abolishing slavery.

428
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,146
Say it’s after the war,

429
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,951
and I can no longer use my war powers
to just ignore the courts’ decisions,

430
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:19,388
like I sometimes felt I had to do,

431
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:23,436
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?

432
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:30,423
That’s why I’d like to get the Thirteenth
Amendment through the House,

433
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,644
and on its way to ratification
by the states,

434
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:36,044
wrap the whole slavery thing up,
forever and aye, as soon as I’m able,

435
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:40,508
Now! End of this month!
And I’d like you to stand behind me,

436
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,511
like my cabinet’s most always done.

437
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:56,532
As the preacher said, I could
write shorter sermons but

438
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,248
once I start I get too lazy to stop.

439
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:07,419
JOHN USHER: It seems to me,
sir, you’re describing precisely

440
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:10,296
the sort of dictator the Democrats
have been howling about.

441
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,399
JAMES SPEED: Dictators
aren’t susceptible to law.

442
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,922
USHER: Neither is he!
He just said as much!

443
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:16,359
Ignoring the courts,
twisting meanings, what...

444
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,380
what reins him in from, from...
– Well,

445
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,231
the people do that, I suppose.

446
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:25,410
I signed the Emancipation
Proclamation a year and half,

447
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,138
before my second election,

448
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,268
I felt I was within my power to do it.

449
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,283
However I also felt that I might be
wrong about that.

450
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:33,977
I knew the people would tell me,

451
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,855
I gave ‘em a year and half to think
about it, and they reelected me.

452
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:41,871
And come February the first,
I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment.

453
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:55,590
LINCOLN: Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!

454
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,683
Tell us the news from the Hill.

455
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,656
– JAMES ASHLEY: Ah! Well, news...
– Why for instance is this thus,

456
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,917
and what is the reason for this thusness?

457
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:06,560
James, we want you to bring the anti-
slavery amendment to the floor for debate.

458
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:08,046
– Excuse me, what?
– Immediately.

459
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:11,096
You are the amendment’s manager,
are you not?

460
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,298
I am, of course, but...

461
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:16,006
And we’re counting on robust
radical support, so tell Mr. Stevens

462
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:19,267
we expect him to put his back into it.
It’s not going to be easy,

463
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,229
but we trust...
– It’s impossible.

464
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:25,305
No, I am sorry, no, we can’t organize
anything immediately in the House.

465
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:28,940
I have been canvassing the
Democrats since the election,

466
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:32,230
in case any of them softened
after they got walloped. But

467
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,214
they have stiffened if anything,
Mr. Secretary,

468
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:37,225
there aren’t nearly enough votes...
– LINCOLN: We’re whalers, Mr. Ashley!

469
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:44,065
Whalers? As in, um... whales?

470
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:46,951
LINCOLN: We’ve been chasing
this whale for a long time.

471
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:49,580
We’ve finally placed a harpoon
in the monster’s back.

472
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,707
It’s in, James, it’s in!

473
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:54,196
We finish the deed now, we can’t wait!

474
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:56,980
Or with one flop of his tail,

475
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:59,893
he’ll smash the boat
and send us all to eternity.

476
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,575
SEWARD: On the 31st
of this month. Of this year.

477
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:05,020
Put the amendment up for a vote.

478
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,391
BLUFF WADE: Whalers?

479
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,705
ASHLEY: That’s what he said.

480
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:12,151
The man’s never been near
a whale ship in his life!

481
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,250
Withdraw radical support,

482
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:20,199
force him to abandon this scheme,
whatever he’s up to.

483
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:25,504
He-He... He drags his feet about
everything, Lincoln. Why this urgency?

484
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:29,344
We got it through the Senate without
difficulty because we had the numbers.

485
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,755
Come December you’ll have
the same in the House.

486
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,932
The amendment’ll be the
easy work of ten minutes.

487
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,575
ASA VINTNER LITTON: He’s using
the threat of the amendment

488
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:37,591
to frighten the rebels
into an immediate surrender.

489
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,458
SCHUYLER COLFAX: I imagine
we’d rejoice to see that.

490
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,267
Will you rejoice, when the Southern states
have re-joined the Union pell-mell as

491
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:47,035
Lincoln intends them to, and one by one
each refuses to ratify the amendment?

492
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,869
If we pass it, which we won’t.

493
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,124
Why are we... co-operating with-with him?

494
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,353
We all know what he’s doing,
and we all know what he’ll do.

495
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,667
We can’t offer up abolition’s best
legal prayer to his games and tricks.

496
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,535
He’s said he’d welcome the South
back with all its slaves in chains.

497
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,826
Three years ago he said that.
To calm the border states

498
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,508
when we were...
– VOICE: I don't.

499
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:12,579
THADDEUS STEVENS: You said
“we all know what he’ll do.” I don’t know.

500
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:14,897
– LITTON: You know he isn’t to be trusted.
– Trust? Oh...

501
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:18,992
I’m sorry, I was under the misapprehension
your chosen profession was politics.

502
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:22,199
I’ve never trusted the President.
I never trust anyone.

503
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,187
But hasn’t he surprised you?

504
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:26,027
LITTON: No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn’t.

505
00:33:27,162 --> 00:33:29,021
Nothing surprises you, Asa.

506
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,390
Therefore nothing about
you is surprising.

507
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:35,902
Perhaps that is why your constituents
did not re-elect you to the coming term.

508
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:42,505
It’s late, I’m old, I’m going home.

509
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:50,973
STEVENS (CONT’D): Lincoln the inveterate
dawdler, Lincoln the Southerner,

510
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,164
Lincoln the capitulating compromiser,

511
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,168
our... adversary and....

512
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:03,629
leader of the god forsaken
Republican Party, our party.

513
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:06,981
Abraham Lincoln has
asked us to work with him

514
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,985
to accomplish the death
of slavery in America.

515
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:14,750
Retain, even in opposition,

516
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:18,200
your capacity for astonishment.

517
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:26,228
The President is never to be mentioned.

518
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:28,720
Nor I. You’re paid for your discretion.

519
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:32,581
W.N. BILBO: Hell, you can have that for
nothin’, what we need money for is bribes.

520
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,613
It’d speed things up.

521
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:35,185
SEWARD: No. Nothing strictly illegal.

522
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:38,267
ROBERT LATHAM: It’s not illegal to bribe
Congressmen. They starve otherwise.

523
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:41,876
I have explained to
Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham

524
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,611
that we’re offering patronage
jobs to the Dems who vote yes.

525
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:47,809
Jobs and nothing more.
– SEWARD: That’s correct.

526
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:51,600
BILBO: Congressmen come cheap!
Few thousand bucks’ll buy you all you need.

527
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,843
The President would be unhappy
to hear you did that.

528
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:56,696
Well, will he be unhappy if we lose?

529
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,090
The money I managed to
raise for this endeavor

530
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:02,018
is only for your fees, your
food, and lodgings, sir.

531
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:03,432
Uh huh.

532
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:07,203
If that squirrel-infested attic you’ve
quartered us in’s any measure,

533
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,865
you ain’t raised much.

534
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,385
Shall we get to work?

535
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:13,869
[Gavel slams down]

536
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:16,433
COLFAX: The House
recognizes Fernando Wood,

537
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,768
[Democrats applaud]

538
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:21,012
the honorable representative
from New York.

539
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:26,936
FERNANDO WOOD: Estimable colleagues.

540
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,612
Two bloody years ago this month,

541
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:34,333
his Highness King Abraham
Africanus the First,

542
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:38,127
our Great Usurping Caesar,

543
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:41,301
violator of habeas corpus
and freedom of the press,

544
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,140
abuser of states’ rights...

545
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:44,946
HIRAM PRICE: If Lincoln really
were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,

546
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,582
he’d’a had your empty head
impaled on a pike!

547
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:54,475
And the country better for it!

548
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,456
Your radical republican autocrat

549
00:35:57,472 --> 00:36:00,771
ruling by fiat and martial law,

550
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:05,963
affixed his name to his on a heinous
and illicit Emancipation Proclamation,

551
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,808
promising it would hasten
the end of the war,

552
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:12,601
which yet rages on and on.

553
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,153
WOOD (CONT’D): He claimed, as tyrants do,

554
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:21,208
that the war’s emergencies
permitted him to turn our army...

555
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:25,261
LATHAM: The New York
delegation’s looking decidedly uninspired.

556
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:29,274
.. and radical Republicanism’s
abolitionist fanaticism!

557
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:31,299
[Shouts and boos from Republicans]

558
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:38,429
WOOD (CONT'D): His Emancipation Proclamation
has obliterated millions of dollars...

559
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:43,643
RICHARD SCHELL: Over in Pennsylvania...
who’s the sweaty man eating his thumb?

560
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:45,744
LATHAM: Unknown to me.
Seems jumpy.

561
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,387
Perhaps he’ll jump.

562
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:55,297
But all that was not
enough for this dictator,

563
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:57,738
who now seeks to insinuate...

564
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:58,435
BILBO: Jesus!

565
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:01,731
When’s this son-of liberty
sonofabitch gonna sit down?

566
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:04,539
SCHELL: John Ellis is going to
break his watch if he doesn’t stop.

567
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:06,859
WOOD (CONT’D): We are once again asked...

568
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:11,562
nay, commanded to consider a
proposed thirteenth amendment.

569
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:14,710
Which, if passed, shall
set at immediate liberty

570
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:18,991
four million coloreds while manacling
the limbs of the white race in America

571
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:23,538
If it is passed.
But it shall not pass!

572
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:32,886
What’s more interesting is how dismal
and disgruntled Mr. Yeaman appears.

WOOD (CONT’D): Every
member of this House....

LATHAM: He should be
cheering right now, but...

575

W.N. BILBO: Looks like
he ate a bad oyster.

WOOD (CONT’D): .. and the constituents
which it serves shall oppose!

STEVENS: A point of order,
Mr. Speaker, if you please?

578
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:47,219
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor,

579
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:48,649
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania

580
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:49,901
is out of order!
– STEVENS: When will Mr. Wood

581
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:51,932
conclude his interminable gabble?

582
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:54,401
Some of us breathe oxygen,

583
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:57,459
and we find the mephitic
fumes of his oratory

584
00:37:57,478 --> 00:38:00,932
a lethal challenge to
our pulmonary capacities.

585
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,392
WOOD: We shall oppose this amendment,

586
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:09,512
and any legislation that
so affronts natural law,

587
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,913
insulting to God as to man!

588
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:16,755
Congress must never declare equal
those whom God created unequal!

589

STEVENS: Slavery is the only insult
to natural law, you fatuous nincompoop!

of these to my room.

609
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:31,480
Is she in there?

610
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:32,638
TAD: She’s asleep, probably.

611
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:34,537
– You need help, sir? I can...
– No, sir, I don’t. No.

612
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:36,011
– PETITIONER: I can...
– ROBERT: No.

613
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:39,476
Could you bring your pa this letter
I writ about my insolvency proceedings?

614
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:41,593
ROBERT: You deliver your
own goddamned petition...

615
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:43,936
TAD: .. ‘cause there’s a new book that
Sam Beckwith says is about finches,

616
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,603
and finches’ beaks, about how they...

617
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,684
He’s here, Mrs. Cuthbert!
He’s here!

618
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,485
– Robbie...
– Hi, ma.

619
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,210
– Oh, Robbie...
– Hey.

620
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:55,235
Robbie. Oh!

621
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,700
MARY: What...?

622
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,714
You’re only staying a few days.
Why’d you pack all of that?

623
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:02,361
Well, I don’t know how long I’m...

624
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:04,099
Go tell your father Robert’s home!

625
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,557
Mr. Nicolay says daddy’s
secluded with Mr. Blair.

626
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,202
Tell him anyway.

627
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:14,301
– You forget to eat, exactly like him.
– No...

628
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:18,950
You’ll linger a few days extra, after the
reception, before you go back to school.

629
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:21,218
Well, I don’t know if I’m
gonna go back to s...

630
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:24,680
We’ll fatten you up before
you return to Boston.

631
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,206
– All right, mama.
– All right.

632
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:30,172
Oh Robbie...

633
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,903
PRESTON BLAIR: Jefferson Davis
is sending three delegates:

634
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,485
Stephens, Hunter and Campbell.

635
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,651
Vice President of the Confederacy,
their former Secretary of State,

636
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,114
and their Assistant Secretary of War.

637
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:47,632
They’re coming in earnest
to propose peace.

638
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:52,454
I know this is unwelcome news for you.

639
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:54,104
Now hear me.

640
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:58,114
I went to Richmond to talk to traitors,

641
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:02,067
to smile at and plead with traitors,

642
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:05,480
because it’ll be spring in two months,

643
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:10,224
the roads’ll be passable,
the Spring slaughter commences.

644
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:14,114
Four bloody Springs now!

645
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:19,489
Think of my Frank,
who you’ve taken to your heart,

646
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,138
how you’ll blame yourself
if the war takes my son

647
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,604
as it’s taken multitudes of sons.

648
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:31,386
Think of all the boys who’ll die
if you don’t make peace.

649
00:41:31,894 --> 00:41:33,919
You must talk with these men!

650
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,278
I intend to, Preston.

651
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:39,250
And in return, I must ask you...
– No, this is not horsetrading,

652
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,096
this is life!
– LINCOLN: NOT NOW!

653
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:44,003
LINCOLN: Bob. I’m sorry.

654
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:45,810
LINCOLN: Welcome home.
– ROBERT: Thank you.

655
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:48,196
You’re looking fit, Robert.
Harvard agrees with you.

656
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,790
–  Mr. Blair.
– Preston, son.

657
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,001
LINCOLN: If you just give us
a moment please, Robert. Thank you.

658
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:57,340
I will procure your votes for you,
as I promised, sir.

659
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:01,982
You’ve always kept your word to me.

660
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:05,112
Those Southern men are coming.

661
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:08,674
I beg you, in the name
of Gentle Christ, sir.

662
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:09,542
LINCOLN: I understand.

663
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:11,549
Talk peace with these men.

664
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,703
I understand, Preston.

665
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:17,925
LATHAM: <i>We have
one abstention so far.</i>

666
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:18,832
SCHELL: <i>Jacob Graylor.</i>

667
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:23,199
SHELL: <i>He’d like to be Federal Revenue
Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania.</i>

668
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:28,562
LATHAM: So the total of representatives voting
three weeks from today is reduced to 182,

669
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:32,538
which means 122 yes votes to reach
the requisite two thirds of the House.

670
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,984
Assuming all Republicans
vote for the amendment.

671
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:40,201
Then, despite our abstention,

672
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,768
to reach a two-thirds majority
we remain 20 yeses short.

673
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:47,569
LATHAM (CONT'D): For which we’re seeking
from among 64 lame duck Democrats.

674
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,796
Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.

675
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:56,756
BILBO: The kind that hates niggers,

676
00:42:56,948 --> 00:42:58,950
hates God for making niggers.

677
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:02,279
LATHAM: The Good Lord on High
would despair of their souls.

678
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:05,347
SEWARD: Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

679
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:08,464
SCHELL: We’ve abandoned these 39
to the Devil that possesses them.

680
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:14,419
SCHELL: The remaining lame ducks,
on whom we’ve been working with a purpose.

681
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:17,032
Charles Hanson.

682
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,647
Giles Stuart.

683
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:47,162
Nelson Merrick.

684
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,010
Homer Benson.

685
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,688
And lastly...

686
00:44:09,432 --> 00:44:12,004
BILBO: Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

687
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:14,703
CLAY HAWKINS: T-tax collector
for the Western Reserve, it...

688
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,315
Th-that pays handsomely.

689
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:20,043
BILBO: Don't just reach for the highest
branches, they sway in every breeze.

690
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:23,842
Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston
looks like the ticket to me.

691
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,007
HAWKINS: Uh, boats,
they-they make me sick.

692
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,481
So just stand on the dock.

693
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:32,005
Let the Assistant Assistant Port
Inspector’s stomach go weak.

694
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:39,501
SEWARD: And lastly, Democratic yes
vote number six. Hawkins from Ohio.

695
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:41,975
– LINCOLN; Six.
– SEWARD: Well, thus far.

696
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,183
SEWARD: Plus Graylor’s abstention.

697
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,504
From tiny acorns and so on.
– LINCOLN: Wha’d Hawkins get?

698
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:49,566
NICOLAY: Postmaster of
the Millersburg Post Office.

699
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:51,130
He’s selling himself cheap, ain’t he?

700
00:44:51,178 --> 00:44:53,576
SEWARD: Aye, he wanted tax
collector of the Western Reserve,

701
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,726
a first-term congressman
who couldn’t manage reelection,

702
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:58,309
I felt it unseemly and they
bargained him down to Postmaster.

703
00:44:58,356 --> 00:45:00,537
Scatter ‘em over several rounds
of appointments, so no one notices,

704
00:45:00,554 --> 00:45:02,617
and burn this ledger,
please, after you’re done.

705
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,723
LINCOLN: Time for my public opinion bath.

706
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,362
Might as well let ‘em in.

707
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:16,935
LINCOLN: Seven yeses
with Mr. Ellis. Thirteen to go.

708
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,669
One last item, an absurdity, but...

709
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,324
My associates report that
among the Representatives,

710
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,767
a fantastical rumor’s bruited about,

711
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:30,119
which I immediately disavowed,

712
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,575
that you’d allowed bleary old
Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond

713
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,998
to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners
up to Washington with a peace plan.

714
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:45,336
I, of course, told them you would never..

715
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:48,240
Not without consulting me, you wouldn’t...

716
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,677
Because why on earth would you?

717
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:19,512
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
Much obliged.

718
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:28,994
SEWARD: Why wasn’t I consulted?!
I’m Secretary of State!

719
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:33,423
You... you-you informally
send a reactionary dottard to...

720
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:37,917
What will happen, do you imagine,
when these peace commissioners arrive?

721
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:41,141
– We’ll hear ‘em out.
– Oh, splendid!

722
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,642
And next the Democrats will
invite ‘em up to hearings on the Hill,

723
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:47,141
and the newspapers,
well, the newspapers

724
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,860
the newspapers will ask

725
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:51,982
“why risk enraging the Confederacy
over the issue of slavery

726
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:54,411
when they’re here to make peace?”

727
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:58,085
We’ll lose every Democrat we’ve got,

728
00:47:58,264 --> 00:48:01,703
more than likely conservative Republicans
will join ‘em, and all our work,

729
00:48:01,848 --> 00:48:05,309
all our preparing the ground for
the vote, laid waste, for naught.

730
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,397
The Blairs have promised support for the
amendment if we listen to these people.

731
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:10,299
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?

732
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:12,663
You think they’ll keep their promise
once we have heard these delegates

733
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,646
and refused them?
Which we will have to do,

734
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:19,314
since their proposal most certainly will
be predicated on keeping their slaves!

735
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,098
What hope for any
Democratic votes, Willum,

736
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:25,472
if word gets out that I’ve
refused a chance to end the war?

737
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:30,370
You think word won’t get out?
In Washington?

738
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:35,931
It’s either the amendment or this
Confederate peace, you cannot have both.

739
00:48:37,254 --> 00:48:39,656
“If you can look into the seeds of time,

740
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:43,907
and say which grain will grow and
which will not, speak then to me...”

741
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,751
SEWARD: Oh, disaster.
This is a disaster!

742
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:49,105
LINCOLN: Time is a great
thickener of things, Willum.

743
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:51,014
Yes, I suppose it is.

744
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,879
Actually I have no idea
what you mean by that.

745
00:48:55,472 --> 00:48:57,274
Get me thirteen votes.

746
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,940
Them fellers from Richmond ain’t here yit.

747
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:24,183
ROBERT: You drafted
half the men in Boston!

748
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:26,766
What do you think their
families think about me?

749
00:49:27,078 --> 00:49:29,234
The only reason they don’t
throw things and spit on me

750
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:30,603
is ‘cause you’re so popular.

751
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:34,753
I can’t concentrate on-on
British mercantile law,

752
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:37,262
I don’t care about British mercantile law.

753
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:40,644
I might not even want to be a lawyer.

754
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:44,786
It’s a sturdy profession,

755
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:46,502
and a useful one.

756
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:51,057
Yes, and I want to be useful,
but now, not afterwards!

757
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,983
I ain’t wearing them things,
Mr. Slade, they never fit right.

758
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:56,387
The missus will have you wear ‘em.
Don’t think about leaving ‘em.

759
00:49:56,418 --> 00:49:58,771
You’re delaying,
that’s your favorite tactic.

760
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:02,515
You won’t tell me no, but the war will be
over in a month, and you know it will!

761
00:50:02,563 --> 00:50:09,505
LINCOLN: I’ve found that prophesying is
one of life’s less prophet-able occupations.

762
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:13,448
TAD: Why do some slaves
cost more than others?

763
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:16,123
Ah, if they’re still young and healthy,
if the women can still conceive,

764
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,153
they’ll pay more.
– Put ‘em back in the box, you scoundrel.

765
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:23,733
We’ll return them to Mr. Gardner’s
studio day after next.

766
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:27,418
Be careful with‘em, now.

767
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:29,711
These things should’ve stayed on the calf.

768
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:33,932
TAD: When you were a slave,
Mr. Slade, did they beat you?

769
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,806
SLADE: I was born a free man.

770
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,712
Nobody beat me except
I beat them right back.

771
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:42,262
Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me...

772
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:45,643
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.
Ask her if she was beaten.

773
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,504
– TAD: Were you?
– Tad!

774
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,742
MRS. KEKLEY: I was beaten with a fire
shovel when I was younger than you.

775
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:53,466
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She’s in Willie’s room.

776
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:55,531
ROBERT: She never goes in there.

777
00:50:55,563 --> 00:50:58,258
JOHN HAY: The reception line
is already stretching out the door.

778
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,208
See, I’ll be the only man over
fifteen and under sixty-five

779
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,485
in this whole place not in uniform.

780
00:51:06,548 --> 00:51:07,932
I’m under fifteen.

781
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,088
MARY: My head hurts so.

782
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,822
I prayed for death
the night Willie died.

783
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,963
The headaches are how
I know I didn’t get my wish.

784
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:48,904
How to endure the long afternoon
that go deep into the night.

785
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:50,000
LINCOLN: I know.

786
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,481
Trying not to think about him.
How will I manage?

787
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:55,624
– Somehow you will.
– Somehow.

788
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,533
MARY: Somehow. Somehow. Somehow...

789
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:03,636
MARY: Every party, every...

790
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,642
And now...

791
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:14,204
Four years more in this
terrible house... reproaching us.

792
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,477
He was a very sick little boy.

793
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:21,173
We should’ve cancelled
that reception, shouldn’t we?

794
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:24,129
– We didn’t know how sick he was.
– I knew, I knew...

795
00:52:25,232 --> 00:52:27,635
I saw that night he was dying.

796
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:33,572
Three years ago, the war was going
so badly, and we had to put on a face.

797
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:37,169
– But I... saw Willie was dying.
– Molly.

798
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:38,600
– I saw him.
– Listen.

799
00:52:41,486 --> 00:52:43,844
LINCLON: It’s too hard.

800
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:50,264
LINCOLN: Too hard.

801
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:15,233
WILLIAM SLADE: She’s just ten
feet yonder. I’d like to keep my job.

802
00:53:16,979 --> 00:53:20,253
MARY: Senator Sumner,
it has been much too long.

803
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,506
CHARLES SUMNER: “Oh, who can
look on that celestial face and..."

804
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:24,102
– And...?
– James Ashley, ma’am,

805
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,400
– we’ve met several times.
– Praise Heavens, praise Heavens,

806
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,703
just when I had abandoned
hope of amusement,

807
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:31,115
it’s the Chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee!

808
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,432
THADDEUS STEVENS:
Mrs. Lincoln.

809
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,989
Madame President if you please.

810
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:40,023
Oh, don’t convene another
subcommittee to investigate me, sir!

811
00:53:40,043 --> 00:53:41,831
I’m teasing! Smile, Senator Wade.

812
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,926
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.

813
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,875
STEVENS: As long as your household
accounts are in order, Madame,

814
00:53:46,954 --> 00:53:49,357
we’ll have no need to investigate them.

815
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,397
You have always taken such a lively,

816
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:56,338
even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

817
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:58,780
Your household accounts
have always been so interesting.

818
00:53:58,928 --> 00:54:01,331
Yes, thank you, it’s true,

819
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,002
the miracles I have wrought out

820
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:08,048
of fertilizer bills and cutlery
invoices, but I had to!

821
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,231
Four years ago, when the President
and I arrived, this was pure pigsty.

822
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:15,144
Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets.

823
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:18,507
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings!

824
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:21,911
And a pauper’s pittance
allotted for improvements.

825
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:25,659
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington awaiting,

826
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:29,258
in what you anticipated
would be our comfort in squalor,

827
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:33,694
further proof that my husband
and I were prairie primitives,

828
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:36,953
unsuited to the position
to which an error of the people,

829
00:54:36,988 --> 00:54:40,410
a flaw in the democratic process,
had elevated us.

830
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:43,768
The past is the past,
it’s a new year now,

831
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:47,837
and we are all getting along,
or so they tell me.

832
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,197
I gather we are working together!

833
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:54,007
The White House and the other House,
hatching little plans together.

834
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:54,836
– ROBERT: Mother?
– What?

835
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,629
– You’re creating a bottleneck.
– Oh!

836
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,167
MARY: Oh, I’m detaining you.

837
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:02,782
And more importantly,
the people behind you.

838
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:06,082
How the people love my husband,

839
00:55:06,363 --> 00:55:10,661
they flock to see him by
their thousands on public days!

840
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:13,255
They will never love you
the way they love him.

841
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,581
How difficult it must be
for you to know that.

842
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:20,859
And yet how important to remember it.

843
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:34,476
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,

844
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:36,904
I thought I’d suggest you might...

845
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:42,494
temper your contributions so as not
to frighten our conservative friends?

846
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,569
STEVENS: Ashley insists you’re ensuring
approval by dispensing patronage

847
00:55:46,629 --> 00:55:49,632
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.

848
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:52,732
LINCOLN: I can’t ensure a single damn
thing if you scare the whole House

849
00:55:52,772 --> 00:55:57,102
with talk of land appropriations,
revolutionary tribunals, punitive...

850
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,720
STEVENS: When the war ends,
I intend to push for

851
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,388
full equality, the Negro vote,
and much more.

852
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:08,253
Congress shall mandate the seizure
of every foot of rebel land

853
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:11,021
and every dollar of their property.

854
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:14,589
We’ll use their confiscated
wealth to establish

855
00:56:14,616 --> 00:56:17,334
hundreds of thousands
of free Negro farmers,

856
00:56:17,362 --> 00:56:20,159
and at their side soldiers armed to occupy

857
00:56:20,187 --> 00:56:22,701
and transform the heritage of traitors.

858
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:25,005
We’ll build up a land down there

859
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:28,235
of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.

860
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:32,380
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.

861
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:36,931
That’s the untempered
version of reconstruction.

862
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:43,474
LINCOLN: It’s not... It’s not
quite exactly what I intend,

863
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:48,965
but we shall oppose one
another in the course of time.

864
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:51,328
Now we’re working together,
and I’m asking you...

865
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:52,479
For patience, I expect.

866
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:55,458
LINCOLN: When the people disagree,
bringing them together requires

867
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,138
going slow till they’re ready to make up.

868
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,506
Ah, shit on the people,

869
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:00,118
and what they want,
and what they’re ready for,

870
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:02,721
I don’t give a goddamn about
the people and what they want!

871
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:05,671
This is the face of someone
who has fought long and hard

872
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:08,596
for the good of the people
without caring much for any of ‘em.

873
00:57:09,686 --> 00:57:12,089
And I look a lot worse without my wig.

874
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:16,122
The people elected me! To represent them!

875
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:19,445
To lead them! And I lead!
You ought to try it!

876
00:57:21,662 --> 00:57:25,015
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,

877
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:28,230
and I have tried to profit
from the example of it.

878
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:32,313
If I’d listened to you,
I’d’ve declared every slave free

879
00:57:32,326 --> 00:57:34,928
the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.

880
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,644
Then the border states would’ve
gone over to the confederacy,

881
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,255
the war would’ve been lost
and the Union along with it,

882
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:44,102
and instead of abolishing slavery,
as we hope to do in two weeks,

883
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:46,809
we’d be watching helpless
as infants as it spread

884
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,030
from the American South
into South America.

885
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,504
STEVENS: Oh God, how you
have longed to say that to me.

886
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:57,069
You claim you trust them.
But you know what the people are.

887
00:57:57,656 --> 00:58:03,106
You know that the inner compass
that should direct the soul toward justice

888
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,907
has ossified in white men
and women, north and south,

889
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:10,874
unto utter uselessness
through tolerating the evil of slavery.

890
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,540
White people cannot bear
the thought of sharing

891
00:58:13,552 --> 00:58:16,332
this country’s infinite
abundance with Negroes.

892
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:22,234
A compass, I learnt when
I was surveying, it’ll...

893
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:25,859
it’ll point you True North
from where you’re standing,

894
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:28,918
but it’s got no advice about the swamps

895
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,653
and deserts and chasms that
you’ll encounter along the way.

896
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:36,704
If in pursuit of your destination,
you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles,

897
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,113
and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp...

898
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:44,019
What’s the use of knowing True North?

899
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:04,060
LINCOLN: Robert’s gonna
plead with us to let him enlist.

900
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,352
Make time to talk to Robbie.

901
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:11,676
You only have time for Tad.
– But Tad’s young.

902
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,824
MARY: So is Robert.
Too young for the army.

903
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:18,895
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up...

904
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,712
Don’t take Robbie.

905
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:26,399
Don’t let me lose my son.

906
00:59:26,424 --> 00:59:27,388
[Knocking on door]

907
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:30,246
Go away! We’re occupied!

908
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:36,889
NICOLAY: Secretary Stanton has sent over
to tell you that as of half an hour ago,

909
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,110
the shelling of Wilmington
harbor has commenced.

910
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:47,125
STANTON: They cannot possibly
maintain under this kind of an assault.

911
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:49,904
Terry’s got ten thousand men
surrounding the Goddamned fort,

912
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:51,524
why doesn’t he answer my cables?
– WELLES: Fort Fisher

913
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,916
is a mountain of a building, Edwin.

914
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:54,214
MAJOR ECKERT: It’s the
largest fort they have, sir.

915
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,744
WELLES: Twenty-two big
seacoast guns on each rampart.

916
00:59:55,774 --> 00:59:57,613
MAJOR ECKERT: They’ve been
reinforcing it for the last two years

917
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,654
STANTON: They’ve taken 17,000
shells since yesterday!

918
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:03,717
I want to hear that Fort Fisher is ours
and Wilmington has fallen!

919
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:05,116
Send another damn cable!

920
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:07,916
The problem’s their
commander. Whiting!

921
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:11,375
He engineered the fortress himself.
The damned thing’s his child.

922
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:14,214
He’ll defend it till his every last man
is gone. He is not thinking...

923
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:15,714
LINCOLN (SHOUTING):
“Come on out, you old rat!”

924
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:20,717
LINCOLN: That’s what...

925
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:25,788
That' what Ethan Allen called to the
commander of Fort Ticonderogain in 1776.

926
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,822
“Come on out, you old rat!”

927
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:32,879
Aah, ‘course there were only forty
odd redcoats at Ticonderoga.

928
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:36,502
But there is one
Ethan Allen story that I’m...

929
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:37,819
– STANTON: No!
– .. very partial to...

930
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:40,604
No, you’re... you’re
going to tell a story!

931
01:00:41,077 --> 01:00:43,480
I don’t believe... that I can bear...

932
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:46,285
to listen to another one
of your stories right now!

933
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:49,280
STANTON: I need the B&O sideyard
schedules for Alexandria!

934
01:00:49,325 --> 01:00:50,922
I asked for them this morning!

935
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,947
[Lincoln laughing]

936
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:57,569
It was right after the Revolution,
right after peace had been concluded,

937
01:00:57,713 --> 01:00:59,180
and, hum...

938
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:01,958
Ethan Allen went to London to help our

939
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:04,726
new country conduct
its business with the king.

940
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:08,689
The English sneered at how rough we are,

941
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,388
and rude and simple-minded
and on like that,

942
01:01:11,422 --> 01:01:15,064
everywhere he went, till one day
he was invited to the townhouse

943
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,292
of a great English lord.

944
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:22,561
Dinner was served, beverages imbibed,

945
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:25,710
time passed, as happens, and

946
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,123
Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.

947
01:01:30,008 --> 01:01:32,617
He was grateful to be directed thence.

948
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:38,136
Relieved, you might say.

949
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,161
[Everyone laughs]

950
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,837
Now, Mr. Allen discovered

951
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:47,898
on entering the water closet that
the only decoration therein was a...

952
01:01:47,968 --> 01:01:50,306
a portrait of George Washington.

953
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,480
Ethan Allen done what he came to do,

954
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:59,542
and returned to the drawing room.

955
01:01:59,804 --> 01:02:01,755
His host and the others were disappointed

956
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,774
when he didn’t mention
Washington’s portrait.

957
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:05,546
And finally His Lordship couldn’t resist,

958
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,548
and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it,

959
01:02:07,576 --> 01:02:09,978
the picture of Washington. He had.

960
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:14,946
What did he think of its placement, did it
seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen?

961
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,552
Mr. Allen said it did.

962
01:02:17,146 --> 01:02:20,249
His host was astounded!
Appropriate?

963
01:02:20,897 --> 01:02:23,983
George Washington’s likeness
in a water closet?

964
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:27,362
Yes, said Mr. Allen, where
it’ll do good service.

965
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,499
The whole world knows
nothing’ll make an Englishman shit

966
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:32,917
quicker than the sight
of George Washington.

967
01:02:32,942 --> 01:02:34,942
[Everyone laughs]

968
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,751
I love that story.

969
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:46,876
[Cable telegraph clicking]

970
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,894
CHARLES BENJAMIN: Fort Fisher
is ours. We’ve taken the port.

971
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:09,424
WELLES: And Wilmington?

972
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,431
ECKERT: We’ve taken the fort, but the
city of Wilmington has not surrendered.

973
01:03:15,886 --> 01:03:17,707
STANTON: How many casualties?

974
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,189
– FERNANDO WOOD: Heavy losses.
– GEORGE PENDLETON: And more to come.

975
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,769
WOOD: Sours the national mood.

976
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,473
That might suffice to discourage him...
– PENDLETON: To bring this down?

977
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:39,304
Not in a fight like this.
This is to the death.

978
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:40,835
WOOD: It’s gruesome!

979
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:43,331
PENDLETON: Are you despairing,
or merely lazy?

980
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:48,450
This fight is for The United States
of America. Nothing “suffices”!

981
01:03:48,552 --> 01:03:50,124
A rumor? Nothing!

982
01:03:50,152 --> 01:03:53,093
They’re not lazy.
They’re busily buying votes!

983
01:03:53,134 --> 01:03:55,826
While we hope to be saved
by “the national mood?!”

984
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:05,794
Before this blood is dry,
when Stevens next takes the floor,

985
01:04:05,877 --> 01:04:07,515
taunt him. You excel at that.

986
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:11,436
Get him to proclaim what we all know
he believes in his coal-colored heart:

987
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:15,622
that this vote is meant to set the
black race on high, to niggerate America.

988
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:18,071
WOOD: George, please. Stay on course.

989
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:21,286
PENDLETON: Bring Stevens to full froth.

990
01:04:21,716 --> 01:04:24,809
I can ensure that every newspaperman
from Louisville to San Francisco

991
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,754
will be here to witness it and print it.

992
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:32,371
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The floor
belongs to the mellifluent gentleman

993
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:35,022
from Kentucky,
Mr. George Yeaman.

994
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:43,097
YEAMAN: I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

995
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:54,735
Although... I’m disgusted by slavery

996
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:01,069
I rise on this sad and solemn day.

997
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,667
to announce that I’m
opposed to the amendment.

998
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:12,708
We must consider what
will become of colored folk

999
01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:17,355
if four million are in
one instant set free.

1000
01:05:17,553 --> 01:05:20,556
LITTON: They’ll be free, George.
That’s what’ll become of them!

1001
01:05:21,242 --> 01:05:25,571
SCHELL: Think how splendid
if Mr. Yeaman switched.

1002
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,635
LATHAM: Too publicly against us.
He can’t change course now.

1003
01:05:28,893 --> 01:05:31,826
BILBO: Not for some
miserable little job anyways.

1004
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:36,630
We will be forced to enfranchise
the men of the colored race.

1005
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,988
It would be inhuman not to!

1006
01:05:40,443 --> 01:05:43,805
Who among us is prepared
to give Negroes the vote?

1007
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,880
[boos throughout the chamber]
YEAMAN: And, and!

1008
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:48,999
What shall follow upon that?

1009
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,199
Universal enfranchisement?

1010
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:55,053
Votes for women?

1011
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,078
[Cheers and boos]

WOOD: Bless my eyes, if it isn’t the
Post Master of Millersburg Ohio!

1013
01:06:11,736 --> 01:06:15,127
PENDLETON: Mr. LeClerk felt
honor-bound to inform us

1014
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:17,911
of your disgusting betrayal.

1015
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:20,652
Your prostitution.

1016
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,962
WOOD: Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?

1017
01:06:25,268 --> 01:06:27,360
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

1018
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,019
HAWKINS: If my neighbors hear
that I voted yes for nigger freedom

1019
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:34,547
and no to peace, they will kill me.

know better than to piss your pants

about peace talks.

they found out I was loyal to the Union,
they came after me with gelding knives!

– HAWKINS: Any other job!
– BILBO: You do right, Clay Hawkins...

1025

– HAWKINS: I want to do right!
– BILBO: and make yourself some money...

1026

BILBO: .. in the bargain!
– HAWKINS: But I got no courage!

BILBO: Wait!! You wanted, what was it,
tax man for the Western Reserve,

1028

hell you can have the whole
state of Ohio if you... Aw, crap.

SEWARD: Eleven votes?!

1030
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,567
Two days ago we had twelve!
What happened?

1031
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:04,841
– There are defections in the Richmond...
– It’s the goddamned rumors regarding...

1032
01:07:04,856 --> 01:07:06,661
– LATHAM: Yes! The peace offer!
– SEWARD: Groundless.

1033
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,278
SEWARD: I told you that.
– LATHAM: And yet the rumors persist.

SCHELL: They are ruining us.

Among the few remaining representatives
who seem remotely plausible

1036

there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.

near to murdered me!

01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:55,544
Perhaps we need reinforcements.

If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,

solid shit to free slaves?

And to have sufficient sense and taste
not to presume to instruct the President.

Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?

for our two countries.”
And it goes on like that.

1060
01:08:58,745 --> 01:09:00,854
– I don’t know what you...
– There’s just one country.

1061
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:03,536
And you and I, we’re
citizens of that country.

1062
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:06,449
I’m fighting to protect it
from armed rebels.

1063
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:08,256
From you.

1064
01:09:08,592 --> 01:09:11,052
Mr-Mr. Blair, he-he told us, he...

1065
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,937
he told President Davis we were...

1066
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:16,969
A private citizen like Preston Blair
can say what he pleases

1067
01:09:16,997 --> 01:09:18,987
since he has no authority over anything.

1068
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:23,290
If you want to discuss peace
with President Lincoln,

1069
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:25,948
consider revisions.

1070
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:30,453
If we’re not to discuss a truce
between warring nations,

1071
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:33,440
what in heaven’s name can we discuss?

1072
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:35,418
Terms of surrender.

1073
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:42,562
GRANT: “Office United States Military
Telegraph War Dept. For Abraham Lincoln,

1074
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:46,301
President of the United States,
January 20, 1865.

1075
01:09:46,707 --> 01:09:49,059
I will state confidentially
that I am convinced,

1076
01:09:49,063 --> 01:09:51,311
upon conversation with
these Commissioners,

1077
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:54,546
that their intentions are good
and their desire sincere

1078
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,393
to restore peace and union.

1079
01:09:56,966 --> 01:10:00,530
I fear now their going back,
without any expression of interest.”

1080
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:01,598
[Seward’s voice takes over]

1081
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:05,653
“...from anyone in authority,
Mr. Lincoln will have a bad influence.”

1082
01:10:06,904 --> 01:10:09,610
“I will be sorry should it
prove impossible for you

1083
01:10:09,635 --> 01:10:11,837
to have an interview with them.

1084
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:14,314
I am awaiting your instructions.

1085
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:20,802
U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General
Commanding Armies United States”.

1086
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:27,661
After four years of war and...
near 600,000 lives lost,

1087
01:10:27,755 --> 01:10:30,851
he believes we can end this war now.

1088
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:37,477
My trust in him is marrow deep.

1089
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,317
SEWARD: You could bring
the delegates to Washington.

1090
01:10:46,716 --> 01:10:48,817
In exchange for the South’s
immediate surrender,

1091
01:10:48,836 --> 01:10:51,239
we could promise them
the amendment’s defeat.

1092
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:54,946
They’d agree, don’t you think?

1093
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,793
We’d end the war. This week.

1094
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:04,330
Or if you could manage,
without seeming to do it, to....

1095
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:13,206
The peace delegation might encounter
delays as they travel up the James River.

1096
01:11:13,238 --> 01:11:15,605
Particularly with the
fighting around Wilmington.

1097
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:26,225
Within ten days time, we might
pass the Thirteenth Amendment.

1098
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:11,198
LINCOLN: Here’s a sixteen year old boy.

1099
01:12:11,508 --> 01:12:13,044
They’re gonna hang him...

1100
01:12:13,222 --> 01:12:16,097
He was with the 15th Indiana
Calvary near Beaufort,

1101
01:12:16,113 --> 01:12:18,867
seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle.

1102
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,362
I don’t think even Stanton
would complain if I pardoned him,

1103
01:12:23,379 --> 01:12:24,847
You think Stanton would complain?

1104
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,303
JOHN HAY: I don’t know, sir,
I don’t know who you’re, uh...

1105
01:12:28,091 --> 01:12:29,077
What time is it?

1106
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:30,734
LINCOLN: It’s three forty in the morning.

1107
01:12:30,815 --> 01:12:33,589
NICOLAY: Don’t let him pardon any more deserters...

1108
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,685
HAY: Aah, Mr. Stanton
thinks you pardon too many.

1109
01:12:36,914 --> 01:12:38,576
He’s generally apoplectic on the subject.

1110
01:12:38,596 --> 01:12:41,103
LINCOLN: He oughtn’t to have done that,
crippled his horse, that was cruel,

1111
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:42,997
but you don’t just hang
a sixteen year old boy for that...

1112
01:12:43,028 --> 01:12:43,881
HAY: Ask the horse what he thinks.

1113
01:12:43,896 --> 01:12:46,298
.. for cruelty. There’d be no
sixteen year old boys left.

1114
01:13:06,268 --> 01:13:09,461
Grant wants me to bring
the secesh delegates to Washington.

1115
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:15,317
HAY: So there are secesh delegates?

1116
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:17,315
LINCOLN: He was afraid, that’s all it was.

1117
01:13:17,924 --> 01:13:20,776
I don’t care to hang a boy
for being frightened, either.

1118
01:13:21,414 --> 01:13:23,388
What good would it do him?

1119
01:13:38,171 --> 01:13:40,545
War’s nearly done, ain’t that so?

1120
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:46,257
What use one more corpse?

1121
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,624
Any more corpses?

1122
01:13:59,063 --> 01:14:00,535
HAY: Do you need company?

1123
01:14:01,056 --> 01:14:03,258
LINCOLN: In times like this,
I’m best alone.

1124
01:14:42,953 --> 01:14:47,160
LINCOLN: “Lieutenant General
Ulysses S. Grant, City Point.

1125
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:50,527
I have read your words with interest.”

1126
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:53,467
“I ask that, regardless
of any action I take

1127
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:56,978
in the matter of the visit
of the Richmond commissioners,

1128
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:02,855
you maintain among your troops
military preparedness for battle,

1129
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,135
as you have done until now.”

1130
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:16,919
“Have Captain Saunders convey the
commissioners to me here in Washington.”

1131
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,967
“A. Lincoln” and the date.
– SAMUEL BECKWITH: Yes sir.

1132
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:26,940
Shall I transmit, sir?

1133
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:33,235
LINCOLN: You think we choose to be born?

1134
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,631
BECKWITH: I don’t suppose so.

1135
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:44,752
LINCOLN: Are we fitted to
the times we’re born into?

1136
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:48,913
BECKWITH: Well, I don’t know about myself.

1137
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:52,981
You may be...
sir. Fitted.

1138
01:15:57,459 --> 01:15:59,153
What do you reckon?

1139
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,024
HOMER BATES: Well, I’m an engineer.

1140
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:11,138
BATES: I reckon there’s machinery but...
no one’s done the fitting.

1141
01:16:14,058 --> 01:16:19,847
LINCOLN: You’re an engineer. You must
know Euclid’s axioms and common notions.

1142
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:23,749
BATES: I must’ve in school, but...

1143
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:26,393
LINCOLN: I never had much
of schooling, but I read Euclid,

1144
01:16:26,452 --> 01:16:28,248
in an old book I borrowed.

1145
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:31,667
Little enough ever found
its way in here, but...

1146
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:33,692
once learnt it stayed learnt.

1147
01:16:36,832 --> 01:16:39,801
Euclid’s first common notion is this:

1148
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:45,137
“Things which are equal to the
same thing are equal to each other.”

1149
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,615
That’s a rule of mathematical reasoning.

1150
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,601
It’s true because it works.

1151
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:54,433
Has done and always will do.

1152
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:59,040
In his book, hmm...

1153
01:16:59,989 --> 01:17:02,391
Euclid says this is
“self-evident.”

1154
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:09,020
D’you see, there it is, even in that two
thousand year old book of mechanical law:

1155
01:17:09,075 --> 01:17:14,093
it is a self evident truth that things
which are equal to the same thing

1156
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:15,392
are equal to each other.

1157
01:17:19,543 --> 01:17:21,174
We begin with equality.

1158
01:17:22,676 --> 01:17:24,530
That’s the origin, isn’t it?

1159
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:27,501
That balance, that's... that’s fairness.

1160
01:17:32,093 --> 01:17:33,444
That’s justice.

1161
01:17:41,162 --> 01:17:44,686
Just read me back the last
sentence of that telegram, please.

1162
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,754
BECKWITH: “Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me here in Washington.”

1163
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:52,341
A slight emendation if you would, Sam.

1164
01:17:55,769 --> 01:17:59,224
“Have Captain Saunders convey
the gentlemen aboard the River Queen

1165
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,470
as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,

1166
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,103
and there wait until...”

1167
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:10,291
“.. further advice from me.”

1168
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:15,887
“Do not proceed to Washington.”

1169
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:05,269
COLFAX: The World, the Herald
and the Times, New York, Chicago,

1170
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:09,508
the Journal of Commerce,
even your hometown paper’s here.

1171
01:19:09,571 --> 01:19:12,923
ASHLEY: Say you believe only
in legal equality for all races,

1172
01:19:12,974 --> 01:19:15,978
not racial quality. I beg you, sir.

1173
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:17,970
Compromise.

1174
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,052
Or you risk it all.

1175
01:19:41,442 --> 01:19:45,200
WOOD: I’ve asked you a question,
Mr. Stevens, and you must answer me.

1176
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:49,067
Do you or do you not hold
that the precept that

1177
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:52,336
“all men are created equal”
is meant literally?

1178
01:19:57,836 --> 01:20:00,589
WOOD (CONT’D): Is that not the
true purpose of the amendment?

1179
01:20:00,856 --> 01:20:03,481
To promote your ultimate and
ardent dream to elevate...

1180
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:06,171
STEVENS: The true purpose
of the amendment, Mr. Wood,

1181
01:20:06,285 --> 01:20:10,295
you perfectly-named,
brainless, obstructive object?

1182
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,565
[Everyone laughing]

1183
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:15,044
Now you have always insisted, Mr. Stevens,

1184
01:20:15,637 --> 01:20:19,545
that Negroes are the same
as white men are.

1185
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,435
The true purpose of the amendment...

1186
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:27,260
[Chamber totally silent]

1187
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,739
I don’t hold with equality in all things,

1188
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,754
only with equality before
the law and nothing more.

1189
01:20:58,195 --> 01:20:59,537
That’s not so!
You...

1190
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:03,284
You believe that Negroes
are entirely equal to white men.

1191
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:06,712
You’ve said it a thousand times...
– PENDLETON: For shame! For shame!

1192
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,020
Stop prevaricating and answer,
Representative Wood!

1193
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:12,570
I don’t hold with equality in all things,

1194
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,296
only with equality...
– After the decades

1195
01:21:15,321 --> 01:21:16,929
STEVENS: .. and nothing more!

1196
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,454
ASHLEY: He's answered your questions!

1197
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:20,874
This amendment has naught
to do with race equality!

1198
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,696
– S: I don’t hold with equality in all things...
– P: You have long insisted, have you not...

1199
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:25,847
– S: only with equality before the law...
– P: that the dusk colored race...

1200
01:21:25,866 --> 01:21:27,387
– S: and nothing more.
– P: is no different from the white one.

1201
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:31,139
MARY: Who’d ever’ve guessed that old
nightmare capable of such control?

1202
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,369
He might make a politician someday...

1203
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,991
– MRS. KECKLEY: I need to go.
– MARY: Mrs. Keykley!

1204
01:21:38,879 --> 01:21:43,288
PENDLETON: Your frantic attempt to delude
us now is unworthy of a representative.

1205
01:21:43,338 --> 01:21:46,221
It is in fact, unworthy of a white man!

1206
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:52,131
How can I hold that all men
are created equal,

1207
01:21:52,437 --> 01:21:55,398
when here before me stands, stinking,

1208
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:58,388
the moral carcass of
the gentleman from Ohio,

1209
01:21:58,438 --> 01:22:01,407
proof that some men are inferior,

1210
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:04,104
endowed by their Maker with dim wits,

1211
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:08,518
impermeable to reason
with cold pallid slime

1212
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:11,399
in their veins instead
of hot red blood!

1213
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,661
You are more reptile than man, George,

1214
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:19,432
so low and flat that the foot of man
is incapable of crushing you!

1215
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,787
PENDLETON: How dare you!

1216
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:25,071
Yet even you, Pendleton,

1217
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:29,182
who should have been gibbetted
for treason long before today,

1218
01:22:29,202 --> 01:22:34,713
even worthless unworthy you ought
to be treated equally before the law!

1219
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:36,633
[Everyone cheers and applauds]

1220
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:40,009
And so again, sir, and again
and again and again I say:

1221
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:43,429
I DO NOT HOLD WITH
EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS.

1222
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,604
ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.

1223
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:52,907
PENDLETON: Mr. Speaker,
will you permit this vile boorish man

1224
01:22:52,932 --> 01:22:55,086
to slander ant to threaten me and...

1225
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:30,885
LITTON: You asked... if ever I was surprised.

1226
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,350
Today... Mr. Stevens,

1227
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:36,003
I was surprised.

1228
01:23:36,168 --> 01:23:39,285
You’ve led the battle for
race equality for thirty years!

1229
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:48,316
The basis of... of every hope
for this country’s future life,

1230
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:51,413
you denied Negro equality!
I’m nauseated.

1231
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:55,578
You refused to say that all
humans are, well... human!

1232
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:59,102
Have you lost your very soul, Mr. Stevens

1233
01:23:59,403 --> 01:24:00,760
Is there nothing you won’t say?

1234
01:24:00,804 --> 01:24:03,781
I’m sorry you’re nauseous, Asa,
that must be unpleasant.

1235
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:06,956
I want the amendment to pass.

1236
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,252
So that the Constitution’s first
and only mention of slavery

1237
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,096
is its absolute prohibition.

1238
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,973
For this amendment, for which
I have worked all of my life

1239
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,742
and for which countless colored men
and women have fought and died

1240
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,135
and now hundreds of
thousands of soldiers.

1241
01:24:21,831 --> 01:24:22,607
No, sir, no.

1242
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:27,690
It seems there is very
nearly nothing I won’t say.

1243
01:24:58,604 --> 01:25:00,406
RERT: I’m not going in.

1244
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:07,439
LINCOLN: You said you wanted to help me.

1245
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:12,069
This is... This is just a clumsy
attempt at discouragement.

1246
01:25:12,134 --> 01:25:14,532
I’ve been to army hospitals,
I’ve seen surgeries,

1247
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,019
I went and visited the
malaria barges with mama.

1248
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:19,629
LINCOLN: She told me
she didn’t take you inside.

1249
01:25:19,638 --> 01:25:23,412
I snuck in afterwards. I’ve seen
what it’s like, this changes nothing.

1250
01:25:25,966 --> 01:25:29,479
At all rates, I’m happy
to have your company.

1251
01:25:36,133 --> 01:25:37,313
LINCOLN: Morning, Jim.

1252
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:38,924
ARMY SURGEON: Hello, Mr. President.

1253
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,594
LINCOLN: Good to see you again.

1254
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:45,847
Well boys, first question:
You getting enough to eat?

1255
01:25:46,038 --> 01:25:46,895
FIRST PATIENT: Hello, sir.

1256
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:47,969
– What’s your name, soldier?
– Robert.

1257
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:50,199
Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.

1258
01:25:50,263 --> 01:25:50,965
KEVIN: Nice to meet you.

1259
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,974
– What’s your name?
– Kevin.

1260
01:25:52,032 --> 01:25:54,556
Tell me your names as I go past.
I like to know who I’m talkin’ to. Kevin.

1261
01:25:54,587 --> 01:25:56,389
– Mr. President, John.
– John.

1262
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:59,168
I’ve seen you before.
– Mr. President...

1263
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,493
LINCOLN: Make sure you get 
some steak, I wouldn’t mind...

1264
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,976
LINCOLN: What’s the matter, Bob?

1265
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,752
I have to do this!

1266
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,072
And I will do it and I don’t
need your permission to enlist.

1267
01:27:29,098 --> 01:27:32,755
That same speech has been
made by how many sons,

1268
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:35,484
to how many fathers since the war began?

1269
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:37,734
“I don’t need your damn permission,
you miserable old goat,

1270
01:27:37,749 --> 01:27:39,595
I'm gonna enlist anyhow!”

1271
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,116
And what wouldn’t those
numberless fathers have given

1272
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,458
to be able to say to their sons as...
I now say to mine,

1273
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:47,508
”I’m commander-in-chief,

1274
01:27:48,114 --> 01:27:49,777
so in point of fact,
without my permission,

1275
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:52,806
you ain’t enlisting in nothing,
nowhere, young man.”

1276
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,234
It’s mama you’re scared of,
not me getting killed.

1277
01:28:03,298 --> 01:28:05,775
I have to do this! And I will!

1278
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:09,340
Or I will feel ashamed of myself
for the rest of my life.

1279
01:28:09,427 --> 01:28:11,503
Whether or not you fought
is what’s gonna matter.

1280
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,740
And not just to other people,
but to myself.

1281
01:28:14,217 --> 01:28:17,448
I won’t be you, pa. I can’t do that.
But I don’t want to be nothing.

1282
01:28:29,489 --> 01:28:31,050
LINCOLN: He’ll be fine, Molly.

1283
01:28:31,559 --> 01:28:35,192
City Point’s away back from
the front lines, from the fighting,

1284
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:38,618
he’ll be an adjutant running
messages for General Grant.

1285
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:41,750
The war will take our son!

1286
01:28:42,031 --> 01:28:44,434
A sniper, or a shrapnel
shell, or typhus!

1287
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:47,718
Same as took Willie,
it takes hundreds of boys a day!

1288
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:51,429
He’ll die uselessly, and how
will I ever forgive you?

1289
01:28:52,823 --> 01:28:55,426
Most men, their firstborn
is their favorite, but you,

1290
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:58,119
you’ve always blamed Robert
for being born,

1291
01:28:58,134 --> 01:29:01,137
for trapping you in a marriage
that’s only ever given you grief

1292
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,571
and caused you regret.
– LINCOLN: That’s simply not true.

1293
01:29:03,602 --> 01:29:07,564
And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on
your hands same as Grant, God help us!

1294
01:29:07,722 --> 01:29:11,045
We’ll pay for the oceans of
spilled blood you’ve sanctioned,

1295
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:14,954
the uncountable corpses we’ll be
made to pay with our son’s dear blood.

1296
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:16,908
Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,

1297
01:29:16,926 --> 01:29:21,326
I demand of you to try and take the
liberal and not the selfish point of view.

1298
01:29:21,746 --> 01:29:24,910
Robert will never forgive himself.
You imagine he''ll forgive us

1299
01:29:24,931 --> 01:29:28,421
if we continue to stifle his
very natural ambition?!

1300
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:32,182
And if I refuse to take the highroad,

1301
01:29:34,562 --> 01:29:37,789
if I won’t take up the rough old cross,

1302
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:41,224
will you threaten me again
with the madhouse,

1303
01:29:41,283 --> 01:29:44,480
as you did when I couldn’t
stop crying over Willie,

1304
01:29:44,647 --> 01:29:49,985
when I showed you what heartbreak,
real heartbreak looked like,

1305
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:53,429
and you hadn’t the courage
to countenance it, to help me...

1306
01:29:53,515 --> 01:29:55,903
LINCOLN: That’s right. When you
refused so much as to comfort Tad...

1307
01:29:55,934 --> 01:29:58,752
– M: I was in the room with Willie,
– L: the child who was not only sick,

1308
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:01,193
– M: I was holding him...
– L: but beside himself with grief?

1309
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:03,311
– M: in my arms as he died!
– L: Oh but your grief, your grief, your...

1310
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:05,734
L: inexhaustible grief!
– M: How dare you throw that at me?!

1311
01:30:05,766 --> 01:30:07,580
– L: And his mother won’t let him near her,
– M: I couldn’t let Tad in!

1312
01:30:07,621 --> 01:30:09,613
– L: ‘cos she’s screaming from morning to night,
– M: I couldn’t risk him

1313
01:30:09,648 --> 01:30:11,513
M: seeing how angry I was!
– L: pacing the corridors,

1314
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:13,947
howling at shadows
and furniture and ghosts!

1315
01:30:15,397 --> 01:30:17,537
I ought to have done it, I ought
have done for Tad’s sake,

1316
01:30:17,552 --> 01:30:20,810
for everybody’s goddamned sake,
I should have clapped you in the madhouse!

1317
01:30:20,852 --> 01:30:22,461
Then do it!!

1318
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,799
Do it! Don’t you threaten me,
you do it this time, lock me away!

1319
01:30:27,895 --> 01:30:32,670
You’ll have to, I swear!
If Robert is killed...

1320
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:37,295
[Mary sobbing]

1321
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:53,593
I couldn’t tolerate you
grieving so for Willie

1322
01:30:53,608 --> 01:30:56,010
because I couldn’t permit it in myself,

1323
01:30:56,902 --> 01:30:58,704
though I wanted to, Mary.

1324
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:04,514
I wanted to crawl under the earth,
into the vault with his coffin.

1325
01:31:05,492 --> 01:31:09,375
And I still do. Everyday I do.

1326
01:31:09,828 --> 01:31:11,362
Don’t speak to me about grief.

1327
01:31:21,488 --> 01:31:24,662
I must make my decisions,
Bob must make his, you yours.

1328
01:31:24,695 --> 01:31:28,674
And... bear what we must,
hold and carry what we must.

1329
01:31:28,779 --> 01:31:32,507
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it,

1330
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:35,453
alone as I must.
And you alone, Mary,

1331
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:39,325
you alone...
may lighten this burden,

1332
01:31:40,858 --> 01:31:44,062
or render it intolerable.
As you choose.

1333
01:31:51,675 --> 01:31:57,675
[Opera: Gounod’s Faust]

1334
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:08,055
MARY: You think I’m ignorant
of what you’re up to

1335
01:32:08,066 --> 01:32:09,705
because you haven’t discussed this scheme

1336
01:32:09,718 --> 01:32:11,613
with me as you ought to have done.

1337
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:14,743
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?

1338
01:32:14,867 --> 01:32:17,413
I believe you when you insist
that amending the constitution

1339
01:32:17,421 --> 01:32:19,898
and abolishing slavery will end this war.

1340
01:32:19,953 --> 01:32:22,148
And since you are sending
my son into the war,

1341
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:24,916
woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.

1342
01:32:28,703 --> 01:32:33,206
Seward doesn’t want me leaving
big muddy footprints all over town.

1343
01:32:36,862 --> 01:32:39,264
No one has ever lived who
knows better than you

1344
01:32:39,288 --> 01:32:42,908
the proper placement of
footfalls on treacherous paths.

1345
01:32:43,081 --> 01:32:46,504
Seward can’t do it.
You must.

1346
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:50,103
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes,

1347
01:32:50,302 --> 01:32:53,209
woe unto you, sir, you will answer to me.

1348
01:33:15,182 --> 01:33:17,584
MRS. KECKLEY: I know the
vote is only four days away.

1349
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:20,256
I know you’re concerned.

1350
01:33:20,495 --> 01:33:22,453
Thank you for your concern over this,

1351
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:25,862
and I want you to know,
they’ll approve it.

1352
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,082
God will see to it.

1353
01:33:31,076 --> 01:33:33,478
LINCOLN: I don’t envy him His task.

1354
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:37,597
He may wish He’d chosen an
instrument for His purpose

1355
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:39,937
more wieldy than the
House of Representatives.

1356
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:43,052
MRS. KECKLEY: Then you’ll see to it.

1357
01:33:45,573 --> 01:33:48,519
Are you afraid of what lies
ahead for your people?

1358
01:33:49,202 --> 01:33:51,022
If we succeed?

1359
01:33:52,215 --> 01:33:54,618
White people don’t want us here.

1360
01:33:54,891 --> 01:33:57,293
– LINCOLN: Many don’t.
– What about you?

1361
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,360
I don’t know you, Mrs. Keckley.

1362
01:34:06,126 --> 01:34:07,688
Any of you.

1363
01:34:08,871 --> 01:34:12,074
You’re familiar to me, as all people are.

1364
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:17,386
Unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures such as we all are.

1365
01:34:19,255 --> 01:34:22,005
You have a right to expect what I expect,

1366
01:34:22,236 --> 01:34:27,223
and likely our expectations are
not incomprehensible to each other.

1367
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,932
I assume I’ll get used to you.

1368
01:34:35,428 --> 01:34:37,443
But what you are to the nation,

1369
01:34:37,602 --> 01:34:41,127
what’ll become of you once slavery’s
day is done, I don’t know.

1370
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:46,373
What my people are to be, I can’t say.

1371
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:52,418
I never heard any ask what
freedom will bring. Freedom’s a first.

1372
01:34:54,925 --> 01:34:56,495
As for me...

1373
01:34:57,688 --> 01:35:00,090
My son died, fighting for the Union...

1374
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,653
wearing the Union blue.

1375
01:35:04,163 --> 01:35:06,022
For freedom he died.

1376
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:09,721
I’m his mother.

1377
01:35:12,157 --> 01:35:14,851
That’s what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1378
01:35:19,204 --> 01:35:20,969
What else must I be?

1379
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,404
BILBO: My whole hand’s gonna
be proud in about five seconds.

1380
01:35:32,468 --> 01:35:34,547
– LATHAM: Oh, it is? What you got goin’?
– BILBO: Let’s see how proud you gonna be.

1381
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:36,454
– BILBO: Yeah?
– LATHAM: Go away!

1382
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:39,530
– LATHAM: That watch fob, is that gold?
– BILBO: You keep your eyes off my fob!

1383
01:35:39,596 --> 01:35:40,698
– SEWARD: Gentlemen...
– LATHAM: Nines paired!

1384
01:35:40,792 --> 01:35:43,369
– SEWARD: .. you have a visitor.
– BILBO: Oh my God damn!

1385
01:35:46,046 --> 01:35:47,350
Well, I’ll be fucked.

1386
01:35:47,559 --> 01:35:50,775
I wouldn’t bet against it, Mr...?

1387
01:35:51,314 --> 01:35:54,103
– W.N. Bilbo.
– Yeah, Mr. Bilbo.

1388
01:35:54,155 --> 01:35:55,996
Gentlemen.
– Sir...

1389
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:59,122
BILBO: Why are you here?
No offense, but Mr. Seward’s

1390
01:35:59,437 --> 01:36:01,366
banished the very mention of your name,

1391
01:36:01,394 --> 01:36:04,808
he won’t even let us use fifty-cent pieces
‘cause they got your face on ‘em.

1392
01:36:05,732 --> 01:36:07,998
LINCOLN: The Secretary of
State here tells me that, uh,

1393
01:36:08,024 --> 01:36:10,892
you got eleven Democrats
in the bag, that’s encouraging.

1394
01:36:10,955 --> 01:36:13,720
LATHAM: Oh, you've got no
cause to be encouraged,

1395
01:36:14,216 --> 01:36:15,778
Sir. Uh...

1396
01:36:16,004 --> 01:36:18,287
SCHELL: Are we being... fired?

1397
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:23,440
LINCOLN: “We have heard the
chimes of midnight, Master Shallow.”

1398
01:36:24,328 --> 01:36:29,057
I’m here to alert you boys that the
great day of reckoning is nigh upon us.

1399
01:36:29,422 --> 01:36:31,224
SCHELL: The Democrats
we’ve yet to bag, sir.

1400
01:36:31,262 --> 01:36:33,942
The patronage jobs simply won’t bag ‘em.

1401
01:36:34,306 --> 01:36:37,792
They require more... convincing,
Mr. President.

1402
01:36:38,191 --> 01:36:39,355
LINCOLN: Mm-hmm.

1403
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:41,695
Do me a favor, will ya?

1404
01:36:41,923 --> 01:36:42,687
BILBO: Sure.

1405
01:36:42,735 --> 01:36:44,634
LINCOLN: I snagged my eye
in the paper this morning,

1406
01:36:44,652 --> 01:36:48,082
and Governor Curtin is set
to declare a winner in the

1407
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,127
disputed Congressional election for the...

1408
01:36:50,146 --> 01:36:51,333
BILBO: Pennsylvania 16th District.

1409
01:36:51,369 --> 01:36:53,728
.. District. What a joy
to be comprehended.

1410
01:36:54,181 --> 01:36:56,650
Hop on a train to Philadell,
call on the Governor...

1411
01:36:56,683 --> 01:36:58,409
SEWARD: Send Latham. Or Schell.

1412
01:36:58,428 --> 01:37:01,131
LINCOLN: No, he’ll do fine, just...
polish yourself up first.

1413
01:37:01,156 --> 01:37:01,599
[Bilbo laughs]

1414
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,701
LATHAM: The incumbent
is claiming he won it.

1415
01:37:03,796 --> 01:37:05,429
LATHAM: Name of, uh...
– BILBO: Coffroth.

1416
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,888
– LINCOLN: That’s him.
– SCHELL: Coffroth.

1417
01:37:06,943 --> 01:37:08,866
SCHELL: He is a Democrat.
– LINCOLN: I understand that.

1418
01:37:09,467 --> 01:37:11,408
– BILBO: Silly name.
– LINCOLN: A little bit silly.

1419
01:37:12,298 --> 01:37:15,191
LINCOLN: Huh, Tell Governor
Curtin it’d be much appreciated

1420
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:18,954
if he’d invite the House of
Representatives to decide who won.

1421
01:37:18,978 --> 01:37:21,251
He’s entitled to do that.
He’ll agree to it.

1422
01:37:21,564 --> 01:37:25,865
Then advise Coffroth, if
he hopes to retain his seat,

1423
01:37:26,535 --> 01:37:28,973
that he’d better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

1424
01:37:29,044 --> 01:37:31,699
SEWARD: Oh, pity poor Coffroth!
[All laugh]

1425
01:37:31,898 --> 01:37:33,900
[Knocks on door]
STEVENS: It opens!

1426
01:37:41,016 --> 01:37:42,938
STEVENS: You are Canfrey?

1427
01:37:44,257 --> 01:37:45,819
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens,

1428
01:37:46,374 --> 01:37:47,727
Alexander Coffroth, I’m...

1429
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:50,112
STEVENS: Are we representatives
of the same state?

1430
01:37:50,614 --> 01:37:52,731
Y-yes sir, We sit only three desks apart.

1431
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:55,172
STEVENS: I haven’t noticed you. I’m...

1432
01:37:55,241 --> 01:37:57,905
a Republican, and you,
Coughdrop, are a Democrat?

1433
01:37:59,141 --> 01:37:59,970
Well...

1434
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:01,870
Um, that is to say, I...

1435
01:38:01,894 --> 01:38:04,965
STEVENS: The modern travesty of
Thomas Jefferson’s political organization

1436
01:38:04,993 --> 01:38:07,086
to which you have attached
yourself like a barnacle

1437
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:10,173
has the effrontery to call
itself The Democratic Party.

1438
01:38:10,191 --> 01:38:12,434
You are a Dem-O-crat.

1439
01:38:12,446 --> 01:38:14,623
What’s the matter with you?
Are you wicked?

1440
01:38:14,988 --> 01:38:16,247
Well, I felt, um, formerly, I...

1441
01:38:16,286 --> 01:38:19,816
Never mind, Coffsnot, you were
ignominiously trounced at the hustings

1442
01:38:19,856 --> 01:38:23,092
in November’s election by your
worthy challenger, a Republican.

1443
01:38:23,113 --> 01:38:24,878
No, sir, I was not, um, trounced!

1444
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:26,888
Uh, he wants to steal my seat!
I didn’t lose the election...

1445
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:28,499
What difference does
it make if you lost or not,

1446
01:38:28,507 --> 01:38:31,951
the governor of our state, is...
A Democrat?

1447
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:35,417
No, he’s a...

1448
01:38:36,722 --> 01:38:38,284
A, um, a Ruh...

1449
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:39,184
Re.

1450
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,391
Re.

1451
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:43,623
– Pub.
– Pub.

1452
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:44,866
– Li.
– Li.

1453
01:38:44,935 --> 01:38:46,404
– Can.
– Can. Republican.

1454
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:48,607
I know what he is.
This is a rhetorical exercise.

1455
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:51,329
And Congress is controlled
by what party? Yours?

1456
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:54,948
Your party was beaten,

1457
01:38:55,052 --> 01:38:57,700
your challenger’s party
now controls the House,

1458
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,490
and hence the House
Committee on Elections,

1459
01:39:00,551 --> 01:39:03,064
so you have been beaten.

1460
01:39:03,094 --> 01:39:06,028
You shall shortly be sent
home in disgrace. Unless...

1461
01:39:06,059 --> 01:39:07,146
I know what I must do, sir,

1462
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,460
I will immediately become
a Republican and vote yes for...

1463
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,571
NO!

1464
01:39:11,275 --> 01:39:13,924
Coffroth... will vote yes,

1465
01:39:14,038 --> 01:39:16,896
but Coffroth will remain a
Democrat until after he does so.

1466
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:18,587
Why wait to switch?
I’m happy to switch...

1467
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:21,697
We want to show the amendment
has bipartisan support, you idiot.

1468
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:25,172
Early in the next Congress, when I tell
you to do so, you will switch parties.

1469
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,565
Now congratulations on your
victory, and get out.

1470
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:33,280
Now... give me the names of
whoever else you been hunting.

1471
01:39:35,431 --> 01:39:37,946
– LATHAM: George Yeaman.
– SCHELL: Yes. Yeaman.

1472
01:39:38,544 --> 01:39:40,096
BILBO: Among others.

1473
01:39:40,245 --> 01:39:41,947
 But Yeaman, that’d count.

1474
01:39:42,014 --> 01:39:45,233
– LATHAM: Y-E-A-M-A-N.
– LINCOLN: I got it.

1475
01:39:46,435 --> 01:39:47,860
LATHAM: Kentucky.

1476
01:39:50,456 --> 01:39:54,027
YEAMAN: I can’t vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1477
01:40:01,131 --> 01:40:03,533
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

1478
01:40:03,971 --> 01:40:06,267
filled with colored men in chains,

1479
01:40:06,358 --> 01:40:09,361
heading down the Mississippi
to the New Orleans slave markets.

1480
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:13,000
It sickened me.

1481
01:40:13,522 --> 01:40:15,894
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down,

1482
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:19,976
a pall around my eyes.

1483
01:40:21,507 --> 01:40:23,910
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember

1484
01:40:25,035 --> 01:40:27,472
in a way it never troubled my father,

1485
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:31,057
though he hated it, in his own fashion.

1486
01:40:31,991 --> 01:40:35,766
He knew no small holding dirt farmer
could compete with slave plantations.

1487
01:40:35,778 --> 01:40:38,180
He took us out from Kentucky...

1488
01:40:38,484 --> 01:40:41,695
to get away from ‘em.
He wanted Indiana kept free.

1489
01:40:42,873 --> 01:40:44,897
He wasn’t a kind man,

1490
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:51,256
but there was a rough moral urge
for fairness, for freedom in him.

1491
01:40:52,116 --> 01:40:54,303
I learnt that from him, I suppose,

1492
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:57,110
if little else from him.

1493
01:40:58,818 --> 01:41:01,693
We didn’t care for one
another, Mr. Yeaman.

1494
01:41:04,582 --> 01:41:06,548
– Well, I’m sorry to hear that.
– Loving kindness,

1495
01:41:06,575 --> 01:41:09,505
that most ordinary... thing
came to me

1496
01:41:09,625 --> 01:41:11,835
from other sources..
I’m grateful for that.

1497
01:41:11,945 --> 01:41:15,345
YEAMAN: I... I hate it, too, sir...

1498
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,503
slavery, but...

1499
01:41:18,473 --> 01:41:21,702
but we’re entirely unready
for emancipation.

1500
01:41:21,922 --> 01:41:25,386
There’s too many questions...
– We’re unready for peace too, ain’t we?

1501
01:41:25,566 --> 01:41:28,479
Yeah, when it comes, it’ll present
us with conundrums and

1502
01:41:28,505 --> 01:41:33,103
dangers greater than any we’ve faced
during the war, bloody as it’s been.

1503
01:41:33,395 --> 01:41:36,091
We’ll have to extemporize
and experiment with

1504
01:41:36,203 --> 01:41:38,605
what it is, when it is.

1505
01:41:41,732 --> 01:41:43,745
I read your speech, George.

1506
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:48,383
Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle.

1507
01:41:49,283 --> 01:41:52,103
No, no, but-but-but

1508
01:41:52,131 --> 01:41:57,227
but Negroes can't...
um... vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1509
01:41:57,849 --> 01:42:00,051
You're not suggesting we
enfranchise colored people.

1510
01:42:00,062 --> 01:42:05,096
I'm asking only that you disenthrall
yourself from the slave powers.

1511
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:09,974
I'll let you know when there's
an offer on my desk for surrender.

1512
01:42:10,008 --> 01:42:11,264
There's none before us now.

1513
01:42:11,311 --> 01:42:14,992
What's before us now, that's the vote
on the Thirteenth Amendment.

1514
01:42:16,552 --> 01:42:18,954
It's going to be so very close.

1515
01:42:22,146 --> 01:42:23,702
You see what you can do.

1516
01:42:33,018 --> 01:42:36,427
WILLIAM HUTTON: I can’t make
sense of it, what he died for.

1517
01:42:39,866 --> 01:42:44,510
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all,
I do, all black people.

1518
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,674
I am a prejudiced man.

1519
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:02,109
I’d change that in you if I could,
but that’s not why I come.

1520
01:43:03,232 --> 01:43:08,656
I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I expect
colored people will most likely be free.

1521
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:11,482
And when that’s so, it’s simple
truth that your brother’s

1522
01:43:11,499 --> 01:43:14,621
bravery, and his death, helped make it so.

1523
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:19,850
Only you can decide whether
that’s sense enough for you, or not.

1524
01:43:22,652 --> 01:43:25,054
My deepest sympathies to your family.

1525
01:43:37,173 --> 01:43:39,972
PRESTON BLAIR: We’ve managed
our members to a fare thee-well.

1526
01:43:40,942 --> 01:43:44,109
You’ve had no defections from
the Republican right to trouble you.

1527
01:43:45,396 --> 01:43:47,798
Whereas as to what you promised...

1528
01:43:48,093 --> 01:43:50,496
where the hell are the commissioners?!

1529
01:43:51,215 --> 01:43:53,884
JAMES ASHLEY: Oh my God... It’s true!

1530
01:43:55,336 --> 01:43:59,181
You... you lied to me, Mr. Lincoln!

1531
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:03,700
You evaded my requests for a denial that-
that there is a Confederate peace offer

1532
01:44:03,818 --> 01:44:05,700
because... because there is one!

1533
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:09,904
We are absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing!

1534
01:44:09,983 --> 01:44:13,156
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: We don’t need
a goddamned abolition amendment.

1535
01:44:13,269 --> 01:44:15,292
M.B.: Leave the Constitution alone!
– ASHLEY: What if... what if...

1536
01:44:15,347 --> 01:44:17,380
.. these peace commissioners
appear today, or...

1537
01:44:17,432 --> 01:44:18,960
ASHLEY: .. or worse, on the morning...
– M.B.: State by state you can extirpate...

1538
01:44:21,907 --> 01:44:24,309
I can’t listen to this anymore.

1539
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:31,006
I can’t accomplish a goddamned
thing of any human meaning

1540
01:44:31,114 --> 01:44:38,611
or worth until we cure ourselves of
slavery, and end this pestilential war,

1541
01:44:39,616 --> 01:44:44,501
and whether any of you or
anyone else knows it, I know I need this!

1542
01:44:44,885 --> 01:44:47,287
This amendment is that cure!

1543
01:44:51,044 --> 01:44:55,569
We’re stepped out upon
the world’s stage now, NOW!

1544
01:44:55,631 --> 01:44:58,756
With the fate of human
dignity in our hands!

1545
01:45:00,402 --> 01:45:05,921
Blood’s been spilt to afford us
this moment! Now now now!

1546
01:45:06,257 --> 01:45:08,961
But you grousle and heckle and dodge about

1547
01:45:08,974 --> 01:45:12,206
like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!

1548
01:45:12,923 --> 01:45:14,685
See what is before you!

1549
01:45:15,286 --> 01:45:19,347
See the here and now!
That’s the hardest thing,

1550
01:45:19,384 --> 01:45:21,786
the only thing that accounts!

1551
01:45:23,108 --> 01:45:27,477
Abolishing slavery by
constitutional provision

1552
01:45:27,483 --> 01:45:31,867
settles the fate, for all coming time,

1553
01:45:32,564 --> 01:45:35,465
not only of the millions now in bondage

1554
01:45:37,687 --> 01:45:41,189
but of unborn millions to come.

1555
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:44,444
Two votes stand in its way,

1556
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:47,073
and these votes must be procured!

1557
01:45:50,746 --> 01:45:55,162
We need two yeses,
three abstentions, or

1558
01:45:55,445 --> 01:46:00,369
four yeses and one more abstention
and the amendment will pass.

1559
01:46:00,432 --> 01:46:03,660
You got a night and a day and a night
and several perfectly good hours,

1560
01:46:03,681 --> 01:46:05,528
now get the hell out of here and get ‘em!

1561
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:07,990
ASHLEY: Yes. But how?

1562
01:46:10,016 --> 01:46:12,418
Buzzards’ guts, man.

1563
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:18,390
I am the President of the
United States of America,

1564
01:46:18,762 --> 01:46:21,765
clothed in immense power!

1565
01:46:23,648 --> 01:46:25,650
You will procure me these votes.

1566
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:38,848
LITTON: We welcome you,
ladies and gentlemen,

1567
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:45,542
first in the history of this
people’s chamber, to your House!

1568
01:48:10,077 --> 01:48:12,480
COLFAX: Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

1569
01:48:20,344 --> 01:48:22,359
ASHLEY: On the matter of
the joint resolution before us,

1570
01:48:22,373 --> 01:48:25,623
presenting a Thirteenth Amendment
to our national Constitution,

1571
01:48:25,811 --> 01:48:28,030
which was passed last year by the Senate,

1572
01:48:28,323 --> 01:48:32,456
and which has been debated now by this
estimable body for the past several weeks,

1573
01:48:33,596 --> 01:48:34,939
today we will vote...

1574
01:48:34,964 --> 01:48:38,964
[Cheers, boos, applause]

1575
01:48:40,221 --> 01:48:44,786
By mutual agreement, we shall
hear <i>brief</i> final statements,

1576
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:49,890
beginning with the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.

1577
01:48:56,144 --> 01:48:57,512
PENDLETON: I’ve just received

1578
01:48:59,297 --> 01:49:00,695
confirmation

1579
01:49:01,236 --> 01:49:03,353
of what previously has
been merely rumored!

1580
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:04,962
Affidavits!

1581
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,926
From loyal citizens recently
returned from Richmond.

1582
01:49:07,989 --> 01:49:10,903
They testify that
Commissioners have indeed

1583
01:49:10,931 --> 01:49:14,149
come north and ought to have
arrived by now in Washington City,

1584
01:49:14,232 --> 01:49:18,820
bearing an offer of immediate
cessation of our civil war!

1585
01:49:19,145 --> 01:49:21,445
[The chamber explodes]

1586
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:22,356
WOOD: Is it true, sir?

1587
01:49:22,357 --> 01:49:24,759
WOOD: Are there Confederate
commissioners in the Capitol?

1588
01:49:24,913 --> 01:49:27,470
ASHLEY: I don’t... I have no idea
where they are or if they’ve arrived.

1589
01:49:27,507 --> 01:49:28,458
WOOD: If they’ve arrived?!

1590
01:49:28,459 --> 01:49:30,103
PENDLETON: I appeal to
my fellow Democrats,

1591
01:49:30,214 --> 01:49:34,176
to all Republican representatives
who give a fig for peace!

1592
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:39,530
Postpone this vote until we have
answers from the President himself!

1593
01:49:42,821 --> 01:49:46,033
[ Democrats begin to chant]
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1594
01:49:46,248 --> 01:49:49,130
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1595
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,259
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1596
01:49:53,238 --> 01:49:54,778
AARON HADDAM: Gentlemen!

1597
01:50:03,252 --> 01:50:04,775
WOOD: I have made a motion!

1598
01:50:04,797 --> 01:50:08,166
Does anyone here care to second my motion?

1599
01:50:08,191 --> 01:50:10,991
[ Democrats still shouting]
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1600
01:50:19,868 --> 01:50:20,898
HADDAM: Gentlemen.

1601
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:25,862
The conservative faction of
border and western Republicans

1602
01:50:25,873 --> 01:50:28,275
cannot approve this amendment,

1603
01:50:28,385 --> 01:50:30,788
about which we harbor grave doubts...

1604
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:34,906
if a peace offer is being
held hostage to its success.

1605
01:50:35,503 --> 01:50:40,404
Joining together with our Democratic
colleagues, I second the motion to postpone.

1606
01:50:40,452 --> 01:50:43,954
[Bilbo mumbles]
LATHAM: Quick, man! Quick!

1607
01:51:33,111 --> 01:51:37,723
LINCOLN: This is precisely what
Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to?

1608
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:42,821
Word for word, this is precisely the
assurance that he demands of me?

1609
01:51:42,907 --> 01:51:44,468
BILBO: Yes sir.

1610
01:52:04,081 --> 01:52:06,294
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

1611
01:52:08,868 --> 01:52:13,448
JOHN HAY: I feel, um, I have
to say, Mr. Lincoln, that this...

1612
01:52:13,716 --> 01:52:15,848
Could you please just step outside?!

1613
01:52:15,978 --> 01:52:17,109
You gonna have a chat now,

1614
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:19,836
with the whole of the House of
Representatives waiting on that?

1615
01:52:19,962 --> 01:52:22,365
Making false representation
to Congress is...

1616
01:52:22,997 --> 01:52:24,800
It’s, it’s...
– It's Impeachable.

1617
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:27,465
I’ve made no false representation.

1618
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:29,563
But there are!

1619
01:52:29,804 --> 01:52:31,569
There is a delegation from Richmond.

1620
01:52:31,666 --> 01:52:33,251
LINCOLN: Give me the note, Johnnie.

1621
01:52:36,923 --> 01:52:39,326
Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.

1622
01:52:57,816 --> 01:52:59,617
ASHLEY: From the President:

1623
01:52:59,842 --> 01:53:02,897
“So far as I know, there are no
peace commissioners in the city

1624
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,343
nor are there likely to be”.

1625
01:53:05,685 --> 01:53:07,833
PENDLETON: “So far as I know”?!

1626
01:53:08,464 --> 01:53:10,085
That means nothing!

1627
01:53:10,985 --> 01:53:14,541
Are there commissioners from
the South or aren’t there?!

1628
01:53:15,513 --> 01:53:17,168
ASHLEY: The President
has answered you, sir.

1629
01:53:17,201 --> 01:53:18,521
Your peace offer is a fiction!

1630
01:53:18,668 --> 01:53:20,213
PENDLETON: That is not a denial,

1631
01:53:20,562 --> 01:53:22,405
it is a lawyer’s dodge!

1632
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:26,102
ASHLEY: Mr. Haddam,
is your faction satisfied?

1633
01:53:28,433 --> 01:53:31,206
The conservative Republican
faction’s satisfied,

1634
01:53:31,272 --> 01:53:33,310
and we thank Mr. Lincoln.

1635
01:53:33,842 --> 01:53:36,169

I order the main question.

A motion has been made to bring the bill
for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote.

[Yeaman mumbles inaudibly]

1678

Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn’t hear you vote.

The Speaker doesn’t vote!

01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,657
COLFAX: The Speaker
may vote if he so chooses.

1713
01:59:43,688 --> 01:59:45,734
It is highly unusual, sir.

1714
01:59:45,784 --> 01:59:49,160
This isn’t usual, Mr. Pendleton.
This is history.

1715
01:59:51,455 --> 01:59:54,458
CLERK: How does Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?

1716
01:59:58,738 --> 02:00:01,140

one hundred nineteen votes for,

1727
02:02:13,048 --> 02:02:15,438
With the bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?

1728
02:02:22,002 --> 02:02:23,856
CLERK: That's... that’s the official bill.

1729
02:02:24,263 --> 02:02:26,065
I’ll return it in the morning.

1730
02:02:26,855 --> 02:02:30,215
Creased...
but unharmed.

1731
02:03:20,345 --> 02:03:22,431
STEVENS: A gift for you.

1732
02:03:27,107 --> 02:03:29,310
STEVENS: The greatest measure
of the Nineteenth Century,

1733
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,065
passed by corruption, aided and
abetted by the purest man in America.

1734
02:03:52,471 --> 02:03:54,874
Aah, I wish you’d been present.

1735
02:03:55,218 --> 02:03:57,616
– LYDIA SMITH: I wish I’d been.
– It was a spectacle.

1736
02:03:58,104 --> 02:04:00,506
LYDIA: You can’t bring
your housekeeper to the House.

1737
02:04:00,704 --> 02:04:04,010
I won’t give them gossip.
This is enough.

1738
02:04:04,784 --> 02:04:06,259
This is...

1739
02:04:07,516 --> 02:04:09,810
It’s more than enough for now.

1740
02:04:10,896 --> 02:04:12,763
STEVENS: Read it to me again, my love.

1741
02:04:14,429 --> 02:04:15,797
LYDIA: “Proposed”...

1742
02:04:15,869 --> 02:04:17,671
– And adopted.
– Adopted.

1743
02:04:18,501 --> 02:04:22,284
“An Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.

1744
02:04:22,708 --> 02:04:28,533
Section One: Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude,

1745
02:04:28,534 --> 02:04:31,299
except as a punishment for crime

1746
02:04:31,378 --> 02:04:34,881
whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted,

1747
02:04:35,305 --> 02:04:38,463
shall exist within the United States,

1748
02:04:38,717 --> 02:04:42,467
or any place subject
to their jurisdiction.”

1749
02:04:42,534 --> 02:04:46,223
– Section Two.
– “Congress shall have power

1750
02:04:46,338 --> 02:04:51,027
to enforce this amendment
by appropriate legislation.”

1751
02:04:58,336 --> 02:05:04,336
[All cheer Lincoln’s arrival]

1752
02:05:12,645 --> 02:05:13,983
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
Let me be blunt.

1753
02:05:14,476 --> 02:05:18,885
Will the southern states resume
their former position in the Union

1754
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:24,594
speedily enough to enable us to block
ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment?

1755
02:05:28,875 --> 02:05:31,277
LINCOLN: I’d like peace immediately.

1756
02:05:31,392 --> 02:05:32,954
STEPHENS: Yes, and...?

1757
02:05:35,745 --> 02:05:38,147
LINCOLN: I’d like your states restored

1758
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:41,912
to their practical relations
to the Union immediately.

1759
02:05:45,066 --> 02:05:49,141
If this could be given me in writing,
as Vice President of the Confederacy,

1760
02:05:49,142 --> 02:05:53,897
I’d bring that document
with celerity to Jefferson Davis.

1761
02:05:55,483 --> 02:05:59,594
SEWARD: Surrender, and
we can discuss reconstruction.

1762
02:06:01,292 --> 02:06:03,694
Surrender won’t be thought of

1763
02:06:03,787 --> 02:06:06,393
unless you’ve assured us, in writing,

1764
02:06:06,526 --> 02:06:09,529
that we’ll be readmitted in
time to block this amendment.

1765
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:13,868
HUNTER: This is the arrogant
demand of a conqueror.

1766
02:06:13,894 --> 02:06:18,146
SEWARD: You’ll not be a conquered
people, Mr. Hunter, you will be citizens.

1767
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:22,476
Returned to the laws and the
guarantees of rights of the Constitution.

1768
02:06:23,126 --> 02:06:27,906
Which now extinguishes slavery.
And with it our economy.

1769
02:06:28,753 --> 02:06:32,036
All our laws will be determined by
a Congress of vengeful Yankees,

1770
02:06:32,602 --> 02:06:35,727
all our rights’ll be subject
to a Supreme Court

1771
02:06:35,983 --> 02:06:38,385
benched by Black Republican radicals.

1772
02:06:38,612 --> 02:06:41,791
All our traditions will be obliterated.

1773
02:06:42,656 --> 02:06:44,546
We won’t know ourselves anymore.

1774
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:48,825
We ain’t here to discuss reconstruction,

1775
02:06:48,838 --> 02:06:51,478
we have no legal basis
for that discussion.

1776
02:06:51,513 --> 02:06:52,980
But I don’t want to deal falsely.

1777
02:06:53,051 --> 02:06:55,453
The Northern states’ll ratify,
most of ‘em.

1778
02:06:55,656 --> 02:06:58,633
As I figure, it remains for two of
the Southern states to do the same,

1779
02:06:58,655 --> 02:07:00,666
even after all are readmitted.

1780
02:07:00,823 --> 02:07:02,417
And I been working on that.

1781
02:07:02,942 --> 02:07:04,159
Tennessee and Louisiana.

1782
02:07:04,464 --> 02:07:06,867
Arkansas too, most likely.
It’ll be ratified.

1783
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:10,264
Slavery, sir... it’s done.

1784
02:07:23,526 --> 02:07:26,653
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,

1785
02:07:26,929 --> 02:07:29,547
even submit to losing freedoms...

1786
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:32,735
the freedom to oppress, for instance...

1787
02:07:33,736 --> 02:07:37,464
we may discover other freedoms
previously unknown to us.

1788
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:41,489
Had you kept faith with
democratic process,

1789
02:07:41,668 --> 02:07:44,671
as frustrating as that can be...
– CAMPBELL: Come sir,

1790
02:07:44,828 --> 02:07:47,117
spare us at least these pieties.

1791
02:07:48,246 --> 02:07:50,511
Did you defeat us with ballots?

1792
02:07:51,577 --> 02:07:53,907
STEPHENS: How’ve you held your Union together?

1793
02:07:54,284 --> 02:07:55,578
Through democracy?

1794
02:07:56,592 --> 02:08:00,195
How many hundreds of thousands
have died during your administration?

1795
02:08:01,228 --> 02:08:03,630
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.

1796
02:08:07,566 --> 02:08:09,404
LINCOLN: It may be you’re right.

1797
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:18,565
But say all we done is show
the world that democracy isn’t chaos,

1798
02:08:21,477 --> 02:08:26,590
that there is a great invisible
strength in a people’s union?

1799
02:08:27,184 --> 02:08:32,407
Say we’ve shown that a people can
endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere?

1800
02:08:33,457 --> 02:08:37,427
Mightn’t that save at least the
idea of democracy to aspire to?

1801
02:08:38,327 --> 02:08:40,730
Eventually, to become worthy of?

1802
02:08:44,853 --> 02:08:48,228
At all rates, whatever may be
proven by blood and sacrifice

1803
02:08:48,256 --> 02:08:50,659
must’ve been proved by now.

1804
02:09:01,044 --> 02:09:03,447
Shall we stop this bleeding?

1805
02:10:41,859 --> 02:10:45,188
LINCOLN: Once he surrenders, send
his boys back to their homes,

1806
02:10:45,411 --> 02:10:47,667
their farms, their shops.

1807
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:52,637
GRANT: Yes sir... as we discussed.

1808
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:56,407
LINCOLN: Liberality all around.
No punishment. I don’t want that.

1809
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:59,728
And the leaders -Jeff
and the rest of ‘em...

1810
02:10:59,862 --> 02:11:01,986
if they escape, leave the
country while my back’s turned,

1811
02:11:01,989 --> 02:11:04,035
that wouldn’t upset me none.

1812
02:11:05,054 --> 02:11:07,812
When peace comes
it mustn’t just be hangings.

1813
02:11:14,230 --> 02:11:16,130
By outward appearance,

1814
02:11:17,499 --> 02:11:20,053
you’re ten years older
than you were a year ago.

1815
02:11:23,669 --> 02:11:26,547
Some weariness has bit at my bones.

1816
02:11:39,282 --> 02:11:43,291
I never seen the like of it before.
What I seen today.

1817
02:11:45,248 --> 02:11:47,650
Never seen the like of it before.

1818
02:11:49,496 --> 02:11:54,003
GRANT: You always knew that...
what this was going to be.

1819
02:11:55,626 --> 02:11:58,029
Intimate, and ugly.

1820
02:12:01,021 --> 02:12:04,646
You must’ve needed to see it close
when you decided to come down here.

1821
02:12:23,404 --> 02:12:26,757
LINCOLN: We’ve made it possible
for one another to do terrible things.

1822
02:12:29,517 --> 02:12:31,509
GRANT: And we’ve won the war.

1823
02:12:31,988 --> 02:12:35,356
Now you have to lead us out of it.

1824
02:14:07,203 --> 02:14:08,939
You’ve an itch to travel?

1825
02:14:10,378 --> 02:14:11,940
I’d like that.

1826
02:14:12,543 --> 02:14:14,603
To the West by rail.

1827
02:14:14,878 --> 02:14:17,280
 Overseas.

1828
02:14:18,469 --> 02:14:20,030
The Holy Land.

1829
02:14:22,822 --> 02:14:27,410
Awfully pious for a man who takes
his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday.

1830
02:14:27,634 --> 02:14:29,196
Jerusalem.

1831
02:14:29,353 --> 02:14:31,456
Where David and Solomon walked.

1832
02:14:31,637 --> 02:14:35,396
I dream of... walking
in that ancient city.

1833
02:14:41,178 --> 02:14:45,640
All anyone will remember of me is
I was crazy and I ruined your happiness.

1834
02:14:46,439 --> 02:14:49,705
Anyone thinks that
doesn’t understand, Molly.

1835
02:14:52,791 --> 02:14:54,362
When they look at you,

1836
02:14:55,841 --> 02:14:58,748
at what it cost to live
at the heart of this,

1837
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:03,340
they’ll wonder at it. They’ll
wonder at you, they should.

1838
02:15:05,178 --> 02:15:07,975
But they should also look
at the wretched woman by your side,

1839
02:15:07,994 --> 02:15:10,396
if they want to understand
what this was truly like.

1840
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:16,111
For the ordinary person.
For anyone other than you.

1841
02:15:16,170 --> 02:15:18,169
We must try to be happier.

1842
02:15:18,731 --> 02:15:20,774
We must. Both of us.

1843
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:23,512
We’ve been so miserable for so long.

1844
02:15:32,647 --> 02:15:35,049
LINCOLN: I did say some colored men,

1845
02:15:35,269 --> 02:15:39,959
the intelligent, the educated,
and veterans, I qualified it.

1846
02:15:40,194 --> 02:15:43,523
ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens is furious,
he wants to know why you qualified it.

1847
02:15:43,598 --> 02:15:46,004
COLFAX: No one's heard the
intelligent or the educated part.

1848
02:15:46,037 --> 02:15:50,516
All they heard was the first time
any president has ever made mention

1849
02:15:50,787 --> 02:15:52,349
of Negro voting.

1850
02:15:52,597 --> 02:15:56,273
LINCOLN: Still, I wish I had
mentioned it in a better speech.

1851
02:15:56,305 --> 02:15:59,932
ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens also wants to know
why you didn’t make a better speech.

1852
02:16:03,068 --> 02:16:04,878
NICOLAY: Mrs. Lincoln’s
waiting in the carriage.

1853
02:16:04,937 --> 02:16:06,527
She wants me to remind you of the hour,

1854
02:16:06,544 --> 02:16:09,389
and that you’ll have to pick up
Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.

1855
02:16:13,311 --> 02:16:15,202
– LINCOLN: Am I in trouble?
– SLADE: No, sir.

1856
02:16:15,397 --> 02:16:17,199
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

1857
02:16:32,437 --> 02:16:34,840
LINCOLN: I suppose it’s time to go,

1858
02:16:35,371 --> 02:16:36,933
though I would rather stay.

1859
02:18:07,011 --> 02:18:09,487
OWNER OF THE THEATER:
The President has been shot!

1860
02:18:12,572 --> 02:18:16,245
The President has been
shot at Ford’s Theater!

1861
02:18:58,166 --> 02:19:01,471
DR. BARNES: It’s... 7:22 in the morning,

1862
02:19:02,541 --> 02:19:05,487
Saturday the 15th of April.
It’s all over.

1863
02:19:05,702 --> 02:19:08,105
The President is no more.

1864
02:19:10,777 --> 02:19:13,180
STANTON: Now he belongs to the ages.

1865
02:19:19,364 --> 02:19:24,695
LINCOLN: <i>Fondly do we hope,
fervently do we pray,</i>

1866
02:19:26,165 --> 02:19:31,479
<i>that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away.</i>

1867
02:19:34,318 --> 02:19:36,721
Yet, if God wills that it continue

1868
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:41,112
until all the wealth piled by
the bondman's

1869
02:19:41,125 --> 02:19:46,104
two hundred and fifty years
of unrequited toil shall be sunk,

1870
02:19:47,435 --> 02:19:51,310
and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash

1871
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:55,527
shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword,

1872
02:19:56,544 --> 02:20:01,562
as was said three thousand years ago,
so still it must be said

1873
02:20:02,059 --> 02:20:09,886
"the judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether.”

1874
02:20:14,993 --> 02:20:16,795
With malice toward none,

1875
02:20:19,001 --> 02:20:21,403
with charity for all,

1876
02:20:22,537 --> 02:20:26,515
with firmness in the right as
God gives us to see the right,

1877
02:20:26,554 --> 02:20:29,843
let us strive on to finish
the work we are in,

1878
02:20:30,637 --> 02:20:33,040
to bind up the nation's wounds,

1879
02:20:34,096 --> 02:20:38,684
to care for him who shall
have borne the battle,

1880
02:20:40,701 --> 02:20:43,104
and for his widow and his orphan,

1881
02:20:44,837 --> 02:20:49,385
to do all which may achieve and cherish

1882
02:20:50,152 --> 02:20:55,482
a just and a lasting peace among ourselves

1883
02:20:56,140 --> 02:20:58,812
and with all nations.

1884
02:21:04,165 --> 02:21:10,171
