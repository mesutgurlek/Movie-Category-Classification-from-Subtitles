A sculptor found
this special stone.

00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:51,004
He worked on it
for months,

102
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,973
until he finally
finished it.

103
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,009
His friends said he'd
created a great statue.

104
00:12:56,077 --> 00:13:00,981
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

105
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,049
The statue
was always there.

106
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:07,653
He just cleared away
the small pieces.

We didn't make you

We just chipped away
the rough edges.

You'll always
tear away at yourself

You not look like

A mercenary?

173

No.

or mercenary.
