Two simply enormous Roman lords

How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

212
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:50,117
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I guess they're enormous.

213
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:52,635
Tell them to wait for me
when they arrive.

214

- Master, you don't understand!
- How enormous
do these Roman lords get?

Wait a minute.

Two pairs.
Oh, yes.

00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:19,354
- I have something
that would please them.
- Two pairs to the death.

253
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,955
To the death, Your Ladyship?

254
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,839
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua...

256
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,597
But I beg Your Honours.

257
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:33,117
We train the finest
gladiators in all Italy.

258
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:37,752
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship which is better
than you can see in Rome.

259
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:41,277
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish.

00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,955
But here, no, we never fight
them to the death.

Today is an exception.

00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,750
But the ill feeling it would spread
through the whole school.

264
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,719
Then the cost.
Oh, the cost!

265
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,996
Name your price.

266
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:02,877

Are you serious, sir?

269
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,949
Arrange it immediately.

270

Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

- Inexhaustible.

- To the death?
- How do you know?

274
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,316
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

275
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,517
- Who fights?
- I don't know.

They won't.

279
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:50,951
What if they did?

280
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,874
Would you fight?

281
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:57,959
I'd have to. So would you.

282
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,430
Would you try to kill me?

283
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,632
Yes, I'd kill.

284
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:05,791
I'd try to stay--

285

There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

474
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:56,320
I did not say the whole garrison.

475
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:59,518
Six cohorts will
more than do the job.

Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

479
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:14,672
I accept the charge of the senate...

480
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:18,117
if the senate truly charges me.

481

Slave hunting's a dirty business.

00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:31,036
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

484

It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

492
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:10,156
Maybe.

493
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,277
At least it gives me a chance...

494
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:14,875
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

495
00:58:14,961 --> 00:58:17,521
You know, this republic of ours...

496
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:19,796
is something like a rich widow.

497
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:22,031
Most Romans love her
as their mother.

498
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,796
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

499
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:29,032
Hail Glabrus!

- And with you too.

- May the gods adore you.
- Only through your prayers.

506

Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice
for Glabrus' success, hmm?

507
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,992
I thought you
had reservations about the gods.

508
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:10,231
Privately I believe in none.
Neither do you.

509
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:12,232

Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:47,918
- He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
- Excellent.

513
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:53,629
- What have we here?
- A gift from the governor of Sicily.

whom I also taught the classics.

520
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:23,838
Classics, indeed.

521
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:26,879

I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

535
01:01:17,681 --> 01:01:20,320
Did Gracchus have something
to do with this brilliant affair?

536
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:24,235
Yes, he proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

537
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:26,960
And you? Do you think
I made you commander...

538
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:30,078
to control some
rock patch on Vesuvius?

539
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,436
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

540
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:35,718
I only take six cohorts.
The rest remain.

541
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:37,792
Under whose command?

542
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:41,032
- Under Caesar's.
- Oh, excellent, excellent!

543
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:43,840

of the mob and the senate...

I'll refuse,
withdraw from the expedition.

547
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:56,315
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician...

548
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:58,869
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

549

You've pledged to go,
and go you must.

to move against you--

He won't!
Has no need to.

immobilized me altogether.

Do you truly believe I'd order
my legions to enter Rome?

556
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:20,995
You can... if you have to.

557
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:23,436
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law...

558
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:26,672
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

559
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:30,470
- Sulla did.
- Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

of his line!

No, my young friend.

One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

564
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,359
It follows that I cannot come
to power or defend myself...

565
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:52,275
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of all.

566
01:02:52,361 --> 01:02:56,593
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

I thought
I'd never see you again.

641
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:19,271
Everything's so different.

642

The last time I saw you, you--

643
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:32,278
you were waiting in the arena to--

you were in Rome.

How'd you escape?

I--

647
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:51,796
I jumped out of the cart...

648
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:54,111
and Batiatus was so fat--

649
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:07,677
I flew out of the cart...

650

he couldn't catch me.

May I remind you...

you've been good to me

- I've been good to you? Oh, ho, ho.
- Oh, yes.

675
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:58,237
You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

676
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:02,758
And you arranged gladiatorial
jousts at cost, practically.

677
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:05,150
You are both ethical
in business...

678
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:09,029
and certainly
farsighted socially.

679

- Hasn't she? I like it.
- So do I.

681
01:14:14,401 --> 01:14:17,871
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

682
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:21,590
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

683
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:25,674
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

In spite of your vices...

685

you are the most generous Roman
of our time.

686
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:33,237

[ Chuckle ] Ladies.

688
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,630
Ladies! Since when are they a vice?

689
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:45,111
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

690
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:47,396
I hope I pronounced that word.

691
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:50,757
It's well-known that even your groom
and butler are women.

692
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:52,638
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

693

<i>I keep these women out</i>
<i>of my respect for Roman morality:</i>

694
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:59,758
That morality, which has made
Rome strong enough to steal...

695
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:01,957
two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners...

696
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,874

You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

701
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,512
Exactly.

702
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:23,674
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

703
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,873

Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate...

707
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:39,558
but there's one man
I can't think of without fuming.

- <i>Who</i>'<i>s that?</i>
- Crassus.

709

- You've grown very ambitious
in your hatred.
- <i>Do you blame me?</i>

710
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:47,995
There I was, better than
a millionaire in the morning...

711
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,072
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall...

712
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:52,470
with nothing but rags
and my flesh.

713
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:55,359
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua...

714
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:58,751
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs!

715
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:02,834
These two daughters of Venus
had to taunt the gladiators...

716
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:05,879

and before I knew what had happened...

- <i>revolution on my hands!</i>
- What...

718

719
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:14,830
I sold Crassus

- Whom?
- <i>Varinia: May the gods give her wings:</i>

721
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:21,559
There was no contract,

722
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:23,757
as soon as the deal was made.

723
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:27,800
Now she's off with Spartacus

<i>And Crassus,</i>
<i>no mention of money!</i>

You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

726
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:36,200
Well... she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

727
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:39,318
- She is very thin and--
- Look around you.

728

To annoy Crassus, of course,

735
01:17:05,641 --> 01:17:07,677
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

In here with it.

737
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:23,952
That will do.

738
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:32,237
Do you steal, Antoninus?

739
01:17:32,321 --> 01:17:34,437
No, master.

740
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:36,876
Do you lie?

741
01:17:36,961 --> 01:17:39,759
Not if I can avoid it.

742
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:43,550
Have you...
ever dishonoured the gods?

743
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:45,950
No, master.

744
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,316
Do you refrain
from these vices...

745
01:17:48,401 --> 01:17:50,835
out of respect
for the moral virtues?

746
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,912
Yes, master.

747
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:58,589
Do you eat oysters?

748
01:17:58,681 --> 01:18:01,241
When I have them, master.

749
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,835
Do you eat snails?

750
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:05,991
No, master.

751
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:10,398
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

752
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:13,757
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

753
01:18:13,841 --> 01:18:15,991
No, master.

754
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:17,878
Of course not.

755
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:23,471
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

756
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:25,995
Yes, master.

757
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,118
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

758
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:32,716
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

759
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:36,152
Hmm?

760
01:18:37,841 --> 01:18:41,390
It could be argued so, master.

761
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:46,517
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

762
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:04,759
My taste includes...

763
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:07,594
both snails and oysters.

01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:18,874

There's only one way to deal
with Rome, Antoninus.

01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:09,832
You must serve her.

You must abase yourself
before her.

781

You must grovel at her feet.

01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,874
- and we can march on Rome.
- Come on, once again.

789
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:33,121
Here on Vesuvius,
we're safe from attack...

790
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:35,317
while we organize
ourselves into an army.

791
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:38,040
It may take six months,
a year.

792
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:41,318
Once we're strong, we're gonna fight
our way south to the sea.

793
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:44,313
We're going to arrange for ships
with the Cilician pirates.

794
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:47,438
The sea will be our road home.

795
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:49,796
If you agree, you may join us.

796
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:54,397
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

797
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:57,041
Too many women.

798
01:22:57,121 --> 01:22:58,679
What's wrong with women?

799
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:00,558
Where would you be now,
you lout...

800
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:03,314
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell...

801
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:05,471
to get you
into this accursed world?

802
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:08,234
I can handle a knife
in the dark as well as anyone.

803
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,710
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

804
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:15,079
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters.

805
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:19,552
- I want to see Spartacus.
- All right, grandmother. I'm Spartacus.

806
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:23,429
Stay with us. We'll need a million
Roman shrouds before we're through.

807
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:30,989
- Where do you come from?
- Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

808
01:23:31,081 --> 01:23:34,391
- What kind of work did you do there?
- 1 6 years a carpenter.

809
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:38,076
Good.
We can use carpenters.

810
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:41,312
- What kind of work did you do?
- Chief steward.

811
01:23:41,401 --> 01:23:44,791
You'll help with the food supplies.
Report to Patullus.

812

01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:49,714
Singer of songs.

814
01:23:49,801 --> 01:23:52,918
Singer of songs?

815
01:23:53,001 --> 01:23:54,832
But what work did you do?

816
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:57,594
That's my work.
I also juggle.

817
01:23:57,681 --> 01:24:00,149
Juggle.
What else do you do?

818
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:02,471
I can do feats of magic.

819
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,711
Magic?

820
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:07,759
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

821
01:25:31,161 --> 01:25:34,756
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman.

822
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:36,672
How about you?
You, sir?

823
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:39,753
Here we have
a likely subject.

824
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:43,550
You'll notice there is
nothing in my hand, true?

825
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:45,597
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

826
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:47,637
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three!

827
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:50,189
I make a bowl.
My hand is upside down...

828
01:25:50,281 --> 01:25:52,476
and I ask you to blow at it.

829
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,995
Not hard enough.
Hard!

830

It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

of noble birth yourself.

Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

Let me put it differently.

983
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:52,398
If you looked
into a magic crystal...

984

and you saw your army destroyed,
and yourself dead...

Yes.

Knowing that you must lose?

989

Knowing we can't.

990
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:14,553
All men lose when they die,
and all men die.

991
01:37:14,641 --> 01:37:17,235
But a slave and a free man
lose different things.

992
01:37:17,321 --> 01:37:19,232
They both lose life.

993
01:37:19,321 --> 01:37:22,711
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

994
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:26,680
A slave loses his pain.

995
01:37:26,761 --> 01:37:30,436
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

996

That's why
he's not afraid of it.
