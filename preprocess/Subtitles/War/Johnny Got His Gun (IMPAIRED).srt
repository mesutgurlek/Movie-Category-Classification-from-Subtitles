[mortar falling]

00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,577
[deep breathing]

5
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,590
[breathing continues]

6
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:44,605
How did you get him
so quickly?

7
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,607
A medical team heard
the shell coming in.

8
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,108
Apparently, he did, too.

9
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,011
Chest and belly
practically unmarked.

10
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,381
Curious how they always
double up in the fetal position.

11
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,849
What's curious about it?

12
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,684
They're trying to
protect their genitals.

13
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,553
Well, this young man
unfortunately succeeded.

14
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,422
Any identification?

15
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:02,456
No, sir.

16
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:03,758
Then we'll assume he's ours.

17
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,694
I'll need to take personal
charge of this case

18
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,162
until repairs are completed.

19
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,130
That could be
rather a long time,

20
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,632
Colonel Tillery.

21
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,100
Wouldn't you say, Captain,

22
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,036
that it's worth a year
of any doctor's life

23
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,837
to observe
a case like this?

24
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,782
You'd never know what
has happened to him.

25
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,284
The one part of his brain
that has escaped damage

26
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,287
is the medulla oblongata.

27
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
It is only because of this

28
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,291
that his heart, vasal, motor,

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,793
and respiratory centers
still function.

30
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,796
In short, that he lives.

31
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,797

00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,864
Post-operation orders,

36
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,865
Colonel M.F. Tillery,

37
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,367
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

38
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,870
Although the cerebellum
still permits

39
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,371
limited physical movement,

40
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,874
said movement
signifies nothing.

41
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,376
Bodily actions
have become violent,

42
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,878
and are persistently
repetitive

43
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,382
and must be treated as
reflexive muscular spasms--

44
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,884
which is to say, by sedation.

45
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,758
The cerebrum has suffered
massive and irreparable damage.

46
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,259
Had I not been sure of this,

47
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,262
I would not have
permitted him to live.

48
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,778
There's no justification
for his continued existence

49
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,747
unless we learn from him
how to help others.

50
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:25,750
Care for him as gently

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,751
as if he knew
what you were doing

52
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:30,755
and would feel the pain
if you did it badly.

53
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,257
Attending personnel
will remember that

54
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:34,691
good medical care forbids

55
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,461
emotional involvement
with the patient.

56
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,363
Avoid such involvement
by remembering

57
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,375
that it is impossible for
a decerebrated individual

58
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,878
to experience pain,
pleasure, memory,

59
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,323
dreams, or thought
of any kind.

60
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:53,326
It follows, therefore,
that this young man

61
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:56,829
will be as unfeeling,
as unthinking as the dead

62
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,332
until the day he joins them.

Kareen?

66
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,095
Kareen?

67
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,601
What happened?

68
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,614
Where am I?

69
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,122
It's dark in here.

70
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,126
Shouldn't have
turned the lights out.

71
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,136
Your old man
will be sore.

72
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,971
Oh, Mike won't care.
He loves me.

73
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,574
Only could I just
ask you one thing?

74
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,052
Why'd you have to volunteer?

75
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,454
Only six months
from the draft anyhow.

76
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,965
Pinkie and Larry
have already gone.

77
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,467
You could have been exempt
because of your sisters.

78
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,969
My mother's got a job.

79
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,347
Besides, when the country
needs you, you've gotta go.

80
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,259
You should go.

81
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,794
I don't think
anybody should go.

82
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,696
They'll kill you.

83
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,699
Oh, I could get killed
at the bakery, too,

84
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,701
or crossing the street.

85
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,704
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry.

86
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,640
Lots of people get killed
who don't think they'll be.

87
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,541
Lots of people come
back, too. Most of 'em.

88
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,279
Most of them, Joe,
they never come back.

89
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,114
Oh, if anything ever
happened to you,

90
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,523
I'd just die.

91
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,326
Ah, you're only
saying that.

92
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,262
I love you.

93
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,231
I do love you.

Stop it.

00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,938
I won't have this
in my house.

100
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,807
You think you're sitting in
the back seat of a flivver?

101
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,051
Now get up. Both of you,
get up like decent people.

102
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,528
Come on, get up.

103
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,030
But he's going away
in the morning.

104
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,533
I know, I know.
Get in the bedroom.

111
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,118
Oh, anyhow.

112
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,087
Go on in there
with her. She's scared.

113
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,996
Go-- Go on in.

114
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,798
Yes, sir.
Put your arms around her.

115
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,809
You know how to
treat her, don't you? Yes, sir.

Uh--

117
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,212
She isn't a whore.
You know that, don't ya?

00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,714
Yes, sir.

take your shoes off?

Yeah?

00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,665
Could you turn your back?

133
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,167
Why?

134
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,568
I have to get out of bed.

135
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,355
No. I want to see you.

136
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,856
I won't let you see me.

137
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,757
Would you get me my robe?

138
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,592
Sure.

139
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,528
It's on the closet

closer, silly. Uh-uh. Reach for it.

00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,767
<i>Inside of the hole is--</i>
<i>is wet.</i>

642
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>The edges of it are dry.</i>

643
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,114
<i>Wet, dry.</i>

644
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:17,850
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

645
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,693
<i>Now, figure out</i>
<i>where it's dry.</i>

646
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,670
<i>Feel. Yes.</i>

647
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,547
<i>I'm feeling.</i>

648
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:27,285
<i>Dry-- And shouldn't</i>
<i>the hole go up?</i>

649
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,753
<i>[nervously] Up.</i>

650
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,021
<i>No eyes.</i>

651
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>I haven't got any eyes</i>

652
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,924
<i>or mouth or teeth,</i>
<i>tongue, or nose.</i>

653
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:34,934
<i>I haven't gotten anything,</i>

654
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:36,902
<i>but my whole face</i>
<i>is scooped out!</i>

655
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:39,772
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>it's me, and I'm alive!</i>

656
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,182
<i>Oh, no. It can't be!</i>

657
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,585
<i>Not me! I--</i>
<i>I can't live like this!</i>

658
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,087
<i>I-- I can't.</i>

659
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,488
<i>Please, no, I can't--</i>
<i>I can't!</i>

660
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:48,965
<i>Help me. Somebody</i>
<i>please help me.</i>

661
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>Mother, where are ya?</i>

662
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:52,902
<i>Help me, Mother.</i>
<i>I'm having a nightmare</i>

663
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:54,803
<i>and I can't wake up.</i>

664
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,274
<i>If you don't wake me up</i>
<i>I'll be like this for years</i>

665
00:41:58,274 --> 00:41:59,208
<i>and years</i>

666
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,076
<i>and years</i>

667
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:11,620
<i>Pray for me, please.</i>

668
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:14,123
<i>Please, pray for me.</i>

669
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:17,626
To all those
in the armed forces

670
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:21,631
who sacrificed
their young lives

671
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:25,134
in this just and holy war

672
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:28,137
for everlasting peace,

673
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:33,642
I grant absolution
of all their sins.

674
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:35,144
In the name of the Father

675
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,645
and of the Son

676
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,648
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

677
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:41,651
Let us pray.

678
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:51,435
<i>A place like this,</i>
<i>you've gotta think</i>

679
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,939
<i>in order to keep</i>
<i>from thinking.</i>

680
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,440
<i>There are eight planets,</i>

681
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:59,844
<i>Earth, Venus,</i>

682
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,146
<i>Mars, Jupiter,</i>

683
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,451
<i>Mercury--</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

684
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,886
<i>There's something</i>
<i>chewing on my forehead.</i>

685
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,264
<i>It's a rat!</i>

686
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:13,766
<i>It's one of those great</i>
<i>big fat trench rats.</i>

687
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:17,144
<i>Help me, somebody.</i>
<i>Kill it!</i>

688
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:19,589
<i>No, couldn't be a rat.</i>

689
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,490
<i>They wouldn't let</i>
<i>rats run around</i>

690
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,392
<i>chewing up the customers</i>
<i>in a place like this.</i>

691
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:25,428
<i>It's a dream.</i>

692
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,897
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

693
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>It is a rat.</i>

694
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,868
<i>It's crawling.</i>
<i>It's crawling.</i>

695
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,803
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

696
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:36,572
<i>Don't--</i>
<i>Don't let it get me.</i>

697
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,309
<i>No. No, no. No, no, no.</i>

698
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:42,654
<i>He's close.</i>

699
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,622
<i>He's on my chest.</i>

700
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,059
<i>Don't even scare him.</i>

701
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:50,882
<i>Hold still and he will--</i>

702
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:53,484
<i>[screams]</i>

703
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:54,953
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

704
00:43:54,953 --> 00:43:56,354
<i>Did somebody kill it?</i>

705
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,122
<i>Or did it just go away?</i>

706
00:43:58,398 --> 00:44:01,343
<i>What if it comes back?</i>

707
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:02,777
<i>It was a dream.</i>

708
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:05,147
<i>It had to be.</i>

709
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:06,648
<i>But how can you tell</i>

710
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:08,158
<i>what's a dream</i>
<i>and what's real</i>

711
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,094
<i>when you can't even</i>
<i>tell when you're awake</i>

712
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:11,595
<i>and when you're asleep?</i>

713
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,364
<i>Or maybe the rat's real</i>

714
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,833
<i>and the nurse here</i>
<i>is a dream.</i>

715
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,504
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>how can I ever be able</i> <i>to tell the difference?</i>

716
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:23,440
The thing to do is yell.

717
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,409
Sometimes, even now,
I have this old dream

718
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,412
that somebody
wants to kill me.

719
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:29,921
And my mother and father
are running away

720
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,756
with me to Egypt.

721
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,759
I hear the sound of
soldiers riding at night

722
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:35,560
and the screams.

723
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,861
And I yell.

724
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:38,905
And the yell wakes me up.

725
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:41,315
And then I know
that it's a dream.

726
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:43,251
So what you have
to do is yell.

727
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:45,253
But, you see,
I can't yell.

728
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,755
I can't even whisper.

729
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:50,758
Well, whispering
wouldn't help anyhow.

730
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:54,762
Another way is just
to tell yourself

731
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:59,233
"Wait a minute, here.
This is a nightmare.

732
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:01,669
"And I have to wake up
in order to stop it."

733
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:02,670
Then just force
your eyes open,

734
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:04,655
and the dream
will be gone.

735
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:06,990
Oh, I can't open my eyes.
I haven't got any.

736
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,097
Well, that complicates things.

737
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,534
Maybe the thing to do

738
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:20,471
is police your mind
before you go to sleep.

739
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,473
Say to yourself,

740
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:24,908
"I'm going to sleep now.

741
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:28,212
"And I'm not going
to have any nightmares."

742
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,547
Could be done, you know?
With practice.

743
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,694
You feel yourself
getting drowsy--

744
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,562
I never feel drowsy.

745
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:39,398
I haven't got anything
to feel drowsy with.

746
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,969
Nothing?
[footsteps]

747
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,341
Maybe we should

748
00:46:22,341 --> 00:46:23,809
take a different
line of attack,

749
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,243
altogether.

750
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:28,113
Let us begin
by assuming

751
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:29,455
that everything
is a dream,

752
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,800
which by and large,
it is.

753
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,201
When we're awake,
we have one kind of dream.

754
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,644
When we're asleep,
we have another.

755
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:36,646
The difference is

756
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:38,649
that we control
our daydreams.

757
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:40,584
And the dream
that comes at night

758
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:43,086
controls us.

759
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,588
Now think about that.

760
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,100
When you dream that
the rat is there,

761
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,602
do you control the dream?

762
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,071
Or does the dream
control you?

763
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,480
It controls me.

764
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,866
Yes, exactly.

765
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,368
If the rat
were really there,

766
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:00,303
you'd knock it off,
wouldn't you?

767
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:01,704
Of course.

768
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,623
So the fact that
you don't knock it off

769
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:06,166
proves that
it really is a dream.

770
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,469
Yes, yes.

771
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,972
I-- [sighs]

772
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,307
That doesn't work.

773
00:47:13,808 --> 00:47:16,143
Even if the rat was real,
I couldn't knock it off

774
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:17,478
because I haven't
got any arms.

775
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:21,682
No arms.

776
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,685
I haven't got anything.

777
00:47:23,685 --> 00:47:25,586
I'm just like a piece of meat

778
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,555
that keeps on living.

779
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:35,838
Since your real life--
[sighs]

780
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,074
is a greater nightmare
than your dreams,

781
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,976
it would be cruel

782
00:47:40,977 --> 00:47:44,480
to pretend that anyone
could help you.

783
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:48,425
What you need is a miracle.

784
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:49,911
No, not a miracle.

785
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,929
Just tell me
that the rat is real.

786
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,933
And the way I am now
is a dream.

787
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:56,410
Perhaps it would be
better for you

788
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,911
to go away now.

789
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,412
You're a very
unlucky young man,

790
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,922
and sometimes
it rubs off.

791
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:03,425
I'll go, but first
tell me just one thing.

792
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,927
Are you and I
really here together?

793
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:07,962
Or is this
a dream, too?

794
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:09,473
It's a dream.
How do you know?

795
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:12,484
Because I'm a dream.
I don't believe you.

796
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:15,454
Nobody does.
[chuckles]

797
00:48:15,455 --> 00:48:17,865
That's why I'm as unreal

798
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:20,734
as every other dream
that didn't come true.

799
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,407
<i>I don't know whether</i>
<i>I'm alive and dreaming</i>

800
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:29,368
<i>or dead and remembering.</i>

801
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,286
<i>Am I getting old?</i>

802
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,788
<i>Is my hair turning gray?</i>

803
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:35,291
<i>Will anybody ever</i>
<i>come to visit me?</i>

804
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:37,126
<i>I hope not.</i>

805
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:38,560
<i>I really wouldn't</i>
<i>want anybody</i>

806
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:40,896
<i>to see me like this.</i>

807
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:43,774
<i>I do get homesick, though.</i>

808
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,285
<i>Oh, but they wouldn't</i>
<i>have shipped me that</i> <i>long way home.</i>

809
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:48,797
<i>Not with all these</i>
<i>tubes and things in me.</i>

810
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:51,799
<i>No, I'm probably in</i>
<i>some frog hospital,</i>

811
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,802
<i>or maybe limey.</i>

812
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:56,304
<i>At least my teeth</i>
<i>don't ache.</i>

813
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,238
[door opens]

814
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,716
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>What's this?</i>

815
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:01,218
<i>There are two</i>
<i>vibrations,</i>

816
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:02,686
<i>and one of them</i>
<i>is heavy.</i>

817
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:04,187
<i>It's a man.</i>

818
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,098
Why are the shutters
closed?

819
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:08,108
They always have been.

820
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:10,543
At least, as long
as I've been here.

821
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:12,554
It's on the order sheet.

822
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:13,997
Well, it's crazy.

823
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:16,507
<i>Well,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

824
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:18,510
<i>Hello? Have I</i>
<i>got visitors?</i>

825
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,011
<i>What happened then?</i>

826
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,512
As long as I'm
head nurse of this ward,

827
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:24,349
the shutters are open
and they will stay open.

828
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:26,158
Let him have
a little sunshine.

829
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,593
They said it was
to keep people

830
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:28,560
from peeking
in at him.

831
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:31,573
It would take a man
7 feet tall

832
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:33,575
to peek through that window.

833
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:35,076
Oh, and another thing.

834
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:36,578
I want sheets
on this bed.

835
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,290
<i>He's walking.</i>
No more blankets.

836
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,267
He can't really
tell the difference, you know.

837
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:43,168
<i>Now he's stopped.</i>
I can.

838
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:49,442
[sighs] Well.

839
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:53,345
How did the triage officer
ever overlook this one?

840
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,696
<i>He's looking at me.</i>

841
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,569
Poor baby.

842
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:07,451
<i>No, it's a woman.</i>

843
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:08,885
<i>Those hands, a fat woman.</i>

844
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,787
<i>That's why I could feel</i>
<i>her footsteps so plain.</i>

845
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,657
Poor-- Poor baby.

846
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:18,896
Come on.

847
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,448
<i>That was funny.</i>

848
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:31,383
<i>What were they doing?</i>
<i>What has happened?</i>

849
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:32,860
<i>What's different?</i>

850
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:34,803
<i>Think, Joe.</i>

851
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:35,805
<i>Think. Use your head.</i>

852
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,740
<i>Feel.</i>
<i>Feel with your scalp</i>

853
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,208
<i>and the skin</i>
<i>on your forehead.</i>

854
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,642
<i>Something has changed.</i>

855
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:43,588
<i>It was cooler before</i>
<i>she came in than it is now.</i>

856
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:46,023
<i>What I feel is--</i>
<i>is warmth.</i>

857
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:47,758
<i>But where does it come from?</i>

858
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,661
<i>Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

859
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:52,664
<i>Oh, my God. I see it now.</i>

860
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:55,133
It-- It's the sun.

861
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,135
<i>The sun, the sun, the sun.</i>

862
00:50:57,135 --> 00:51:00,346
<i>I found the sun.</i>

863
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:03,183
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

864
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,720
Thank you. Thank you.

865
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,736
If I never have
anything else,

866
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,739
I'll always have God

867
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:20,241
and the morning sunlight.

868
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:29,296
<i>It's night.</i>

869
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:30,642
<i>If a man can</i>
<i>tell the difference</i>

870
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:31,442
<i>between day and night,</i>

871
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:32,877
<i>he's beginning to tell time.</i>

872
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,812
<i>It's warm again.</i>
<i>It's morning,</i>

873
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,714
<i>and she's changing</i>
<i>my sheets.</i>

874
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:38,482
<i>Now it's night.</i>

875
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:40,701
<i>Morning again.</i>
<i>She's bathing me.</i>

876
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:42,169
<i>One morning she changes me,</i>

877
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,013
<i>the next morning,</i>
<i>she bathes me.</i>

878
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,415
<i>Night, night.</i>

879
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,016
<i>Day. Night.</i>

880
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,626
<i>How will I keep track?</i>

881
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:50,502
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Put a big blackboard</i> <i>up in your mind.</i>

882
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:52,121
<i>And right here</i>
<i>in the middle,</i>

883
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:53,699
<i>put a mark for each day.</i>

884
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:56,125
<i>Four, six, seven days.</i>

885
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,868
<i>Now, put a mark up</i>
<i>in this corner for</i> <i>the weeks.</i>

886
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,936
<i>Erase the days.</i>
<i>Start over again.</i>

887
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:01,817
<i>Three, four weeks.</i>
<i>That's right!</i>

888
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:03,218
<i>Erase the weeks</i>
<i>and mark down</i>

889
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:04,153
<i>a month over here.</i>

890
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:07,522
<i>5, 9, 11, 12 months.</i>

891
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:08,464
<i>Now that isn't a year,</i>
<i>not yet.</i>

892
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,032
<i>Four twelves is only 48.</i>

893
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,376
<i>Okay, check off</i>
<i>four more weeks,</i>

894
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,855
<i>very carefully.</i>

895
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,833
<i>And then put Roman</i>
<i>numeral number 1</i>

896
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,303
<i>right down here. One year!</i>

897
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>I'm ringing bells!</i>

898
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,205
<i>Hey, I'm blowing horns</i>

899
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,540
<i>and shooting off</i>
<i>firecrackers.</i>

900
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,009
<i>Everybody's singing</i>

901
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,544
<i>"Should old acquaintance</i>
<i>be forgot."</i>

902
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,547
<i>And I'm saying--</i>

903
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,550
<i>I'm saying,</i>
<i>"Happy New Year, Kareen."</i>

904
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,552
<i>And I'm kissing her.</i>

905
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,726
<i>But it isn't</i>
<i>New Year's Day out there.</i>

906
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,227
<i>Sure, I've counted a year,</i>

907
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,129
<i>but a year from when?</i>

908
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,407
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>how old I am.</i>

909
00:52:48,408 --> 00:52:50,376
<i>All I know is</i>
<i>I'm 20 years old,</i>

910
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:52,778
<i>plus X years since</i>
<i>I got blown up,</i>

911
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:55,181
<i>plus the year I just counted.</i>

912
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,591
<i>But when did</i>
<i>those X years begin?</i>

913
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,027
<i>Think, Joe. Think back.</i>

914
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:03,372
<i>We were next to</i>
<i>an English regiment.</i>

915
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:05,874
<i>And we went out</i>
<i>on night patrol</i> <i>and scattered.</i>

916
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,343
<i>And then I hooked up</i>

917
00:53:07,343 --> 00:53:08,844
<i>with that little</i>
<i>limey corporal</i>

918
00:53:08,845 --> 00:53:09,779
<i>and his outfit, and--</i>

919
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:12,548
<i>Yes, I remember now.</i>

920
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,825
<i>I was writing a letter</i>
<i>to you, Kareen.</i>

921
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,294
Corporal Timlon?

922
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:17,795
Yes, sir?

923
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,809
What is that damnable odor?

924
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,811
Out there, sir.

925
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:27,813
This fat Hun came
stumbling through the fog.

926
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:31,317
Some bloke lost his head
and popped him off. [sniffs]

927
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,818
The stink ain't half so bad

928
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:33,986
when they're close
to the ground, sir,

929
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:36,021
but he's got himself
hung up on the wire.

930
00:53:36,022 --> 00:53:37,999
Bad for morale.
Extremely bad.

931
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:41,002
He's a Bavarian, sir.
They always smell worse.

932
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,004
Yes, they do,
don't they?

933
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,483
Not so bad as Hindu is,
though. Or Welshmen.

934
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,485
While it's nice and quiet,
sir, we keep on trying

935
00:53:48,485 --> 00:53:50,487
to shoot him down,
but he hangs on pretty good.

936
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:52,989
Well, take a detail
out tonight, Corporal.

937
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,491
And bury him.

938
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:56,993
Well, but it's kind of
busy out there, sir. Even at night.

939
00:53:57,494 --> 00:53:59,496
And don't forget,
Corporal.

940
00:53:59,496 --> 00:54:01,998
Death has a dignity
all its own.

941
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:06,010
And you will say
a few words of prayer over the remains.

942
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,012
Yes.
[explosion]

943
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:12,017
Oh, Jesus!

944
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,371
Just for that,
I'll take volunteers.

945
00:54:14,372 --> 00:54:16,374
You. You. You.

946
00:54:16,374 --> 00:54:18,809
You two.
You in the back there.

947
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,212
And to almighty God,

948
00:54:21,212 --> 00:54:24,949
we commend the soul of
our brother departed,

949
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:27,685
and we commit his body
to the ground.

950
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:37,806
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

951
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,109
dust to dust.

952
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:41,777
Who's got the dust?

into my arms and stayed there.

she was
always healthy,

1401
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:27,738
gave plenty of milk.

Mmhh.

Willow Lake.

1427

How you and Bill Harper

Yes, of course. Would you

Thank you.

1507
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:13,698
Probably an early entry.

1508
01:30:17,136 --> 01:30:18,570
"If bodily action

1510
01:30:20,906 --> 01:30:23,884
These movements
are persistently repetitive.

"They must be treated

Fair enough.

I don't believe that
the movement is reflexive.

Oh, you don't?

1517
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,055

staff inspection.

1519
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,392
If you don't trust me,
nurse,

1520
01:30:49,393 --> 01:30:51,395
perhaps you'd better
take it up with him.

1521
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:56,408
I will.

1522

Well, that's excellent,
nurse.

1523
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:01,930
General Tillery is
the chief operating surgeon

1594

<i>will pay to see me.</i>

1595
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:11,617
<i>Lots of people.</i>
<i>Put me in a fancy coffin</i>

<i>and having fun.</i>

1598
01:35:15,888 --> 01:35:17,890
<i>Take me to the beaches</i>

<i>celebrations</i>

1600
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:20,893
<i>and all the church bazaars.</i>

1601
01:35:20,893 --> 01:35:22,828
<i>They've seen</i>
<i>the pin-headed girl</i> <i>from Timbuktu</i>

1602
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:23,829
<i>or the dog-faced man</i>

1603
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:25,330
<i>who crawls on his belly</i>
<i>like a reptile.</i>

1604
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:27,308
<i>But they're not real freaks.</i>
<i>They were born that way.</i>

1605
01:35:27,308 --> 01:35:29,310
<i>They were made</i>
<i>that way by God.</i>

1606
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:31,312
<i>But this thing here</i>
<i>in his fancy coffin</i>

01:35:31,312 --> 01:35:33,247

<i>by you and me</i>
<i>and the lady next door--</i>

1609
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,684
<i>and that takes</i>
<i>a lot of planning</i>

1610
01:35:36,684 --> 01:35:38,085
<i>and costs a lot of money.</i>

1611

Well, what could we
have expected?

1631
01:36:36,882 --> 01:36:39,317
Tell him, uh...

1632
01:36:39,317 --> 01:36:41,252
Tell him we'll do
everything we can,

1633
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:44,022
but, uh, his condition
won't permit him to be moved.

1634
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:45,723
For the present, that is.

1635
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,927
Be sure to say
"for the present."

1636

kill me.

1642
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:32,711
He's upset.
Understandably so.

1643
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:34,713
Ask him what his name is.

1644
01:37:54,233 --> 01:37:57,455
These shutters are to be closed
at all times.

1645
01:37:57,456 --> 01:37:59,458
What's he saying?

1646
01:37:59,892 --> 01:38:02,361
He says, "Kill me."

1647
01:38:02,361 --> 01:38:04,696
Over and over again.
"Kill me."

1648
01:38:08,434 --> 01:38:11,746
[General]
Tell him we'll do everything we can to make him comfortable.

1649
01:38:11,746 --> 01:38:13,214
For now, he needs rest.

1650
01:38:13,214 --> 01:38:16,091
Tell him we'll give him
a sedative and come back later.

1651
01:38:16,092 --> 01:38:18,035
And try to get his name.

1652
01:38:20,004 --> 01:38:22,873
You're not to mention
what has happened here to anyone.

1653
01:38:22,873 --> 01:38:25,775
I'll hold you collectively
responsible for any breach.

1654
01:38:25,776 --> 01:38:28,712
If new orders are received
in view of the new situation which has developed,

1655
01:38:28,712 --> 01:38:30,714
you'll be notified.

1656
01:38:31,215 --> 01:38:32,223
Well?

1657
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,961
He won't wait
for an answer.

1658
01:38:36,962 --> 01:38:39,898
All he says is

1659
01:38:39,898 --> 01:38:44,177
"Kill me, kill me, kill me."

1660
01:38:46,555 --> 01:38:49,491
Don't you have some message
for him, Padre?

1661
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:52,827
You could at least tell him

1662
01:38:52,828 --> 01:38:54,462
to put his faith in God,
couldn't you?

1663
01:38:55,831 --> 01:38:58,308
I'll pray for him
for the rest of my days,

1664
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:01,110
but I will not risk
testing his faith

1665
01:39:01,111 --> 01:39:02,912
against your stupidity.

1666

Well, you're a hell

He's the product

not mine.

1669

[door opens]
Clear the room.

And I detest all my sins,

1682
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:16,285
not because of Thy judgment,
O Lord,

1683
01:40:16,286 --> 01:40:18,988
but because
thou art all good

and deserving
of all my love.

with the help of thy grace,

1687
01:40:34,337 --> 01:40:37,606
