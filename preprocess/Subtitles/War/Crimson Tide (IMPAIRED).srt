aircraft carrier Foch...

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,000
somewhere in the Mediterranean.

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,520
Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya...

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,280
spread to the neighboring Caucasus
republics, the Russian president...

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,600
ordered massive bombing strikes
against rebel positions...

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
around Rutul and Belokany.

Appalled at the loss of human life,
the President of the United States...

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,000
joined by the French president
and the British prime minister...

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
suspended all foreign aid
to Russia.

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,840
Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko...

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
denounced the U.S. Pressure
as an act of war...

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.

15

Denouncing his own president
as a U.S. Puppet...

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,120
he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,480
He said, "This brutish and hypocritical
American intervention...

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
will not go unanswered."

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,520
On Tuesday, at 10:00
in the morning Moscow time...

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,080
the Russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.

With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic...

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,440
was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces...

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,280
seized the region around Vladivostok,
including a naval base...

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,480
and a nuclear missile base
housing Russian ICBMs.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,080
As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko...

are in a state of high alert.

have been deployed near the Caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis...

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
and a crisis which started
in the Caucasus

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,080
has now spread to the Far East...

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,280

standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.

I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.

their own best interests.

But this Radchenko's playing a whole new
ball game with a whole new set of rules.

120
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,080
Now I've heard people talk...

121
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,880
but I don't think this man's talking
to get his picture in the paper.

122
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,960
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
Always a dangerous combination.
And I think he's capable...

124
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,960
of doing every damn thing
he says he's going to do.

125
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,320
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,720
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.

We've been informed by the NSA...

128
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,240
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,560
That's four armored divisions
numbering 60,000 men.

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
There seems to be
massive defections.

and minds of the Russian soldiers.

- Admiral.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,920
They've seized the region by the Chinese
and North Korean borders.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,240
That includes a submarine base...

135
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,640
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.

136
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,040
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem...

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,960
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs...

138

armed with up to
ten warheads apiece.

139
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Now the Russian government has
assured us that talks are underway.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
But if Radchenko
were to crack them...

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
they could launch against
our west coast direct...

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,920
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.

- Thank you.

155
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,880
You bet. Hey, Bobby.
This is Bobby Dougherty. He's Supplies.

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,120
- Pleasure, Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,000
- Mr. Linkletter.
- Commander.
- And you know Darik.

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.
- How's Julia?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,280
- She's excellent.
- Good.

160
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,880
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.

- Thank you.
- We served together on the Baton Rouge.

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,320
- Twice.
- That's right. We're lucky to have him.

163
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
- I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.
- He's crazy about that dog.

164
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,840
Takes him everywhere. The Navy looks
the other way 'cause he's Ramsey.

165
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Navy looks the other way
'cause he's one of the few skippers
left who've seen combat.

166
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,840
- He took SEALS into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.

167
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
- Took out eight or nine X.O. S in '94?
- Ouch.

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,720
- Last one caught what? Appendicitis?

- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.

173

- The German guy with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?

174
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,880
- Who was it?

Question is invalid.
We're even.

- Whoo.
- How you doin'?

- Good. Address me as "sir"

Stand at attention, sailor!

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,240
Is he gonna fit in the sub?

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Doubtful.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,720
Who played the German sub commander
in The Enemy Below with Robert Mitchum?

186
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,680
- Was it Curt Jurgens or Hardy Kruger?

I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.

I don't know what to say.

there's trouble

So they called us.

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,200
We're going over there
and bringing...

212
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
the most lethal killing machine
ever devised.

213
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
We're capable...

214
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
of launching
more firepower...

215
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,560
than has ever been released
in the history of war.

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,920
For one purpose alone:

217
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,480
To keep our country safe.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,520
We constitute the front line...

219

your very best.

[Men Laughing]

225

This might be our

226
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,120
but this is my boat.

you keep up with me.

that strange sensation you'll be feeling
in the seat of your pants...

- Mr. Cob?
- Yes, sir!

You're aware of the name of this ship,
aren't you, Mr. Cob?

Very aware, sir!

It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr. Cob?

Very proud, sir!

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,680
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!

- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- [Cob] Outstanding, sir!

In the greatest country
in the entire world.

- Alabama, sir!

The last breath of polluted air

to talk it away.

Allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.

If you want
your own boat someday...

the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.

I can't stand save-asses,

- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.

- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.

- [Zimmer] I don't understand.
- [Dougherty] You don't understand?

286
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,320
- Somebody should just shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.

- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.

- That's what made him great.

[Linkletter]
You think this guy is Patton?

291
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,520
He's a dangerous lunatic, threatening
nuclear war, and he means it.

292
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
What's that make us, since we're the
only nation to ever drop a nuclear bomb?

293
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
It makes us a prime target.
There's a half a dozen...

294

other Third World countries with
atom bombs who'd love to drop one on us.

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
[Dougherty] That's right.
That's why we should drop one on them.

Are you a communist? You have a problem
with us dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?

on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
a simple, "Yes, by all means, sir.
Drop that fucker. Twice."

307
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,000
- [Men Laughing]
- I don't mean to suggest...

308
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,960
that you're indecisive,
Mr. Hunter.

309
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Not at all.

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,560
Just, um... complicated.

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,440
[Chuckles]

312
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,240
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.

313
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,040
Me, they wanted simple.

314
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,960
- Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
- [Laughs]

315
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Be careful there, Mr. Hunter.

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
It's all I got to rely on:
Bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.

317
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,840
Rickhover gave me
my command...

318
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,920
a checklist, a target
and a button to push.

319
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,840
All I had to know
is how to push it.

320
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,880
They'd tell me when.
They seem to want you to know why.

321
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
I would hope they'd want
us all to know why, sir.

322
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
At the Naval War College...

323
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,200
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.

Von Clausewitz.

327
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,080
I think, sir, that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...

328
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,360
- Complicated?
- [Men Laughing]

329
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,200
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end...

330
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,400
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.

331
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
[Laughing]
I'm very impressed.

332
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,120
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war...

333
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,040
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians...

334
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,080
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.

335
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,240
You'd agree with that.

336
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
I'd agree that, uh, that's what
Clausewitz was trying to say.

337
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,960
But you wouldn't agree with it?

338
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,080
No, sir, I do not. No, I just think
that in the nuclear world...

339
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,960
the true enemy
can't be destroyed.

340
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,160
[Chuckling, Tapping Glass]
Attention on deck.

341
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.

[Men Laughing]

344
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,080
In my humble opinion,
in the nuclear world...

345
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,520
the true enemy
is war itself.

How ya doin'?
Oh, boy. Yeah.

429
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,520
So, Mr. Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?

430
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,480
Not necessarily, sir.

431
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,200
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.

432
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,040
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.

433
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.

434
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
Why not?

435
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
The fire in the galley
could have flared back up.

436
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,280
- I would have seen to it first, sir.
- I'm sure you would have.

437
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,600
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.

438
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.

439
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,120
It should be taken advantage of.

440
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,160
Lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.

441
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,800
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.

442
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,360
What'd you think, son? I was just
some crazy old coot putting everyone...

443
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,280
in harm's way
as I yell "yee-haw"?

444
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,520
That was not
my first thought, sir.

445
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,400
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley...

446
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,160
I did not agree
with your call, sir.

447
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,560
Take a seat.

448
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,840
[Sighs]

449
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,160
Just so we understand
each other...

450
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,320
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.

451
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,120
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.

452
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,320
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.

453
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,440
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.

454
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,640
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.

455
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Those sailors out there
are just boys...

456
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,680
boys who are training to do
a terrible and unthinkable thing,
and if that ever occurs...

457
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,720
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing...

458
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,600
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.

459
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,760
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.

460
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
It means we don't
undermine each other.

461
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,480
It means in a missile drill...

462
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,080
they hear your voice right after mine,
without hesitation.

463
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,720
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.

464
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,000
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.

465
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,760
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.

466
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,200
- Go see to it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

467
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,120
Oh, Hunter.

468
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,040
Short of the outbreak
of World War III...

469
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,240
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus...

470
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,560
I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.

471
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
I'll see to it, sir.

472
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,440
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.

473
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,480
Not the fire.

474
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,400
Dismissed.

475
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,960
[Sighs]

476
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,280
One, two, three, four.

477
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,680
Back. Back.

478
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,720
One, two. One, two.

479
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

480
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?

481
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,960
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died too.

482
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?

483
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,080
Not 'cause of what
the captain did.

484
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Weps...

485
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,360
a fire is a serious threat
to the ship.

486
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
- Now where was he? Why didn't
he check it out first, huh?
- That's his style.

487
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,640
- He's a hard-ass.
- So what?

488
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,560
So you wanna fight him,
go ahead.

489
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,280
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.

490
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,040
Two schools of thought here.
To him, you're Annapolis...

491
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,400
Harvard, expert on theory,
well-versed in world affairs.

492
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
Ha!

493
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.

494
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,320
He's probably
a little paranoid about that.

495
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,560
I mean, Navy's all he's got.

496
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
Navy and that little rat-dog of his.

497
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,960
That's why his wife left him.

498
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
So what are you saying?

499
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.

500
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,680
Let him get to know you.

501
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,080
You do pants too?

502
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Conn/Radio:
Receiving emergency action message.

503
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,040
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one!

504
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,960
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!

505
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,000
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming EAM.

506
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,720
[Zimmer] Captain.

507
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
Captain has asked me to brief you...

508
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,320
on the emergency action message
we just received.

509
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,880
As you know,
before we got underway...

510
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
the Russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps...

511
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,400
and Radchenko started making extravagant
threats should anyone move in on him...

512
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,960
that he would launch
his land-based nuclear weapons
at the United States and at Japan.

513
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,160
The only safeguard was that the Russian
government controlled the launch codes.

514
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,400
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.

515
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,320
U.S. Military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.

516
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,640
The last time we hit
this state of emergency...

517
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,160
was 32-and-a-half years ago
during the Cuban missile crisis.

518
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,520
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we train for.

519
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Captain.

520
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
The NCA has determined that...

521
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,720
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled...

522
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,920
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour...

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,240
we'll be compelled to act.

524
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,120
Now given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts...

525
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,480
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon...

526
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,000
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.

527
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,960
It's important
to remain focused.

528
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,400
Keep your men informed.

529
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,880
Any questions?

530
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Dismissed.

531
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,880
- We lost that frying unit, and then...
- [Glass Shattering]

532
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,840
- We can't get the same capacity in...
- [Men Shouting]

533
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,760
- [Glass Shattering]
- Hey, man!

534
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Get out! Get...

535
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,200
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!

536
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,840
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?

537
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,280
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.

538
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,560
- It's just a difference of
opinion that got out of hand.
- What about?

539
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,160
It's really too silly to talk about,
sir. I'd rather just forget about...

540
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,880
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
Why were you two fighting?

541
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,040
I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer...

542
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,960
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer
was shit.

543
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
And Bennefield's
a big Moebius fan, and...

544
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,840
It just got out of hand.
I pushed him; he pushed me.

545
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,640
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.

546
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,040
You can get a commission like that.

547
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,520
I know it, sir.
You're 100% right.

548
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,080
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not happen again.

549
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,400
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'm gonna write you up. You understand?

550
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,320
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,760
You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.

552
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,800
Everybody that reads comic books
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.

553
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
- Now am I right or wrong?
- [Chuckling] You're right, sir.

554
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,640
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,400
- Captain.
- How can I help you?

556
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,440
Test results
from the missile drill.

557
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,160
This the best
they can do?

558
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,480
No, sir, but that's
what they did.

559
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,840
I want this down to five minutes.
Train on it.

560
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,680
Yes, sir.

561
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,160
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.

562
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,080
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.

563
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,480
Damn.

564
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,120
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.

565
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,480
Or a pat on the back, sir.

566
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,760
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal, but...

567
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,560
I think the men are a little on edge
with all we're going through.

568
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,560
- Morale seems to be a bit low.
- [Chuckling]

569
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

570
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,560
Thank you, sir.

571
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,600
May I have your
attention, please?

572
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,360
Summer's here and
the time is right

573
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,000
- Mr. Hunter has informed me...
- For dancin' in the street

574
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,000
that morale may be a bit low...

575
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,960
that you may be a bit...

576
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,960
- On edge.
- On edge.

577
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,400
So I suggest this:

578
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,840
Any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation...

579
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,560
can leave the ship right now.

580
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,160
Gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three.

581
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,520
War is imminent.

582
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
This is the captain.

583
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
That is all.

584
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,280
Very inspiring, sir.

585
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
Come on, Bear.
Come on. Come on.

586
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,960
[Beep]

587
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,800
Sup?
Come here.

588
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,200
You hear that?

589
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
[Beeping]

590
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,680
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.

591
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,880
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.

592
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,320
Conn/Sonar: We have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.

593
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,480
Designate contact: Master 28.

594
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,560

Man battle stations torpedo.

595
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,520
- Rig for ultraquiet.
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.

596
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,480
Make tubes one and four fully ready.
Aye, sir.

597
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,400
[Alarm Ringing]

598
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,320
[P.A.]
Man battle stations torpedo.

599
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,920
[Alarm Continues]

600
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,080
- All right, what do you got?
- Sir, we have
a possible submerged submarine...

601
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,840
bearing 049,
designate master 28.

602
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,080
- [Beeping]
- Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 831 feet to avoid that sub.

603
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,120
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.

604
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,240
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.

605
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,000
Make your depth
831 feet, smartly.

606
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,440
- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.

607
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,600
- Who are you, sweetheart?

May I suggest that we float
the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.

That should give us enough reach

00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,880
- in six minutes.
- [Ramsey] Very well.

758
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,120
Main seawater pump
is out of commission.

759
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,880
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?

760
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,360
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?

761
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,800
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.

762
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,440
- That's it?
- Ah, uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.

763
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,920
We lost it when the radio buoy cable
got severed.

764
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,320
All right.

765
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,760
All right, gentlemen,
let's get on with it.

766
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,320
All ahead one-third.

767
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,040
- [Bell Ringing]
- Steady as you go.

768
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,920
All ahead one-third.
Steady. Aye, sir.

769
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,440
Make your depth 150 feet.
Zero bubble.

770
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Up slow and silent
to launch depth.

771
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,080
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye, aye, Captain.

772
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,560
Captain?
Got the EAM.

773
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,320
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.

774
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,600
Yes, sir. It, uh, got cut off
during the attack.

775
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,680
Then it's meaningless.

776
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,160
Sir, this is an EAM
pertaining to nuclear missiles.

777
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,360
No, Mr. Hunter,
that's a message fragment.

778
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,680
Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.

779
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,800
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.

780
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,840
- It could be a message...
- Could be a fake Russian transmission.

781
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,920
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm it, sir.

782
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,640
- All I'm asking for is the time
we need to get back on line.
- Calm down, Mr. Hunter.

783
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,040
- I am calm.
- You don't appear to be calm.

784
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,400
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.

785
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,320
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.

786
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,440
[Faint Radio Transmission]

787
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,600
We have orders in hand, and those orders
are to make a preemptive launch.

788
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,840
Every second that we lose
increases the chances...

789
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,400
that by the time our missiles arrive,
their silos could be empty...

790
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,440
'cause they've flown their birds
and struck us first.

791
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,680
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do...

792
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,400
that any launch order received without
authentication is no order at all.

793
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,320
- Captain... National Mili...
- That's our #1 rule.

794
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,280
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.

795
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,920
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow
without exception.

796
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,880
Captain, National Military Command
Center knows what sector we're in.

797
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,760
They have satellites looking down on us
to see if our birds are aloft.

798
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,640
And if they're not, then they give
our orders to somebody else.

799
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."

800
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,720
- I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter.
- All I'm saying...

801
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,280
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.

802
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,560
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.

803
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,240
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.

804
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,000
But as captain,
I must assume...

805
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,720
that our submarines could have been
taken out by other Akulas.

806
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,240
We can play these games
all night, Mr. Hunter...

807
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,920
- but I don't have the luxury
of your presumptions.
- Sir...

808
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,440
Mr. Hunter, we have rules that are not
open to interpretation...

809
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,400
personal intuition, gut feelings,
hairs on the back of your neck...

810
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,600
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.

811
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,400
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware...

812
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,480
of what our orders are
and what those orders mean.

813
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,520
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.
They contain no ambiguity.

814
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,080
- Captain, sir...
- Mr. Hunter, I've made the decision.

815
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!

816
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,200
Damn.

817
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,400
Weapons/Conn:

818
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,880
Shift targeting
to target package SLBM 64741/2.

819
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,800
This is the captain.

820
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,800
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.

821
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,000
Sir, we don't know what this means.
Our target package could have changed.

822
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,520
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!

823
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,560
- Hell no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.

824
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,880
Cob, remove Mr. Hunter
from the control room.

825
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,840
- Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here now!
- No, sir, I do not concur...

826
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,640
and I do not recognize your authority
to relieve me on the command
under Navy regulations.

827
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,960
- Cob, arrest this man and get him out!
- Captain Ramsey...

828
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,480
under operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons...

829
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,000
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree!

830
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,440
- Cob, what are you waiting for?
- Now this is more than formality, sir.

831
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,120
This is why your command must
be repeated! It requires my assent!

832
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,840
I do not give it, and, furthermore,
you continue upon this course...

833
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,080
- and insist upon this launch without
confirming this message first...
- Son of a bitch.

834
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,800
- I will be forced,
backed by the rules of precedents...
- Chief of the boat...

835
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,720
- as captain and commanding
officer of the USS Alabama...
- authority and command...

836
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,600
- regulation 08150H6...
- I order you to place
the X.O. Under arrest...

837
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
- on the charge of mutiny!
- Of the Navy regulations...

838
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,120
- to relieve you...
- I say again, I order you...

839
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,040
- of command, Captain!
- To place the X.O. Under arrest...

840
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,280
on the charge of mutiny!

841
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,480
- Cob!
- Captain, please, the X.O. Is right.

842
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,600
We can't launch
unless he concurs.

843
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,840
"To the USS Alabama.

844
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Rebel-controlled missiles
being fueled.

845
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,640
Launch codes compromised.
Dissidents threaten launch
at continental United States.

846
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,360
Set DEFCON two.
Immediately launch ten
Trident missile sorties."

847
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,680
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!

848
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,920
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.

849
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,360
I don't have
to think this over!

850
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,160
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.

851
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,280
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.

852
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,720
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.

853
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,640
Chief of the boat, Captain Ramsey's
under arrest. Lock him in his stateroom.

854
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,240
- Captain, please...
- Now, Cob!

855
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,800
Aye, sir.
Mitchell! Walker!

856
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,240
Take the captain below.

857
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,120
You're way out
of your league, Hunter.

858
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,560
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.

859
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,760
What the hell
we waitin' for?

860
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,640
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done...

861
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,240
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.

862
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,240
Anybody?

863
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,800
All right.

864
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,800
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.

865
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,200
This is the Executive Officer.

866
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,640
I have assumed
command of this ship...

867
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,080
under authority granted me
by Navy regulations.

868
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,840
I have relieved Captain Ramsey of his
duties for acting in contravention...

869
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,480
of the rules and regulations
regarding nuclear weapons release.

870
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,280
It is my intention
to delay the missile launch...

871
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,120
maintaining our current state
of readiness...

872
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,600
pending confirmation
of an emergency action message...

873
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,640
- that was cut off during the attack.
- [Sighs]

874
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,360
Remain at battle stations missile.

875
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,280
Carry on.

876
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,200
[Locks Door]

877
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,120
What the hell
are we doin', Fred?

878
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,680
I don't know about you,
but I'm pissin' my pants.

879
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,240
[Bear Softly Growls]

880
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,040
Come on, boy.

881
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,880
Conn/Weapons: Russians will have
missile launch capability...

882
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,640
in 39 minutes.

883
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,480
[Hunter] Chief of the boat.

884
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,880
Sir?

885
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,800
Thank you, Cob.

886
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,560
"Thank you"?
Fuck you.

887
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,000
Get it straight, Mr. Hunter.
I'm not on your side.

888
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,040
Now you could be wrong.

889
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,920
But wrong or right, the captain can't
just replace you at will.

890
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,680
That was completely improper. And that's
why I did what I did, by the book.

891
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,600
I thank you anyway.

892
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,920
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, get
those communications back on line now.

893
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,440
We're working on it, sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.

894
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,120
- Are you ready?
- Uh... ready. Go.

895
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,360
Jesus.
This fuckin' thing...

896
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,240
You know, this whole system is crashed;
radio buoy is severed.

897
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,080
- What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?

898
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,480
Hey, Vossler, we need communications,
not smart-ass remarks.

899
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,280
- Aye, sir.
- All stop, ten degrees up.

900
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,400
- Ten up. Aye, sir.
- All stop. Aye, sir. Enters all stop.

1051
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,800
That's the whole fucking point is
we don't have time!

1052
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,000
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Now why do you think he's doing that?

1053
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,240
Why? You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck!

1054
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,440
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.

1055
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,120
Come on, man.

1056
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,760
Peter, think about your family, man.

1057
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,680
I am. I am!

1058
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,160
I mean, what do you...
What do you plan to do?

1059
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:16,120
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.
The TSO's with Hunter.

1060
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,280
And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.

1061
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,840
Now we want to recruit a few more men,
and then we're gonna open that arsenal.

1062
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,760
[Dougherty] I just talked
to the captain in his room.

1063
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,080
He specifically asked for you.

1064
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,640
He says we cannot go
without you.

1065
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,600
I don't believe this.
[Sighs]

1066
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,760
This is a mutiny, Peter.

1067
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,720
There's only two sides
to a mutiny.

1068
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,240
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.

1069
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,840
What are you gonna do?

1070
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,280
What are you gonna do?

1071
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,440
All right.

1072
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,800
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles
will have launch capability...

1073
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,800
in 24 minutes.

1074
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,240
You're doing the right thing.

1075
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,440
[Booming, Electricity Buzzing]

1076
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,520
[Mahoney]
Electrical power has been restored.

1077
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,720
- [Growling]
- All stations, prepare to
reinitiate the system.

1078
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,800
[Continues Growling]

1079
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,600
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, what's the
status on that radio repair?

1080
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,920
Conn/Radio: All systems are still
down, sir. Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.

1081
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,640
- Where is he?
- [Vossler] I don't know, sir.

1082
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,120
Very well.

1083
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,040
- Mr. Mahoney has the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

1084
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,960
- Cob.
- Sir?

1085
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,320
- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.

1086
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,520
- Get a side arm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1087
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,600
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.

1088
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,880
Turn around!
Move it!

1089
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,480
- [Growling]
- At ease, sailor.

1090
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,920
[Bear Growling]

1091
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,440
- [Bear Barks]
- Sir.

1092
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,400
- Thank you, Mr. Ince.
- [Growling]

1093
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,320
- Mr. Westergaurd.
- Sir.

1094
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,240
- Mr. Zimmer.
- [Zimmer] Ready, sir.

1095
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,640
Let's get on with it.

1096
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,680
- [Barking]
- [Weps] Stand guard.

1097
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,160
All you people,
return to your stations!

1098
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,120
- Mr. Rivetti.
- Sir?

1099
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,520
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.

1100
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,360
[Man Cocks Pistol]

1101
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,080
Is there a problem, sir?

1102
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,320
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.

1103
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,440
Conn/Weapons:
Russian missiles...

1104
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,560
will have launch capability
in 21 minutes.

1105
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,680
Who's in charge here?

1106
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,600
Shit!

1107
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,160
Me, sir. Oh, fuck.

1108
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,640
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.

1109
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,880
- Do you know what's going on here?
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,720
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.

1111
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,800
If we launch and we're wrong...

1112
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,000
what's left of Russia
is gonna launch at us.

1113
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,120
There will be a nuclear holocaust
beyond imagination.

1114
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,320
So it's all about knowing,
Mr. Vossler.

1115
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,880
We have to know whether or not our order
to launch has been recalled or not.

1116
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,240
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?

1117
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,200
Yes, sir.

1118
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,000
You ever watch Star Trek?

1119
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,960
- Yeah, I seen Star Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.
The USS Enterprise. All right.

1120
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,920
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise?

1121
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,720
And Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty,
"Scotty, I gotta have more power."

1122
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,040
- He needs more, more warp speed. Yeah.
- Warp speed. Exactly.

1123
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,520
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.

1124
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,280
If you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.

1125
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,280
It's up to you. I know that's a shitty
deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?

1126
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,200
Scotty?

1127
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,600
Aye, Captain.

1128
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,080
You got anything?

1129
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,480
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.

1130
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,280
- I have the conn.
- [Mahoney] X.O. Has the conn.

1131
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,680
Chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.

1132
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,640
Continue up
to periscope depth.

1133
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,160
- Belay that order!
- [Pistols Cocking]

1134
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:26,920
Any officers or chiefs feel you've been
unjustly caught up in this thing...

1135
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,080
you stand with me now.

1136
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,840
[Sighs]

1137
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,240
Sir, propulsion
has been restored.

1138
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,040
All flooding
has been contained.

1139
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,800
All communications
are still down.

1140
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,400
Take him away.

1141
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,360
Lock him up
in the officers' mess.

1142
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,320
Of all the people.

1143
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,200
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr. Zimmer, you stay with me.

1144
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,120
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The rest of you,
return to your stations.

1145
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,560
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.

1146
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,000
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

1147
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,880
Diving officer,
make your depth 150 feet.

1148
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,880
- At 150 feet. Aye, sir.
- 1MC.

1149
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,800
[Radioman] Aye, sir.

1150
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,040
May I have
your attention, please.

1151
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,920
Crew of the USS Alabama...

1152
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,280
attempted mutiny has been put down.

1153
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,480
We'll maintain security alert.

1154
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,840
Authorized movement
only in two-man teams.

1155
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,240
In the absence
of further radio communication...

1156
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,640
on orders from
the National Command Center...

1157
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,680
we'll achieve launch depth
as quickly as we can...

1158
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,760
for strategic missile launch.

1159
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,920
We all know what this means.

1160
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,560
It's not something
one would wish for...

1161
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,280
but we have the obligation
under authenticated orders...

1162
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:09,360
issued by our Commander-ln-Chief
to prevent the attack on our country.

1163
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,720
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 15 minutes.

1164
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,680
Set condition 1Sq.

1165
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,200
Spin up missiles 1 - 5...

1166
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,520
and 20 - 24
for strategic missile launch.

1167
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,880
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1168
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,200
This is the captain.
Mr. Zimmer is the new X.O.

1169
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,720
Set condition 1Sq.

1170
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,640
Spin up missiles
1 - 5 and 20 - 24...

1171
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,320
for strategic launch.

1172
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,320
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1173
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,280
This is the X.O.

1174
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,040
Weapons/Conn:

1175
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:54,200
Confirm target package
SLBM 64741/2...

1176
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,040
for missiles 1 - 5
and 20 - 24.

1177
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,920
- Target package confirmation, sir.
- This is the captain.

1178
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,120
Conn/Weapons:

1179
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,720
Confirm target package
SLBM 64741/2...

1180
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,800
for missiles 1 - 5
and 20 - 24.

1181
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,720
Aye, sir.

1182
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,200
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.

1183
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,680
It's not about the book.

1184
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,720
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we do nothing, who's gonna stop 'em?

1185
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,000
Half of me is glad the captain
came back. He could be right, you know.

1186
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,080
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.

1187
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,200
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.

1188
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,200
That's why we have
to find out first.

1189
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,800
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over? Hmm?

1190
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,280
We launch. They see us.

1191
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,920
They launch.

1192
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,200
Our birds pass each other
in the air. Boom!

1193
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,880
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.

1194
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,280
Nuclear holocaust.

1195
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,840
- What are you doing down here?
- Jesus, I was just going to the bath...

1196
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,840
Rivetti, nobody moves alone!
Come on. You know the drill.

1197
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,560
- What, Bennefield, I need
an escort to take a shit?
- Shut up!

1198
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:31,120
Now I'm gonna call Control.
You stay right there.

1199
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,120
- Fuck that.

1350
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,880
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.

01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,440
Yes, sir.

"Yes, sir" you're aware
they're all white...

1353

or "Yes, sir" you've seen them?

1354
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,280
Yes, sir, I've seen them.

1355
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:57,320
Yes, sir, I'm aware
that they're all white.

1356
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,800
They're not from Portugal;
they're from Spain...

1357
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,160
and at birth, they're not white;
they're black.

1358
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,520
Sir.

1359
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,760
I didn't know that.

1360
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,360
But they are from Portugal.

Some of the things they do,
uh, defy belief.

1365
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:33,120
Their training program
is simplicity itself.

1366
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,680
You just stick
a cattle prod up their ass...

1367
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,080
and you can get a horse
to deal cards.

then we're at war.

God help us all.

Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message...

01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,400
from the National Command

[Westergaurd] "Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

1392
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,080
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.

1393

I concur, sir.

Set condition 2Sq.

Terminate launch,

Mr. Hunter has the conn.

1404
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,280
In the early hours of this morning,
Russian army forces moved in...

1405
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,480
and met surprisingly
little resistance.

1406
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,000
- [Yelling, Gunfire]
- There were some sporadic battles...

1407
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,320
- [Yelling, Gunfire]
- There were some sporadic battles...

1408
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,240
but, apparently, the specter
of fighting their countrymen...

1409
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,840
proved too much for these rebel troops,
and they surrendered quickly.

1410
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:04,280
So a crisis that seemed to be escalating
beyond the point of no return...

1411
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,760
was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.

1412
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,080
And the nuclear base captured by
Radchenko is back in government hands.

1413
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:16,080
Reporting live from the French aircraft
carrier Foch in the Mediterranean Sea...

1414

this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.

1415
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,560
All right, stand there, uh, Lieutenant
Commander Hunter. This won't take long.

1416
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,880
This panel has convened in order
to investigate the events...

1417
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,200
subsequent to the setting
of condition 1Sq...

1418
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,600
for strategic missile launch...

1419
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,720
on board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.

1420
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,200
Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the Alabama...

1421
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,920
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey...

1422
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,480
I am prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.

1423
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:01,040
- Without my testimony, sir?
- You have a problem with that?

1424
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:06,160
- I might, sir.
- I have known Captain Ramsey
for almost 30 years.

1425
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,640
We served together
on more than a few occasions.

1426
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,200
If he is lying, this will be
the first I've heard of it.

1427
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,080
- Yes, sir.
- My primary concern here...

1428
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,520
is the breakdown in the system.

1429
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,400
In this instance,
the system failed...

1430
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,200
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences...

1431
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,760
while preserving
the chain of command.

1432
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,200
Now you may have been
proven right, Mr. Hunter...

1433
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,400
but insofar as
the letter of the law is concerned...

1434
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,720
you were both right.

1435
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,920
And you were also both wrong.

1436
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,640
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this Navy...

1437
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:49,240
and this country's armed forces
as a whole...

1438
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,600
long after you leave this room.

1439
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:59,000
Off the record, you've both
created one hell of a mess:

1440
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,080
A mutiny aboard a United States
nuclear submarine...

1441
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:07,800
violation of nuclear
launch protocol.

1442
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,520
For the record, it is
the conclusion of this panel...

1443
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,440
that your actions
aboard the Alabama...

1444
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,280
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy...

1445
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,240
and in the interests
of the United States.

1446
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:26,000
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept...

1447
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,680
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country...

1448
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:35,160
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.

1449
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:40,680
And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation...

1450
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:44,280
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command...

1451
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:48,000
at the earliest possible convenience.

1452
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,320
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.

1453
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,240
No, sir.

1454
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,120
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.

1455

[Sighs] Just wanted
to say thank you.

1458
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,120

and I was wrong.
