00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,723
Bonjour, madame.

2
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,042
Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.

3
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,396
Vive l'Amerique.

4
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,814
Vive la France.

5
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,441
Vive le President Roosevelt.

6
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,168
Vive Le General de Gaulle.

00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,425
Vive le Radio City Music Hall.

Vive Les Folies Bergere.

9
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:10,273
SAM: First time I saw him,
we'd stopped off in a little town

10
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,401
in the mountains of Southern France.

11
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,570
Up north, at the time,
they were liberating Paris.

12
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,139
That was the big war, the glamour war.

13
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,577
The one they were taking all the pictures
of and writing all the words about.

14
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,663
But we had our own war,

15
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:28,233
And they weren't writing many words
or taking many pictures.

16
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,128
We'd landed near Saint-Tropez.

17
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,902
There wasn't much
resistance on the beaches,

18
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,967
not at all like the day
we got to Sicily or Salerno, or...

19
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, yeah, Anzio.

20
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,807
We started north, and once in a while
the Germans loped over an 88,

21
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,705
and once in a while somebody was killed.

22
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,004
Sometimes it was a friend.

23
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,616
He was one of a truckload of replacements,

24
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,369
and at ﬁrst they looked
like any bunch of new guys...

25
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,972
Too young, too clean and too polished.

26
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:09,224
And they all looked scared...

27
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,318
Except him.

28
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,004
He wasn't scared.

29
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,381
He was the kind of a guy you'd notice.

30
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,341
You know, take any group of guys,

31
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,177
there's always one that stands out.

32
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,824
(WEAPON FIRING)

33
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,083
Attention!

34
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,353
Any of you guys know
how to operate a radio?

35
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

36
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,588
Okay, the rest of you guys
can knock it off.

37
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:40,864
What's your name, soldier?

38
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,467
Technician 5th grade Britt Harris, sir.

39
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,036
Let's see your Form 20.

40
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,353
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:57,860
Uh-huh.

42
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,301
Graduate of Culver Military Academy,
attended Virginia Military Institute,

43
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,887
Penn State, Colgate and Cornell.

44
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,723
I never met a guy who
went to four colleges before.

45
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,951
How come you're not an officer?

46
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:12,187
Uh, it's rather difficult to explain, sir.

47
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,334
Try.

48
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,543
I wanted to serve with the men, sir.

49
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,799
Would you like to try that again?

50
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,451
Well, there are a few people
I wanted to prove a few things to, sir.

51
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,662
You got anxious a little late.

52
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,706
You been in the Army eight months,
we've been overseas 20 months.

53
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,355
I was deferred, sir, because of my job.

54
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,780
Yeah, "General Manager of the Harris
Woolen Mills, Newark, New Jersey."

55
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,633
You're named Harris and the mill's
named Harris. Coincidence, huh?

56
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,531
My father, sir.

57
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,304
That's pretty smart
of you to pick an old man

58
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,056
who owns a textile mill.

59
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,533
Only one?

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,043
Four, sir.

61
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,480
My old man was in business, too.

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,274
Ran a little candy store in New York.

63
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,609
123rd Street, near 8th Avenue.

64
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:04,431
He used to ask me to help him out once
in a while when he had a run on bubble gum.

65
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,302
You run that radio right,
and we'll get along fine.

66
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,434
If you don't, I'll boot your tail up
around your neck.

67
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,539
Comprenez?

68
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,544
Wait around here and I'll check you in
with the room clerk.

70
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,046
Does the, uh, Lieutenant
wish me to carry these, sir?

71
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,491
The Lieutenant wishes for you to knock off
that stateside chicken!

72
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,279
SAM: I needed someone to do Wiley's job.

73
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,082
He was one of the men
we left behind on the beach.

74
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,272
All right, dream boy, up and at 'em!

75
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:38,982
Come on, I got a new radio operator.

76
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,025
Check him in.

77
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,109
(SIGHS)

78
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,152
The artillery makes the replacements.

79
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,629
Why don't you let the artillery
make the repl...

80
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,155
They make 'em. Why don't you let them?

81
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,740
I mean, you know how the old man...

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,492
Shut your big, fat mouth
and grab a pencil. Come on!

83
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,265
(SIGHS)

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,246
That's not a nice way to talk,
you know that.

85
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,707
Not a nice way to talk for someone
who was just made an officer

86
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,684
and a gentleman, sir.

87
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,443
This guy's from Newark, too.
Do you know him?

88
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,691
Ho, ho.

89
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,553
No, I... Well, we're not exactly
buddy-buddies, but I know about him.

90
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,680
Yes, sir, "Corporal Britt Harris.

91
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,059
"Army serial no. 33170247."

92
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,853
You've got yourself a real doozy
this time, Lieutenant.

93
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,105
Would you like to explain that, Corporal?

94
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,231
You mean a "doozy"?

95
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:21,316
Mm-hmm.

96
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,361
Well, a doozy,
in this case, is a celebrity.

97
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:28,031
I mean, Mr. Britt Harris was quite
a celebrity up around our way.

98
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,383
It seems

99
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,410
that a member of the draft board,
of Harris' draft board,

100
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,765
just happened to be working in a factory
that Harris just happened to be running.

101
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:39,793
He tried to bribe him,
he gave him a Chevrolet.

102
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,169
I would've held out for a Cadillac.

103
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,612
Naturally.

104
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,381
What then... What happened then?

105
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,950
Well, he had to enlist. In a hurry.

106
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,611
Huh.

107
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:51,012
Thanks, Corporal.

108
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,472
You're welcome.

109
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,557
Oh, uh... Corporal,

110
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,977
you will keep this to yourself, won't you?

111
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,422
Tear out the fingernails, sir.
Tear out the fingernails.

112
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:04,676
And a very sanitary measure
it would be, too.

113
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:08,468
Don't worry about me, Sam, Lieutenant, sir.
You know me, sir.

114
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:09,906
Big mouth!

115
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,575
Je parle le francais un petit peu,
but I'd like to borrow your eggs.

116
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,676
Oh!

117
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:14,744

118
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,247
- Yeah, I'll take one, two...

121
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:26,423
SAM: I never told him I knew,
but I kept an eye on him.

122
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,341
You see, in our outﬁt we had to get along.

123
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,260
We were a forward observation team.

124
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,658
We lived in each other's pockets.

125
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,198
(LAUGHING)

126
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:37,659
Oh.

127
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,206
SAM: Hey, Harris.

128
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,040
Bye-bye.

129
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,363
What are those?

130
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,573
Les oeufs.

131
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,199
Did you pay for them?

132
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,410
No, sir. That woman gave them to me.

133
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,557
Why?

134
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:00,774
I don't know why, sir,
but women are always giving me things.

135
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,232
Let me see now, that'll be one for Rogers,

136
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,214
one for Harmer,

137
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,383
one for Breglio,

138
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,885
and one for...

139
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,428
No, two for me.

140
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,722
I keep forgetting I'm an officer now.

141
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,183
Yeah, that about leaves
one for you, right?

142
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:19,455
Right.

143
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,147
SAM: I guess I gave him
a rough time, all right.

144
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,774
Partly because I didn't trust him,

145
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:28,878
and partly because he was
born rich and handsome,

146
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,838
and I was born poor and not handsome.

147
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,268
You guys met Harris yet?

148
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:38,369
Uh-huh.

149
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,595
Yeah.

150
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,647
I understand he got sort of held up
getting in the army.

151
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,980
We had a couple of dry runs today.
He's pretty good with a radio.

152
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:50,924
So was Wiley.

153
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,367
(EXPLOSION)

156
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,118
Get the medics up here on the double!

157
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,438
It's those replacements.
They went into that other orchard.

158
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,649
I thought everybody knew
that place was loaded with mines!

159
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:09,843
It was marked! I know it was marked!

160
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,802
Shut up, you guys! Shut up.

Oh, my God, Mama!

162
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,992
Everybody knew it was mined.
Everybody should've known it was mined!

163
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,469
You men in there,

164
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:22,497
don't move an inch,
you'll touch off some more mines!

165
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,065
Stay right where you are!

166
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,709
SOLDIER WHIMPERING: Oh, God, Mama!

167
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,151
Get the P and A men up here on the double.
Tell 'em to bring their detectors.

168
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,948
SOLDIER: Oh, God, Mama!

169
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,865
Oh, God, Mama!

170
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,160
Oh, God, Mama!

171
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,282
Oh, God, Mama!

172
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,476
Oh, God, Mama!

173
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,453
You, stop! Hold it there!

174
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,464
Don't move, you'll touch off more mines!

175
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:51,460
They're all in here in close order.

176
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:54,596
Tell the medics to take
a bearing on my clothes.

177
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,355
SAM: One was dead, two had lost legs,
ﬁve were hospital cases.

178
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,695
You're quite a guy, Corporal.

179
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,038
Yes, sir, a real live hero.

180
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:27,458
You want me to pin the medal on you now,
or you wanna wait for the General to do it?

181
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,379
Well, I figured speed was essential, sir.

182
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,110
You ever hear of a little gadget
called a mine detector?

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,278
Answer me.

184
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,362
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,073
Didn't you hear me holler for you
to stop when you went in there?

186
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,283
Oh, no, sir.

187
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,885
That's too bad.

188
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,956
You got a razor blade in your gear?

189
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,082
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:49,834
Then use it to cut off your stripes,

191
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,561
Private Harris.

192
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,597
'Morning, sir.

193
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:03,723
'Morning, Sam.

194
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,417
Find yourself a place to sit.

195
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,984
I'm, uh, not going to try to persuade you

196
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,257
not to yank this man's stripes,

197
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:20,281
but I thought maybe you'd fill me in
on just what happened.

198
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,658
Nothing much happened, Colonel.

199
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:26,309
It's just that I hollered at him to stop
and he didn't obey orders. That's all.

200
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,730
I can recall a couple times
when you didn't hear an order.

201
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,504
I wouldn't have gone in there. Would you?

202
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,777
You kiddin'? We got too much sense.

203
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,107
Yeah.

204
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,530
You know, I can't quite figure this kid.

205
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,247
Maybe you don't have to. No, thanks.

206
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,183
Sam, don't ride the man so hard.

207
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,911
He can't help that he went to college.

208
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,563
I was going to put him up for a citation.

209
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:53,648
Oh, don't worry.

210
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:56,693
You'll get plenty of chances
to give this guy a medal.

211
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,010
Sam, um...

212
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,699
How many days have
you and your men been under fire?

213
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,783
Altogether?

214
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,993
Yeah, altogether.

215
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,436
188, 89.

216
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,581
You familiar with the French Riviera?

217
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:12,649
Only what I've read in
the National Geographic.

218
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,878
Well, I'm told that, um...

219
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,048
Big hotels are fixed so that
you turn on a water faucet

220
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:21,301
and you get either Cognac or Champagne.

221
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,969
Now that, uh, probably isn't true,

222
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,015
but suppose you and your men go down
there and make a 24-hour investigation.

223
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,662
Yes, sir.

224
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,168
(CHUCKLES)

225
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,330
SAM: An hour later we were
halfway to Nice.

226
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,482
That's the kind of a war it was.

227
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,210
Some people call it
the Champagne Campaign.

228
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,036
Nobody who was there will ever forget

229
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,184
the way the French Riviera
was that season.

230
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,899
The Army had made it a rest area.

231
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:56,686
There'd never been one like it
before and never would be again.

232
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:00,631
They shipped in oranges from North Africa,

233
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,733
eggs from Sweden, steaks from Argentina.

234
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,325
The Champagne and Cognac
were already there...

235
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,766
So were some of the girls,

236
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:13,086
but others came by bus,
by foot and by plane.

237
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,959
Oh, there were all kinds of girls.

238
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,028
The hotels were luxurious, all right,

239
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,381
but it wasn't quite like the Colonel said.

240
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,741
You had to go all the way
out to the terrace

241
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,094
to get the Cognac and the Champagne.

242
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,142
You can forget how beautiful
a beautiful woman can be,

243
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:40,192
but it doesn't take long
to refresh your memory.

244
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,739
I saw what they meant
by the French Riviera.

245
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,723
After a few hours, I got tired

246
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:36,060
of looking at 10,000 other men
wearing the same suit I was

247
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,812
and doing the same things I was.

248
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:41,291
I left the guys at a bistro
and just took off in the jeep.

249
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,242
Bienvenue, Americain!

250
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,368
Bravo, les Americains!

251
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,494
Ah!

252
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,204
Bienvenue, les Americains. Bienvenue!

253
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,977
Soyez bienvenu!

254
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:09,986
WITH FRENCH ACCENT:
You are the first American I have seen.

255
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,680
I have been thinking

256
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,558
that I must give something
to my first American...

257
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,752
Something I like very much.

258
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,252
BOY: Four...

259
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,354
Cinq, five...

260
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,735
Six, six...

261
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,595
Sept, huit... Sept...

262
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,368
- Sev... Sev...
- Sept...

263
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,349
- Sept, seven...
- Seven...

264
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,623
SAM: I try now to remember
what I thought in that ﬁrst moment...

265
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,354
That she was beautiful, I guess.

266
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,855
BOTH: Quatre, four...

267
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,274
That I wanted very much to speak to her.

268
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:07,047
- Cinq...
- Cinq, five...

269
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,554
Six, six...

270
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,053
Sept, seven...

271
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,261
Huit.

272
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,515
Oh, non, non, non.

273
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,358
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

274
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,965
Uh, mademoiselle, um...

275
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,443
Je suis American.

276
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,574
Uh, yes, I know.

277
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,365
You speak English.

278
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:40,793
My mother sometimes says
I speak it perpetually.

279
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,829
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

280
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,402
Lieutenant Sam Loggins.

281
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,004
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

282
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,090
Oh...

283
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,939
I don't understand.

284
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:10,064
He does not know you mean him to keep it.

285
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,925
He has never had a gift before, I think.

286
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,777
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

287
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,460
Uh, Lieutenant Sam Loggins,
Jean-Francois Duvan.

288
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,873
Merci bien, monsieur.

289
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,711
You're welcome.

290
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,281
And now I must go. I am very late.

291
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,099
Thank you again and goodbye.

292
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,848
I know Jean-Francois' name,
but I don't know yours.

293
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,705
Oh, I am Monique Blair.

294
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,728
Your English is very good.

295
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,834
I am an American.

296
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,938
You're kidding!
Then why do you talk like that?

297
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,316
Well, I was born in Paris.
I have always lived in France.

298
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,678
And you've never been home...
Uh, to the United States, I mean?

299
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,451
France is my home.

300
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,824
Miss, whatever it is she's
cooking in there smells awful good.

301
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,368
What do you call it?

302
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,186
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Poulpe.

303
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,439
It... It tastes very good, too.

304
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,653
Uh, come, I...
I will introduce you to the madame.

305
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,673
Ah, bonjour!

306
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,799
Bonjour.

307
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,651
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

308
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,919
That looks good.

309
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,672
Mmm, that's wonderful.

310
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,566
What do they call this?

311
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,418
Uh, uh... Poulpe.

312
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,428
What's it mean?

313
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,715
Octopus.

314
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,410
(LAUGHING)

315
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,370
My father felt the same way.

316
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,871
He loved poulpe.

317
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,956
Very nice.

318
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,057
(GIGGLING)

319
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,626
(STAMMERS)
Can't you recommend something else?

320
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,855
Uh... The small sardines,
fried crisp in butter.

321
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,110
Could you, uh...

322
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,300
Could you stay and...

323
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,993
Have some with me?

324
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,988
Please?

325

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

326
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,635
Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,990
Does she give Brandy
to everybody on the house?

328
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,159
- (SNICKERS)
- Madame is French.

329
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,853
It is unlikely that she
has ever done so before,

330
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,064
or that she ever will again.

331
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:49,598
Now...

332
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:53,311
Tell me what happened
after your father died.

333
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,615
Well, I hung around New York for a while,

334
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,343
then I realized that
all the guys I grew up with

335
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,787
were either drafted or in jail.

336
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,574
So I went back to Los Angeles.

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,169
Then one day, Mr. Bolling called me
in his office and he said, uh...

338
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:13,130
"Sam, take a look at the new letterheads."

339
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,691
So I looked at them and I said,
"They look fine."

340
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,418
And then I saw it.

341
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,760
The letterhead said,
"Bolling and Loggins, Constructionists."

342
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,134
He made me a partner just like that.

343
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,387
And what did you do then?

344
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,481
Well, I thanked him.

345
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,211
You thanked him,

346
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,405
making your voice very deep,

347
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,485
then you

348
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,033
excused yourself,

349
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,948
and you went into your own office,

350
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:45,825
closed the door,

351
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,954
and you wept.

352
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,393
You wept because

353
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:54,271
Mr. Fred Bolling is such a good man.

354
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,419
Well, to tell you the truth,

355
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,338
I never mentioned this before,
but that's exactly what I did.

356
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:02,554
I wept.

357
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,846
How did you guess that?

358
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,552
Oh, I did not guess.

359
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,802
I think

360
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,308
Americans are

361
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,894
ashamed when they feel tenderness.

362
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:15,977
You know, my father once told me...

363
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,045
"Monique, you cannot judge a man,

364
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,692
"by what he says

365
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,987
"unless you see his face."

366
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,027
Your father was a very wise man.

367
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,387
Oh, yes,

368
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,471
he was,

369
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,539
very wise indeed.

370
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:32,376
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

371
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,296
What'd she say?

372
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,590
Uh, oh, ah...

373
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:43,925
She said that

374
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,557
she loved having the Americans here.

375
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,492
Thank you.

376
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,060
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

377
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,356
Uh, she wishes you

378
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:01,025
very much good luck.

379
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,758
For me, it will be very bad luck
unless I go home now.

380
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,326
My mother will worry.

381
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:12,224
Think I could see you again?

382
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,747
I can get another pass next weekend.

383
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,337
I cannot see you again.

384
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,753
You cannot or you will not?

385
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,587
Will not.

386
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,426
Well, I guess that wraps it up then.

387
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,262
I like you, Sam.

388
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:36,189
I think you are a very good American.

389
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:38,608
But you won't see me again.

390
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,443
I won't see you again.

391
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:46,008
Well, I don't usually
press my luck, but, uh,

392
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,551
if you change your mind,

393
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:50,450
around 8:00 next Saturday night,
I'll be here.

394
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:52,056
Goodbye, Sam.

395
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,703
And thank you again.

396
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,102
SAM: When we got back,
it was still the same old war.

397
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,206
It was funny. Some days we drank
Champagne, courtesy of the French,

398
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:02,526
and some days we ate dirt,
courtesy of the Germans.

399
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:06,255
Our objective that morning was a ridge

400
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,278
that overlooked a valley
held by the Germans.

401
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,678
The valley was only ﬁve kilometers
from the pass leading into Italy,

402
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,372
but it was a very valuable
piece of real estate.

403
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,353
Intelligence ﬁgured the Jerries
had moved off the ridge,

404
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,501
but intelligence couldn't be sure.

405
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,792
So it was our job to ﬁnd out.

406
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:18,827
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

408
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,190
You got 'em?

409
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,518
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

410
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,836
From Checkpoint 8.

411
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,671
From Checkpoint 8.

412
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,068
Azimuth 4000.

413
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:32,991
Azimuth 4000.

414
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,619
SAM: Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

415
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:38,781
Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

416
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,416
A concrete bunker. Fire for effect.

417
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:42,789
BRITT: Concrete bunker.

418
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,120
Fire for effect. Over.

419
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,714
Here they come.

420
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,201
Duck!

422
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,910
Okay, that's it.

423
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:19,697
End of mission. Area covered. Out.

424
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,499
There goes our radio.
We're gonna have to wait for support.

Duck!

427
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,756
SAM: Then they started paying us back.

428
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,733
We couldn't move in any direction.

429
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,760
We were locked in.

430
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,033
(EXPLOSION)

431
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,740
They got guns, too.

432
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:08,542
I ﬁgured maybe we had ﬁve minutes to live,

433
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,627
give or take a little.

434
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:58,004
You're quite a guy, Harris.

435
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,756
Pretty fancy dancin'.

436
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:05,452
You like your stripes back,
I'll get 'em back for you.

437
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:06,895
Thanks.

438
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:10,916
Next time we're on a pass together,
I'll buy you a beer.

439
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,768
Thanks, Lieutenant.

440
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,608
It's nothing, Sergeant.

441
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,034
SAM: That night, we took over the bunker,

442
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,787
we started to zero in
on the valley with our howitzers.

443
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,117
We blasted them whenever we saw them.

444
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,544
But the thing is,
we almost never saw them.

Hey, Britt.

Hi.

452
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:01,984
You guys know each other?

453
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,929
Sure. We just about got our tails
blown off together. Didn't we, Britt?

454
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,014
Yeah.

455
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,140
How's that?

456
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,742
We're in the same bunch of replacements.

457
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,895
Remember that night all those guys went
into that minefield and got blown to hell?

458
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:17,750
Me and old Britt were in there
getting a helmet full of apples.

459
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,945
Okay, Anderson, get on over to the billet.

460
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:24,281
Rustle yourself up a spot to lie down in.

461
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,741
Right you are, Lieutenant.

462
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,684
Take it easy, Britt.

463
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,774
So you'd already explored
the orchard, huh?

464
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,006
You knew pretty much where the mines were.

465
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,858
Uh, well, I wasn't sure.

466
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:47,909
I figured you wouldn't pull a bonehead trick
like that without an angle.

467
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,251
If you'd told me about it,
I wouldn't have yanked your stripes.

468
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,380
But then I guess nobody
would have thought of you as a hero.

469
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,582
Did somebody?

470
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,252
You know something?

471
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,489
I can't figure you.
Every time I think I've got you zeroed in,

472
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,182

It's been a long time
since I've had the privilege.

You're very kind, but, uh,
I'm sort of in a hurry.

Please.

to drink for one night.

00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,820
I thought all American soldiers
drink as much as they can.

490
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,155
As quickly as they can.

491
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:29,598
Some do.

492
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,429
I would, too, if I were a soldier.

493
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,137
You, uh, were waiting for someone.

494
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:37,726
A girl?

495
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,083
If you'll excuse me now,
I have other plans.

496
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:41,918
What other plans,

497
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:43,645
if you don't mind my asking?

498
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,446
No, I don't mind you asking.

499
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,075
Sit down, Sam.

500
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,154
I'm Monique's mother, of course.

501
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:59,728
It was, uh, rather rude of me
to pretend to be otherwise, wasn't it?

502
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,205
Yes, it was.

503
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,291
Are you always so honest?

504
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,167
No, not really.

505
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:09,696
You ever been
out of the States before, Sam?

506
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,924
No. Well, once, I went to Catalina Island.

507
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:15,619
You like living in Los Angeles?

508
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,746
You're in the construction business.

509
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:19,623
Is there much money in that?

510
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:21,166
Mrs. Blair...

511
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,210
I'm not asking for your daughter's
hand in marriage.

512
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,063
I just wanted to spend
an evening with her.

513
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:27,881
Did you sail from New York?

514
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:28,924
Mm-hmm.

515
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,402
I remember the morning I left.

516
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,658
The sun was shining
and there was just a little haze.

517
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,099
That was 20 years ago.

518
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,200
Leaving,

519
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:41,460
that's what I remember best.

520
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:45,106
I remember there were
some very nice gray ladies.

521
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,709
They gave each of us a cup of coffee

522
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,257
and then word came to board ship,

523
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,406
and each and every one of us stooped down

524
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:56,259
and placed the cup next to his right foot.

525
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,644
And then as the ship
pulled out of the dock,

526
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,985
I looked down and saw all of these cups.

527
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:10,407
Some guy behind me said
they looked like rows of tombstones,

528
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,110
and maybe some of them were.

529
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,805
Come on, Sam.

530
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:19,033
Monique's waiting dinner for us.

531
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,936
How do you feel about riding in a jeep?

532
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:27,732
Well, it's one of the several experiences
I promised myself before I die.

533
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,833
Uh!

534
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,799
Another is jumping out of a parachute.

535
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,947
No, dear, you jump out of a plane.

536
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:36,015
You hold on to the parachute.

537
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,878
SAM: It was quite a place they lived in.

538
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:50,380
We had a home-cooked meal,

539
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,949
and after dinner,
Monique took me on a tour.

540
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:58,617
During the occupation,

541
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,163
Mama and I each had
an hour alone in this room

542
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,786
every day.

543
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:06,688
Uh, hers was from 3:00 to 4:00
in the afternoon,

544
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,758
and mine was
from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning.

545
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,151
It's a lovely room.

546
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,298
Yes.

547
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:17,198
What is this, Monique?

548
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,283
(LAUGHS)

549
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,602
It is a piece of brown bread.

550
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,808
An old family relic?

551
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,146
No.

552
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:28,168
No. There... There was one week

553
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:30,521
when there were 30 of us in the villa...

554
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,025
Mostly refugee children, like...
Like Jean-Francois, remember?

555
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,494
And we had only brown bread
and water to drink.

556
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:43,872
My father said that when the time came
that we had enough again,

557
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,921
and there would be such a time, he said,

558
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:51,834
I must not forget
what it is like to be hungry.

559
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,112
So you kept it.

560
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:57,213
Mm-hmm.

561
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,384
Your father must have been quite a guy.

562
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:03,136
When did he die?

563
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:06,352
About two years ago.

564
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,730
I miss him very much.

565
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,611
I'm sure you do.

566
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,755
Sam...

567
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,256
Oh, I've got to run.

568
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,425
I've got to get back to the outfit.
I'm on the midnight shift.

569
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,468
Oh.

570
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,178
Now that the Germans are gone,

571
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,701
I keep thinking that the war is over.

572
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,908
Is it bad?

573
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,768
No, it's been worse,

574
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,604
but it's always bad
when somebody's shooting at you.

575
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,272
You be careful, now.

576
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,921
I am the most careful girl in these parts.

577
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,671
Return soon.

578
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:41,049
It has been most pleasant.

579
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:42,884
It was wonderful.

580
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,887
Uh, Monique...

581
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:48,766
In America, we have a custom
called a good-night kiss.

582
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,019
It is the custom in many countries.

583
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,024
May I kiss you?

584
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:56,906
I should like you to.

585
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,914
Good night.

586
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,478
SAM: I had never seen the moon so bright.

587
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,439
Right then, I could've KO'd Joe Louis,

588
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,008
hit a homer for the Giants
and climbed an Alp.

589
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,950
I lived for my passes.

590
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,493
We went on a picnic.

591
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:27,036
There was fried chicken, all right,

592
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:30,891
and also pâté de foie-gras sandwiches,
and a view.

593
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:33,710
I'd heard it's the most beautiful
in the world.

594
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,902
I'll buy that.

595
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:37,005
We went pedal-pushing.

596
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:39,233
It's for kids, you know, like me.

597
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,594
I made a deal with the Mess Sergeant.

598
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,762
I gave him my liquor ration,

599
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:47,162
and he gave me, well,
a lot more food than it was worth.

600
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,003
I did them in at poker,

601
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,086
and Mrs. Blair murdered me at chess.

602
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:09,183
And then there was
that night in the garden.

603
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,026
I know one thing,
you are not very much for flowers,

604
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:18,147
but in here I planted
these American beauties.

605
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,490
But it is not time for a goodnight kiss.

606
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,415
Mm-hmm, but in America,
some people just don't wait.

607
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:34,729
If they feel like kissing, they kiss.

608
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,002
Kiss, kiss, kiss all the time.

609
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:39,297
That's how I feel

610
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,836
with you.

611
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:49,969
Monique,

612
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,913
remember the day we met

613
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,515
at Madame Brieux's,

614
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,375
and she said something to me in French

615
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,210
and I asked you what she said?

616
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,154
And you told me that
she wished me much luck?

617
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,907
Yes, I... I remember.

618
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,785
Well, that wasn't what she said.

619
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,199
No.

620
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,370
I consulted an expert
and found out what she really said was,

621
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,540
she wished for me a great love.

622
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,289
Now, that was quite a thing
for her to say because,

623
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,440
well,

624
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,276
I'm not much of a catch.

625
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:24,153
As a matter of fact,
nobody ever tried to catch me,

626
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:27,097
and I've never tried
to catch anybody either.

627
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:29,384
Well...

628
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,559
What I'm trying to say is that

629
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,474
I love you, Monique.

630
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,397
I love you very much.

631
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:46,697
But you don't love me.

632
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:49,237
No, Sam.

633
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,156
Well...

634
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:54,416
You can't win 'em all.

635
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:56,415
Sam,

636
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:59,422
when I came home that first afternoon,

637
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,608
I said to my mother...

638
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,131
"I have met a very nice American

639
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,863
"from Los Angeles, California.

640
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:09,282
"A lieutenant," I said.

641
00:40:09,382 --> 00:40:11,760
"And it would be my dearest wish

642
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,521
"that he would like me,

643
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,856
"and that he want me

644
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,808
"as a friend."

645
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,357
I still wish that.

646
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:24,356
I'll settle for that for now.

647
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,611
Mmm, that love-at-first-sight routine
rarely happens anyway,

648
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,620
and we've got time.

649
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:34,491
I'll try to make you love me,

650
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,185
and I hope you will.

651
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,287
No, Sam. There is no such hope.

652
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:43,254
You... You can't stop me from trying.

653
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,759
I can stop seeing you.

654
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,341
I will.

655
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,226
That's fine.

656
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:01,793
I always say, "If you're going
to kick a guy in the teeth,

657
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,736
"be sure to use both feet."

658
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:07,632
It is for you that I have said that.

659
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:08,904
Thanks a lot.

660
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,402
Sam!

661
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:12,528
Sam.

662
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,555
I was just shoving off.

663
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:15,932
Sam, I was listening.

664
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,832
Well, good for you. It will save
a lot of time, a lot of trouble.

665
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:21,712
Come in.

666
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,708
Come in, Sam.

667
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,667
Please.

668
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:53,365
Uh, sit down, Sam, please.

669
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,211
I have had something to tell you

670
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:09,044
ever since that first afternoon.

671
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,512
I did not because

672
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:14,382
I did not see any point to it then.

673
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,636
No, that...

674
00:42:19,428 --> 00:42:21,055
That is not true.

675
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,892
I did not because

676
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,811
I liked you.

677
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:28,441
Uh, I still do,

678
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,065
but...

679
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,238
I... I

680
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,411
know how Americans

681
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,363
feel about some things.

682
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:40,825
I have read and

683
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:44,121
I know the way so many
of the soldiers talk.

684
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:47,648
I...

685
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,295
I have told you

686
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:52,111
that my father

687
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:53,963
was a very great man.

688
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,016
Believe me, he was.

689
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,191
He was also a negro.

690
00:43:25,578 --> 00:43:26,795
I guess

691
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,022
"nigger" is

692
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:31,422
one of the first words
you learn in America, isn't it?

693
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,474
Good... Goodbye, Sam.

694
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,650
Monique's father was a rare man.

695
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:04,242
I've never known another like him.

696
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:15,838
This picture was taken
a year before he died.

697
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,857
Fred was a poor boy

698
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:30,310
from Georgia.

699
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:33,355
His mother took in washing

700
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,361
and he never knew his father.

701
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,777
But he ran errands,

702
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,178
he swept floors,

703
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,407
he dug ditches to get through
Hampton Institute.

704
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,707
And at 35, he was president of
an insurance company in Philadelphia.

705
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:59,221
I was a public health nurse
in West Virginia.

706
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,593
When I went back home to Philadelphia,

707
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:07,480
I met him for the first time
at a welfare conference.

708
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:11,396
I fell in love with him

709
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,521
and married him.

710
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:18,070
I didn't care what color his skin was.

711
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:20,989
He was the finest,

712
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:24,246
dearest man I've ever known in my life.

713
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,717
When the time came,

714
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:44,805
I discovered I was going to have a child.

715
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:48,100
I cried that night.

716
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,020
I said to my husband...

717
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,062
"There are ways," I said.

718
00:45:58,314 --> 00:46:00,942
See, for us, it hadn't mattered
what people thought.

719
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:02,843
We walked the streets of Philadelphia,

720
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:04,303
proud and

721
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:05,529
defiant,

722
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,703
and in love.

723
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,705
But a child...

724
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,378
My husband was a rock of a man.

725
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,544
He said...

726
00:46:21,003 --> 00:46:23,097
"It is the will of God."

727
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:29,478
He said, "We will go to France.

728
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:33,312
"In France, they have
a beautiful blindness to color.

729
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:37,315
"Our child will be French."

730
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,493
We've lived here ever since.

731
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:46,620
All our friends were French.

732
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:52,918
Monique was 13 when
the last Americans left the Riviera.

733
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:57,836
She had not seen one since
until she met you.

734
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,180
Maybe I should've told you
that first night, but...

735
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,180
I thought to myself, "Sam is a soldier.
He will soon move on."

736
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:14,498
I'm going to bed now, Sam.

737
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,976
Please don't say anything. Please.

738
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,157
If you want to come back and see us,
you'll always be welcome here.

739
00:47:24,316 --> 00:47:25,568
If not,

740
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:30,205
you've already given us
a lot of happiness.

741
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,815
SAM: I fought two wars that week...

742
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,880
My own and the Army's.

743
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,799
The Army's was easy.

744
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:06,993
Mostly, I thought about that word.

745
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:09,178
Monique was wrong.

746
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:11,389
It's not the ﬁrst one you learn at all,

747
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,742
and some kids never learn it at all.

748
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:16,102
Some learn it and never use it.

749
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:18,751
I learned it early and used it often.

750
00:48:18,913 --> 00:48:21,257
It showed just how tough I was,

751
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:23,317
and that wasn't all.

752
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:26,153
Where I was brought up, Harlem near 125th,

753
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:27,863
they were on one side,

754
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,840
and we were on the other.

755
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,558
Why? I don't know why,

756
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:34,745
except a lot of people need
somebody to look down on,

757
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,722
or they think they do.

758
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,101
What's the matter, Lieutenant?

759
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:47,028
Not a thing.

760
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:11,599
SAM: It got to be Saturday night.
It always does.

761
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:16,058
SOLDIER 1: My mother wants to know,
am I taking my vitamin pills?

762
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:21,041
SOLDIER 2: I was scared,
but I mean really scared.

763
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,335
I said, "God, you get me out of this one,

764
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:25,654
"and I'm really gonna shape up."

765
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:30,134
I mean, I said, "God, you can trust me,
you can count on me!

766
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,594
"No more drinkin',

767
00:49:31,694 --> 00:49:33,571
"no more smokin',

768
00:49:33,862 --> 00:49:37,099
"no more, you know,
swearin' or, uh, any of that stuff."

769
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,893
(STAMMERING) Well, well, what happened?

770
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:40,811
Well, tell you the honest truth,

771
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,564
I don't think I had a cigarette
for about two days there.

772
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:45,007
(SOLDIERS LAUGH)

773
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:14,912
'Evening, sir.

774
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:17,348
Sit down.

775
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,432
Am I interrupting something?

776
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:19,533
No.

777
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:24,789
Writing a letter to my wife.

778
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,710
She was always
in charge of Saturday night.

779
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,306
Whatever she wanted to do, you know,

780
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,308
it was her night.

781
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,308
You know what we used to do?

782
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:43,857
Half the time, we'd stay home,

783
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,585
barbecue a steak,

784
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:49,359
then play a couple of hands of blackjack,

785
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,816
go to bed early.

786
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,612
That's what we used to do.

787
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:02,285
Uh, have some.

788
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:15,093
Angel food cake, butterscotch frosting.

789
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:18,767
Best damn cake my wife ever baked.

790
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,264
Um...

791
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:28,895
Sir, um...

792
00:51:31,605 --> 00:51:33,699
Well, the guys all
went off to town, and I...

793
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:35,864
I wasn't gonna go,

794
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:38,821
but I... I changed my mind and I...

795
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:42,558
And I was wondering whether I could, uh...

796
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:44,018
You can, uh,

797
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:45,290
take my jeep.

798
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,417
I'm not going anyplace.

799
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:49,502
Thank you, sir.

800
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:51,083
Sam...

801
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:56,756
You know the worst thing in the world?

802
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:00,133
Loneliness.

803
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,222
Yes, sir.

804
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,755
MONIQUE: Sam!

805
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:38,798
Hello, friend.

806
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:40,511
Sam!

807
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,467
Maman!

808
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:44,052
Oh...

809
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:45,179
Sam!

810
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,580
Oh...

811
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,248
You have come back.

812
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:49,349
Oh.

813
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:51,018
Maman!

814
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:53,195
It's Sam!

815
00:52:58,525 --> 00:52:59,868
Welcome.

816
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:04,556
Now look, we're gonna go to Nice,
all three of us.

817
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:07,017
How long will it take you to put
your glad rags on?

818
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,211

SAM: And he was wonderful
with her, of course.

984
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:27,549
He even knew all about flowers.

985
01:05:27,649 --> 01:05:32,137
They liked the same books, the same music,
and they spoke the same language... French.

986
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:34,205
They both liked Picasso and...

987
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,599
There was one other thing...

988
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,768
She was in love with him.

989
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,791
I didn't know about him.

990
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:43,628
I never knew about him.

991
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:54,492
Britt and I went on
almost every pass together

992
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:56,077
and it was always the same...

993
01:05:56,177 --> 01:05:58,726
There were the two of them, and me.

994
01:06:00,306 --> 01:06:02,125
Sam, I know you're not much
of a wine drinker,

995
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:04,398
but this stuff is the wildest.

996
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:05,812
Here.

997
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:07,797
Bonsoir, madame.

Uh, she said that friendship

between a man and a woman is, uh...
Is what?

1005
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:34,616
Is only for

01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:36,075
those who are

1007
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:37,577
very old

or very tired.

1009
01:06:45,727 --> 01:06:47,045
Oh, Sam,

1010
01:06:47,145 --> 01:06:48,922
you should not drink chablis that way.

1011
01:06:49,022 --> 01:06:51,650
It is a tender wine.
It must be sipped only.

1012
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:53,693
Yeah, I'm a slob.

1013
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,488
A very sweet slob.

1014
01:06:56,863 --> 01:06:58,080
Thanks.

01:06:59,824 --> 01:07:01,309
Hey, why don't we play that game,

1016
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:02,977
uh, "I Love My Love Because"?

1017
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:04,771
Oh, yes, that is a lovely game.

1018
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:05,813
No.

1019
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:06,898
Sam, look, it's a very simple...

1020
01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:07,999
No!

1021
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,135

Notre Dame de la Garoupe

I've seen a cathedral and a lighthouse.

But never together, Sam.
It's the only one like it.

- You sure?
- I'm sure!

1031
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,566
Mind if we take the jeep?

1032
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:58,364
No, go right ahead.

Hi, Sam.

1045
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:31,746
You really should have seen
that lighthouse.

1046
01:11:31,846 --> 01:11:33,723
It was absolutely the...

1047

Hey, Sam, you're my buddy, right?

1048
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:37,335
Thick and thin? Fire and water?

1049

Sleet and snow? Muck and mire?

1050

Look, Sam, buddy, pal, friend,
I've been through quite a bit this morning.

1051
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,885
The old lady was waiting up for us.

1052
01:11:45,985 --> 01:11:46,986
Huh.

1053
01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:52,558
Sam, I think you're familiar
with the term "love."

1054
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:55,394
It's never properly been defined,
although a lot of guys have tried it,

1055
01:11:55,494 --> 01:11:58,231
even those fellows that make it
with the poetry.

1056
01:11:58,331 --> 01:12:00,333
Sam, I'm in love with the girl!

1057
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:04,320
Well, I didn't think
this was going to happen!

1058
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,406
I don't care whether you hate my guts
or not, that's beside the point.

1059
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:10,305
But I never figured
that I was the guy that...

1060
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:14,472
Sam...

1061
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:17,516
Monique and I are going to get married.

1062
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:21,529
Someday, Britt?

1063
01:12:21,896 --> 01:12:23,339
When the shooting's all over?

1064
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,783
You're going back to New Jersey?

1065
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:28,736
Sam...

1066
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:31,702
I'm never going back to Newark.
I never was.

1067
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:33,199
Uh...

1068
01:12:33,366 --> 01:12:35,852
Well, I never mentioned it
to you, but, uh...

1069
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,021
I got in a little trouble when
I was back there, you know, and...

1070
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,465
I've had Newark,
and I think Newark's had me.

1071
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,944
Besides, I've got a little money
going for me.

1072
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,012
I've got a trust fund.
So maybe we'll even settle here.

1073
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:48,465
I don't know.

1074
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:54,895
When, Sergeant?

1075
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,416
You know how the Army is, Sam.

There's a right way
and there's a wrong way.

01:13:13,114 --> 01:13:16,038
Sam, I was going to ask you
to be my best man.

1082
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:18,540
I'd be delighted.

Sammy, don't you trust me?

1084
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:30,256

1088
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,746
Good morning, dear.

1089
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:57,871
For me?

1090
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:20,473
Did you make him ask her?

1091
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:23,313
Oh, no.

1092
01:14:25,144 --> 01:14:27,192
What... What do you think, Sammy?

1093
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,490
Well, I'm not exactly neutral.

1094
01:14:31,025 --> 01:14:32,493
No, you're not.

1095
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,780
It won't be easy for them,

1096

even at best.

1097
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:42,662
You know what I bet?
I bet everything turns out just dandy.

1098
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:45,915
Maybe.

1099
01:14:46,624 --> 01:14:48,217
I hope that's true.

Well, I've protected her, and I'm

not sure I was right.

When he...

1107
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:10,398
Came to me this morning
with those great eyes

1108
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,677
that must have got him so much
and saved him so much.

1109
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:15,778
Mm-hmm.

1110
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:17,905
He told me that he loved her

1111
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,157
and wanted to marry her.

1112
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,452
Well, I said what I said.

1113
01:15:27,081 --> 01:15:29,675
Now, go wish her
all the happiness there is.

1116

I was hoping you would come.

1117
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,842
I thought I'd better report in
and see how you are.

(STAMMERING)
Uh, did Britt tell you... Tell you?

1119
01:15:58,904 --> 01:16:01,932
Oh, he was blabbering about
love and marriage and all that stuff.

1120
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:05,144
I didn't quite understand
what he was talking about.

1121
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:06,687
I am very happy.

1122
01:16:06,787 --> 01:16:08,164
That's good.

1123
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:09,290
I am in love.

1124
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,860
I guess that's about all anybody can ask.

1125
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,928
It is a very great deal.

1126
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,490
And there is even more.

1127

Oh, there couldn't be.

1128

Yes.

1129
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:24,438
That first night,

1130
01:16:24,763 --> 01:16:26,390
uh, when he was here,

1131
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:28,397
we went into the garden

1132
01:16:29,435 --> 01:16:31,062
and he looked at me, and

1133
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:32,859
he said...

1134
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,491
"Sam has told me about your father.

1135
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,198
"You must be very proud of him."

You can see, can you not,
that I worship Britt?

I think you've got it all taped,
all buttoned up.

You approve then?

1139
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,863
Well, I wouldn't want to get this around,

Oh!

01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:16,590
Hey, Sam, I thought
you weren't coming back.

1145
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,987
I'm back.

1146
01:17:18,943 --> 01:17:19,927
Britt?

1147
01:17:20,027 --> 01:17:21,028
Hmm?

1148
01:17:21,695 --> 01:17:23,055
You're not kiddin' this time, are you?

1149
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:25,249
You're not just foolin' around?

1150
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,997
Sam, I'm in love with the girl.

1151
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:29,332
Okay.

1152
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,647
There's just one thing worries me.

1153
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,999
What's that?

1154
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:35,568
I haven't got a thing
to wear for this wedding.

1155
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:36,669
(LAUGHS)

1156
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:52,856
SAM: He got the marriage application
the next day.

1157
01:17:56,522 --> 01:17:58,900
A month passed and then another,

1158
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:00,926
and the Germans kept pouring them in,

1159
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:03,512
and every week,
a few more men were killed.

1160
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,848
But there was still
no word on the mission.

1161
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,201
Finally, the old man sent for me.

1162
01:18:12,663 --> 01:18:14,006
Hi, Lieutenant.

1163
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,695
He'll be with you in just a minute.
He just got back from regiment.

1164
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,115
Havin' a little conference with the staff,
you see. Take a load off, Lieutenant.

1165
01:18:23,215 --> 01:18:24,888
Thank you, Corporal.

1166
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:27,386
1725...

1167
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,288
Tell me, uh...

1168
01:18:29,388 --> 01:18:31,790
How's the pride of Newark, New Jersey
making out?

1169
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,710
He's turning out to be
a damn fine soldier.

1170
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,902
Yeah?

1171
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,398
You know what General Grant always said.

1172
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,363
No, what did General Grant "always said"?

1173
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:43,177
I don't know. He just, uh...

1174
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:45,095
(LAUGHS) He said somethin'.

1175
01:18:45,195 --> 01:18:47,765
By the way, how's our boy's
marriage application coming along?

1176
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:50,744
It's been in the works
for over two months now.

1177
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:53,833
Are you kiddin'? He picked those papers
up here about three weeks ago.

1178
01:18:54,204 --> 01:18:57,003
He just never brought 'em back.
I don't know.

1179
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,150
Wait a minute.

1180
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,153
Oh, yeah. Hey, listen, I, uh,
I mentioned that to him about,

1181
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:03,656
uh, a couple of days ago.
You know what he said?

1182
01:19:03,756 --> 01:19:05,532
He said the whole thing was a gag.

1183
01:19:05,632 --> 01:19:07,409
It was just a big gag.

1184
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,637
(LAUGHING) He's a character.

1185
01:19:09,762 --> 01:19:11,372
You know what I figured?
I mean, personally,

1186
01:19:11,472 --> 01:19:13,374
I figure that some French mama

1187
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:15,101
put the squeeze on our boy, you know,

1188
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,878
but he, uh, he smoothed himself out of it.

1189
01:19:17,978 --> 01:19:19,505
You know him, he's quite a smoother.

1190
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:21,278
Oh, he is quite a smoother.

1191
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:26,070
Sam, regimental headquarters
approved your plan.

1192
01:19:27,946 --> 01:19:30,349
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

1193
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:31,475
No, sir.

1194
01:19:31,575 --> 01:19:32,576
All right.

1195
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,481
Sam, I think you know everybody.

1196
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,024
Yes, sir. Hi, Sam.

1197
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,694
Hour is 0300 at hill 209.

1198
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:43,195
I'll personally see you off.

1199
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:46,031
When you get to town hall,
set up an OP and check in

1200
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:47,449
and report all activity while en route.

1201
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:48,534
Yes, sir.

1202
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:51,036
Now, Captain Harrison
will brief you on net operation.

1203
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:54,060
You won't follow
any regular radio procedure.

1204
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:55,853
FDC will be alerted.

1205
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,628
Two men will monitor the net
at all times for your signals.

1206
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,403
Now, when you reach the tower,
switch on your radio and say...

1207
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:05,384
"Established."

1208
01:20:05,484 --> 01:20:06,468
Any questions?

1209
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,553
No, sir.

1210
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:08,595
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1211
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:10,322
Anything else?

1212
01:20:10,948 --> 01:20:13,267
Well, I guess that about covers it.

1213
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:15,165
Thank you, gentlemen.

1214
01:20:25,379 --> 01:20:27,614
Sir, does this mean
our passes are cancelled?

1215
01:20:27,714 --> 01:20:29,716
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.

1216
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:34,663
Well, sir, it's important that Sergeant Harris
and I get into town for a little while.

1217
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,874
It's, um, personal and it's...

1218
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:38,375
It's pretty important, sir.

1219
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:40,352
But I promise to get us back by 0100.

1220
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:42,313
I guarantee it.

1221
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:46,425
All right, Sam. You wouldn't ask if it
weren't important. Permission granted.

1222
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:49,870
I'll pick you and the Sergeant up
at your billet at 0200.

1223
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,367
Yes, sir.

1224
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:57,874
(HUMMING)

1225
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,775
Lieutenant Sam? Yeah.

1226
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:04,127
Any news?

1227
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:05,881
Yeah, we've got it.

1228
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:08,572
Tonight's the night. Hour is 0300.

1229
01:21:08,672 --> 01:21:10,324
Well, that cancels our soufflés.

1230
01:21:10,424 --> 01:21:13,052
No, but we've got to be back by 0100.

1231
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:15,308
Well, I'll shake a leg.

1232
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:18,374
It would've been nice if your papers
had come through.

1233
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,292
Yeah, that would've been great.

1234
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:23,837
I went by headquarters this morning
and they told me it takes a lot of time.

1235
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:25,464
Well, you know how it is.

1236
01:21:25,564 --> 01:21:29,410
You know, I sometimes think the Army
doesn't want people to get married.

1237
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:33,660
The ladies expect you, gentlemen.

1238
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:36,450
Beautiful, you're beautiful.

1239
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,144
I couldn't get you a mink coat
or a bag of diamonds today

1240
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:41,397
'cause they didn't have any in the PX,
so I got you these.

1241
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,024
- Oh, that's sweet of you, Britt.
- Well, I'm a very sweet fellow.

1242
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:46,151
- MRS. BLAIR: How are you, Sammy?
- He's not feeling well at all.

1243
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,820
All the way down the hill,
he didn't say a word.

1244
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,198
But I have a feeling that that chocolate
soufflé with those black-market eggs

1245
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:55,223
- is going to clear up his mind beautifully.
- You touch her, and I'll kill you.

1246
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:05,778
Tell her.

1247
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:12,845
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

1248
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:14,822
I talked to Corporal Lindsay today.

1249
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,144
He's not much
of a conversationalist, is he?

1250
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:21,587
Tell her!

1251
01:22:23,121 --> 01:22:25,107
You really want me to, Lieutenant?

1252
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,401
Like you thought it over real hard?

1253
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:28,878
Mon cheri...

1254
01:22:30,587 --> 01:22:31,634
What is wrong?

1255
01:22:32,256 --> 01:22:33,473
Monique.

1256
01:22:41,807 --> 01:22:43,855
Uh, I guess...

1257
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,029
I guess what Sam means is

1258
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,941
I'm not going to marry you, Monique.

1259
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:53,860
That's about it, I guess.

1260
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:04,796
You never even planned to, did you?

1261
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:09,459
You scum.

1262
01:23:10,002 --> 01:23:12,404
I don't like that word, coming from you.

1263
01:23:12,504 --> 01:23:14,256
Get out of my house.

1264
01:23:16,008 --> 01:23:17,351
Mrs. Blair?

1265
01:23:17,968 --> 01:23:20,287
On several occasions,
I've been engaged to marry,

1266
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:24,108
and on several occasions I've been not
engaged to marry, if you follow me.

1267
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:29,363
And a lot of these girls I wouldn't
take to a country club, but

1268
01:23:29,855 --> 01:23:32,859
with the exception of your daughter,
Mrs. Blair,

1269
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:35,073
all of them were white.

1270
01:23:38,864 --> 01:23:40,116
Sam, look,

1271
01:23:40,824 --> 01:23:42,226
you understand.

1272
01:23:42,326 --> 01:23:44,203
It was like a new kick for me.

1273

01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:02,429
(GRUNTS)

1277
01:24:04,389 --> 01:24:05,390
Sam!

1278
01:24:07,684 --> 01:24:08,919
Sam, she's gone!

1279
01:24:09,019 --> 01:24:10,316
I'll find her.

1280
01:25:01,905 --> 01:25:04,433
Captain, Captain,
it was I who rescued her.

1281
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,560
I was coming home slowly,
taking my leisure

1282
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,395
because it is so beautiful an evening,

1283
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:10,230
then I saw the girl running fast.

1284
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,441
At first, I think she's going
to a rendezvous,

1285
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,651
but then I recognize she's trying to jump.

1286
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:17,971
I was very close behind her,
but below are many rocks...

1287
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:23,885
Monique.

1288
01:25:25,762 --> 01:25:26,809
Monique, it's Sam.

1289
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:32,148
I'm your... Your friend, Monique.

1290
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,063
Monique.

1291
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:38,800
Go away.

1292
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,402

1295
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,554
When I saw Monique's face,

1296
01:26:42,714 --> 01:26:44,783
when I left her mother at the villa

1297
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:46,726
or when I got back.

1298
01:26:55,227 --> 01:26:56,900
Now, any questions?

1299
01:26:57,062 --> 01:26:58,255
No, sir.

1300
01:26:58,355 --> 01:27:01,404
I'm gonna have to take
your sidearm and your rifle.

01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:03,326
Sir?

1302
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:06,972
If you don't have weapons,
you'll hide instead of trying to shoot.

1303
01:27:07,072 --> 01:27:08,699
Now, you can carry your knives.

1304

Sam, you still with me?

1305
01:27:12,244 --> 01:27:14,463
Yes, sir, I'm still with you.

1306
01:27:24,756 --> 01:27:26,099
Good luck, Sam.

1307
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:27,534
Thank you, Colonel.

1310
01:28:02,127 --> 01:28:03,128
Uh...

1311
01:28:03,295 --> 01:28:05,172
It's a long way down this hill.

1312
01:28:06,006 --> 01:28:08,759
Shake hands with me, huh? What do you say?

1313
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:13,309
Sergeant, I'm going to kill you.

1314
01:28:13,471 --> 01:28:16,145
I don't know when or where or how,

1315
01:28:16,266 --> 01:28:17,643
but I'm going to kill you.

1316
01:28:21,438 --> 01:28:23,215
Sam, I'm not proud of what I did.

1317
01:28:23,315 --> 01:28:24,817
I apologize.

1318
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:28,178
Look, in a month, six weeks,
she won't even remember my name.

1319
01:28:28,278 --> 01:28:29,495
I'm going to kill you.

1320
01:28:34,826 --> 01:28:37,521
If you think I'm going on a mission
with a nut like you,

1321
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:39,464
you've got rocks in your head!

1322
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:41,900
I'll see that you get court-martialed...

1323

Desertion in the face of the enemy.

1324
01:28:44,461 --> 01:28:46,363
That'll be just dandy,

1325
01:28:46,463 --> 01:28:48,591
and, by God, I'll make it stick.

1326
01:28:50,175 --> 01:28:51,347
Now, get moving.

1327
01:28:55,055 --> 01:28:57,308
It works both ways, Lieutenant.

1328
01:28:58,016 --> 01:28:59,251
I'll give the Colonel your dog tags.

1329
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:01,545
I'll say, ah, "A sniper got him."

1330
01:29:01,645 --> 01:29:04,589
Or maybe I'll say,
"He stepped on a mine, sir. It was awful."

1331
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:07,092
It'd be a long time before
they found your body,

1332
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:08,660
and by then, who'd know?

1333
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:12,222
Listen, Lieutenant,
anybody you want me to write to?

1334
01:29:12,322 --> 01:29:13,869
Funny.

1335
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:16,038
Now, get moving!

1336
01:29:18,203 --> 01:29:20,438
Don't worry, you won't get it in the back.

1337
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:23,417
When I kill you, I want to see your face.

1338
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:25,210

would happen and I didn't...

with those tramps at the Negresco Club.

I'm not like you, Sam. That's all.

In fact, I

1384
01:35:40,793 --> 01:35:42,466
sort of envy you.

1385
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:48,100
I remember when I went to...

1386
01:35:48,926 --> 01:35:51,975
Went to one of
the several colleges I attended.

1387
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:55,517
I was asked to join a fraternity...

1388
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:57,543
One of those, uh, secret organizations

1389
01:35:57,643 --> 01:35:59,504
where they give you a secret handshake,

1390
01:35:59,604 --> 01:36:00,821
and then they

1391
01:36:01,898 --> 01:36:05,534
bend you over and then paddle
your fanny till you can't sit down.

1392
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:11,996
Well, I happened to overhear two of
my fraternity brothers talking one night.

1393
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:14,519
They were talking about me. One said...

1394
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:17,748
"Gee, that Britt.
Hmm, boy, he's got everything.

1400
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:31,511
"Yeah, that Britt, he's got everything,
except one thing.

you see something you want very badly,

1408
01:36:53,366 --> 01:36:55,101

1411
01:36:59,205 --> 01:37:01,754
"What do I have to give up to get it?"

1412
01:37:02,834 --> 01:37:03,881

"What do I have to say to get it?"

01:37:28,192 --> 01:37:30,136

01:40:49,602 --> 01:40:50,728
Sam!

1464
01:40:50,853 --> 01:40:52,105
Sam!

1465
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,074
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

1466
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:26,180
Brit!

1467
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:34,463
Oh.

1468
01:41:34,563 --> 01:41:36,065
(HEAVY BREATHING)

1469
01:41:36,982 --> 01:41:39,531
You thinking about Monique now, Britt?

1470
01:41:41,237 --> 01:41:43,160
You sorry now, Britt?

1471
01:41:48,536 --> 01:41:50,004
It's too damn late now, Britt.

1472
01:41:51,622 --> 01:41:53,124
It's too late.

1473
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:57,845
You're going to be all right, Sarge.

1474
01:41:58,796 --> 01:42:00,798
You're going to be fine.

1475
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:11,107
You know,

1476
01:42:12,435 --> 01:42:14,563
there's no satisfaction.

1477
01:42:59,690 --> 01:43:02,385
Don't wait for 0400! Don't wait for 0400!

1478
01:43:02,485 --> 01:43:04,095
They're getting out! They're moving out!

1479
01:43:04,195 --> 01:43:06,289
Give 'em everything you've got,
on the double, quick!

1480
01:43:09,742 --> 01:43:11,369
I'm on my way out.

1481
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:14,792
I'm all right.

1482
01:43:48,656 --> 01:43:50,766
SAM: When my outﬁt got
into the rubble the next day,

1483
01:43:50,866 --> 01:43:53,018
they found 13 people still breathing...

1484
01:43:53,118 --> 01:43:55,020
Twelve Germans and me,

1485
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:57,339
or what was left of me.

1486
01:44:03,754 --> 01:44:06,553
I was in the hospital in Paris
for seven months.

1487
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:12,184
When I got out, I had $4,967 in back pay,

1488
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:15,934
and I was one of the displaced.

1489
01:44:18,519 --> 01:44:21,739
I'd had two letters from Monique
while I was in the hospital.

1490
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,990
"Dear friend," the ﬁrst one began.

1491
01:44:24,108 --> 01:44:25,885
"I think of you often."

1492
01:44:25,985 --> 01:44:29,346
And at the end, she added,
almost as an afterthought,

1493
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:32,141
"I have met a soldier
named Harmer in Nice.

1494
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:34,685
"He said that Britt Harris was dead."

1495
01:44:34,785 --> 01:44:36,503
That was all.

1496
01:44:36,912 --> 01:44:39,290
I was glad she could write it like that.

1497
01:44:39,832 --> 01:44:42,255
The second letter was also short.

1498
01:44:42,626 --> 01:44:45,675
It merely said that her mother
had died the week of VE Day.

1499
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:48,866
I didn't answer the letters. I...

1500
01:44:48,966 --> 01:44:51,139
I didn't really know what to say.

1501
01:45:00,185 --> 01:45:02,563
And then one afternoon
as I took my ﬁrst sip

1502
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:05,341
of what must have been my 2,000th beer,

1503
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:08,820
I saw myself in the ring
the glass left on the table.

1504
01:45:08,986 --> 01:45:11,388
I realized then that I'd known
guys like me

1505
01:45:11,488 --> 01:45:13,474
left over from the ﬁrst war.

1506
01:45:13,574 --> 01:45:15,768
They got shot up
at the Battle of the Meuse

1507
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:19,168
and spent the next 20 years
brooding about it. I'd had it.

1508
01:45:23,876 --> 01:45:26,904
I went to the American Express
and sent a cable to my partner...

1509
01:45:27,004 --> 01:45:28,989
"Reporting back three weeks from today.

1510
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:32,013
"Meantime, taking small
sentimental journey."

1511
01:45:34,011 --> 01:45:36,730
The next morning I was in Villefranche.

1512
01:45:57,868 --> 01:45:59,711
DRIVER: Merci, monsieur.

1513
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:15,098
Are you the lieutenant of the top?

1514
01:46:15,844 --> 01:46:17,391
I am,

1515
01:46:19,056 --> 01:46:21,479
and you are Jean-Francois Duvan!

1516
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,585
Tsk-tsk.

1517
01:46:22,685 --> 01:46:23,627
You've grown.

1518
01:46:23,727 --> 01:46:25,570
I have become taller.

1519
01:46:26,063 --> 01:46:27,565
Yes, you have.

1520
01:46:32,403 --> 01:46:34,030
And you have lost one arm.

1521
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:38,434
So I have. I've never even missed it.

1522
01:46:38,534 --> 01:46:40,912
But one is enough for anybody, and beside,

1523
01:46:41,078 --> 01:46:43,672
the Army's going to make me
a brand new one.

1524
01:46:43,872 --> 01:46:46,170
Does the mademoiselle know you are here?

1525
01:46:46,709 --> 01:46:48,006
No.

1526
01:46:55,467 --> 01:46:57,094
I will find her.

1527
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:47,653
Hello, Sam.

1528
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,772
How are you, friend?

1529
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:53,258
I was sorry to hear about your mother.

1530
01:47:53,358 --> 01:47:55,452
Oh, she had a very good life.

1531
01:47:56,487 --> 01:47:57,613
What is all of this?

1532
01:47:58,072 --> 01:47:59,540
Oh, it is recess.

1533
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:02,393
All of this is a school for children

1534
01:48:02,493 --> 01:48:05,497
whose parents have been killed by the war.

1535
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:08,753
On the first day they are here,

1536
01:48:09,124 --> 01:48:11,923
I remind them of something
my mother told me.

1537
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:14,196
She said,

1538
01:48:14,296 --> 01:48:17,516
"Everyone in the world
has some kind of a burden,

1539
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:19,576
"but

1540
01:48:19,676 --> 01:48:21,974
"it is not the burden that's important.

1541
01:48:22,846 --> 01:48:24,940
"It's how you carry it."

1542
01:48:31,355 --> 01:48:32,572
Are you happy?

1543
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:34,816
Sometimes,

1544
01:48:35,025 --> 01:48:36,527
like most people.

1545
01:48:38,237 --> 01:48:40,660
Let me show you our classroom.

Today we have a visitor,

an American.

1551

His name is Lieutenant...

No,

Captain Sam Loggins.

1554
01:49:05,055 --> 01:49:06,540
In his honor,

1555
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,937
we shall sing a song.
