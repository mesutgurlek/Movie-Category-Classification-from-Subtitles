Afternoon, Parker.

2
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,734
Good afternoon, sir.

3
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,070
General Faversham
is waiting for you on the terrace.

4
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,655
Aye.

5
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,491
Dr. Sutton, sir.

6
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,536
You've had a long journey, Doctor.

7
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,581
Oh, it's worth a journey
to join old comrades.

8
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,125
- Are they all coming?
- Same crowd.

9
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,460
- A year older.
- Ah.

10
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,754
- Sit down. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,924
Well, what's the news from London?

12
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,384
Well, haven't you heard?

13
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,221
Gordon's dead.
Murdered in Khartoum.

14
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,724
That's no news to me.

15
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,895
I said that was going to happen years ago
when they first sent Gordon to Egypt.

16
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,314
He wasn't hard enough.

17
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,900
They wanted someone like you
out there.

18
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,444
Just what I was going to say myself.

19
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,530
First time for a hundred years
there hasn't been a Faversham in the army...

20
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,241
and look at the mess they make.

21
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,119
I'm too old, the boy's too young.

22
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,247
Me own fault for not marrying sooner.

23
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,874
You remember the boy.

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,209
He's 15 years old today.

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,796
I'm going to let him dine with us tonight.

26
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,258
- Oh, good.
- I don't mind telling you, I'm worried about him.

27
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,218
- Oh?
- I can't understand the boy.

28
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,596
I send him to the best
army school in England...

29
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,599
spend half me time telling him
about his famous ancestors...

30
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,059
and what do you think?

31
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,311
I found him this morning
reading a poetry book!

32
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
Shelley, of all people!

33
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,901
So I want you to help me
lick this boy into shape and make him hard.

Ah, war was war in those days
and men were men.

No room for weaklings.

Balaclava, for instance.

44
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,262
Here. You fellows
remember the positions.

45
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,516
Now here, these nuts...

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,810
were the Russians.

47
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,772
Guns, guns, guns.

48
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,525
On the right,
the British infantry.

49
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,738
The thin red line.
There was the commander in chief.

50
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,534
And here was l...

51
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,953
at the head of the old 68th.

52
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,373
The right was impossible.
The left was blocked.

53
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,834
Behind us was the commander in chief.

54
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,294
I realized the position in a flash.

55
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,964
I said, "The 68th will move forward."

56
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,426
Immediately one of my subalterns
came to me shaking.

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Absolutely shaking!

58
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,888
I said, "What's wrong, Travers?"

59
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,600
Said, "I'm afraid to face those guns, sir."

60
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,770
I said, "Would you rather face me?"

61
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,940
Hmph! He took one look at my face
and off he went.

62
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,901
Ten minutes later he was shot to pieces
at the head of his men.

63
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,653
As a soldier should be, eh?

64
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,655
[Faversham]
I quite agree with you, General.

65
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,535
I can tolerate nerves before a battle,
but I can't stand cowardice.

66
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,080
I remember a soldier at Inkerman
when a Cossack charged down on him.

67
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,877
I saw a man raise his musket,
fumble with his trigger, then turn and run.

68
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,337
The Cossack's lance went in
at the back of his neck...

69
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,089
and came out in his throat.

70
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,134
Best thing that could have happened to him.
Do you remember Wilmington?

71

- Wilmington?
- Fine old service family.

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,805
Father killed at Inkerman...

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,434
grandfather blown up under Nelson
and an uncle scalped by Indians.

- [Men Murmuring Agreement]
- [Faversham] What happened?

76
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,025
Well, the general ordered him
to gallop through the lines with a message.

77
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,695
Paralyzed with funk.
Couldn't move.

78
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,989
General sent his adjutant.

79

Killed before he'd gone 50 yards.

80
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,744
Sent his A.D.C.- head blown off.

81
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,289
Then he went through with
the message himself- lost his arm.

82
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,958
- Ruined his cricket.
- Oh, yes, I remember now.

83
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,377
He disgraced his family.

84
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,338
His father disowned him.

85
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,299
Hung about for a year or two,
then blew his brains out.

86

Ah, he had the courage
to blow his brains out.

You can't take her with you, you know.

Shouldn't be surprised.

- That's all right, Peter.

points why I don't love Mr. "B."

Oh, I put down
about 40 reasons altogether.

Reason 41 was,
she loves the other man.

I should have taken this action

I only accepted a commission
for my father's sake...

because all his family have been soldiers.

I have a mission to reach the army
of General Kitchener.

500
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,098
I want your help
to disguise me as a native.

How then can a doctor help you,
except to certify you as mad?

506
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,615
I'm told there is a native tribe
called the Sangali...

507
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,617
that once revolted against the Khalifa.

508
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,120
And in revenge the Khalifa branded them,
cut out their tongues from their heads...

509
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,664
and made them outcasts.

510

- All men know the brand of the Sangali.

Then you understand
the reason of my visit, Doctor.

512
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,173
But, my dear young man,
you will miss your tongue in many ways.

513
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,343
I will keep my tongue.
No one will look for it if I'm branded.

I can stain your skin...

You know what the situation is.

526
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,652
The main army and provision ships
must get up the Nile.

527

It's the only feasible route
up country towards Omdurman.

528
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,949
But the river's blocked
by the Khalifa's army...

529
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,619
and our ships
can't get through the gorge.

530
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:31,457
Now, the Khalifa must be drawn away,

Yes, sir.

Now, if one of our brigades

he'd have to turn away and face it.

- Yes, sir.

I don't understand, Doctor.

He left England for one purpose only.

805

If he succeeded, he said
that you would learn by means...

that would need no explanation.

807

then he asked me to let you know...

If I heard nothing for a year...

Is it true? We've got Khartoum?

It's just come through. Kitchener broke
the Dervishes's army at Omdurman.

Heine, the German specialist,
was there too.

Nice fellow, that German.
Took a lot of trouble.

You needn't tell me the verdict, Doctor.
I quite understand.

I think it's what you expected, John.

I'm certain
I should have felt it there.

sometimes comes...

01:45:57,309 --> 01:46:00,270
from a lesion
that can be repaired by operation.

If I had known from the start
it was hopeless...

I'd probably have blown my brains out.

the British would be destroyed.

had ignored that silly rot and fought -

and faced death to do so...

I've just had some splendid news.

I've been to a famous German eye doctor...

1235

I've got that, John.

1238
01:50:57,443 --> 01:51:00,570
It means a long course of treatment
in Germany...

1239
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:02,655
and I leave tomorrow.

1240
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:07,535
When I can see again,
I shall return to the army...

1241

01:51:16,712 --> 01:51:18,838
I'll sign it myself.

1245
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,177
And add a postscript.

1246
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:27,055
PS:

1247
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:30,808
Just heard the splendid news
of Peter and Willoughby...

1248
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:33,978
and Harry Faversham.

1249
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:38,066
I enclose a little souvenir
of a journey through the desert...

1250
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:40,485
with a dumb Sangali native.

1251
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:45,073
If you'll give him the chance
that he deserves...

1252
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,617
you'll find he's not...

1253
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,827
as mute...

1254
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:51,913
as I thought he was.

1255
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:55,083
That's all.

1256
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,793
[Joe]
Your bags are packed, sir.

1257
01:51:56,877 --> 01:51:59,212
There's just time for a bite of dinner
if you hurry.

1258
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:02,799
All right, Joe.
We're not going after all.

1259
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,511
I -

1260
01:52:07,513 --> 01:52:11,641
I still say the army of today
is soft compared with our day.

1261
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:13,935
Soft! That's your trouble.

1262
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:15,937
Still, you did your best...

1263
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:18,689
and as Harry has made you two young rascals
take your feathers back...

1264
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:21,818
well, he'd better marry the girl
and have done with it, eh, Doc, hmm?

1265
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:24,946
It's not as easy as all that.
There's my feather too.

1266
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,282
What deed of reckless daring
are you going to do...

1267
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:30,660
to make me take back my feather?

1268
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:32,412
Must l?

1269
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:34,956
Deeds of reckless twaddle.

1270
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,458
Stuff and nonsense.
No such thing nowadays.

1271
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:40,837
All you boys had to do
was deal with Fuzzy-Wuzzy.

1272
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:42,922
But the Crimea was different.

1273
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:44,966
War was war in those days.

1274
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,759
No room for weaklings.

1275
01:52:46,844 --> 01:52:49,554
- Take Balaclava, for instance.
- [Dr. Sutton] Ah.

1276
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:52,932
Of course, you fellows wouldn't
remember the position, but it was this -

1277
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:54,684
Ah, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1278
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:56,769
Here were the Russians.

1279
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:59,063
Guns. Guns. Guns.

1280
01:52:59,148 --> 01:53:02,191
On the right, the British infantry.

1281
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:04,944
One moment, sir.

1282
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:08,281
Your famous account of Balaclava's
not accurate, you know.

1283
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,576
- Not -
- Not accurate, sir.

1284
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,495
Not accurate?

1285
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:17,665
No, sir.
Let me recall the position.

1286
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:20,418
Out of the way, Peter.

1287
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:22,670
Here are the Russians,
behind the walnuts.

1288
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,672
Guns. Guns. Guns.

1289
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:27,800
Here's the British Infantry.

1290
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:29,802
The thin red line.

1291
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:33,347
Here's the commander in chief.

1292
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:36,434
And here are you...

1293
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:40,021
at the head of the old 68th, correct?

1294
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,148
Absolutely.

1295
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:45,026
You were riding a horse called Caesar,
which my father sold you...

1296
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,029
because, fine horseman though he was,
he could never hold him himself.

1297
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:51,532
Quite right. Quite right.
[Chuckles]

1298
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:53,534
Then, according to your story, you said...

1299
01:53:53,619 --> 01:53:55,536
"The 68th will move forward."

1300
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:58,164
Quite right. Quite right.

1301
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,999
Yes, sir.
The trouble is, you never said it.

1302
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:03,544
- Ne -
- You never said it, sir.

1303
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:08,758
- Never said it?
- No, sir. You never had time.

1304
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,427
At that moment,
my father told me, Caesar -

1305
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:13,971
uh, Caesar - Caesar...

1306
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,184
startled by a stray bullet,
took the bit between his teeth...

1307
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:19,894
and dashed straight
at the Russian lines.

1308
01:54:19,978 --> 01:54:22,104
Away went Caesar, away went you,
away went the 68th...

1309
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:24,357
away went the commander in chief,
away went everybody...

1310
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:27,693
and another magnificent mistake was added
to an already magnificent record.

1311
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:30,071
But nobody ever said,
"The 68th will move forward."

1312
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,366
Unless it was the horse.

1313
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:35,409
Come on, sir. Own up.

1314
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:39,372
Well, well, well, well, after all these years, it's
rather difficult to remember all the details...

1315
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,541
but... confound the boy!

1316
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,085
I shall never be able
to tell that story again!

1317
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:46,170
- [Laughter]
- Ethne, your feather.
