154
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:23,808
You know. It's logical.

155
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,811
Psycho.

156
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,313
I'm familiar with the word, Colonel.

157
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,984
Oh, of course.

158
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:35,317
I'd like to get started
in the morning, first thing.

159
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,619
Well, let me get the billeting
on that for you.

160
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:41,320
Uh, Radar, uh, would you, uh...

161
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,364
- Capt. Hildebrand is gonna spend a day...
- Or two.

162
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:48,367
Or two. He's gonna spend some time
with us before he leaves.

163
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,836
- Yes, sir.
- Please assign him to the V.D. Tent.

164
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:54,271
- I mean, the P.I.B. Tent.
- Follow me, sir.

165
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,275
Uh, the P.I.V. Tent. The P...

166
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,739
- <i>[Hildebrand] Colonel?</i>
- Yo.

167
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,748
Remember, Colonel...

168
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,584
Not a word.
You have my word.

169
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,178
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,828
Hawkeye?

171
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,456
Captain?

172
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,559
She seemed more like
a lieutenant to me.

173
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:25,104
Captain, it's me, Radar.
You've got to get up.

174
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:28,801
Get out of here, Radar,
or I'll sever every nerve in your butt.

175
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,868
It's Col. Blake.
He says it's urgent.

176
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,879
What is it, a patient?

177
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,472
No, just the colonel.
He needs you in the shower.

178
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,576
You think he'd be old enough
to know where everything is.

179
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,247
All I know is he says it's important.

180
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,959
Trapper?

181
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,063
Trapper?

182
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,064
- Trap...
- [Gasping]

183
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:02,836
Look, okay.
I know it's dumb to be in here.

184
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,744
<i>But Clayton sent</i>
<i>this joker Hildebrand to spy on us.</i>

185
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:09,715
And I figured the shower
was the safest place to meet. Right?

186
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,149
Absolutely.
Nobody ever comes in here.

187
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,585
- To cover our voices.
- [Loudly] What?

188
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:18,750
- To cover our...
- You got a case of galloping paranoia.

189
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,760
Never mind.
Now look.

190
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,695
I'm the only one who knows
this guy's a psychiatrist.

191
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:26,426
And you still got the guts
to wear that?

192
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,196
Pierce, can you lay off the wisecracks
for just five minutes?

193
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,262
Oh, he always acts funny
in a men's shower.

194
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,741
Look, what I'm asking you guys is...
make that commanding.

195
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,301
- Keep it asking.
- It's to for pete sakes...

196
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,543
stop acting like a couple of horse's
patoots while Hildebrand is here.

197
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,949
Or sure as God made little green apples,
he's gonna break us up.

198
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,318
<i>And I don't think any of us</i>
<i>really want that to happen.</i>

199
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,325
I mean, as screwy as this outfit is,
better the devil you know, right?

200
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,065
- You've got our word, Henry. Right?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,964
- Promise?
- Promise.

202
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,126
Thanks.

203
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,636
Henry? Your fly is closed.

204
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,109
- <i>[Houlihan] Yes?</i>
- Major?

205
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,645
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- It's me, Henry Blake.

206
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:17,309
- <i>Just a minute. Go.</i>
- <i>[Objects Clattering]</i>

207
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,750
<i>Come in, Colonel.</i>

208
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,548
Hi.

209
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:25,319
Uh, we were just going over
tomorrow's duty roster.

210
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:26,825
The one on my desk?

211
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:28,759
He means
yesterday's duty roster tomorrow.

212
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,026
Never mind.
I've got something serious to discuss.

213
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,033
- Sir...
- What is it...

214
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,763
A Capt. Hildebrand showed up today
from Headquarters in Seoul.

215
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:40,398
He's a psychiatrist,
and he's here on Clayton's orders.

216
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,932
Now, it is my guess that
someone in this unit has been...

217
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:47,003
rat-finking to the general
on the sly.

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,538
It wasn't me.
Anyway, it was my duty to.

219
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,757
There is nothing wrong with reporting
the unmilitary posture of your command.

220
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,350
Just let me remind you,
Mrs. MacArthur,

221
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:02,520
that if this unit gets split up,

222
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:05,588
it might just happen
that we <i>all</i> get split up.

223
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,466
Which means that you and Burns will have
to stop practicing medicine together.

224
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:13,165
And whatever else it is
you've been practicing.

225
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,642
- Sir... I'm sorry.
- What the hell...

226
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:25,378
- Everything's taken care of.
- Good.

227
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,785
Everybody's agreed to behave themselves
in front of Capt. Hildebrand...

228
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:32,292
- and make the place look real G.I.
- Very, very good.

229
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,486
- I want every golf club out.
- I took all golf clubs and hid them.

230
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,859
- Sew the hole in the shower.
- I sewed the hole in the nurses' tent.

231
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,262
And I took Klinger's bras
and I burned them.

237
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,967
- What is that?
- This motel is surrounded by soldiers.

238
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,873
It's disgusting that you sleep
in your underwear.

239
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:17,740
It beats sleeping in yours.

240
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,742
We're all gonna make nice
for Capt. Hildebrand today,

241
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,750
but don't push us.

242
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,244
Well, a shave wouldn't be a bad start.

243
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,312
You both look more like bums
than doctors.

244
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,258
Actually, I was thinking
of becoming a bum doctor,

245
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,318
but the proctology class was full.

246
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,422
Ha, ha, ha.

247
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:53,440
- What is that?
- "What is that" what, Frank?

248
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:58,349
Why is someone's appendix in this boot?

249
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,580
Because the other one
is full of tonsils.

250
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:11,053
Uh, Captain?
Captain Hildebrand, good morning.

251
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,066
- Good morning.
- How about breakfast?

252
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,364
It's how a very typical day
starts here.

253
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:19,099
- Good idea.

There we go. Pierce, Mclntyre,
I'd like you to meet Capt. Hildebrand.

263
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:54,167
- He's here to, um, to observe.
- Your surgical technique.

264
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,403
Oh, really?
You got a specialty?

265
00:15:56,477 --> 00:16:00,004
- Uh, gynecology.
- Nose and throat.

266
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,072
Well, you were close, Henry.

267
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:06,244
Uh, mind if we join you?

268
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,254
We were going to join the nurses.

269
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,517
Yeah, we were going to join them
and make one big nurse.

- Plenty of room for everyone.
- Thanks, pal.

273
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:24,362
Could I have the salt
down there, buddy?

274
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:28,101
Listen, could you take it easy with the
"buddy" talk? I've got a weak stomach.

275
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,406
Thanks.

276
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:33,345
Oh, uh, Maj. Burns, general surgeon,

277
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:37,009
Capt. Hildebrand,
nose, throat and bloomers.

278
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:40,986
Hey, Frank. I took a look at that kid
whose bowel you resected this morning.

279
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,114
That was some job.

280
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,159
- What was wrong with it?
- Not a thing!

281
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:48,093
You ought to put your monogram on that
scar, Frank. That was a thing of beauty.

282
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:51,029
Well, I don't like to brag,
but that is my specialty.

<i>Oh, I mean to tell you. One look, and</i>
<i>I can see your hand all over that gut.</i>

00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,994
Uh, Colonel,
may I have the butter, please?

285
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,702
- Henry? The butter.
- Hmm?

286
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,541
Oh, here you go, "Piercelntyre."

- <i>Isn't that right, Trap?</i>
- We're gonna open our own clinic.

290
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,486
That's right. The three of us
war buddies would run the place.

291
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,326
Frank would park the cars.

292
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,865
Great, great leg-pullers, these guys.

293
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:39,008
Is there room for one more?

294
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,640
Well, Capt. Hildebrand,
this is Maj. Houlihan.

295
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,877
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.
- Delighted to meet you.

296
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:46,249
She's our head nurse.
Best one in Korea.

297
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,050
Every nurse I've ever known
takes a backseat to the major.

298
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,055
Thank you.

299
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:53,525
And you're talking to a man who's
taken a lot of nurses into backseats.

300
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:56,085
- Miz Scarlet.
- Thank you, Captain Pierce.

301
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:59,098
Pass the butter, will you, Pierce?

302
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,100
