he was looking for us.

153
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,792
<i>[Allen] Frigate? I tell you, if she</i>
<i>was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.</i>

154
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,264
It was an unfair match. There was no
dishonor in it. No dishonor at all.

155
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,528
She was more like a ship of the line,
a two-decker, more than a frigate!

156
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,969
You have to wonder about the nature
of her hull. Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

157
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,667
Triple-shotted at 200 yards,
and our guns had no effect.

158
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,870
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

159
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,176
What is the "weather gauge"?

160
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,307
Shall I show you again,
Stephen?

161
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,978
Not on the cloth.

162
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,817
It means she had
the wind in her favor.

163
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,050
Therefore,
control of the engagement.

164
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,390
<i>And she had the longer guns,</i>
<i>which meant she could hit us</i>
<i>beyond our effective range.</i>

165
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,555
The simple fact is
we were soundly beaten.

166
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,796
Heavy frigate like that
in the Pacific...

167
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,702
Could tip the balance of war
in Napoleon's favor.

168
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,403
<i>By comparison, the</i> Surprise
<i>is a somewhat aged man-of-war.</i>

169

- Would you call me
an aged man-of-war, Doctor?

170

<i>The</i> Surprise <i>is not old.</i>
<i>No one would call her old.</i>

171
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,324
She has a bluff bow,
lovely lines.

172
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,556
She's a fine sea bird...
weatherly, stiff and fast.

173
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,031
Very fast,
if she's well handled.

174
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,159
No, she's not old.

175

176

<i>Well, we can patch up</i>
<i>the main and mizzen.</i>

177
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,236
The foresail's too far gone,
I'm afraid, so we'll bend our spare.

We're not going home.

180
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,559
But to refit
we need a port...

181
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,392
<i>and the</i> Acheron
<i>may be still looking for us.</i>

182

We can refit at sea.
Here, we're at shoals.

183

As you said, Mr. Allen...

184
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,770
she is taking the war to the South Seas,
and we are supposed to stop her.

185
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:15,780
But, sir, with respect,
she's a vastly heavier ship.

186

187

<i>She could be halfway to Cape Horn</i>
<i>by the time we're repaired and underway.</i>

188

Well, then, there's not

Excuse me, sir,
but Mr. Blakeney said that...

330
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,160
you served under Lord Nelson
at the Nile.

331
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,099
Indeed.
I was a young lieutenant...

332
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,329
not much older
than you are now.

333
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,498
And Mr. Pullings... Mr. Pullings
was a sniveling midshipman...

334
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,508
still yearning
for hearth and home.

- [Chuckling]
- <i>[Calamy] Did you meet him, sir?</i>

Can you tell me
what he's like?

337
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,775
I have had the honor
of dining with him twice.

338
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,717
He spoke to me
on both occasions.

339
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,311
A master tactician and
a man of singular vision.

340
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,756
Well, he always said
in battle:

341
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,327
"Never mind the maneuvers.
Just go straight at 'em."

342
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,559
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

343
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,658
He's England's only hope
if Old Bony intends to invade.

344
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,136
Sir, might we press you
for a anecdote?

345
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,270
The first time
that he spoke to me...

346
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,779
I shall never forget
his words.

347
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,577
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

348
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:11,849
He leaned across the table, he looked me
straight in the eye and he said...

349
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,050
"Aubrey, may I trouble you
for the salt?"

350

[Laughter]

351
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,959
I've always tried
to say it exactly...

352
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,397
as he did ever since.

353
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,172
The s...

354
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,172
The second time...

355
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,675
The second time,
he told me a story...

356
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,576
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

357
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,775
<i>And he said no,</i>
<i>he didn't need it</i>...

358
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,148
that he was quite warm.

359
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,278
His zeal for king and country
kept him warm.

360
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:51,520
I know it sounds absurd, and were it
from another man you'd cry out...

361
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,396
"Oh, what pitiful stuff,"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

362
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,469
But with Nelson...

363
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,204
you felt your heart glow.

364
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,047
Wouldn't you say,
Mr. Pullings?

365
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,483
You did indeed, sir.

366
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:19,113
Well, then, he would seem to be the
exception to the rule that authority corrupts.

367
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,992
- <i>[Mowett] To Lord Nelson.</i>
- To Lord Nelson.

368
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,064
[All]

370
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,599

Neither. There's not a scrap
of difference between them.

373
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,369

Well, then, if you're going to push me.

378
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,126

00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,082
Your first command.

450
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,830
<i>[Howard] Quickly, now,</i>
<i>or she'll be on top of us!</i>

451
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,800
<i>[Hollar] Take the weight</i>
<i>on the yard tackles!</i>

452
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,167
<i>Fend her off!</i>
<i>Fend her off!</i>

453
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,797
Lower away on the main!

454
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,615
- I wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

455
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:37,599
There's a painter, bo. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

456
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,101
<i>[Mowett] Lively now. We've got</i>
<i>10 minutes before he's up with us.</i>

457
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,469
<i>[Allen] Lively, lads. Lively.</i>
<i>We've precious little time.</i>

458
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,946
<i>Mind what the captain</i>
<i>told you.</i>

459
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,947
- <i>[Hollar] Pull, boys!</i>
- <i>That's it.</i>

460
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:57,544
<i>Pull on the larboard line there.</i>
<i>Line her up. Line her up!</i>

461
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,539
Now.

462
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,146
Killick, there!
Douse your light!

463
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,080
- Mr. Allen, make ready.
- <i>[Cannon Blast]</i>

[Grunting, Panting]

465
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,794
Hello.
We caught a fish!

466
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,302
- [Coughing]
- <i>[Jack] Take the helm, Bonden.</i>

467
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,896
- Now tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,600
Hard a'larboard!

469
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,702
Stand the men down,
Mr. Pullings.

470
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,971
- I'll take this watch.
- <i>[Cannon Blasts Continue]</i>

471
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,277
Aye, sir. Mr. Mowett, Mr. Allen,
calmly now.

472
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,342
- You know his orders.
- Well done, sir.

473
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,722
<i>She's a right phantom,</i>
<i>she is.</i>

474
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,918
The way she come up again,
right behind us like that.

475
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,291
<i>Out of nowhere,</i>
<i>and right behind us.</i>

476
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,524
Like that first time
out of the fog...

477
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,965
with our shot
bouncin' off her.

478
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,004
Captain's not called
Lucky Jack for no reason.

479
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,335
Phantom or no,
she's a privateer...

480
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,341
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

481
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,105
You need more than luck
against a phantom.

482
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,150
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

483
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,878
Oh, no.
If they were...

484
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,649
we could hang them
when we catch 'em.

485
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,656
<i>[Nagle] Privateer gets a piece of paper</i>

<i>that bears our flag.</i>

487
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:54,227
They go after rich merchantmen
and the like.

488
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,323
Hey, but think on our share
of the prize money.

489
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,698
<i>She'll be loaded with gold...</i>

490
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,136
and ambergris
and all the gems of Araby.

491
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,800
<i>That's all very well, Nagle.</i>
<i>Gotta get home to spend it.</i>

492
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,072
But I never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

493
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,138
- And I've never met a live one
you've bought one for neither.
- [Laughter]

494

[Sighs]
That's the last of the coffee too.

496
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,792
Thank you, Killick.

497
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,230
Bonden?

498
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,097
That's enough easting.
Set a course south-southwest.

499
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,571
Aye, sir.
South-southwest.

- Foul! Foul!

506
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,972
You got away before me!

507
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,708
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

508
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,516
- Have the idlers placed along the rails.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,586
In all my years,
I've never seen the like.

510
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:27,555
It has to be more than 100 sea miles,
and he brings us up on his tail.

511
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:31,890
That's seamanship, Mr. Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

512

- <i>I told you the plan would work, Will.</i>
- <i>Thank God you're right.</i>

- We'll have them by nightfall, I think.
- I think we've got him, sir.

<i>[Calamy]</i>
<i>And the wind favors us this time.</i>

515

Now, don't count your eggs before
they're in the pudding, Mr. Calamy.

516
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,601
<i>Still, if we can close this gap</i>
<i>and get up behind her...</i>

That's 12 knots?
That's good.
