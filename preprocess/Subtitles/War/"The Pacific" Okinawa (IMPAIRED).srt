1
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,188
(theme music playing)

2
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,937
(men speaking)

3
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,786
I could settle for something
to eat right now.

4
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,538
This looks like
fucking poo.

5
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,790
Always replacing
the army.

6
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,294
- (man shouts)
- Smitty, Burke, let's go! Move!

7
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,798
- Son of a bitch.
- Let's go!

8
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,967
(baby crying)

9
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,848
(people speaking
Japanese)

10
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,879
Are those
Jap prisoners?

11
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,799
- No.
- On account of we don't take prisoners.

12
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,759
(explosion)

13
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,263
Hey, take it easy.

14
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,057
- That's outgoing.
- (explosions)

15
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,269
- They're Okinawans.
- They look like Japs.

16
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,521
Shut the fuck up, Kathy.

17
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,481
Don't you hear good?

18
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,817
- They're Okinawites.
- Fuck off.

19
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,777
(plane engines roaring)

20
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,322
- What you say, boot?
- The name's Peck... Tony Peck.

21
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,785
Hey, Pecker, let me see that photo
of your wife Kathy again.

22
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,579
- She's gorgeous.
- Thanks.

23
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,582
I need something
to jerk-off to.

24
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,128
She's perfect.
"Oh, Kathy.

25
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,130
Oh, Kathy.

26
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,425
Harder. Harder!"

27
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,261
(both speak Japanese)

28
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,397
- Shit.
- The new ponchos are full of chemicals.

29
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,901
- Chemicals, huh?
- What chemicals?

30
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,903
They done treat 'em
with all kinds of chemicals.

31
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,574
That shit'll make you sick...
real real sick.

32
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,327
- I didn't hear that.
- Yeah, you think they're gonna tell you?

33
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,414
Here, take mine.

34
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,875
Okay, thanks.

35
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,050
Semper fi.

36
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,641
Burgin:
Well, look what we've got here.

37
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,435
I thought you didn't
take prisoners.

38
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,937
Those are
army prisoners, boot.

39
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,985
- (spits)
- (mimicking monkey)

40
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,363
You fucking monkeys.

41
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,951
Dirty little Nips.

42
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,956
- (spits)
- (yells in Japanese)

43
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,417
Snafu:
Out of the way, Hirohito.

44
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,799
Move, you slant-eyed
bastard. Move!

45
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,343
- Man: Shoot him!
- Sit down.

46
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,512
- Move!
- Sit down!

47
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,765
- (marines yelling)
- Do it! Fucking do it!

48
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,767
- Do it!
- Fucking shoot him!

49
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,936
(speaking Japanese)

50
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,648
- Move!
- Sit the fuck down!

51
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,777
- Sit the fuck down!
- You can't mistreat these men.

52
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,029
They're protected
by the Geneva Conventions.

53
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,448
- Fuck the Geneva Code!
- Mac: Hey hey!

54
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,159
- What's the hold up?
- These men attacked my prisoners.

55
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,994
I want his rank
and serial number!

56
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,288
- Get your hands off of him.
- Man: Oh, come on!

57
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,875
I command these men.
I'll take care of them.

58
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,294
Do you speak Japanese?

59
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,004
I'm an intelligence officer.

60
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,216
Right. Well, maybe you should use
your fucking intelligence

61
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,759
and get these people
off the trail.

62
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,553
(prisoner crying)

63
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,559
You hit another Japanese prisoner,
I'll have you court-martialed.

64
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,773
- (man #2 yells)
- (explosion)

65
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,942
(machine guns firing)

66
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,654
Man #3: Cover!
Head for cover!

67
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,742
Come on, let's go!

68
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,789
Look out for the leg!

69
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,249
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

70
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,793
Get that radio set up!

71
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,795
Right now!
In here!

72
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,965
Let's go! Mortars over here!
Let's go go!

73
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,010
Stay down!
Stay down!

74
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,638
- Get that gun set up!
- You're the officer relieving us?

75
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,056
I'm the CO
of K company,

76
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,100
- 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines!
- Stay down!

77
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,103
We couldn't hold 'em!
The Japs are dug in deep!

78
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,189
We lost a lot
of good men out there!

79
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,692
- Where's the rest of your company?
- This is it!

80
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,569
You're gonna need
more than that!

81
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,613
Stumpy:
Like I said, this is it!

82
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,198
All right, Mac,
get them up the hill!

83
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,034
Go! Let's go!
Let's go! Go!

84
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,786
- Stumpy: Move move!
- (explosion)

85
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,706
Let's go, people!
Move it up there!

86
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,584
- (gunfire continues)
- Move out! Move it!

87
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,962
- Move it along!
- Get up the hill! Move it!

88
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,008
Let's go!
Get up there!

89
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,178
Everybody up!
Keep moving!

90
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,014
First and second squad!

91
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,184
Second squad here!
Hamm! Hamm!

92
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,020
- Hamm, over here!
- Come on!

93
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,855
Stumpy:
Stay with me! Get down!

94
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,233
Set up the mortar
base plate too!

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,778
First squad...
first squad here!

96
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,155
Stay the fuck down!

97
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,783
- Hanging.
- Fire!

98
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,993
(man yells)

99
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,790
- Burgin: Come on, move!
- Shit. Let's go.

100
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,167
Lock it in there.
Make sure this is straight.

101
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,294
- Snafu: Hurry the fuck up!
- Come on, boys. Come on.

102
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,797
We're not on level
ground yet. Come on.

103
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,715
- Hanging.
- Fire!

104
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,842
- (hissing)
- (rain pattering)

105
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,970
(machine guns firing)

106
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,525
You're gonna drown in that hole without
a trench for the runoff.

107
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,443
Huh?

108
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,449
Put a small hole at the bottom.
It helps with the drainage.

109
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,414
Don't know why you bother.
They'll be dead in a few days.

110
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,583
Don't want
to know their names.

111
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,795
My name is Hamm...
H-A, two Ms.

112
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,256
Just use it
to get my attention.

113
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,925
Hamm with two Ms.

114
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,387
Now I've got
to forget something.

115
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,765
I need some long thin ones.

116
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,519
- Try this.
- I've got one.

117
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,941
Hey, Kathy. Give me those ready rounds.
Break out some more.

118
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,871
(pounding)

119
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,365
- (wood cracks)
- Holy hell.

120
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,866
Snafu:
Jesus Christ!

121
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,911
What the fuck
is that stench?!

122
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,205
- Sledge: Shit.
- (Hamm coughs)

123
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,791
Unbelievable.

124
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,001
Start digging.

125
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,339
- Snafu: Fucking horseshit.
- Sledge: Oh, man.

126
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,759
Mac: What are
you doing, Private?

127
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,804
Holes are supposed
to be five yards apart.

128
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,390
Sir, there's a dead body
in there.

129
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,767
The whole island's
a graveyard.

130
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,728
Get in your hole
and start digging.

131
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,318
Man: Send him down
another 15 yards!

132
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,288
How come the Japs are buried
and our guys aren't?

133
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,335
- (flare hissing)
- (gunfire continues)

134
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,796
Fire mission 16!
Fire mission!

135
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,841
- Sledge: Fire mission!
- Burgin: Gun one, fire!

136
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,762
Gun three, fire HE
for effect on the pre-plots!

137
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,472
Hanging!

138
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,934
- Fire!
- (distant explosions)

139
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,187
- Short round!
- Both: Short round!

140
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,106
Short round!
Short round!

141
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,941
Shit.

142
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,944
Let's go. Try again.

143
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,364
Hanging.

144
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,120
- Fuck!
- Misfire!

145
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,788
Misfire!

146
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,750
- It's hot.
- Clear it.

147
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,087
Easy.

148
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,923
- (mortar rattles)
- Got it.

149
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,851
- Man: Check the water!
- Try again?

150
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,312
No, our fucking rounds
are all wet.

151
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,647
(gunfire continues)

152
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,319
Keep firing, God damn it!
Pour it on!

153
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,863
Our rounds are wet!

154
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,783
Get more then!
There's ammo up the road!

155
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,076
- Go!
- Man: Hanging!

156
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,954
- Man #2: Fire!
- Let's go.

157
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,334
Dice, Hamm, with me.

158
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,962
You stay here!

159
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,427
Man #3: Open up!
Up the rate of fire!

160
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,346
- Let's go!
- (men yelling)

161
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,525
Let's go.

162
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,698
- What do you need?
- We need 60 mortars... HE.

163
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,957
Friendlies coming in!

164
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,793
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

165
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,549
(people yelling
in Japanese)

166
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,027
- Hey! That kid's still alive!
- Get down.

167
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,155
- Get down.
- That kid's still alive!

168
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,340
- Man: Covering fire!
- Let's go.

169
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,936
- Dice!
- Sledge: He's dead. Keep moving.

170
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,778
(man #2 yells)

171
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,781
- Hanging!
- Man #3: Fire!

172
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,783
- Hanging two!
- Fire!

173
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,954
- Hanging three!
- Fire!

174
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,584
(men yelling)

175
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,076
- (distant explosions)
- (man shouting)

176
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,790
Why aren't we
giving them safe passage?

177
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,708
What are you
talking about?

178
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,710
The civilians.

179
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,632
We should be
giving them safe conduct.

180
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,926
A lot of them are
helping the Nips, Hamm.

181
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,054
That family wasn't.

182
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,558
Only thing that matters
up here is killing Japs.

183
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,895
Man:
Get this gear, Gavanoff.

184
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,488
You know, the first time
you see someone get killed...

185
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,159
it's something.

186
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,495
You get used to it.

187
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,957
I was 15.

188
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,628
A buddy and I were hopping
subway cars in Brooklyn.

189
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,755
We went through a tunnel that was
a little bit too small.

190
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,008
I fractured my skull.
He, uh...

191
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,759
his brains
and bones got spread

192
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,761
all over
my face and chest.

193
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,057
You never ever forget
something like that.

194
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,103
Good thing your damn head
is so fucking hard.

195
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,939
You've got nine lives,
Bill Leyden.

196
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,776
(distant gunfire)

197
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,779
What's the matter, Kathy?

198
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,824
One day of combat,
you're all wore out.

199
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,246
More excitement's
on the way, princess.

200
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,791
Japs are fighting
for their own turf now.

201
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,753
Every damn foot
we go south

202
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,214
they'll get meaner
and meaner.

203
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,927
You'd better
get mean too, boot.

204
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,479
Ooh.

205
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,773
Ooh, la la la.

206
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,484
Now that's
a piece of ass.

207
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,652
Careful. That's the man's wife
you're talking about.

208
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,155
Snafu: Mmm.

209
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,285
Wow.

210
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,204
- Yeah.
- I'd marry her.

211
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,539
Leyden: Marry?

212
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,833
Who said anything
about marriage?

213
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,585
Give her back.

214
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,545
"Kathy Jones"?

215
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,423
I thought you said
your name was Peck.

216
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,636
(gunfire and explosions
continue)

217
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,179
She's not...
she's not your wife.

218
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,766
(laughs)
Oh, that's rich.

219
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,311
What's the missus think
about kitty cat?

220
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,772
I met her
after I was drafted.

221
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,650
- What?
- Drafted?

222
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,695
What kind
of marine is drafted?

223
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,783
Hamm, were you
drafted too?

224
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,493
No.

225
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,787
I don't believe it.

226
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,582
No way that broad is
banging some drafted marine.

227
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,334
- No way.
- I don't care what you think.

228
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,628
(men yelling
in Japanese)

229
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,766
They're leaving.
Japs are retreating.

230
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,686
They're leaving.

231
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,021
K company, let's move!
Let's move!

232
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,816
Burgin, 2nd Battalion's
broken through on the left.

233
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,693
We need
to guard their flank.

234
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,653
Third platoon
in reserve!

235
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,156
First and second,
form a skirmish line.

236
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,866
- Burgin...
- Man: First platoon, hold tight!

237
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,034
...I need all the men
you can spare.

238
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,370
Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

239
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,706
The Japs are falling back!
Let's go!

240
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,125
- Second squad, let's go.
- Why us?

241
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,127
Because your squad's
low on ammo.

242
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,753
Mac: Move it!
Get on that hill!

243
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,589
If it makes any damn difference to you,
I'm coming with you.

244
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,132
So grab
a rifle and move.

245
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,177
- Shit.
- Burgin: Second squad, let's go.

246
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,095
- On me!
- Fuck.

247
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,432
- Man: We're moving up.
- Burgin: We're taking some ground!

248
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,935
Great. 'Cause of you,
we're gonna get our asses shot up.

249
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,313
(machinegun firing)

250
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,776
Mac: Extend the left!
Extend the left!

251
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,654
It's about time
you stateside boys got to see

252
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,364
- what the war's all about.
- Not now, Bill.

253
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,950
Snafu:
We need more damn men up here.

254
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,787
Burgin: All right!
Let's go! Move out!

255
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,207
Oh Lord.
Okay okay.

256
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,918
- Okay okay.
- Burgin: Stay on line!

257
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,633
Spread out!
Break to the left!

258
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,135
Get on line!

259
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,639
Make sure
to check everything!

260
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,766
Man:
Get help right there!

261
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,727
Mac:
Move slow in the center!

262
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,729
Check everything!

263
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,365
Stay as low as you can.
Follow my lead.

264
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,659
Keep your intervals.

265
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,927
Mac: First platoon,
get up on the rocks!

266
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,930
- (rifle fires)
- Man: Sniper!

267
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,479
Man #2:
Put some fire on that crew!

268
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,857
- Man: Move it!
- Let's go.

269
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,484
Mac: Tell them
to try to hold it!

270
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,903
Wait for word!

271
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,080
Happy
to be back, Bill?

272
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,416
What the fuck are
we doing here?

273
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,892
(baby crying)

274
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,070
(woman speaking
Japanese)

275
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,617
- Man: Civilians!
- Man #2: Civilians!

276
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,411
Burgin: Let's go.
Move 'em through.

277
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,538
Come on, get out
of the way. Come on.

278
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,214
Sledge,
what do you see?

279
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,759
(baby crying)

280
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,927
(sobbing,
speaking Japanese)

281
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,936
- She's trying to give us the baby.
- What do we do?

282
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,448
- Man: Booby-trapped!
- Oh, no.

283
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,950
- Man #2: She's wired!
- (guns firing)

284
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,953
(screaming)

285
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,960
(machine gun firing)

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,924
- (all yelling)
- Take her!

287
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,189
Man: We can't move!
Get that damn gun!

288
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,248
Stay down!

289
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,752
Mac: Incoming!
Cease fire!

290
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,380
Cease fire,
God damn it!

291
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,758
(people moaning)

292
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,927
(gunfire)

293
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,811
- Corpsman!
- Get up here!

294
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,317
(crying)

295
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,785
- (distant explosion)
- Oh Lord.

296
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,745
- (bombs whistling)
- Man: Incoming!

297
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,914
- Man #2: Take cover!
- Those are ours.

298
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,127
- Short round!
- Our own fuckers are shelling us.

299
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,588
Mac: Pull back!
Back to the other ridge!

300
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,298
- Go go!
- Fall back!

301
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,925
Men: Fall back!
Fall back!

302
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,680
- Son of a bitch!
- Fall back to the start point!

303
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,266
They have us targeted!

304
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,686
(all yelling)

305
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,773
Mac:
Move! Move!

306
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,152
- Move!
- Let's go! Go!

307
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,945
Come on!

308
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,745
This is
fucking bullshit!

309
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,539
I ever find the fucking FO

310
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,208
that called that arty,
I'll shoot him!

311
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,959
The sons of bitches
will just do it again.

312
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,127
Why did they shell us?

313
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,129
Because some asshole officer
read a map wrong,

314
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,048
and nobody gives
a shit about us.

315
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,092
- There is no goddamn reason.
- Man: Got a body over here!

316
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,261
Man #2:
Get out there and police 'em up.

317
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,224
(explosions continue)

318
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,201
- (rain pattering)
- (men chattering)

319
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,269
Man:
Get me a count.

320
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,145
Move those casualties back
to the collection point.

321
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,648
Ready, lift.

322
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,650
Eugene.

323
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,948
(distant gunfire)

324
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,963
Eugene.

325
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,008
- (distant explosion)
- My dog died.

326
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,935
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,609
He was a good dog.

328
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,948
How old was he?

329
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,619
Got him as a pup
about nine years ago,

330
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,162
maybe 10.

331
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,920
They say
dogs live, what,

332
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,300
seven years
to every one of ours?

333
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,403
Man: Take those cleaning rags
to second squad.

334
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,659
My brother was
on the Bunker Hill.

335
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,786
Wow.

336
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,747
Ship got hit
by two kamikazes.

337
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,375
500 guys died, asshole.

338
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,544
How the fuck
can they do that?

339
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,297
Fly themselves
into a ship?

340
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,633
Emperor is God.

341
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,927
Duty to God.

342
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,097
They can't
fucking surrender?

343
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,475
(distant machine-gun fire)

344
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,477
I hope they don't.

345
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,399
I hope we get to kill
every last one of them.

346
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,283
- God damn it, give it back.
- Forget about her.

347
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,703
You're fucking
married, anyway.

348
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,287
Fuck you!

349
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,416
- Burgin: Stop it, Bill.
- Man: Hey, knock that shit off.

350
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,626
Bill. Bill.
God damn it, Bill.

351
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,378
Bill. Hey! Bill.

352
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,589
What the fuck's the matter with you, Bill?
The Japs ain't enough?

353
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,759
What the fuck
is this about?

354
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,679
It's just a damn picture, Peck.
Get the fuck out of here.

355
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,557
She sent him
a letter.

356
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,935
You know, a letter.

357
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,063
Burgin:
Who gives a shit?

358
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,774
- We don't need this crap, Bill.
- Leyden: You think I need it?

359
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,776
We don't need it, Bill.

360
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,752
- Bill! Bill!
- Oh shit! Oh shit!

361
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,587
- Sledge!
- Corpsman!

362
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,673
- (bombs exploding)
- Bill!

363
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,176
- (moaning)
- Man: Corpsman, we've got wounded!

364
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:26,722
- Snafu!
- Corpsman! Corpsman!

365
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,935
- Bill!
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

366
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,522
Man:
Get him to BAS!

367
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,942
- (groaning)
- Come on.

368
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,659
(men chatting)

369
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,224
(distant machine-gun fire)

370
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,523
Hey, why don't you
get a newer poncho off a dead body?

371
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,610
This one
suits me just fine.

372
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,711
Man, I thought
it'd be different.

373
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,675
Different from what?

374
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,760
Books you read?

375
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,428
Movies you saw?

376
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,764
No, I just...

377
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,351
I'm just saying.

378
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,939
Grow up, Hamm.

379
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,610
Fuck you, Sledge.

380
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,737
(laughs)

381
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,824
Why don't you pull yourself in the hole
the next time, okay?

382
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,536
That's the talk.

383
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,747
Yeah.
Fuck you too.

384
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,457
(chuckles)

385
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,252
The Hammbone did learn
something in boot camp.

386
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,759
Where you from,
Hamm with two Ms?

387
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,012
So now you want to know
where they're from?

388
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,357
(distant explosions)

389
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,283
Jesus, can't they
give it a rest?

390
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,038
(farts)

391
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,873
What's the date?

392
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,251
June 5th maybe.
Might be the 6th.

393
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,337
We're never getting
off this island.

394
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,756
Burgin:
Hey. Hey.

395
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,549
You dig that any deeper,

396
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,593
they'll get you
for desertion.

397
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,887
(men chatting)

398
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,764
We got here
April 1st.

399
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,766
Easter Sunday.

400
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,769
Fucking April Fools,
no matter how you look at it.

401
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,021
That's 66 days.

402
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,400
We're never getting
off this island.

403
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,445
Oh, come on, Kathy.

404
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,365
Summer's right
around the corner,

405
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,909
then Halloween

406
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,747
and then there's
Thanksgiving.

407
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,918
Look. I'm already working
on your Christmas present.

408
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,676
(distant
machine-gun fire)

409
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,761
Out of the sticks in '46.

410
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,764
Hell to heaven in '47.

411
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,683
The Golden Gate in '48.

412
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,936
(whispers)
Oh, shit.

413
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,775
Mac: Let's go!
Come on up here!

414
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,112
I need
a stovepipe boy up top.

415
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,614
Sledge, that's you.

416
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,658
Bring some comm wire.

417
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,494
Yes, sir.

418
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,294
Hamm, get a spool.

419
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,011
Fuck!

420
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,763
(panting)

421
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,739
Mac: Sledge,
where the fuck are you?!

422
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,575
- Get your ass up here!
- Yes, sir!

423
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,915
Man:
OP coming in!

424
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,503
Sledge?

425
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,801
- Here you go.
- They're moving back into that ridge.

426
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,763
Kutner saw Japs move
into the hut

427
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,765
to the left
of the big tomb.

428
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,767
I want a round on it.

429
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,019
Hamm, wire in.

430
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,616
(radio whirrs)

431
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,035
XO wants a round
on the farmhouse in sector 2.

432
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,245
Azimuth 3-1-0,
range 300.

433
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,872
One round, HE.

434
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,417
Man: 3-1-0. 300.
One round, H.E., on the way.

435
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,461
(distant boom)

436
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,840
Left 2-0.
Add 50 and try again.

437
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,760
Left 2-0, add 50.
One round, HE.

438
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,929
(distant boom)

439
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,894
Target. Mark it concentration Baker
for this sector.

440
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,902
(man shouts
in Japanese)

441
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,907
(men shouting)

442
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,213
Wait. Wait till
they're close.

443
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,936
(rifles firing)

444
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,910
Mac:
Cease fire! Cease fire!

445
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,916
(grunting)

446
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,599
Jesus, Sledge.
Leave him.

447
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,434
What for?
He's a Jap, ain't he?

448
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,570
Mac: Cease fire!
Cease fire, God damn it!

449
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,956
I told you to cease fire.
What are you doing?

450
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,583
Killing Japs.

451
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,501
You just gave away
our goddamn position.

452
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,755
I think they've got a pretty good idea
of where we are.

453
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,257
I told you to cease fire and you're
supposed to be observing.

454
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,426
I see you
with a goddamn sidearm.

455
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,928
We were all sent here
to kill Japs, weren't we?

456
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,306
So what the hell difference does it make
what weapon we use?!

457
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,644
I'd use my goddamn hands
if I had to.

458
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,904
(rain pattering)

459
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,675
Screw it.

460
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,053
We need some
reinforcements up here.

461
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,014
- Give it a rest.
- Fuck you, Eugene.

462
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,100
Yeah, fuck you too,
Shelton.

463
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,770
Fuck, I'm so fucking tired.

464
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,440
I'm fucking tired
of this maggoty stench.

465
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,277
First they order us to push forward when
we ain't got enough bodies,

466
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,696
- then they order us to sit in our own shit.
- Shut up.

467
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,406
They fucking shell us
with our own artillery.

468
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,699
Shut up.

469
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,785
I'm so fucking tired of not having
enough fucking bodies!

470
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,413
- Jesus Christ! Shut up!
- Fuck you!

471
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,498
- Sledge: Shut up!
- Snafu: Fuck you, Sledge!

472
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,209
- Shut up, Shelton!
- Fuck you!

473
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,753
Hey, Peck!

474
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,338
Peck, sit down!

475
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,051
- Peck!
- Come on, you fuckers!

476
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,761
- Peck!
- Kathy: Come on!

477
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,847
- Peck!
- You fuckers!

478
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,765
- (guns firing)
- Come on!

479
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,767
- Peck!
- Come and fucking get me!

480
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,769
Come on!

481
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,896
- Come on, you motherfuckers!
- Peck!

482
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,357
- Peck, come on.
- Come on and get me!

483
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,609
- Come on.
- Come on!

484
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,029
Come on!
Come on!

485
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,739
- Come and fucking shoot me!
- Eugene!

486
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,950
Somebody come for me!
Come on! Come on!

487
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,535
Hey, Peck!

488
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,871
Peck!

489
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,335
- Stay down!
- (grunts)

490
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,274
(softly)
You stupid bastard. You stupid...

491
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,069
(yelling)
You stupid stupid stupid bastard!

492
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,737
You fucking idiot!

493
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,907
You stupid
stupid bastard!

494
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,833
Peck.
You're okay, Peck.

495
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,836
- You're okay.
- Mac: Hey.

496
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,839
What the fuck happened?

497
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,592
Hamm's dead...

498
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,346
and Peck's gone.

499
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,767
- You two, get him out of here.
- Aye, sir.

500
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,189
Mac:
Get some shut-eye, both of you.

501
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,355
- (machine guns firing)
- Mac: Down the hill!

502
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,940
- Bring up the rear!
- (explosions)

503
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,279
Let's go! Move it!

504
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,739
Come on! Move it!
Find cover!

505
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,908
(men shouting)

506
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,006
Man: Let's go!
Get up there!

507
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,758
Man #2:
Get behind that entrance!

508
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,678
First squad,
get behind that trash!

509
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,931
Clear that pillbox!

510
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,902
First platoon,
left flank!

511
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,529
- Let's go! Let's move it!
- Man #2: Let's go! Get a move on!

512
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,698
Get up that hill!

513
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,077
Man:
Machine guns, high and right!

514
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,957
Get up the hill!
Let's go!

515
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,116
- Man #2: Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

516
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,290
(yells)

517
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,192
(coughs)

518
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,005
(baby crying)

519
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,851
Might be a trap.

520
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,917
Lots of people
fired mortars up here.

521
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,920
That doesn't matter.

522
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,054
What the hell is the matter
with you two?

523
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,108
(crying continues)

524
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,262
- (metal chimes)
- (woman speaking Japanese)

525
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,809
(moaning)

526
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,006
(wind blowing)

527
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,187
(exhales)

528
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,259
- Find anything?
- No.

529
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,721
All right, let's get
these boots squared away.

530
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,222
Where's Burgie?

531
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,852
(men chatting)

532
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,513
- (gunshot)
- Man: Yeah-ha-ha! I got him!

533
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,515
How's that?
A clean shot.

534
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,684
- I got me a Jap.
- You see him go down?

535
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,477
- Man #2: Heck of a shot.
- Man: Yeah, I got him.

536
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,146
- (men laugh)
- Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

537
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,732
Do you feel good? Huh?

538
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,527
Killed your first Jap?
He's a damn kid!

539
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,737
What's your problem?
He's a Jap.

540
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,948
We're here
to kill Japs, ain't we?

541
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,248
Check him out.

542
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,920
Don't look like he's
got anything at all.

543
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,324
(waves crashing)

544
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,493
(men chatting)

545
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,770
Burgie.

546
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,614
Where'd you get this,
Hammer?

547
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,950
Gunny Haney
gave it to me.

548
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,579
Pops.

549
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,664
Took it with him
from Guadalcanal

550
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,166
all the way
to Peleliu.

551
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,381
I heard Leyden made it
back to the States.

552
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,051
Son of a bitch always
said he was first.

553
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,220
(chuckles)

554
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,890
All right, enough with the sunbathing.
Let's go, move out.

555
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,748
We dropped some new bomb
on the Jap mainland.

556
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,751
- Don't that beat all.
- No. Oh, no.

557
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,754
This one's different...
vaporized an entire city

558
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,715
- in the blink of an eye.
- (man shouts)

559
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,677
- How?
- I don't know.

560
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,888
Anyway,
killed a lot of Japs.

561
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,936
Oh, word is battalion mess is serving
Cokes and steaks tonight.

562
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,230
Might even
get a movie.

563
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,567
Man:
Let's go! Load up!

564
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,986
- Let's go! Get it in tight!
- (truck starts)

565
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,530
Man #2:
Let's get aboard! Let's move!

566
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,800
- (truck starts)
- Man #2: We're heading home!

567
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,469
Man:
Move out!

568
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,172
(theme music playing)
