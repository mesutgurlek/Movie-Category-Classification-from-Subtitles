Keep them coming, boys!

00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,677
We're up and running,

00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,245
getting new customers by the truckload.

6
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:19,381
All right, let's get these boxes moving.

Oliver: What happened?

8
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,618
They came in the middle of the night

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,253
and took everything we had.

10
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:26,021
Ration cards, food, clothes...

11
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,890
our house.

12
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,092
Told us we had four hours to move.

13
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:31,560
Said we worked for them now.

14
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,229
- Who did?
- Marines.

15
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,631
They swapped out their
patches for California United Forces.

16
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,800
I grew up on a base.
I knew who they were.

17
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,468
I hear you, but you need to know,

18
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,703
those Marines didn't
know what they were doing.

19
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:41,904
They were fooled just like us.

20
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,706
[Crying] They took everything.

21
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,040
Don't give up hope. You hear me?

22
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,575
We'll get through this.

23
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:49,678
- We will.
- Thanks.

No, it's your chair. I understand.

26

It'll be okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.

27
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,548
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics,

28
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,949
but you got to stay off your feet.

29

- Okay. Thanks, doc.

If you need
immediate medical assistance,

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,710
please raise your
hand and I'll come to you.

33
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,112
- Sorry.
- Can't help.

34
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,813
- Good luck.
- Here. Let me...

35
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,483
No more! Leave us alone!

00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,165
on the other regional leaders...

41

Their homes, habits, security detail.

Jeter: We tasked a
satellite to do some early recon.

Lives in a penthouse, 60
floors above Park Avenue.

Gonna be tough to sneak up on him.

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,498
He does like to drink.

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,801
That much I know to be true.

49
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,736
Most nights, you can find him
stumbling out of a pub on the West Side,

couple of hours before sunrise.

And Wilson is out on a
farm somewhere, right?

52
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,375
Yes, sir.50 miles south of Des Moines.

53
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:21,011
Sleeps with the windows
open. Likes the fresh air.

54
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,013
He's got dogs, but we can handle them.

Sasha: Price is the
smartest and the meanest.

Her place is a fortress.

You leave her up to me,

58
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,518
if it's all the same to you.

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,089
So, small teams, set targets,

60

simultaneous assault to cut
off the heads of leadership.

61
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,594
All goes right, we can
expect limited casualties.

62
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,430
So in one fell swoop, we
take out all three leaders?

63
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:44,067
Four. We need to take
out the mastermind.

64
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,403
We need to take out Shaw.

65

I know you're all
concerned, but just sit tight.

66
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,976
I'm sure Castillo has an explanation

67
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,511
as to why the train hasn't arrived.

68
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:57,047
Or why he isn't
answering any of our calls!

69
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,682
Something's going on, Allison.

70
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,885
Yeah, he's stealing Beatty's
livestock is what's going on.

71
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,321
Our livestock, for Christ sakes.

72
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:08,659
My sources are telling me
this was not Castillo's doing.

73
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,927
That train was attacked.

74
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,698
And how it was taken out,
it was no small rebel hit.

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,133
Yeah, well, if that's the case

76
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,734
and a revolution starts out west,

77
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:20,337
then we're gonna have a
real shit sandwich on our plates.

78
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,140
And if Castillo falls, who
takes over his region?

79
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,275
Stop, all of you. I will handle this.

80

Like you've handled it before?

Once my people come back with
answers about the train,

82
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,329
we will decide the best
way to proceed... together.

83
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:36,386
Get them started. ‭All
right, I'll let them know.

84

Have you found them yet?

85
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:39,847
We think they're somewhere
off the coast of San Diego, but we...

I'm not talking
about Nathan James, Powell.

90
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,307
they were splitting from
Chandler's family.

91
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,975
I'm sure Mom found a good place

92
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,744
for them to lie low with the baby.

93
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,546
Kara, you should take Wilson.

Let me handle Shaw. You
can't let it be personal.

If you let your judgment
get clouded by anger or...

97
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,388
Hey, this is personal for all of us.

98
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,090
But that's not why I'm going.

99
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,524
No one knows Shaw like I do.

100
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,793
What if something happens to both of us?

101
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,261
Then Frankie will know we died

102
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,764
so he didn't have to grow
up in a world like this.

103
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,166
It's not gonna happen.

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,445
Execute.

163
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:28,290
Tiger, I'm seeing no
movement on the northeast side.

164
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,760
Dogs are still. You
are clear to proceed.

165
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:36,999
Vulture, Croft's taking the north alley.

166
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:39,001
Cobra, entrance is clear.

Yeah, hookers would
be good at this point.

169
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:51,146
Stay with the team here.

170
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:08,030
Tom: Raptor, bogey coming at you hard.

171
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:09,098

- Unh!

Tom: Vulture team, Croft and company
100 yards to your west,

174
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,743
heading southbound.

175
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,320
Veer left around the
corner of the building,

176
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,880
then proceed north. You can cut him off.

- [Taser crackles]
- Yaah!

180
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,591
Smile for the camera, Croft.

181
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,494
Man: Tiger team's inside.

Danny: Jackpot. We got Wilson.

00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:56,245
Tex: Raptor moving
in on the master suite.

188
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:12,161
- Raptor, how we doing? Damn it.

189
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,862
Price ain't here.

190
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,837
Living room clear. Approaching bedroom.

191
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,942
Clear.

192
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,544
Negative on Shaw.

193
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,980
Damn it! We only got two.

194
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,247
We'll get the others.

195
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:34,116
- Keep me updated.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,384
Cobra, where is she?

197
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,652
We're working on it.

198
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:39,521
There's only one other place she'd be.

199
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,058
We've got a problem. Captain
Chandler's alive.

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,327
We think he's the one that
stopped that train.

201
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,229
Price: We saw the ship
sink. He should be dead!

202
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,998
He will be.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Our intel says he's on the
ship with Castillo in custody.

204
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,602
- So he's coming after us?
- Not if I can help it.

205
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:54,777
That's why I called you here.

206
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,338
Why me? Why not Croft or Wilson?

207
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,740
You really want Croft or Wilson

208
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,742
with their fingers on
the button, Roberta?

209
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:04,146
Why, you sneaky little so-and-so.

210
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,782
You sold them out.

[Beeping]

We're ready.

This time, I want a
more failsafe solution.

[Beeps]

215

What have we got? Nuclear weapons?

216
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,295
Oh, Jesus, Roberta,
we're talking about California.

217
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,497
I'm not that cynical.

218
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,699
Well, you'll have to excuse me

219
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,533
for not giving you the
benefit of the doubt.

220
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,673
Nukes are too messy. We
have something more reliable.

221
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,153
We're gonna find the Nathan James,

222
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:31,306
we're gonna hit it, and
we're gonna watch Chandler die.

[Knock on door]

225
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:48,090
Wilson and Croft have
been secured in local prisons.

226
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,356
And the others?

227
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,926
Satellite feeds picked up

228
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,694
Price's jet touching down in St. Louis.

229
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,497
Our guess is she's headed to
the White House to meet with Shaw.

230
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,167
I've diverted all
teams to that location.

231
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,601
Once we have them in custody,

232
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,004
we'll get you on the
air to address the people.

233
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,906
And say what?

234
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,841
We got Castillo's man to stand down,

235
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:08,710
but what if the other
generals aren't so easily convinced?

236
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,012
We could start a civil war.

237
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,147
The rank and file will fall in line.

238
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,083
They've just forgotten who they are.

239
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,350
Who's gonna remind them?

240
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,219
You put a suicidal mission in office,

241
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:18,587
and I took advantage of it.

242
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,223
We are public
enemies number one and two.

243
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,691
The people don't trust us.

244
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:25,160
That's because they've been poisoned.

245
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,795
We'll change their minds.

246

You know,

00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,668
before the quarantine
was in place in St. Louis,

248
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,639
it was just me and
115 people in a Costco.

249
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:39,608
But I was able to protect them,

250
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,578
because they wanted more
than anything to be there.

251

Not like those broken
people we saw in that shelter.

Nothing on subsurface.

SPY didn't pick it up until
it was practically on top of us.

Radar is detecting no aircraft.

00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,693
Could the missile have been loitering?

280
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,028
We would've spotted it sooner.

281
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,130
I saw something on
radar, just for a second,

282
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:09,998
but then it just... Disappeared.

as Tiger and Raptor teams land.

take care of her guards.

Chill water to SPY is down,

346

and we need a few
minutes to get it up and running.

Without fire
control, we're sitting ducks.

Can we rig ours to do the same?

352
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,590
Yeah, maybe, if we fill the
service tanks with low-grade fuel.

353
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:04,658
But we can only sustain
it for a few minutes

354
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,093
before damaging the engine.

355

smoke to mask their location.

372

Well, then aim at the smoke.
You're bound to hit something.

It ain't that easy. I'm working on it.

Sir, the pipes are badly damaged.

I will hunt you
down and I will kill you.

not because they were sick...

more food for himself.

00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:50,844
There's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

651
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:58,619
Kara: He was a little
restless on the way over.

652
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:02,222
I think he knew he
was meeting his daddy.

653
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:04,057
[Chuckles]

654
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:07,861
You want to hold him?

655
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,063
Yeah.

656
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:13,367
Hey.

657
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,435
Look at you.

658
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,404
Hey, little man.

659
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:20,374
Already flex his muscles. [Chuckles]

660
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:22,843
Oh, wow.

661
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,047
[Baby fusses]

662
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,515
It's so nice to finally meet you.

663
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:59,046
Tom, you can't just walk away.

664
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,615
We have too much left to do.

665
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,852
It's Slattery's ship now.

666
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,386
And he's got you.

667
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,489
That crew out there needs you.

668
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:12,125
Kathleen needs you.

669
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:13,493
She's been crying all night.

670
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,529
You haven't even gone to talk to her.

671
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,397
What am I supposed to say?

672
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,833
Which speech am I
supposed to give, Sasha?

673
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:22,402
The one about the "casualties of war"?

674
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,739
Or the one about a
hero dying for the cause,

675
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:30,577
like the ones I gave for
Mason and Cossetti, Cruz,

676
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:35,015
Chung... Frankie, Ravit...

677
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,387
Rachel.

678
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:48,729
I wasn't there for
her when she needed me.

679
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:52,499
I wasn't there for Darien,
I wasn't there for my kids,

680
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:54,268
for my father...

681
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,670
Whatever you think is
broken, we can fix it.

682
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,538
[Bag zips]

683
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,440
Put on your uniform.

684
00:40:55,431 --> 00:41:00,033
I speak to you today a humbled man.

685
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:02,202
I've made mistakes.

686
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:05,405
I was silent when I
should have spoken out.

687
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:09,843
I ran when I should
have stood and fought.

688
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,311
[Boatswain's whistle blows]

689
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:17,718
But in adversity, we
find strength and courage.

690
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,855
The great Naval Captain Nimitz once said

691
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:26,426
"God grant me the courage not
to give up what I think is right,

692
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:30,998
even though I think it hopeless."

693
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,700
Stand with me.

694
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,036
Fight with me.

695
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:40,007
Because together, we can move forward.

696
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:46,480
Together, we can be strong again.

697
00:41:57,326 --> 00:42:00,994
Permission to go
ashore for the last time.

698
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:04,097
Permission granted.

699
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:17,377
Hip, hip!

700
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,097
- All: Hooray!
- ‭Hip, hip!

701
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:20,140
Hooray!

702

Hip, hip!

703
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,026
All: Hooray!

704
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,799
Don't look back!

705
