the trick.

It's well we had them.

9
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:24,625
It takes more than foot soldiers
to stop highland men.

10
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,195
Prisoners, sir.

among them, sir.

I'm in command of 4,000

How will you have me use them?

of the highlanders

And hold them there.

00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,200
You will give me the signal
to charge?

25
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,537
There will be no signal.

26
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,205
The very sight of such numbers
will win the day for us.

But me lord Duke,
my muskets can wipe

Every rebel in Scotland
off the face of the earth.

29

No.

32

We must spare the lovely

They're the finest men

I came to kill your lovely
blue bonnets.

I'm a highlander myself,
you bloody minded mercenary.

38
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,368
I should be fast to report
this to Mr. walpole.

39

Report what you will.

40

What has happened
to my Robbie?

46

They've taken him
to stirling castle.

47
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,866
You're his nearest kinsman

48
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,869
And you dare to show your faces
in the Glen without him.

49
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,205
We did but come to ask
for his best plaid and sporran

50
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,840
Then we'll give ourselves up
to be at his side.

Aye.

Our losses were greater
than those of the rebels.

My lord Duke, Victors
are not always measured

Such as it is.
A mere 19 in all.

And only three
lairds among them.

In view
of so slight a victory

To deliver up our chief prize
for trial in London?

Would you be responsible
for taking him there?

91
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,303
I would indeed.

92
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,672
And you call yourself a scot.

93
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,308
There's literally none of the
good scots left in your speech

94
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,377
And none at all in your heart.
My lord.

95
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,180
What a child for a politician
like you, montrose.

96
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,049
A captive tied
at your chariot wheels.

97
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,151
I am not secretary of state
for Scotland.

98
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,152
You are.

99
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,187
And it's your loyalty
that may be questioned.

100
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,189
Not mine.

101
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,158
Have you interest
in my loyalty

102
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,161
Or the office I hold?

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,163
I'll tell you this,
argyll.

104
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,231
If you don't deliver macgregor
to London

105
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,200
You'll have no office to hold.

106
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,573
You'll do well
to think it over.

107
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,188
Her ladyship of glengyll.

108
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,124
Putting her ear to the door
like a serving wench.

109
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,126
And you born a Campbell.

110
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,528
I'm not proud
to be called Campbell.

111

When the chief of my own clan
put my Robbie in jail.

112
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,699
His own hot blood
put him there.

113
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,204
If yours
had not gone cold, argyll,

114
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,705
You'd be in jail
beside him.

115
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,307
Oh, I'm fighting
for Scotland too.

116
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,210
- Huh!
- But in a different way.

117
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,312
Long ago I realized
we can never seek the exiled

118
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,148
King James on england's throne.

119
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,218
If we're to live in peace,
we must be better neighbors.

120
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,220
And before I let hot heads
like your rob

121
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,389
Destroy old Scotland,
I'll see them all in jail.

122
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,160
London must think
you're the great man.

123
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,562
Margaret, I'm trying to get
an amnesty

124
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,231
For all the highlands.

125
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,499
To do so, I must make a vow
towards London.

126
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,335
It may sound hard to you.

127
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:53,506
But rob must stand his trial
with the rest.

128
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,043
Oh, I see now.

129
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,656
Would it help you at all
to send my Robbie to London?

130
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,258
Do you know
what you're saying?

131
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,694
Down there they'll stretch
his neck in a minute.

132
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,164
If...

133
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,531
If you did send him there,

134
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,134
Would his grace
the Duke of montrose take him?

135
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,136
Does it matter?

136
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,638
It might.

137
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,675
It's a long road to London.

138
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:33,113
The ways are bad and full
of highway men.

139
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,182
I should not like montrose
to fall in

140
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,184
With the kind of highway men
you would put in his path.

141
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,686
You macgregor woman, you.

142
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,223
Oh, you have my word
as one Campbell to another,

143
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,193
No macgregor would harm
a hair of his wig.

144
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,828
Oh, yes.
We must mind his wig.

145
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,498
T'would be a thundering great
catastrophe

146
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,134
If his lordship's feathers
were ruffled.

147
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,237
Oh, aye.

148
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,181
You must forgive my coachman
if he seems over anxious

149
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,183
To get you out of the country.

150
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,085
- Like his master.
- True.

151
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,087
Once you're rid
of me in London,

152
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,156
You think you'll have a free
hand in the highlands?

153
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,158
Half our crofters pay rent
to you, now.

154
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,062
I see no reason to deny
the other half my patronage.

155
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,332
- No reason but one.
- And what is that?

156
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,367
When my clansmen
have their belly full

157
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,368
Of thieving land robbers,

158
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,205
They have a way
of flinging them in the loch.

159
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,174
Nay, killearn.
Let him talk.

160
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,544
His words will be choked off
all too soon.

161
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,181
- Whoa there...
- Come on, come on.

162
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,217
Come on...
[Speaking gaelic]

163
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,555
Come away now.
[Speaking gaelic]

164
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,789
Wayfarer, make way.

165
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,890
Aye, sir, aye.

166
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,127
Did you not hear him?
Make way for the gentleman.

167
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,796
Aye.
Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,699
[Speaking gaelic]

169
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,170
You blathering fools
drive those sheep off the road.

170
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,334
Wipe the dust
from his clothes, nabby.

171
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,370
His lordship's wig.

172
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,342
There that's better.

173
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,678
Will your grace please accept
this small reminder

174
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,315
To keep your nose out
of macgregor business.

175
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,871
Oh, Robbie.

176
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,308
So you got away.
Aye.

177
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,344
Thanks to dugal,
Hugh and nabby.

178
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,113
- Oh, they're bonny lads.
- New curtains?

179
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,315
I was making things fine
for your homecoming.

180
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,184
You were so sure
I'd be back?

181
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,287
Well, I hoped.

182
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,058
Mother, the trouble's
not ended yet.

183
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,366
What are you looking for?

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,700
My father's pistols.

185
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,370
- I put them away.
- Where?

186
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,238
In the big chest
in my room.

187
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,053
You've no need of them, rob.

188
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,354
You wouldn't say that

189
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,589
If you knew who was
taking me to London.

190
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,491
I do know.

191
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,161
It was I who sent the men
to stop montrose's coach.

192
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:13,333
But it was argyll himself
who winked at what was done.

193
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,535
You went to argyll

194
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,605
And got down on your knees
to the great Campbell?

195
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,208
Have a care at
what you're saying, Robert.

196
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,609
I'm a Campbell too.

197
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,211
It seems you have forgotten
the fact

198
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,745
That you married a macgregor.

199
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,199
I am sorry, mother.

200
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:50,203
Argyll is not the enemy
you think he is.

201
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,205
He quelled
the rising of the clans

202
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,373
Like any englishman.

203
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,208
Yes, and he always will.

204
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,310
But once the fighting's over,

205
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,147
He's just as good a highlander
as you are.

206
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,216
He's set his mind on an amnesty
for the highlands.

207
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,219
He wants the war forgotten.

208
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,222
Why don't you
forget it too, rob?

209
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,391
Why don't you try
the ways of peace?

210
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,261
And settle down.

211
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,134
I suppose you have a Lassie
all picked out for me.

212
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,836
I don't know
who would have you.

213
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,306
Has no one at the inn
been asking about me?

214
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,442
- Do you mean Helen Mary?
- And why not?

215
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,444
Oh, she's been busy I hear.

216
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,845
Busy?

217
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,648
Well, you wouldn't expect
so bonny a Lassie

218
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,151
To be starved for attention,
now, would you?

219
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,286
Oh, no.

220
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,788
Not if that's what
she's wanting.

221
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,192
And why not?

222
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:50,697
Uh, is there anyone she might
have a particular fancy for?

223
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,533
- How would I know?
- Is there?

224
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,303
Well, if I were you...

225
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,539
Bring me that curtain,
please.

226
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,310
I would find out for myself.

227
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:07,214
I'll do no such thing.

228
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,148
It was the horseman
I tell you.

229
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,184
Take away the horseman

230
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,785
And throw him into
the river annan.

231
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,355
Ahh, they don't know
what fighting is nowadays.

232
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,226
It would be a far different
story back in '93.

233
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,694
Did I ever tell you about
the fighting at killiecrankie?

234
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,696
You see, it was like this.

235
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,533
There was a red coat coming
at me from the front.

236
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,202
And another all crouched
and ready to spring

237
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,169
From the rocks above.

238
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,171
And that's not counting the one
at the back

239
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,240
Who had me surrounded.

240
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,174
All I had was my sword.

241
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,678
And what do you think
I did then?

242
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,181
I cut and i...
and I slashed!

243
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,517
'Til the first one
gave ground.

244
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,186
I hacked at his head
and I hacked at his knees.

245
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,224
And then I told him to settle at
the hat of the one behind me.

246
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,192
Spit at the one
in the rocks above.

247
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,428
Whirl towards another one.

248
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,230
Break down his guard.

249
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,233
And...

250
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,402
The way we clip off a Daisy.

251
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,377
What was all that about?

252
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,712
Oh, I had just been slaying
and slaughtering

253
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,180
A few red coats.

254
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,382
- Oh.
- I'll chop the haggis.

255
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,383
You go back to your baking.

256
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,219
You'll need an apron
over that pretty dress.

257
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,221
What day is it today?

258
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,190
It's Thursday, Uncle hamish.

259
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,192
Oh, so it is.
So it is.

260
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,362
And why are you wearing
your Sunday best?

261
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,197
You're not expecting
anyone, are you?

262
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,200
- Oh, leave the girl alone.
- She started it.

263
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,803
Go on.
Get out of here.

264
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,072
Let's see now.
Where was I?

265
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,376
You were wading in red blood
right up to the knee.

266
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,312
Oh, yes, yes.

267
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,214
When I was in me prime.

268
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,218
I could bring down two
with every stroke.

269
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,386
Three!

270
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,090
And sometimes four.
[Laughing]

271
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,560
Out!
Out with you!

272
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,229
And you!

273
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,298
Good evening,
hamish MacPherson.

274
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,302
Rob!
Oh, rob, lad.

275
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,803
If you had me in the battle

276
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,306
The two of us could've chased
the sassanaks

277
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,074
All the way down to London.

278
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
Oh, there's no doubt
about it.

279
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,478
No doubt about it at all.

280
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,180
They say your cousin
dugal is a great man

281
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,182
With the claymore
and I don't deny it.

282
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,485
We're about the same tallness
and broadness

283
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,120
Though I may out weigh him
by a stone or two.

284
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,155
But oh, rob I wish you would
have seen me...

285
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,256
Good evening, rob.

286
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,159
In '93 when I was at
killiecrankie with montrose.

287
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,694
- Helen Mary i...
- Welcome home.

288
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,364
Not the montrose
that you escaped from.

289
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,499
No, not that markened evil

290
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,368
Who sold himself
to the English.

291
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,169
- Helen Mary...
- Excuse me.

292
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,871
No, no it...
It was his Uncle.

293
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,841
His Uncle the great montrose.
The bonny dundee.

294
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,845
Ahh, those were
the grand days.

295
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,114
Did you mind when you stalked
the sentry.

296
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,683
Aye...

297
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,118
Of all your great deeds,

298
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,053
That's the story
I like the best.

299
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,489
Aye.

300
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,358
And you took him by surprise
in broad daylight, aye.

301
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,628
That was the instinct
of the hunter.

302
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,500
There he was.

303
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,201
Standing up for all the world
to see

304
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,203
Like a cairn on
the Mountain top.

305
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,337
And there was...

306
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,810
Good evening.

307
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:28,381
Oh, rob.
It's grand to have you back.

308
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:31,317
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

309
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,486
You can help the Lassie
if you will mind.

310
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,189
Uh, thank you but, uh...

311
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,190
Helen Mary.

312
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,760
Could I have a straight forward
word with you?

313
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,261
Alone.
Alone?

314
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,531
What are you thinking of, rob?

315
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,599
I think I can be trusted.

316
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,835
Helen Mary.

317
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,703
Have I not been civil to you
in the past?

318
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,340
Oh, yes you have, rob.
Very civil.

319
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,543
Oh, you're a God-fearing lad,
rob.

320
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,377
But you've been away
to the wars.

321
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,612
And who knows
what you've picked up,

322
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,514
The loose ways of a soldier.

323
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,351
Talking from experience,
no doubt.

324
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,719
Pay no heed to him, rob.

325
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,121
Sit down.

326
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,799
You may speak as free
as you like.

327
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:23,536
There are no eavesdroppers
in this house.

328
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,638
And there'll be no bagpipes,
either.

329
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:29,075
I'm just going to soften
the Reed.

330
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,651
What was it you were wanting
to ask me about?

331
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,220
- I, uh...
- Yes, rob?

332
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,124
I wonder how matters
lie between us.

333
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,258
[Loud squawk]

334
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:52,164
You were wondering...

335
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,833
[High pitched squeak]
How matters lie between us.

336
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,767
Just what do you mean?
[Flat squeak]

337
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,104
I mean, you're not a bad
looking girl.

338
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,172
It's good of you
to say so.

339
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,173
And there are other lads
besides me who

340
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,242
Have thought so too.

341
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,844
Oh, I don't know.

342
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,847
And what about
Hector Stuart?

343
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,948
[Squeaking]

344
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,084
Well, he may have cast
his eye upon me in the kirk.

345
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,187
And no doubt you stared back
at that round-eyed-bullock.

346
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,689
I did not.

347
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,692
Hector was minded to speak
a straightforward word too

348
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:24,296
But he never got past
the threshold.

349
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:30,202
- Have i...
- Whoa, no.

350
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,472
My mother sends you her love.

351
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,341
You can take mine
back to her.

352
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,511
She loves you
like her own daughter.

353
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,180
You wouldn't believe
the changes she's...

354
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,282
You wouldn't believe the changes
she's made in the house.

355
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,285
Uh, with two new
leather rushy chairs.

356
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,855
And new curtains... curtains
for the windows.

357
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,659
[Continuous squawking]
And a great bed of timber.

358
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:56,529
And a looking glass
as tall as...

359
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,231
A looking glass
as tall as yourself.

360
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,668
My.

361
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,703
Oh, there's many a lass
that would be proud

362
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:07,640
To have the over seeing of
a house like inversnaid.

363
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,208
I've no doubt.

364
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,178
Uh, maybe you would.

365
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,581
- It's better now.
- Shh!

366
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,517
Did you come looking for
a housekeeper or...

367
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,519
You think he be looking
for a wife?

368
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,354
Well, the man must have
something to look at

369
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,523
After the kirk on Sundays.

370
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,759
You know fine why I've come.

371
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,828
I've been casting my eye
upon you too.

372
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,830
These last three years.

373
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,265
Have you now?

374
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,734
Why would you ever do that?

375
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,207
Helen Mary...

376
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,243
Will you be my...
[Bagpipe squealing]

377
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,085
What do you say?

378
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,319
Kinsmen and friends.

379
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:30,156
To Helen Mary.
My bride.

380
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,458
She's blythe and she's bonny.

381
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,227
She's my mother over again.

382
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,497
And I'd spill my heart's blood
in her defense.

383
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,801
As this will be token.

384
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,336
[Cheers]

385
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,305
Aw, she's a bonny wee lass.

386
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,274
* we will all sing so gay
we will drink while we may *

387
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,077
* with a toast to our laddy
in a merry merry cup *

388
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,611
* we will set our cares aside

389
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,180
* if you'll kiss
the bonny bride *

390
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,347
* and go leaping
high and wide *

391
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,283
* while your legs
will hold you up *

392
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,350
[Laughing]

393
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,528
[Singing in gaelic]

394
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,400
[Loud cheers]

395
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,356
What brings you here?

396
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,694
I come to read a proclamation
from king George.

397
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:32,331
It has pleased his majesty
to signify his approval

398
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,134
Of an act of grace and pardon.

399
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,469
Granting an amnesty
to all persons who committed

400
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,139
Any treasonable offenses
against him.

401
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,141
Such pardon and amnesty
to be granted

402
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,210
To all the highland clans.

403
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:48,480
Save only the cursed
and traitorous clan macgregor.

404
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:52,351
Who's name shall be
forever abolished.

405
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,154
Here with, it is decreed

406
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,089
That any man
known as macgregor

407
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,158
Shall henceforward
call himself

408
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,493
And his bairns
already procreated

409
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:05,764
After any other surname
he may choose.

410
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,334
And it shall be unlawful

411
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,169
For a minister of the church
of Scotland

412
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,205
To baptize or christen
any male child

413
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,208
Called by the name
of macgregor.

414
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:20,112
Nor shall any man
of the clan macgregor

415
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:22,214
At any time bear arms,

416
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:25,217
Either weapons offensive
or weapons defensive.

417
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,219
Under pain of death.

418
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,720
You and your black cattle

419
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:32,258
Had best get out of macgregor
country while you may.

420
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:39,865
Still high and mighty.

421
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,202
Maybe this will cool
your pride.

422
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,605
I bear a warrant for the arrest
of the escaped prisoner

423
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,209
Rob macgregor and his return
to stirling castle.

424
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,379
Signed and sealed by the
secretary of state for Scotland.

425
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,115
Don't you believe him, rob.

426
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,049
The Duke of argyll

427
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,385
Would never put his name
to such an order.

428
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,222
This order is from
the new secretary.

429
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,392
The Duke of montrose.
Let me see it.

430
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,561
With pleasure, my dear lady.

431
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:14,233
If you didn't abide among
the myths and the crows,

432
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,668
You'd know that argyll has been
stripped of his offices

433
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,305
And sent to his castle
at inveraray.

434
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,241
Then your montrose's private
fencibles.

435
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:22,975
Aye.

436
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,643
Sent to humble
the MacGregors.

437
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,113
Aye.

438
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,215
- Give us the word, rob.
- Aye, give us the word.

439
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,324
No, put up your decks.

440
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,359
And go back to the punchbowl.

441
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,528
- Aye.
- The punch bowl.

442
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,530
Aye.

443
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,332
Go and get puggled
if you want,

444
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,334
But if you try any
of your games

445
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,071
This time we'll take more than
your names away from you.

446
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,310
Rob!

447
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,849
Go with my mother,
Helen Mary.

448
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,184
To inversnaid.

449
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,354
Come now.

450
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,523
You've not seen the last
of rob macgregor.

451
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,363
It takes more than the hook of
a sassanak

452
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,498
To hold a Scottish salmon.

453
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,235
Get after him!

454
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,412
[Speaking indistinctly]

455
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,322
I'll look down.

456
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,315
Behind the great stone.

457
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,489
Down stream near thunderhead.

458
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,050
A day and a night
is a long time to wait.

459
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:23,655
Are you sure he said
he'd meet us here.

460
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,393
Aye.
He said the punchbowl.

461
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,267
No, he's not coming.

462
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,203
Don't fret yourself, dugal.

463
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,871
Those fencibles will never
take Robert to the highlands.

464
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,340
Well, he's not here now.

465
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,808
Give them time, man.

466
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,511
He's had all the time
in the world and more.

467
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,346
You needn't get your beard
in a blaze.

468
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,181
Aye, bide wee while longer.

469
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:53,051
Sit down, man.
Sit down.

470
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,058
[Singing in gaelic]

471
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,200
Ahh, hold your voice.

472
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,236
And you hold yours.

473
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,338
I like to hear the lad sing.

474
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,340
This is no time for singin'.

475
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,174
Or for argy-bargy.

476
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,144
You old women can sit here
'til the stroke of day.

477
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,179
I'm going after rob,
even if I have to go on my own.

478
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:24,683
- You'll not go alone, dugal.
- Me too.

479
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,052
All right, come on then.

480
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,154
You're chief gave orders
to meet him here

481
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,155
And here you'll stay
until he comes.

482
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,524
- Stand aside, you.
- Stop!

483
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,826
What's all this
tramash about?

484
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,695
It was me.
It was my doing.

485
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,196
Aye, I don't doubt that.

486
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh, he was just wanting
to go after you, rob.

487
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,601
There'll be no
going after me.

488
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,336
And there'll be
no more fighting.

489
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,338
Either among yourselves
or against others.

490
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,073
Now that montrose
is the high and mighty

491
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,775
Lordling of Scotland,
the clan will have to fight.

492
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:50,776
No, dugal.

493
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,378
If the clan shows fight,

494
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,346
He'll burn you out
of house and steading.

495
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,615
You're not the man he wants.
He's after me.

496
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,217
You will not be for giving
yourself up, rob.

497
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,352
Oh, no.

498
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,887
I'll lead his lordship
such a chase

499
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,555
He'll have no time left
for the rest of the MacGregors.

500
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,124
And we're to let you take all
the blows and knocks?

501
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,593
What kind of men
do you think we are?

502
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,295
I know the kind
you're going to be.

503
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,063
You're going back
to your own houses.

504
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,199
And hide your pistols
in the grain bins

505
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,867
And your claymores
in the thatch.

506
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,370
And learn
to speak as discreetly

507
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,438
As a Glasgow Bailey.

508
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,240
With our bonnets
in our hands.

509
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,375
Aye.

510
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,412
With your bonnets
in your hands.

511
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,818
Rob.

512
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,388
Rob, you did come back.

513
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,499
Oh, Helen Mary.

514
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,269
You made a bad bargain
when you took me for husband.

515
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,236
Don't say that, rob.

516
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,474
If I had known all this
was in store for me,

517
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:33,144
Aye, and ten times worse,
I'd still have married you.

518
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,850
No sign of him yet, sir.

519
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,285
You sure he didn't slip
past you in the dark?

520
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,152
No, sir.

521
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,188
I've a 20 men
on it all night long.

522
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,222
Hmm.

523
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:52,163
- What are you going to do?
- I'll take to the Heather.

524
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:56,167
- You'll not go far away?
- No, I must look to my clan.

525
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,336
If I don't keep an eye on
those hotheads,

526
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,207
They'll have themselves hanged
within a 12-month.

527
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,642
But in the end,

528
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,212
I'm driven from these hills
into the far north.

529
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,214
I'll not leave without you.

530
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,249
I'll be waiting.

531
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,855
[Pounding at the door]

532
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,390
Open up!

533
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,202
Where is rob macgregor?

534
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,238
I don't know.

535
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,409
I give you my word.
My son is not here.

536
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,414
[Gunfire]

537
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,182
Well?

538
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,185
The Duke of montrose
is entitled to his rent money.

539
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:04,322
But he's no right
to the double tax.

540
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,290
No right?

541
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:19,437
I want my receipt too.

542
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,206
And what do you
call yourself?

543
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,508
My name is dugal macgregor.

544
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,210
There is no such name
as macgregor.

545
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,647
Put him down as macalister
and be done with it.

546
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,197
There will be none of that
in my house.

547
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,299
This is the inn
of hamish MacPherson.

548
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,567
- Why you...
- Torcal!

549
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,708
So it's your inn?
Yes.

550
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,712
And where's the charter
for the land you built it on?

551
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,413
There is my charter.

552
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:09,554
And there's mine.

553
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,722
No, dugal!

554
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:12,824
Any more trouble from you

555
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:15,493
Or any of the rest of you
mangy tykes,

556
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,895
I will take you out
to stirling

557
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,798
And leave your crofts forfeit.

558
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,768
Now maybe
you'll listen to me.

559
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:26,805
This is the quarter rent you
paid to the Duke of montrose.

560
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:31,309
The same as it always is.
Aye.

561
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,179
But this one
grows and grows.

562
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,481
Next quarter
it'll be doubled.

563
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,183
Then doubled again.

564
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,351
Until it grows so great

565
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:42,821
You'll have to sell your
livestock and your farm gear

566
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,823
And your land itself...

567
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,191
To keep the bag full.

568
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,828
Unless you wish
to claim it now.

569
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:53,198
The whole sum will be posted
as a reward

570
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:57,168
For the man who leads us
to rob Roy macgregor.

571
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:03,308
I'll claim it.

572
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,344
Take their weapons.

573
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,279
Dugal, give it to maccallum.

574
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,480
Throw them in the loch.

575
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,349
Aye.

576
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,861
Give every man back
what he is due.

577
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,863
Aye.

578
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:25,864
As for you,

579
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:30,068
You poor cowardly
walking act of parliament,

580
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,336
Go and tell your master this.

581
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,206
My men have laid down
their arms.

582
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,542
They obey your laws
because I told them to.

583
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,378
And that command they still
must keep.

584
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,315
As for me, you may take me
if you can.

585
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,252
But leave my men alone.

586
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,354
For any Levy you may plague them
with hereafter,

587
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:52,758
I'll take double the amount
from montrose's own granary.

588
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,060
And from his cattle herds.

589
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,362
If you burn out our macgregor
crofts and steadings,

590
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,429
I'll burn yours.

591
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,331
If you kill my men,

592
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:04,569
I'll kill you, killearn.

593
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:13,378
Time after time you let
the red macgregor

594
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,546
Slip through your fingers.

595
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,682
And that's not all.

596
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,885
On the 20th day of this month

597
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,221
To punish dugal macgregor
for false information,

598
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,424
You stripped his croft
of its farm gear.

599
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,427
Is that not so?
True, your grace.

600
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,196
And on the 21st,

601
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:36,201
Ten of my finest cattle
disappeared.

602
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,203
You further report

603
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,205
That fencibles courted
at macgregor houses

604
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:46,211
Are way laid and beaten
by an unknown hand.

605
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:51,216
An unknown hand,
you witless goat?

606
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,550
Already you've made me
the laughing stock

607
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,219
Of Edinburgh and stirling.

608
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,287
Now London
is asking questions.

609
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,389
Mr. walpole himself.

610
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,226
We've done our best, my lord.
But I need more men.

611
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,494
You have all my fencible
troops now,

612
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,231
Save only my personal guards.

613
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,100
How many do you need
to capture one man?

614
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:12,637
He's more than one man,
your grace.

615
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,440
The plowman on the hill
is rob macgregor.

616
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,275
The man who carries the water
from the spring

617
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,443
Is rob macgregor.

618
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,678
The boatman on the loch
is rob macgregor.

619
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,148
And even the wee lad who fetches
in the cows.

620
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,351
As for the women.

621
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,686
Not a soul of honor.

622
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,456
Her ladyship of glengyll

623
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,658
Has swore herself
with such conviction

624
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,127
That the devil himself
would've believed her.

625
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:39,297
And all that time she was
hiding her son in the house.

626
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,301
Then bring her in.

627
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,137
We'll show them
what our courts can do

628
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,639
To those who harbor
prescribed outlaw.

629
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,109
A desperate measure,
your grace.

630
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,278
It may make the outlaw
desperate too.

631
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,181
Aye, and it may bring
the whole clan of macgregor.

632
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,617
We'll sorely need the packing
of the red coats.

633
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,119
Very well.

634
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,188
If colonel carpenter
can spare us the soldiers,

635
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,357
We rig ourselves a fort
at inversnaid.

636
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,722
You have no right
to strip my house.

637
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,291
For harboring an outlaw,

638
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,260
Your cattle's a forfeit
to the crown.

639
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:20,798
As for you, my fine lady,

She did not rig,
you're lord.

00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,235
She did not know her son
was in the house.

Get rid of the girl.

- Yes, here, rob.

00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:34,405

We'll spare your women

I must look to my mother.

Dugal, see that the fort
is surrounded.

Don't let one of them
show his head outside.

He mustn't fight
with the soldiers.

You must stop him,
Helen Mary.

Yes, mother.

in your debt

Were you to lift the siege
from inversnaid fort.

And when
they denied us amnesty,

We still tried
to keep their laws.

Will you not try once more
to let reason prevail?

And give our guile
a chance to make peace.

And be murdered for it?

731

I'd rather be shot for a wolf
than a sheep.

You go back and tell him...

- Is it bad, rob?
- No.

748
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:19,289
Now rob, do we beg for mercy
without bullets in our hands?

749
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:22,426
No.
It's war.

A new ballad about rob Roy.
All for one penny.

752
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,154
The Duke's mayor
rode from stirling

753
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:51,722
And up to inversnaid

754
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:55,392
To put 100 pound
on rob macgregor's head.

The girl did went a beggin',
so did the Duke, as well.

756
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,332
For in walked bold macgregor
and claimed it for himself.

757
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,301
Here it is.
It's true history.

Sir, you're a quick little
fellow.

01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:29,359
The highland rogue,
if you please.

764
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,195
Certainly, countess.

765
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:35,332
I am deeply honored
by his majesty's patronage.

766
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:41,205
This cabinet meeting
has been called, gentlemen,

767
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,808
To consider the very dangerous
state of affairs

768
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,811
Existing in
the Scottish highlands.

769
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,179
Our secretary of state
for Scotland

770
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:52,049
Brings with him the disturbing
intelligence

771
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,517
That the clan macgregor

772
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,186
Led by their outlaw chieftain,
rob Roy,

773
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,855
Has openly revolted.

774
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:02,059
And besieged the king's
fort at inversnaid.

775
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,494
We have
every reason to believe

776
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,330
That the other clans
will join them

777
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,199
In a full scale uprising.

778
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,335
The other clans appear
to be quite content

779
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,870
With the king's amnesty.

780
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:16,874
My lord marlborough,
the amnesty saved their hides.

781
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:20,878
But their loyalty to the king
is only skin deep.

782
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,880
Scratch a highlander

783
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,182
And you'll find a rebel
underneath.

784
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,851
Why doesn't
colonel carpenter

785
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,352
March a force up
to relieve the fort?

786
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,188
Because, sir, it might
seriously weaken

787
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,490
His Garrison at stirling

788
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,592
And in the face
of a general revolt.

789
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,197
What general revolt?

790
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:46,503
The clans rose in '48
and in '78 and in '93.

791
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:51,708
And they tried it again
only a few short months ago.

792
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:55,179
All they've ever needed
to touch them off

793
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,781
Is one troublemaker.

794
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,383
Now they have macgregor.

795
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,685
Tempest in a teapot.

796
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,221
Can be more serious
than you think, marlborough.

797
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,523
We haven't the time
for bickering.

798
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,127
Has his majesty been
made aware of the situation?

799
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,129
It was the king himself
who requested us

800
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:15,132
To sift the facts and present
our recommendations.

801
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,535
His majesty is even now
in the throne room

802
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,472
Conducting his own unique study
of the highland situation.

803
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:30,280
"And then the coachmen
had been let go.

804
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:33,617
"And montrose himself

805
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:39,389
"Was sitting
in the dust of the road.

806
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:45,295
"Rob Roy lifted the wig
of the Duke of montrose

807
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:49,166
Und"... and, and...

808
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,503
Tweaked.

809
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:56,473
What is this... tweak?

810
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,477
Tweaked his nose.

811
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:06,316
- Tweaked?
- Yeah.

812
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,520
Tweaked his nose?

813
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:19,096
- [Speaking german]
- Yes.

814
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,464
Your majesty?

815
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,300
The Duke of argyll
earnestly requests an audience

816
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,369
With his majesty.

817
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:29,840
[Speaking German]

818
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:35,345
Argyll.
[Speaking German]

819
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:38,682
His majesty
will receive him.

820
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:41,318
Your grace.

821
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:47,057
His grace,
the Duke of argyll.

822
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:48,458
Does the Duke not realize

823
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,527
That he's no longer
an accepted person at court?

824
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,862
I do indeed.

825
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:54,231
Know that I am true
to that great cause.

826
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,166
But I beg of you to explain
to his majesty

827
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,202
That when the safety
of the realm is in danger,

828
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:00,637
An honest man will go
straight to his king.

829
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,639
Then how many troops
do you propose

830
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,141
To send to the highlands?

831
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,343
I believe 6,000
would be adequate.

832
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,712
6,000?

833
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:11,181
To relieve one small fort?

834
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:12,649
My lord marlborough,

835
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,086
It is not for me to expound
the philosophy of war

836
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,090
To the hero of blenheim and
the first soldier of Europe.

837
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,525
But I must humbly propose

838
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,693
That we follow
your military examples.

839
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,163
And strike a ruthless
and crushing blow

840
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,165
At the head and front
of the trouble.

841
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,767
Oh, well...

842
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,735
I suppose
if the secretary's

843
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:35,539
Going to cite
my own campaigns against me.

844
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:39,509
He's right, marlborough.
It's reason and good sense.

845
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:40,377
Perfectly sound.

846
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,379
I agree, my lord.

847
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,515
I have never questioned
the secretary's wisdom.

848
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:49,353
My only concern is where I'll
find the money for the troops.

849
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,221
All you can think about,
walpole,

850
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:53,457
Is money, money, money.

851
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,293
I'll never mention
the word again, sir...

852
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,695
If you will show me a way
to get along without it.

853
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,131
[Laughing]

854
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:05,335
How, walpole, how montrose,
killearn.

855
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:25,655
Majesty, I am astounded
to find his grace of argyll

856
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,224
Admitted to the royal presence.

857
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:30,227
He more than any other
has been responsible

858
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,395
For thwarting
our secretary's attempt

859
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,230
To capture
the outlaw macgregor.

860
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,601
That I am proud to admit.

861
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,637
Will the countess please
explain to his majesty

862
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,339
That this brave gentleman

863
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,474
Tried to surprise
rob Roy macgregor

864
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:45,809
At his mother's funeral.

865
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:51,481
We in the highlands
respect our dead.

866
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,683
My liege, lord.

867
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:56,320
Mr. walpole will tell you
that the cabinet

868
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,322
Has this day recommended
the immediate dispatch

869
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:02,192
Of 6,000 soldiers to bring
the highlands under control.

870
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:05,362
Not one would be needed
were it not for this man.

871
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,464
They'll not need it now.

872
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,167
Send bandits
into our mountains

873
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,270
And they'll be matched
with murdering knives.

874
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,339
But if you will send me
alone and unarmed

875
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,507
To speak the words
a highlander can understand,

876
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:21,045
I will bring rob Roy macgregor
back with me to London.

877
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:23,180
Preposterous.

878
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,348
The only thing a highlander
can understand is...

879
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,483
Genug!

880
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,387
[Speaking German]

881
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:43,067
Macgregor?
Here in London?

882
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,805
[Speaking German]

883
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,208
Zehr gut...

884
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,210
[Speaking German]

885
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,230
Rob.

886
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,467
Get you back to the inn.

887
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,202
Oh, rob.
You cannot do it.

888
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,370
You keep out of this.

889
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,441
I tried to make peace.
I did as you asked, Helen Mary.

890
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,209
As your mother asked.

891
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,212
Aye, and both of you wrong.

892
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,714
I'll trust no man again
unless he be kinsmen to me.

893
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,450
Nor listen to any woman.

894
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,318
And no one will stop me

895
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,254
Blowing those cutthroats
out of the highlands.

896
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,452
[Whistling]

897
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,524
MacGregors!

898
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,398
[Speaking indistinctly]

899
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:28,057
Give a hand.

900
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,226
What's in it, lad?
She's loaded with gun powder.

901
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,562
Good, we'll rake them
with it.

902
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,478
Light your head start.

903
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:25,349
Stand back, macgregor.

904
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:29,252
Order your men
out of the fort.

905
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,054
If you don't...

906
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,077
Rob.

907
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:04,488
You've made a desperate fool
of yourself, macgregor.

908
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:07,223
And you've made
a fool of me.

909
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,193
I went to the king
to plead your cause.

910
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,195
He heard me out and bade me
bring you to London

911
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:13,229
To make your peace.

912
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,666
And now, you've committed
an overt act of war,

913
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,503
Which may well be more
than the king can forgive.

914
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:22,238
Do you think we MacGregors
will bow the knee

915
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,172
To German geordie?

916
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:27,176
No.
We took this fort.

917
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,380
And we'll hold it against
all your kings.

918
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:34,183
[All agreeing]

919
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:37,186
If you do, I'll come back
with an army

920
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,556
And take it from you
myself.

921
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:43,259
Ahh, let him go.

922
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,094
- We need no fear of them.
- We're with you, rob.

923
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:48,097
- Aye, to the last man.
All: Aye.

924
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:51,367
You're brave men.

925
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:53,537
And when
the English armies come

926
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,539
And set
the whole highlands aflame,

927
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,707
Bravely you will die
to the last man.

928
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,209
And then nothing will be left
of the clan macgregor.

929
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,446
Nothing but the women
and the burned houses

930
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,382
And the fatherless bairns,
to tell of your glorious deeds.

931
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,618
Do you think I'll sing
your praises then,

932
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:09,853
Robert macgregor?

933
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,557
No, I'll say that once
you were a man

934
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,525
Who wanted to save
your people.

935
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,461
You even denied yourself
a wife

936
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:20,530
That none might suffer
because of you.

937
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:22,131
I honored you then.

938
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:25,635
But I do not honor you now.

939
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:32,208
Oh, now,
the Lassie means well,

940
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,543
But you know how women are.

941
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:35,211
They'll have you dead
and buried

942
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,446
Before you've done
any fighting at all.

943
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,782
There'll be some fighting
by the time we gather the clans.

944
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,450
We'll gather
all the clans, rob.

945
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,218
Aye, the robertsons
of stranraer

946
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,419
Will join the drummonds of
perth...

947
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,555
And the banffshire Gordons
and the good man of the board.

948
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:46,723
We'll surely meet and go
quicker.

949
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,726
Then the Stuarts of oban
will come in.

950
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,661
And the mackenzies of kinkill

951
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,396
And the canoms of Murray
on the hill.

952
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,899
And the macclains of mull or...

953
01:13:55,932 --> 01:14:00,169
[Speaking indistinctly]

954
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,638
They'll find a whole swarm
of blue bonnets

955
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,507
A buzzin' about their ears.

956
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:13,249
Where is rob Roy?

957
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,619
Sire, macgregor
has refused to come.

958
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:17,186
Worse than that,

959
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,622
He has taken your fort
at inversnaid

960
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,357
And is determined to hold it.

961
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,627
If the other clans join him,

962
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,629
The army these gentlemen
have vantaged upon you

963
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:27,163
Will be most solemnly needed

964
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,633
In a such a pass,
your majesty.

965
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,367
The only reparation
I can make

966
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,170
Is humbly to offer my sword
against the rebels,

967
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,539
To redeem my failure.

[Speaking German]

971
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:04,067
Is this rob Roy?

972
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,856
His majesty awaits you.

973
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,424
Alone.

974
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,657
I have come to your majesty

975
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,292
Because you sent the Duke
of argyll to me.

976
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:38,394
I trust him.

977
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,398
And ask his pardon.

978
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,502
From your majesty,
I ask no favor but one.

979
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,437
I beg of you.

980
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:52,141
Grant amnesty to my clan.

981
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:57,080
As for me,
you may do what you will.

982

[Speaking German]

983
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:07,857
I have heard...

984
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:10,126
I hear many things.

985
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:21,504
I hear you've captured
my soldiers and take my fort.

986
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:24,107
You bring disgrace
upon my clan.

987
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,675
And take my name away from me.

988
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:29,478
I pray, your majesty.
Let me remove this insolence.

989
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:33,683
The king does not fear
the bold enemy.

990
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:37,320
The king fears only
the self seeking friend.

991
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:46,062
I give you back your sword...

992
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,496
And your name.

993
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,703
Rob Roy macgregor.

994
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,344
You are the great rogue.

995
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:05,214
And you, sire,

996
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:09,418
Are a great king.

997
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:11,654
Oh, it must have been
a wonderful sight, you.

998
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,189
And what happened then?

999
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,758
Right into the palace
we went.

1000
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,426
And there in the great hall,

1001
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,196
Sitting all alone with his hat
on his head,

1002
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,198
Was king geordie.

1003
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:25,201
Glowering out of a great wig.

1004
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,203
Oh, I wish I could
have seen him.

1005
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:29,205
And what was he like?

1006
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,208
He was like her ladyship's
Galloway nag.

1007
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,112
When he's just going
to take a bite out of you.

1008
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:39,215
And you should have seen
the lords and Dukes

1009
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,217
With their clipped up breeches.

1010
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,519
And wee buttons hanging
about the knees

1011
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,353
To clip them up.

1012
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,389
And not a man's sword
among them.

1013
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:49,058
And right through
all the courtiers

1014
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,461
Bending and bowing like
barley in the wind,

1015
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,363
Marches rob.

1016
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:58,768
As proud and as straight
as an evergreen pine.

1017
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:01,204
And he says to the king,
he says, geordie,

1018
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:04,540
I've come to get my name back
and I'll take my pardon now.

1019
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,376
Aye, the king liked the look
of rob.

1020
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,612
And the king said,
"macgregor," he said

1021
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,247
"How would you like to be

1022
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,649
My secretary of state
for Scotland?"

1023
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,251
And rob said, "I'd do it,
geordie",

1024
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,452
"But I have got to go home now

1025
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,721
"And look after my great herds
of cattle.

1026
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,457
Give the post back to argyll."

1027
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,126
Do you hear that, Helen Mary?

1028
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:26,329
I heard.

1029
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,131
When do you think
he'll be back?

1030
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:31,234
Oh, you needn't be looking
for him yet, Lassie.

1031
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,335
The way they were wining
and dining,

1032
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,237
He won't be back for a week.

1033
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,172
And what were
the fine ladies like?

1034
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:39,442
They were covered with jewels
all over.

1035
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,178
Great red heathen
carbuncle stones

1036
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,346
On their fingers.

1037
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,849
And diamonds as big
as duck's eggs

1038
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:49,252
Hanging from their ears.

1039
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:53,356
Were the ladies very...

1040
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:55,691
Were they clothed
very beautiful?

1041
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:59,695
Well, uh, they had
Crocker nonnies

1042
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,132
And barbs of ribbon
piled up on their heads.

1043
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,801
Oh, and quilt and combs.

1044
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:08,271
And they walked
on wee cloppers

1045
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,873
With heels so high

1046
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,674
That a man had to carry them
in his arm

1047
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:13,042
For fear they would fall over.

1048
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:15,211
Oh, that must have been
a lovely sight.

1049
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,612
The painted hussies.

1050
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,215
They better not make
sheep's eyes at our Robbie.

1051
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,516
Oh, it's only natural

1052
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,351
When a man marches into a town
after a battle,

1053
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:25,188
Swinging along to the skattle
of the pipes.

1054
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:26,622
That the ladies
would look down

1055
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,857
From their balconies
and windows

1056
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:29,492
It's perpetually a...

1057
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,228
If he's a fine figure of a man
with an eagle feather

1058
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:35,164
Shining in his bonnet
and his tartans flying.
