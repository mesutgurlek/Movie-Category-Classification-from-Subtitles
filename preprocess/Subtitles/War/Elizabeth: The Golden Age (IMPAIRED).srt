You like him, don't you?

323
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,350
He's a man
that lives in a world
far beyond the court.

00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,531
It's refreshing.

326
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,362
Well.

327
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,561

<i>SIR WALTER: Can you imagine</i>
<i>what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

330
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:22,181
For weeks, you see nothing
but the horizon,
perfect and empty.

331
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,757
You live in the grip of fear.

332
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,582
Fear of storms.

333
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,128
Fear of sickness on board.

334
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,691
Fear of the immensity.

335
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,304
So you must drive
that fear down deep
into your belly.

336
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,406
Study your charts.

337
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,075
Watch your compass.

338
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,938
Pray for a fair wind.

339
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,513
And hope,

Let them wait.

346
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,527
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

347
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,665
You were hoping.

348
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,342
SIR WALTER: At first,
it's no more than
a haze on the horizon.

349
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,584
So you watch.

350
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,251
You watch.

351
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,687
Then it's a smudge,

352
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,501
a shadow on the far water.

353
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,501
For a day.

354
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,339
For another day.

355
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:56,839
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

356
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:03,052
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

357
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,419
You dare to whisper
the word.

358
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,454
Land.

359
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,630

The true adventure.

Coming out of
the vast unknown,

364
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,841
out of the immensity,

365
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,247
into new life.

00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,418
That,

367
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,649
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

368
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,104
I like
your immensities.

369
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:01,510
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

370
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,039
Such great spaces
make us small.

371
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,917
Do we discover
the New World,
Mr. Raleigh,

372
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,480
or does the New World
discover us?

373
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,391
You speak like
a true explorer.

374
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,897
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

375
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,201
And I like you.

376
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,806
You know, of course,
that when I like a man,
I reward him.

377
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,147
I have heard that.

378
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,117
And what have you
to say about it?

379
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,554
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

380
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,921
Is the mission
not the man?

381
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,927
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

382
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,797
Go on.

383
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,706
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

384
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,677
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

my concern

because you're pretty,

and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,987
Yes?

486
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,382
You cannot
save England now.

487
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,787
The Enterprise
has begun.

488
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,866
ELIZABETH: Ambassador?

489
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,435
What do you know
of the Enterprise
of England?

490
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,703
DON GUERAU: The Enterprise?
Forgive me, Majesty,
I'm not familiar...

491
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:36,213
Two armies landing
on the coasts
of Sussex and Norfolk.

492
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,215
Mary Stuart is to be
set free and placed
on the English throne,

493
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,080
and I am to be
assassinated.

494
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,585
Does any of this
sound familiar?

495
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,881
DON GUERAU: I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

496
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,115
Well, I refer to
this plan as the
Enterprise of England,

497
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,159
it should more
accurately be called
<i>la Empresa de Inglaterra</i>

498
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,023
because it is
a Spanish plan.

499
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,995
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

500
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,929
your king,
to attack my country.

501
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,129
DON GUERAU: Your country?
It is my country
that is under attack.

502
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,398
Your so-called <i>piratas,</i>
your pirates attack
our merchant ships daily.

503
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,808
And you...
You think we don't know
where the orders come from?

504
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,676
The whole world knows
these pirates sail up
the Thames,

505
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,548
all the way
to your royal bed.

506
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,194
You will leave
my presence, sir.

507
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,097
Go back to your rat hole.

508
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:35,570
Tell Philip I fear
neither him, nor his priests,
nor his armies.

509
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,005
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

510
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,303
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

511
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,174
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

512
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,306
You see a leaf fall
and you think you know
which way the wind blows.

513
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,116
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

514
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,485
that will sweep away
your pride.

515
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,321
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

516
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,927
I have a hurricane in me
that will strip Spain bare
if you dare to try me!

517
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,416
What are you staring at?

518
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:34,089
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

519
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,263
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

Mars is due to take
the ascendant

three days
after the anniversary

which governs
the fortune of all princes

Princes of the

00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,835
I mean to say,
a prince who is

Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,572
What does it mean?

538
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:36,519
It means the rise
of a great empire, Majesty,
and the fall of another.

539
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,721
Convulsions.

540
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,423
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

541
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,727
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

542
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,860
Astrology is,
as yet, more an art
than a science.

543
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,371
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

544
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,067
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

545
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:02,545
(LAUGHS) He means,
will I be assassinated?

546

Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

547
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:17,793
And the private life
of this prince
of the female gender,

548
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,022
what do the stars
foretell there?

549
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,895
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

550
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,097
Surely the stars
foretell matters
of state, Dr. Dee.

551
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,609
For such a prediction
I must look
in a different chart.

552
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,977
Wonderful.

553
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,316
Such strength.

554
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,485
You will need
all your strength
in the days to come.

555
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,356
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

556
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,600
I have not seen
fear in your face
for such a long time.

557
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,165
Have I reason to fear?

558
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,469
Something has
weakened you.

559
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,306
There are
hard days coming.

560
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,682
But I am no prophet.

561
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,789
I see no more
than the shadows
of ghosts.

Sorry to come
aboard your ship

without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

565

Welcome aboard.

The Queen wishes
to see you.

567
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,224
She asks me
to assure you...

568
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,390
I need
no assurances, Bess.

569
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,395
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

570
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,961
Then you should
say so in person.

571
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,078
This is
my life, Bess.

572
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,451
This is where
I belong.

573
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,524
It seems to be
a Ionely life.

574
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,494
Sometimes.
But it's the life
I've chosen.

575
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,991
I understand.

576
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,075
You ask permission to go.

577
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,121
Yes, Majesty.

578
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,646
You plan to return
to your colony

579
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:06,185
for two, maybe three,
four years.

580
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,699
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

581
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,101
That is a long time.

582
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,469
There's nothing
for me here.

583
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,976

I know what I'm to do.
I know the risks.

584
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,375

No. You're wrong.

585
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,882
You're needed here.

586
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,746
As captain of my
personal guard.

587
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,115
Captain of your guard?

588
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,175
Kneel.

589

Majesty.

590
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,222
I said, kneel.

592
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,803
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

593
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,339
This is too great an honor.

594
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,812
If it's so great an honor,
why are you staring
at your boots?

595
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,214
You know why.

596
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,514
Now you stare
at the wall.

597
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,923
Am I so hideous
you can't even look
me in the face?

598
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,017
Why do you speak
like a fool

599
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,154
when you are anything
but a fool?

Fool?

601
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,662
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

You come here

And I've...

604
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,978
You have real adventures.
You go where the maps end.
And I'd...

605
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,846
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

606

are gathering.

They call her
the Virgin Queen.

Why is that, sir?

647
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,747
Can it be that no man
will have her?

throw you round.

to show us his skill.

that they'll conspire
in your favor,

And some

969

spread their wings
like eagles and soar
on the wind.

970

You are a wise man,

I can offer you
no words of comfort.

that sails against us,

no more liberty in England

987

And release Raleigh.

988
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,195
He is forgiven.

989
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,407
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

990
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:47,512
Let the fleet know
we're on our way,
Mr. Calley!

has been engaged.

1000

With what gain?

1002
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,304

to advance.

SAILOR: Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

1004
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,821
Another four
ships lost.

1005
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,421
We must continue
to engage and harass
the enemy.

1006
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:10,369
We're outgunned,

(SAILORS SHOUTING)

1008

We must fall back
and defend the coast.

DRAKE: If the wind
is with us, Walter,

1010
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,715
we can attack them
with fire ships.

1011
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:24,718
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

1012
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,617
that may force
them to scatter.

1013
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,382
We can't get
anywhere near them.

1014
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:31,721
We have to break
their formation.
That's our only chance.

are barely
a day away, Majesty.

to safe ground.

the gravity of the situation.

We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

1021

Soon now,
we will meet them
face to face.

1022

I am resolved in the midst

to live or die
