1
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,179
RICHARD: All of our
earliest memories are lies,

2
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,945
family mythologies
handed down to us repeatedly

3
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,578
until they become as real
as what actually happened.

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,317
WOMAN: Get the door, Mama.

5
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:05,263
You may be king,
you may possess the world and it's gold

6
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,457
(WAILING)

7
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,196
But gold won't bring you happiness

8
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,706
When you're growing old

9
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:19,975
The world still is the same,
you never change it

10
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,547
WOMAN: Get the damn door, Mama.

11
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,949
As sure as the stars shine above

12
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,089
RICHARD: No one in the family can say
exactly when my mother went crazy.

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,753
According to Grandma,
she was always that way.

14
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,592
WOMAN: Get the damn door, Mama.

15
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,633
Dad said it started
when she lost the babies.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,466
Seven miscarriages in eight years
can tend to do that to a person.

17
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,301
That's why my arrival on the scene
came as somewhat of a surprise.

18
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,341
(BABY CRYING)

19
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,270
I was born with the umbilical cord
wrapped around my neck.

20
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,973
I've been pissed off ever since.

21
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,776
(BABY CRYING)

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,361
The world still is the same,
you never change it

23
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,271
RICHARD: The miscarriages had taken
such a toll on Mom

24
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,245
that she somehow got it in her head
that she'd lost me as well.

25
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:35,654
Well, you're nobody
'til somebody loves you

26
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,761
So find yourself somebody to love

27
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,631
(BABY CRYING)

28
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,075
RICHARD: Shortly after I was born,

29
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,482
my mother drove me to California
and placed me in a Catholic orphanage.

30
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,251
I wish I could tell you
about my earliest memories there,

31
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,655
but the truth is, no one knows.

32
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,528
Back home, she claimed I had died at birth
and couldn't tell anyone where I was.

33
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,696
What?

34
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,302
Two years later, after another miscarriage,

35
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,140
she suddenly remembered
where she'd left me.

36
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,114
Despite all of Mom's craziness,
Dad never stopped loving her.

37
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,274
But they divorced,

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,150
and I was passed around
like an unwanted Christmas fruitcake.

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,563
Eventually, my mother decided
she needed to be a full-time mom again,

40
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,265
and that we needed a fresh start.

41
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,364
I disagreed.

42
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,501
-You'll have your own room.
-I already have my own room.

43
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,601
I'll get you bunk beds.

44
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,738
But why do I need bunk beds?
I'm an only child.

45
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,514
It wasn't all bad.
The best thing in my life was my dad.

46
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,185
His name was Dell Fong,
and he was Chinese.

47
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,725
I identify him as being Chinese,

48
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,317
because his race
is the most vibrant memory I have of him.

49
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,489
Richard, that's not safe.
Come on, time to work.

50
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,532
Maybe you can be a cook, too, someday.

51
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,352
(RATTLING)

52
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,921
I could never be a cook like my father

53
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,552
because I'd already made
my career choice.

54
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,220
Superhero.

55
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,698
As a superhero, you occasionally
have to deal with something annoying,

56
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,359
like Kryptonite.

57
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,665
My Kryptonite was called home.

58
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,308
My mother had this ritual.

59
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,743
Every year, she'd celebrate the birthday
of each of the children she miscarried

60
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,681
by buying them a birthday card
and taking an overdose of sleeping pills.

61
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,809
That happened seven times a year.

62
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,845
I wouldn't call her successful at suicide,
but she was punctual.

63
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,595
My dad's Kryptonite?

64
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,360
(THUDDING)

65
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,494
Soy sauce.

66
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,559
(CRASHING)

67
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,450
"Most people go to their graves
with their music inside them."

68
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,586
What was Mr. Holmes saying?

69
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,600
Come on, guys, it's not that hard.

70
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,694
He's saying that most people die

71
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,265
without discovering their own genius,

72
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:21,507
without expressing the uniqueness
that makes them special.

73
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,572
And that's what
this little exercise is about.

74
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,213
I want you to give me three minutes
about something, anything that you know,

75
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,757
that your classmates may not know.

76
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,997
Mr. Pimentel, I like your spirit.
Come on up.

77
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,768
Butt kisser.

78
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,334
RICHARD: Funny how things happen.

79
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,673
Only in hindsight do you realize how
something as small as raising your hand

80
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,871
can change your entire life.

81
00:06:54,981 --> 00:07:01,011
Well, have any of you ever eaten chicken
at the Golden Dragon,

82
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,248
the Rickshaw Gardens
or the Chinese Gardens?

83
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,847
Well, you know the restaurants
don't buy live chickens, right?

84
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,654
They buy dead ones.

85
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,356
And you know where they get those
chickens and how those chickens die?

86
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,594
I do, 'cause I killed them.
I killed your dinner.

87
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,070
I've chopped the head off chickens
for every Chinese restaurant in the city.

88
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,470
You find the biggest knife you can find,

89
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,510
then you have to grab the chicken
by the lower of its neck and swing...

90
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,341
I could've talked for hours.

91
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,247
Mr. Parks was almost as happy as I was,
because he ran the speech club.

92
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,184
NEWSCASTER ON RADIO:... warnings of
approaching missiles over the Arctic.

93
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,745
And in other news, Soviet Premier
Khrushchev has made great strides

94
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,124
in his policy towards peaceful coexistence
with non-Communist countries.

95
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,722
And I believe Premier Khrushchev
has made great strides

96
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,861
in his policy towards peaceful coexistence
with non-Communist countries.

97
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,768
I may not have been
the most original speaker,

98
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,397
but I became a star.

99
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,570
Forget that superhero dream,
now I knew what I really wanted to be.

100
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,936
Mom?

101
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,341
I forget whose birthday it was this time.
I just know it wasn't mine.

102
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,674
My mother ended up surviving
only to leave me a few months later.

103
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,983
It didn't matter, though,
because I had plans.

104
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,180
Things didn't happen
as quickly as I expected.

105
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,982
A few years after high school, I got a job
working in the kitchen of a go-go bar

106
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,546
to earn money for college.

107
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,186
Richard, I need that order 10 minutes ago.
I don't pay you to stand around.

108
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,027
I still had my dream,
but there were a few distractions.

109
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,676
Bambi was a visual effect
that would only be rivaled years later

110
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,179
by my first viewing of Star Wars.

111
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,557
Tiff, you're exposed.

112
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,423
What are you working on?

113
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,728
There's a tournament
at Portland State University,

114
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,496
and it's open to anybody.

115
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,367
So I figured if I went there
and I did really well, I might get noticed,

116
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,135
and who knows, maybe a scholarship.

117
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,470
No shit.

118
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,342
-What are you gonna wear?
-I don't know. Probably a sweater.

119
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,876
Oh, honey, no way.

120
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,017
You see that guy over there?
He owns the biggest men's store in town.

121
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,285
Girls.

122
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,373
Did you hear about the midnight rambler?

123
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,243
Everybody got to go

124
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,148
Did you hear about the midnight rambler?

125
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,207
MAN: Well done.

126
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,048
RICHARD: Yeah, thank you, sir.

127
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,547
Hey.

128
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,293
Mr. Pimentel?

129
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,990
I'm Ben Padrow with the University.
I'm chairman of the Speech Department.

130
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,033
Hi, Dr. Padrow, I know who you are.

131
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,694
Well, congratulations. I'm impressed.

132
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,359
Nice suit.

133
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,564
Oh, thank you very much.

134
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,663
Where do you go to school?

135
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,765
Actually, sir, I'm not in school right now.

136
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,642
I'm a little strapped financially.
But I'd love to come to State.

137
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,740
Well, we have scholarships
and financial aid. We'd love to help.

138
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,011
Come see me.

139
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,347
Yes, sir.

140
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,923
(CHUCKLING)

141
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,767
You're late.

142
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,539
I'm sorry. I was over at the admissions...

143
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,876
No time for apologies.
On the stage, let's go, come on.

144
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,042
I picked three speeches, like you asked.
Now, which one do you wanna see first?

145
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,518
The good one. Tick, tock. Come on.

146
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,952
All right.

147
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,861
Last meal's been eaten.

148
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,659
Last prayer has been said.

149
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,066
The prisoner is strapped
into the electric chair...

150
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,835
My black brothers will gladly sacrifice
for freedom overseas

151
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,206
when there's freedom in Birmingham...

152
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:30,738
...until my right to vote in this country
precedes my obligation to die for it.

153
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,019
Just sit down there, please. Right here.

154
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,166
You like it up there?

155
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,601
Yeah, l...

156
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,833
I like it better than anything.

157
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,999
Why?

158
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,008
I don't know.

159
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,601
Stop right there.

160
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,580
That's the first honest thing you've said,
"l don't know."

161
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:08,211
You don't know why you're up there.
You don't even know what you're saying.

162
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,686
Sure, you're talented and passionate.

163
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,485
You could fool some blue-haired judge
in high school, but not here.

164
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,492
This is another league.

165
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,454
Wait a minute, l...

166
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,523
I've won every single tournament
I've ever entered.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
You didn't think that I was good?

168
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,836
I think you're the most gifted,
natural speaker I have ever seen,

169
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,876
and you have incredible potential.

170
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,503
And you are completely full of shit.

171
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,278
Hold on, wait a minute. So that's it?

172
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,117
I've been working towards this
for the last six years, all right?

173
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,125
I'm not asking... It doesn't have to be
a full scholarship. I can...

174
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,957
Look, my advice? You're not ready.

175
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,397
Go live a life. Fill yourself up.

176
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,696
Find out what's important,
earn a point of view.

177
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,793
-l...
-Earn.

178
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,136
Earn a point of view. Then come back
when you've got something to say.

179
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,135
RICHARD: "Get a life, " my ass.

180
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,265
I had a life, and there was no way
I was going back to it.

181
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,469
Fortunately, the government
had this program

182
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,036
where you could gain valuable
life experience and see the world.

183
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,380
They would guarantee your education
in exchange for services rendered.

184
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,351
It was called Vietnam.

185
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,355
Now my girl you're so young and pretty

186
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,030
And one thing I know is true

187
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,535
My reaction may have been a bit hasty.

188
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:11,940
After six months in country,
life in Portland didn't seem all that bad.

189
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,276
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'

190
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,044
Watched his hair been turnin' grey

191
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,986
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away

192
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,320
Oh, yes, I know it

193
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,518
Yeah

194
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,655
-He's been workin' so hard
- Yeah

195
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,223
-I've been workin' too, baby
- Yeah

196
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,327
Every night and day

197
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,999
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

198
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,207
We gotta get out of this place

199
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,278
If it's the last thing we ever do

200
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,008
We gotta get out of this place

201
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:58,955
'Cause girl, there's a better life
for me and you

00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,185
(GUNS FIRING)

203
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,588
So we're gonna move off this hill
before they decide to take it from us.

204
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,103
I need four volunteers to stay behind.
This is your chance to be a hero.

205
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,966
I always wanted to be a hero.

206
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,905
All right, there we go. I need three more.

207
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,911
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'

208
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,884
-Yeah
-Every single day

209
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

210
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,726
We gotta get out of this place

211
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,431
If it's the last thing we ever do

212
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,894
Sector One. Sector One. We need help!
Under fire in the sector. Over.

213
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,633
Let's move!

214
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,470
We're out. Let's go. We're out.

215
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:57,080
What you did out there took courage.
Know your outfit is proud of you.

216
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,550
I just wanted you to understand
that I'm personally proud of you.

217
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,109
I got something planned for you
you can enjoy,

218
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,314
while you're right here in Vietnam.

219
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,652
Carry on.

220
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,062
Come here, sister

221
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,299
Papa's in the swing

222
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,132
Oh, the mother lode.

223
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,100
(LAUGHING)

224
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
Who needs a medal, huh?

225
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,033
I don't want a medal, man.

226
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,111
He ain't no drag

227
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,307
To surviving the surviving.

228
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,442
Papa's got a brand new bag

229
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,053
Come here, mama

230
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,353
And dig this crazy scene

231
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,220
He's not too fancy

232
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,064
But his line is pretty clean

233
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,622
(EXPLOSION)

234
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,362
He ain't no drag

235
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,663
Bring it on, gooks.

236
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,205
Papa's got a brand new bag

(INTENSE HIGH PITCHED RINGING)

241
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,860
Richard! Point to where it hurts.
Can you hear me?

242
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,196
(RINGING CONTINUES)

243
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,145
You got tinnitus. It's ringing in the ears.

244
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,814
I can't hear you.

245
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,494
(HIGH PITCHED RINGING)

246
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,053
(DISTORTED) You're lucky.
You only lost half your hearing.

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,066
Your friends lost theirs completely.

248
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,967
If I'm deaf,
why do I hear this noise all the time?

249
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,096
You lost your upper register,
and hearing aids won't help.

250
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,641
By the time you can hear
those high sounds,

251
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,542
the low sounds will be so loud,
you'd go crazy. You understand?

252
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,705
Can you just make the noise stop?

253
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,749
I can't. That's tinnitus.

254
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,378
Some days will be better than others,
but it won't stop.

255
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,379
Ever.

RICHARD: This is my letter of acceptance
to the university.

260
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,865
And I also brought
a couple of recommendations.

261
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,302
No, no, I can't authorize this.

262
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,438
I'm sorry. Could you speak up
and look at me when...

263
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,874
Thank you.

264
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,737
I can't authorize government funds
to send you to college.

265
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,941
Why?

266
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,415
You're deaf.

267
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,448
I'm what?

268
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,886
It's a deaf joke.

269
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,459
You're worse than deaf, you're confused.

270
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,224
You can hear only vowels, no consonants.

271
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,689
Yeah.

272
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,859
Well, if you can only hear vowels,
you've got two choices,

273
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,529
learn to read lips or move to Hawaii.

274
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,433
(CHUCKLING)

275
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,903
I don't wanna go to Hawaii,
I wanna go to college.

276
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,547
Listen, even if you graduate,
they won't be able to place you.

277
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,139
Why? 'Cause I'm deaf?

278
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,843
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
She had a job.

279
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,011
-No.
-No, I know she had a job...

280
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,214
No, because of the ringing.

-Night and day, right?
-Yeah.

282

-In both ears?
-Uh-huh.

283
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,121
You won't be able to concentrate.
You'll forget what you've read.

00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,893
You won't have any friends.

285

You'll be incompetent
and you'll be foul-mouthed.

No shit?

287

You know what?
Who the hell are you, huh?

288
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,237
You got a desk and a clipboard.
You don't know me.

289
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,875
'Cause if you did, you'd know
how close I am to coming over that desk

and shoving that clipboard
up your fat, pompous ass.

graduate, and then I'm gonna get a job,

in your goddamn chart.

-Yeah.
-I'll be right back.

Hell, I only work half the time myself.

303
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,588
You don't say much. Got a light?

304
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,125
Buddy, you got a light?

305
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,427
Hey, man, you deaf?

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,633
Yeah, I am.

307
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,931

I'd hate them a lot more
if I didn't agree with them.

You wanna get a beer?

00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,536
What?

312
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,776
A beer. A brew. Cold one.

313
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,681
It's 10:00 in the morning, man.

314
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
So?

315

482
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,004
What?

483
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,107
How come you said "dick"?

484
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,083
Because it was funnier.

485
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:12,505
Sunshine came softly
through my a-window today

486
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,879
Could've tripped out easy
a-but I've a-changed my ways

487
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:26,120
It'll take time, I know it
but in a while

488
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,789
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

489
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,762
Oh. You.

490
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,599
Yeah, remember me? Immature guy.

491
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,003
Yeah. I got class.

492
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,132
Oh, I'll walk you.

493
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,573
No, thanks.

494
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,111
You're going to be mine

495
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,071
I'll tell you right now

496
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,412
Any trick in the book now, baby

497
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,715
All that I can find

498
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,199
It's sold out.
How are we going to get in, genius?

499
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,432
We'll figure that out.

500
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,839
What if that guy's coming?

501
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,104
Then the two of you can hold hands.
Don't worry about it.

502
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,043
Okay, here she comes.

503
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,154
No. You're Richard?

504
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,851
Oh, my God, this is so trippy.
What are the odds?

505
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,416
Where's your friend? He's not coming?

506
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,326
Nikos? Nah.

507
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,257
Aw, man.

508
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,861
I don't think this is a good idea.

509
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,599
Come on. You need the gas money,
we need the ride.

510
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:47,804
Look, come on, I'll be nice.
I promise. Please?

511
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,272
Yeah, well, if you're mean, I'll leave you.

512
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,910
All right, that sounds fair.
Art, that sound fair to you?

513
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,144
-Art thinks that's fair.
-Oh, come on, baby. I'll drive.

514
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,516
I like to dream

515
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,324
Yes, yes, right between my sound machine

516
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,527
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night

517
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,831
Any place it goes is right

518
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,635
Goes far, flies near,
to the stars away from here

519
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:21,235
Well, you don't know what we can find

520
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,746
Why don't you come with me, little girl

521
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,873
On a magic carpet ride

522
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,784
You don't know what we can see

523
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,049
Why don't you tell your dreams to me

524
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,250
Fantasy will set you free

525
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,364
Are you guys coming?

526
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,424
Yeah, we'll be right in.

527
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,105
RICHARD: Pardon me.

528
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,799
Hi.

529
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,543
You better not molest me back here.

530
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,812
(SHUSHES) I have a plan. Bite me.

531
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,147
Do what?

532
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,712
(YELLS) Oh, my God, he's got me! Help!

533
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,987
Help! For the love of God,
somebody help me! Help!

534
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,051
No, no, he's contagious. He'll get you, too.

535
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,221
Go, go get help. Hurry!

536

You didn't have a ticket, did you?

540
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,382
RICHARD: Sorry?

541
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,890
You didn't have a ticket, did you?

542
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,550
Don't you need somebody to love?

543
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,824
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

544
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:50,458
Hey, hey. I really can't see
anything from here.

545
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,230
You better find somebody to love

546
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,466
GIRL 1: Hey!

547
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,471
GIRL 2: That is so uncool.

548
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,544
Yes, and your mind

549
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,847
Better?

550
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,412
Your mind is so full of red

551
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,983
Don't you want somebody to love?

552
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,552
Don't you need somebody to love?

00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,986
I like that.

559
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,893
I need to shower.

560
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,381
(SHOWER RUNNING)

Hey, morning, Tarzan.

564
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:37,063
I'd invite you in, but I don't think
there's room for both of us in here.

565
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,871
-Hey, babe.
-Hey. You remember Richard.

566

Uh-huh.

567
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,306
What, do you guys, like, live together?

568
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,849
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

569
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,976
What, are you guys, like, friends or what?

570
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,848
We have an open relationship.

571
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:57,021
You look a little confused, man.
You need me to draw you a picture?

572
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,828
You just spent the night with me
and you sleep with this guy, too?

573
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,925
I'm not confining myself.

574
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,974
So are you trying to get back at me?

575
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,378
No, Richard, this is my life.

576
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,408
We had fun last night, right?
I like you, but I like Nikos, too.

577
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,845
Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.

578
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,815
I can't handle this shit.

579
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,425
Richard?

580
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,659
Richard, I know you hear me.

581
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,328
Look, I guess I should've warned you.

582
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,132
Maybe before I looked in the shower.

583
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:45,164
Well, let's just have fun. I mean,
we don't even know what we have yet.

584
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,734
I think what we have
is one too many sausages in the bun.

585
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:53,512
Look, I like to have fun, too,
but your idea of fun is a testicle tag team.

586
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,575
No, that's... Wrong guy.

587
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,887
You're old-fashioned. That's cute.

588
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,654
Am I going to see you again?

589
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,153
Hmm?

590
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,891
Okay.

591
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,736
Here's how this works.

592
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,132
If you're with me,
when you're with me, you're with me.

593
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,510
I don't wanna hear about him,
I don't wanna see him,

594
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,550
I don't wanna smell him.

595

That's fair.

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight

597

I got the feeling that something ain't right

598
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,025
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair

599
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,804
And I'm wondering
how I'll get down the stairs

00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,705

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you

604
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,152
And I'm wondering what it is I should do

605

It's so hard to keep this smile from my face

Well, you started out with nothing

00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,708
And you're proud
that you're a self made man

You're a decorated veteran.

You mind telling me
where you were wounded?

I don't usually divulge that information
till the second date.

So what do you wanna do
with your life, Richard?

618
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,565
I wanna help people.

I lied about my experience

621
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,884
and got a great job
with an insurance company.

to front them, you know?

Some buttoned-down asshole who's
already got his nose up the man's ass.

634

Hello?

643
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,809
Wait, whose birthday?

644
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,659
They better be
the best pancakes on the planet.

645
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,629
Forget it, I'm not hungry anymore.

646
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,462
Oh, that's funny.

647
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,199
-You know what else is funny?
-What?

00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,846
Thank you, appreciate that.

00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,783

00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,783
Yes, your highness.

-You want your coat on or off?
-Off.

Okay.

657
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,498
All right.

RICHARD: You need a menu?

00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,605
No, no. I...

660
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,335
I know what I want.

661
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,134
Good evening.

00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,545
I mean, good morning.

Hey, we'll just have the pancakes.

665

Yeah.

666
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,982
Actually, my manager
told me that we can't serve.

667
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,188
-You can't serve pancakes?
-Why? They...

668
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,288
They got them.

669
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,833
Look, I don't want to sound rude...

670

I think you two need to leave.

she needs some hot man love.

in the phone book.

714

I wouldn't take no for an answer.
I found jobs for every vet I knew,

RICHARD: At that time, the only people
vets trusted were other vets,

721
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,176
so I got a job at a government agency
helping them find work.

722
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,153
What is it that you're afraid of,

723
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,290
that he can't work with you,
or that you can't work with him?

724
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,195
You had to stop
and think about that, didn't you?

725
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,326
As soon as I was hired,
Mike said he wanted a job.

726
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,425
Nothing tickled him more

727
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,403
than trying to tear down a system
that made no sense to him.

728
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,666
Mike was a natural headhunter.

I'm gonna keep calling you back
till you pull your head out of your ass.

00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,773
Listen, lady, listen to me.

732
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,748
I left my leg in a rice paddy.

733
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,648
I get a big, fat check every month.

734
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,709
I don't need to be
begging work for these guys.

735
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:31,947
But they need me.

736
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,614
And they need
somebody like you with balls

737
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,784
to give them a freaking chance
to make your company better.

738
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,854
What?

739
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,961
Yeah? Well, amen, sister.

740
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,832
Listen, maybe you and l
could get a drink sometime.

741
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,104
All right, maybe not. All right, take care.

742
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,900
RICHARD: The word was out.

743
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:59,039
I could find jobs for any disabled person,
veteran or otherwise.

She's a file clerk and she hasn't missed
a day of work in 20 years.

-MAN: Sounds good.
-Tell him I'm a dwarf. Tell him.

746
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,121
-Can she start tomorrow?
-Yeah. And she's a dwarf.

747
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,055
-A what?
-A dwarf.

748
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,491
How the hell can a dwarf be a file clerk?

749
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,088
She specializes in L through Z.

00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,162
-I have a step stool, stupid.
-She got a step stool. Come on.

751
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,038
-Okay, I'll give her a shot.
-Right.

752
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,266
-Have her come in tomorrow.
-Great.

753
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,256
Hello?

754
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,529
Is this the Governor's office?

755
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:58,237
Yeah, well, this is Richard Pimentel.
I have a note to return a call.

756
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,468
Okay.

757
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,474
Hello.

758
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,578
Yes, sir.

759
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,347
Well...

760

'Cause you're selfish.

00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,919

763
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:20,985
MIKE: What?

764
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,329
What? You wanna fucking take me on?
You wanna take me on, tough guy?

765
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,734
Yeah, I would love
to talk about that. Absolutely.

766
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,533
MIKE: I don't give a shit, man.

767
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,464
Okay. Thank you very much.

768
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,702
Listen, bro, how about
I come down there right now

769
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,507
and I beat you to death
with my plastic leg?

770
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,605
What? When?

771
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,375
You can start tomorrow?

772
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,645
He'll be there.

773
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,053
Hey, bro, listen, you're doing
a great thing for a vet, man.

774
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,485
Don't fuck it up.

775
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,368
-To our future.
-Absolutely.

776
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,968
So, when the Governor's office
called me last week...

777
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,476
Whoa. Excuse me?

778
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,604
I guess his office
had heard something about me.

779
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,084
I don't remember the exact words,
but something like innovator or genius.

780
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,416
-But you don't remember?
-No, not the exact words.

781
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,115
Anyway, the upshot is

782
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,618
they want me to create a program

783
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,323
to train employers to hire
and work with the disabled persons.

784
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,562
-Seriously? Honey, that's amazing.
-That's what I thought.

785
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,933
What were they doing before?

786
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,666
There is no before.
This is the first time they've done this.

787
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,732
-I'd be starting from scratch.
-Well, you little ground-breaker, you.

788
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,073
You heard about this for a week
and you never told me?

789
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,478
Well, I didn't know
it was going to be definite yet.

790
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,608
And the bad news is
I'd have to quit my job.

791
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,119
But the good news is,
is that once the program was created,

792
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,315
they wanna send me around
the country and train all the trainers.

793
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,790
So the good news is you'll be traveling?

794
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,887
Yeah. If you want to,
you could come with me for some of it.

795
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,731
What's wrong?

796
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,567
I just... Nothing. Nothing.

797
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,933
Well, come on, you seem bummed.

798
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,532
I'm not bummed. It's...

799
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,338
It's just that I hardly see you now as it is,

800
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,042
so what's it going to be like
when you start traveling?

801
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,574
No, no. This... Look,
this is a completely different job. Okay?

802
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
When I'm in town, I'm gonna be at home.

803
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,683
I've been working a lot lately
and you've been really great about that.

804
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,227
This is a really big deal.

805
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,757
I know.

806
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,233
Okay. I'm proud of you.

807
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,938
So when are you gonna tell Mike
you're leaving?

808
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,576
Mike's the hardest worker you got, okay?
He's a little bit volatile.

809
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,840
He's a ticking time bomb.

810
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,280
He's effective.
That's the important thing, right?

811
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,318
He's completely out of control.

812
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,986
What happens when you're not here
to baby-sit him?

813
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,490
As it is, no one wants to work with him.

814
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,050
The people that he got work for
will work with him.

815
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,121
Look, I'll talk to him. This job is his life.

816
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,632
I don't care.

817
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,334
I want him gone.

818
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,779
I'm on time, bro. I'm never late.

819
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,010
I wear nice clothes.

820
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,280
Who's placed more people than me,
even more than you?

821
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,720
No doubt, I know.

822
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,024
You got an unorthodox style, man.
It makes management nervous.

823
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,823
So when are you leaving, man?

824
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,058
I go in a week.

825
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,097
Fucking A, brother. You're gonna be great.

826
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,297
Thanks.

827
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,339
Look, man, I don't have to do this
if you're not...

828
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,811
No, don't worry about me.

829
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,815
I'm a survivor, brother. I'm gonna be fine.

830
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,276
Yeah.

831
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,769
Sometimes late when things are real

832
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:35,807
And people share the gift of gab
between themselves

833
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,785
Some are quick to take the bait

834
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,587
And catch the perfect prize

835
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,595
RICHARD: They wanted me to write
the book on hiring the disabled.

836
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,497
I finally had something to say,
I just didn't know how to say it.

837
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,627
But oz never did give nothing
to the tin man

838
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,201
That he didn't, didn't already have

839
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:04,013
And cause never was the reason
for the evening

840
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,050
Come on, guys.
Now, I don't wanna see text in your eyes.

841
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,143
Has he told you yet you're full of shit?

842
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,883
'Cause if you're any good he will, trust me.

843
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Richard Pimentel,

844
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,594
the best student I never had.

845
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,831
That's all for today, thank you.

846
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,868
Tilting at Windmills. You a Quixote fan?

847
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:33,731
Yeah.

848
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,779
I was reading it one night
and I had an epiphany.

849
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,678
You know, the hardest thing
about being disabled

850
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,808
is the way that other people treat you.

851
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,349
Employers, they don't wanna
hire people with disability.

852
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,820
Why is that?

853
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,983
They lack confidence in us.

854
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,727
-I think you may have that wrong.
-What do you mean?

855
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,766
You don't need to change their minds
about people's disabilities,

856
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,928
you need to change their minds
about themselves.

857
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,233
I wanna show you something.

858
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,610
-Lithium?
-Yeah.

859
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,247
I'm what they call a manic-depressive.

860
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,121
That medicine you're holding
allows me to function.

861
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,125
I don't share that with a lot of people.

862
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,354
For years,
I didn't wanna accept what I was.

863
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,032
The day you auditioned for me
was not a good day.

864
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,268
No, I got a life 'cause of you.

865
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,464
-You could've lost it because of me.
-I make my own decisions.

866
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,535
I lost my hearing.

867
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,807
I gained a superpower, lip-reading.

868
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,111
I can spy on conversations
a hundred feet away.

869
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,648
I could have some fun with that
at those god-awful faculty lunches.

870
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,887
-So you don't wear hearing aids?
-No, they don't help.

871
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:03,229
I get them from the government, but I just
pass them out like candy for Halloween.

872
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,300
Do me a favor,
I want you to meet someone.

873
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,883
-Richard?
-Yeah.

874
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,924
Bill Austin. Come on back with me.

875
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,285
-Right in here, please.
-All right.

876
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,021
No offense,
but this is all kind of a circle jerk.

877
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,068
I'm just here to humor Ben.

878
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,002
See, I have this ritual with Uncle Sam
every year where he tells me

879
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,039
how much more deaf I am
than the year before,

880
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,802
and then I cash his disability checks.

881
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,536
Well, there doesn't seem to be
too much purpose

882
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,909
in living a life with a hearing problem
if we can find the right solution.

883
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,277
Wait, wait.
What are you gonna do with that thing?

884
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,906
I'm going to stick it in your ear,

885
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,645
unless you have another place
you'd rather I stick it.

886
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,918
Ear's good.

887
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,161
Now we're ready to try
the new hearing aids.

888
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,788
Is that them?

889
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,732
They're like a contact lens for the ear.

890
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,928
(DISTORTED) We've found that
smaller's better.

891
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,700
We get a more efficient coupling
for the ear when the aid is in the canal.

892

(RINGING IN EAR)

893
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,502
Can you hear me, Richard?

894
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,643
How does it sound? Can you hear me?

895
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,048

(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)

898
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,488
Oh, yeah. That's great.

899
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,005
Wash away my troubles
Wash away my pain

Wash away my sorrow
Wash away my shame

902
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,118
RICHARD: Once I started writing again,
it was like I tapped a vein.

903
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,121
My central focus was
to change the attitudes of employers

904
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,453
about persons with all disabilities.

905
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,719
It took me a year to write.

906
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:16,393
Ah, ooh, yeah

907
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,697
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

908
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,569
Everyone is helpful
Everyone is kind

On the road to Shambala

Everyone is lucky
Everyone is so kind

On the road to Shambala

912
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,620
What page are you on right now?

913
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,422
I'm on page shut the fuck up.

914
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,182
I've got CP, I'm not deaf.

915
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,453
All right, come in.

916
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,296
Come on, man. Say something.

917
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,479
Why did you want me to read this?

918
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,274
'Cause I don't think
I know what I'm doing, Art.

919
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,184
But I never would've written that
if I hadn't met you.

920
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,289
Now, you're the smartest guy that I know,

921
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,485
and if you don't think that's any good,
I'm just gonna tear it up.

922
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,225
You don't have

923
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,068
a clue...

924
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,436
-All right, shit.
-No, let me finish.

925
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:12,706
You don't have a clue how good this is.

926
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:21,789
You know what we cripples want

927
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,918
besides getting laid?

928
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,462
To be seen.

929
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,167
When they look at me out there now,

930
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,035
you know what they see?

931
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:38,801
Nothing.

932
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,408
I'm ignored.

933
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,275
How can you ignore this?

934
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,874
But they ignore me,

935
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,343
because

936
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,454
I am so disturbing

937
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:02,190
to their definition of human,

938
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,824
that I make them feel.

939
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,639
I love that.

940
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,611
What you've created

941
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:22,246
will help to make them see us.

942
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,514
If you try to tear this up,

943
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,717
I'll kick your ass.

944
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,720
All right.

(CHINA GROVE PLAYING)

946
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,662
RICHARD: I threw myself into my career.

947
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,765
I was changing lives and ignoring my own.

948
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,774
I was keynote speaker for
the US government, training every agency.

949
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:56,443
CIA, NASA, the VA, all of them.

950
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,215
My own subversive little goal
was to make the federal government

951
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,655
into the biggest employer
of disabled persons in the country.

952
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,658
Mike would've dug the irony.

953
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,965
Richard, we made plans
for this months ago.

954
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,371
Why did you wait till now
to tell me you can't go?

955
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:23,310
-I just forgot all about it. I'm sorry.
-So tell them that.

956
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,143
It's an important conference,
I'm the speaker.

957
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,547
I can't just not show up,
people count on me.

958
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,141
And I don't?

959
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:33,655
They're strangers at a convention,
an audience.

960
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,917
They applaud, you eat it up.

961
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,687
So I have to wonder,
are you doing this for them or for you?

962
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,752
I'm doing it for them
and I'm doing it for me.

963
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,699
We'll do something special
when I get back.

964
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,562
Okay?

965
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,634
Richard, this is important to me.
I'm asking you not to go.

966
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,407
Stop it! I am not doing this right now.

967
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,283
I'll call you from the hotel.

968
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:18,356
Until you've seen
this trash can dream come true

969
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:25,230
You stand at the edge
while people run you through

970
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,038
And I thank the lord

971
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,710
There's people out there like you

972
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,843
I thank the lord

973
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,979
There's people out there like you

974
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,390
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters

975
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,195
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers

976
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:57,732
Turn around and say good morning
to the night

977
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:03,136
For unless they see the sky

978
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:12,449
Hey, baby, it's me.
I know it's late, but pick up if you're there.

979
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,885
RICHARD: Hello? Just wanna say that

980
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,086
today went really well

981
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:24,294
and I wanted to see how you were doing

982
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,767
and tell you that I miss you a lot.

983
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,198
And...

984
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,602
Pick up if you're there
'cause I really wanted to tell you that l...

985
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,906
(BEEPS)

986
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,646
I think I messed up.

987
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,969
Christine?

988
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,074
Christine?

989
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,693
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

990
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:33,763
Oh, boy.

991
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,661
The minute I turn my back,
you come sniffing around.

992
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,536
You just don't get it, do you?

993
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,270
Just go get Christine
before I have your visa revoked.

994
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,705
It's okay, Nikos.

995
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,021
You've been seeing him behind my back?

996
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,030
No. I'm just here until I find my own place.

997
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,963
I'm not getting back with Nikos.

998
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,969
-Does he know that?
-Of course.

999
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,532
You two sleeping
in the same bed together?

1000
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,700
-Jesus. You don't get it.
-What?

1001
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,773
I just want you to come home.

1002
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,640
-I'm not coming home.
-Why?

1003
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,185
Is this because
I don't give you enough attention?

1004
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,450
No, it's because
I don't give me enough attention.

1005
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,081
I've always depended on men like you

1006
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,888
to make me feel better
and take care of me.

1007
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,258
I need to be on my own.

1008
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,059
All right, well, be on your own.
Be on your own with me.

1009
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:40,165
I mean, I'm traveling,
I can give you all the space you want.

1010
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,603
I'm flailing here, okay?
I don't know what you want me to say.

1011
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,340
-I love you. I wanna be with you.
-You don't wanna be with me.

1012
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,680
You just wanna win me and put me
on a shelf to remind you that you won me.

1013
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,585
That's not a relationship, Richard,
I think we need to be apart.

1014
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,720
I need to figure out who I am and...

1015
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,990
And I think you need to figure out
what's important to you, too.

1016
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,210
WOMAN: Margaret, you have a visitor.

1017
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,879
Hi, Mom.

1018
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,814
How you feeling?

1019
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,924
The doctors tell me I'm doing well.

1020
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,456
But I don't feel like it, and neither do l.

1021
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,358
(CHUCKLES)

1022
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,639
Schizophrenia humor. That's good, Mom.

1023
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,002
You know what I miss?

1024
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,378
Dancing.

1025
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,682
You know who was a good dancer?
Richard.

1026
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,815
Not really.

1027
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:11,155
He took foxtrot, cha-cha, tango lessons.

1028
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,428
I used to take him to the nightclubs.

1029
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,828
Oh, we had so much fun.

1030
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,890
No, Mom, actually, I didn't.

1031
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:22,095
No 12-year-old boy
really wants ballroom dancing lessons.

1032
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,832
That's a lie.

1033
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:31,010
-Why'd you do it for two years?
-So that I could be with you.

1034
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,449
I wanna take a nap now.

1035
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,127
-But your son came so far to visit you.
-That's all right.

1036
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,927
That's all right. That's okay, it's fine.

1037
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:56,769
Here, I wanna give you something.

1038
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,503
This is a new standard for disability
training for employers nationwide,

1039
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,101
and I wrote it.

1040
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,513
I don't feel like reading anything.

1041
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,614
Well, I just wanna tell you, Mom,
I'm doing great.

1042
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,319
I love my job, I'm making a difference.

1043
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,791
What do you want?

1044
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,597
You want me to pat your hand,
say you're a good boy?

1045
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,661
I'm not wired that way.

1046
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,220
RICHARD: The average able-bodied person
doesn't give a damn about the disabled.

1047
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,781
Would we care about women's rights
if they hadn't mobilized?

1048
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,293
We're not gonna care about
disabled people

1049
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,763
until they set aside their differences,
stop being invisible,

1050
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,130
and come together
for the passage of the ADA.

1051
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,260
That would be the Americans
with Disabilities Act, am I right?

1052
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,099
Yes, exactly,
Americans with Disabilities Act.

1053
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,835
This bill, simply put, says that
you can't discriminate against people

1054
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,434
simply because they don't look like you.

1055
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,911
Okay. Why don't we hold that thought
right there until...

1056
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,278
Now that the election
has come down to Bush and Dukakis,

1057
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,146
I have it on very good authority

1058
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,676
that the very first candidate who
comes out publicly in support of the ADA

1059
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,622
is gonna get the disabled vote.
The whole thing, all of it.

1060
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,751
Everybody, which is
millions of votes for the first candidate

1061
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,693
that has the balls
to come out and support this.

1062
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:29,628
-Richard, please, just...
-One second.

1063
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:35,295
Rumor has it that one of our senior
elected officials was told by his advisors,

1064
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,203
okay, "Sir, we have a problem.

1065
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,763
"There is a horrific disease.

1066
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:43,903
"It is infecting homosexuals
and drug addicts at an alarming rate,

1067
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,776
"and it is always fatal."

1068
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,214
And you know what he said?
You know what his reply was?

1069
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,184
He said,
"What did you say the problem was?"

1070
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,918
That is the kind of Nazi Germany
mentality that we're looking at

1071
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:59,392
here in America, in the late 20th century.

1072
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,624
That's it. We're off the air, all right?

1073
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:08,093
RICHARD: Somewhere along the way
I realized my heart wasn't driving me.

1074
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,637
My anger was.

1075
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,506
I think Art noticed it first.

1076
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,776
You're a complete asshole.

1077

You used to be a partial one,
but you graduated.

1078

How the hell did you get in here?

1079

When you're not looking, I can walk.

1080
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:34,989
So you're too busy
to see your friends anymore?

1081
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:38,396
Too deaf to hear the phone ring?

1082

You know what?
Don't bring your wobbling ass in here

1083
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,796
and try and guilt-trip me, all right?
You know who I lectured last week?

1084
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,861
I do.

1086
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,572
I'm doing great.

1087
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,239
But you don't look great.

1088
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,446
Yeah? Well, who's this?

Like you had survived hell and from
now on it didn't matter what happened

1262
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,807
I wonder what it's like

1263
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:47,184
For ordinary people

1264
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,850
Running through your life

1265
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,224
Don't you wanna fly?

1266
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,961
Ordinary people

1267
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,927
Why am I knocking on your door?

1268
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,332
It never opened for me before

1269
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:13,642
Sometimes I feel

1270
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:18,982
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be

1271
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:23,547
Sometimes I feel

1272
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:26,256
I shouldn't be here

1273
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,955
You go the other way

1274
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,590
I thought I heard you say

1275
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:35,193
You wish you'd never come

1276
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:40,000
Tearing through the time

1277
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:45,637
Would you try to right
the wrong that has been done?

1278
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:51,645
Why am I knocking on your door?

1279
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,255
It never opened for me before

1280
01:29:56,324 --> 01:30:01,284
Sometimes I feel

1281
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:06,861
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be

1282
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:11,962
Sometimes I feel

1283
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,735
I shouldn't be here

1284
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,445
Is everybody lost before they're found?

1285
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:27,647
I don't wanna be forgotten this time around

1286
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:31,180
No, no, no

1287
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:38,655
Sometimes I feel

1288
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:44,096
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be

1289
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:49,007
Sometimes I feel

1290
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:51,738
I shouldn't be here

1291
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,873
I shouldn't be here

1292
01:30:54,949 --> 01:31:00,285
Sometimes I feel

1293
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:05,553
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be

1294
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:10,962
Sometimes I feel

1295
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:16,299
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be

1296
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:21,603
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be

1297
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:26,773
Sometimes I feel like I couldn't be

1298
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,840
Sometimes

1299
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:35,122
Sometimes

1300
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:44,397
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be here

1301
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:45,398
