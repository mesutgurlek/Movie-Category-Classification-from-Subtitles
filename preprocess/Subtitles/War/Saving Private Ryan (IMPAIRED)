335
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:41,620
Assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

336
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,124
he could be anywhere.

337
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:44,785
ln fact,
he's probably K.l.A.

338
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,294
And frankly, sir,

339
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,797
we go sending some sort
of rescue mission,

340
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:51,459
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

341
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,297
all along our axis
of advance,

342
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,133
they're gonna be K.l.A. too.

343
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:19,828
l have a letter here...

344
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:25,830
written a long time ago
to a Mrs. Bixby in Boston.

345
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,995
So bear with me.

346
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:32,040
''Dear Madam,

347
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,168
l have been shown in the files
of the war department

348
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:39,341
a statement of the adjutant
general of Massachusetts

349
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,849
that you...

350
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,851
are the mother of 5...

351
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:48,346
sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

352
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:55,194
l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine...

353
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,693
that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief...

354
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,533
of a loss so overwhelming.

355
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,374
But l cannot refrain
from tendering to you

356
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:08,877
the consolation
that may be found...

357
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:11,880
in the thanks
of the republic...

358
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,382
they died to save.

359
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:19,888
l pray that
Our Heavenly Father

360
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:22,720
may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

361
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,726
and leave you only
the cherished memory

362
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:27,126
of the loved and lost...

363
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:30,391
and the solemn pride
that must be yours

364
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,401
to have laid so costly
a sacrifice

365
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,403
upon the altar of freedom.

366
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,905
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully...

367
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:39,407
Abraham Lincoln.''

368
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:00,591
That boy is alive.

369
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:04,256
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

370
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:08,437
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

371
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:11,497
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,286
We expected 32 tanks
on the beach.

373
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:26,447
27 didn't make it.

374
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:27,785
Miller, Charlie Company.

375
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:28,949
Go on in, Captain.

376
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,458
l understand
your situation,

377
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,961
but if we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

378
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,792
we're gonna have
an entire division

379
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:37,799
stuck at Carentan with
its pants around its ankles.

380
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,801
Well, you let me know.

381
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:41,803
Have Charlie Company
hold at Vierville

382
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,964
until we can get
some armor up there.

383
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,803
Yes, sir.
Runner!

384
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,776
[Truck lgnition Grinding]

385
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:53,309
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door

386
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,816
for the rest of us.

387
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:55,976
lnstead they misdropped,

388
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:57,485
scattered all their
sticks into the wind.

389
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:58,646
What's your situation?

390
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:01,315
Uh, yes, sir.
Sector 4 is secure.

391
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:03,325
We, uh...

392
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:05,725
we took out towed 88s

393
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:07,820
here, here...

394
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:08,989
and here.

395
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:10,828
They'd already gotten
4 of our Shermans

396
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,333
and a number of our
deuce-and-a-halves.

397
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,836
These 2 minefields
are actually one big one.

398
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,838
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

399
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:19,340
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field--

400
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,842
little bit of everything.

401
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,502
Sprengmine 44s,
Schumine 42s,

402
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:24,843
pot mines, A-200s--
the little wooden bastards

403
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:27,849
that the mine detectors
don't pick up.

404
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,851
This road here...

405
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,853
they placed big mushrooms--
Teller mine 43s,

406
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,513
l guess for our tanks--

407
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,024
from here right up
to the edge of the village,

408
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,354
right here.

409
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:39,361
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

410
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,691
Resistance?

411
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:42,856
We had higher support
expectations, sir.

412
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:45,366
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

413
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:48,871
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

414
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,701
We ended up
with 23 prisoners.

415
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:53,037
We turned them over
to M.P.s from the 29th.

416
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,713
What about our casualties?

417
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:01,079
Well...

418
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,879
the figures...

419
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:05,386
were 35 dead...

420
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:06,717
times 2 wounded.

421
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,222
They just...

422
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,555
didn't wanna give up
those 88s.

423
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:14,896
lt was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

424
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:16,397
Yes, sir.

425
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:18,896
John...

426
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,730
l've got another one
for you.

427
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:24,898
Yes, sir.

428
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:27,169
This one's straight
from the top.

429
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:33,281
Miller:
l wish.

430
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,442
You and l are taking
a squad over to Neuville

431
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:37,782
on a public relations mission.

432
00:38:37,854 --> 00:38:39,788
Horvath:
You leading a squad?

433
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:42,950
Some private in the 101st
lost 3 brothers,

434
00:38:43,026 --> 00:38:44,618
and he's got a ticket home.

435
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,127
How come Neuville?

436
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:47,787
They think he's up there
somewhere,

437
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:49,798
part of all
those airborne misdrops.

438
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:51,299
lt's not gonna be easy

439
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,800
finding one
particular soldier

440
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,302
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

441
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,304
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

442
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:57,964
But what about
the company?

443
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,804
We take the pick
of the litter,

444
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,810
and the rest get folded
into Baker.

445
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:03,311
Jesus Christ.

446
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,643
They took away
your company?

447
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:07,979
lt wasn't my company,
it was the army's.

448
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,985
So they told me, anyway.

449
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,486
Give me Reiben on B.A.R.,

450
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:13,818
Jackson, Wade, Beasley
and Caparzo.

451
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,482
Beasley's dead.

452
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:17,150
All right.
Mellish then.

453
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:18,659
We got anybody speaks French?

454
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:20,320
Not that l know of.

455
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:22,659
What about Talbot?

456
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:23,664
This morning.

457
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:24,665
Oh.

458
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:25,826
All right.

459
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:27,836
l'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

460
00:39:27,904 --> 00:39:30,338
Assemble at Battalion
Motor Pool on the beach.

461
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:31,338
Yes, sir.

462
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:32,840
What are we gonna do?

463
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:33,841
Listen up-- What?

464
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,002
What we gonna do?

465
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:36,511
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

466
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:38,171
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo.

467
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,181
l thought you liked it
in the ass.

468
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:41,375
What?

469
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,419
Attention!

470
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,919
As you were.

471
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:46,750
l'm looking
for Corporal Upham...

472
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:47,755
Timothy E.

473
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:48,813
l'm Upham, sir.

474
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:50,586
l understand you speak
French and German.

475
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,592
Yes, sir.

476
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,753
How's your accent?

477
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:54,262
Just a slight one
in French,

478
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,763
but my German's clean.
A touch of Bavarian, sir.

479
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:57,265
Very good. You've
been reassigned to me.

480
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,425
Grab your gear.

481
00:39:58,501 --> 00:39:59,695
We're going to a place
called Neuville.

482
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:00,701
Yes, sir.

483
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,828
When was this updated?

484
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:03,269
Updated as of 0830
this morning.

485
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,363
Uh, sir...

486
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,930
this is
the 12th S.S. Panzer.

487
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:07,771
These are the 2 axis
that advance south.

488
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,277
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

489
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:10,778
That's what l understand,
Corporal.

490
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,280
Um, sir,

491
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:14,282
there are a lot of Germans
in Neuville.

492
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,783
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

493
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:16,944
No, sir.

494
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,782
Just if you consider
l've never been in combat.

495
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:20,288
l make maps,
and l translate.

496

01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:22,129
isn't that his brothers
are OK and that--

992
01:03:22,203 --> 01:03:23,135
Lieutenant.

993
01:03:23,204 --> 01:03:24,398
l'm sorry
for the trouble.

994
01:03:24,472 --> 01:03:26,997
l just wrote them a letter
before l left.

995
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:29,305
l got to get home.

996
01:03:29,377 --> 01:03:31,641
l got to get home
right now.

997
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:33,112
l want to go home.

998
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:34,773
Lieutenant:
Shh, take it easy.

999
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:36,146
So where in the hell
is our Ryan?

1000
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:37,149
l don't know.

1001
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:39,015
Are you in touch
with your C.O.?

1002
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:40,019
That figures.

1003
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:41,680
What unit's
your Ryan in?

1004
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,348
Baker Company,
5-0-6.

1005
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:45,255
The guy with the broken
foot, he's 5-0-6, right?

1006
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:46,588
Yeah. Charlie,
l think.

1007
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:47,889
- You think?
- Yeah.

1008
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:50,726
Ryan? Don't know-- Man!

1009
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:53,096
Miller: Where was
your drop zone?

1010
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:54,533
Just inside of Vierville.

1011
01:03:54,602 --> 01:03:55,660
Vierville?

1012
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,466
How the hell did you
end up way up here?

1013
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:58,801
You got me, sir.

1014
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:00,807
C-47 took heavy fire.

1015
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,536
Pilot went crazy trying
to get out of there,

1016
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,872
turning every which way,

1017
01:04:03,945 --> 01:04:06,311
took more fire in the drop,
got messy.

1018
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:07,780
l ended up here.

1019
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:09,908
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

1020
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,315
God knows
where they are.

1021
01:04:11,386 --> 01:04:13,081
Anybody from Baker Company
have a big mouth?

1022
01:04:13,154 --> 01:04:15,054
Say where the drop zone
might've been?

1023
01:04:15,123 --> 01:04:16,920
No, sir,
but l know Baker Company

1024
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:18,583
had the same rally point
as us.

1025
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,628
Show me.

1026
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,162
My men are beat.

1027
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,164
We're gonna hold up here
for about 3 hours.

1028
01:04:24,232 --> 01:04:26,393
We'll pull out after dark.

1029
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,401
Got anything left
in this town

1030
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,869
like a 3-star hotel,
something with clean sheets

1031
01:04:30,939 --> 01:04:33,339
and soft pillows
and room service?

1032
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:35,342
How about
a nice comfy church?

1033
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,342
We'll take that.

1034
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:37,673
What have you heard?

1035
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:39,337
How's it all
falling together?

1036
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:41,314
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

1037
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:44,146
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

1038
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:46,710
We can't pull out
till he's ready. So--

1039
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:48,119
That guy's overrated.

1040
01:04:48,189 --> 01:04:49,281
No argument here.

1041
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:52,121
You got to take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lo.

1042
01:04:52,193 --> 01:04:54,093
You got to take Saint-Lo
to take Valognes.

1043
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:55,720
Valognes,
you got Cherbourg.

1044
01:04:55,797 --> 01:04:57,355
And Cherbourg,
you got Paris.

1045
01:04:57,432 --> 01:04:59,662
Paris, you get Berlin.

1046
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,725
And then
that big boat home.

1047
01:05:04,038 --> 01:05:07,007
We sure as hell could
use you around here,

1048
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:09,009
but l understand
what you're doing.

1049
01:05:09,077 --> 01:05:10,169
You do?

1050
01:05:10,245 --> 01:05:13,373
Yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself.

1051
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:14,415
Oh.

1052
01:05:14,482 --> 01:05:15,915
Good luck.

1053
01:05:15,984 --> 01:05:17,110
Thank you.

1054
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:18,709
No, l mean it.

1055
01:05:18,786 --> 01:05:21,380
Find him.
Get him home.

1056
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,895
Horvath:
What's with your hand?

1057
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:34,264
l don't know.

1058
01:05:35,903 --> 01:05:37,165
lt started in Portsmouth

1059
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,763
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

1060
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:41,274
lt comes and goes.

1061
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:44,470
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

1062
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:47,480
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you anymore.

1063
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:54,216
What?

1064
01:05:58,293 --> 01:05:59,260
What?

1065
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:00,316
Nothing.

1066
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:03,330
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

1067
01:06:03,398 --> 01:06:04,990
The one that was always

1068
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,590
walking around
on his hands, you know,

1069
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:08,636
and he was
singing that song

1070
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,364
about the man
on the flying trapeze?

1071
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:11,427
Vecchio.

1072
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,030
Vecchio.

1073
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:18,503
Yeah.

1074
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,046
Yeah, Vecchio.

1075
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:22,514
He was a goofy kid.

1076
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:26,713
l remember he used to pee
a ''V'' on everybody's jacket

1077
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,983
for Vecchio.

1078
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:30,354
For victory.

1079
01:06:30,425 --> 01:06:31,653
Vecchio.

1080
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:36,029
He was so short.

1081
01:06:36,097 --> 01:06:38,031
He was a midget,
wasn't he?

1082
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,964
''How did you
get to be a ranger?''

1083
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:41,296
[Both Chuckling]

1084
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:43,599
He got shot in the foot once,
didn't he?

1085
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:45,104
And he was walking
on his hands.

1086
01:06:45,173 --> 01:06:47,368
Yeah, well, he could
walk faster on his hands.

1087
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:51,972
He could run faster
on his hands than...

1088
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,313
Vecchio.

1089
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:58,818
Yeah.

1090
01:07:00,355 --> 01:07:01,822
Caparzo.

1091
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,124
You see, when...

1092
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:14,291
when you end up killing
one of your men, you see,

1093
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:17,463
you tell yourself
it happened

1094
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:21,634
so you could save
the lives of 2 or 3

1095
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:24,644
or 10 others.

1096
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,805
Maybe a hundred others.

1097
01:07:30,852 --> 01:07:34,083
Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?

1098
01:07:34,155 --> 01:07:35,087
How many?

1099
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:37,420
94.

1100
01:07:37,492 --> 01:07:41,189
But that means
l've saved the lives

1101
01:07:41,262 --> 01:07:43,492
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

1102
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:46,556
Maybe even 20, right?

1103
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,067
20 times as many?

1104
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:56,073
And that's
how simple it is.

1105
01:07:57,145 --> 01:07:59,340
That's how you...

1106
01:07:59,414 --> 01:08:00,608
That's how you

1107
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,546
rationalize
making the choice

1108
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:05,745
between the mission
and the men.

1109
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,755
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

1110
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,526
This Ryan
better be worth it.

1111
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:20,533
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

1112
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:24,731
or invent a longer-lasting
lightbulb or something.

1113
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:26,603
'Cause the truth is,
l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

1114
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:29,507
for one Vecchio
or one Caparzo.

1115
01:08:29,577 --> 01:08:31,545
Amen.

1116
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:32,579
[Grunts]

1117
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:35,673
Look.
There it goes again.

1118
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,183
Sir...

1119
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:40,220
are you all right?

1120
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,560
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in 2 hours.

1121
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:49,493
Why don't you
get some sleep?

1122
01:08:49,564 --> 01:08:52,294
Reiben: l don't know
how he does it.

1123
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:53,458
Mellish: What's that?

1124
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:54,796
Falls asleep like that.

1125
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:56,200
l mean, look at him.

1126
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,364
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

1127
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,771
Clear conscience.

1128
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:03,436
Yeah, what's that saying?
''lf God's on our side,

1129
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,445
who the hell could
be on theirs?''

1130
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:08,710
''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''

1131
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:10,273
Yeah, what did l say?

1132
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:11,511
Wade: Well, actually,

1133
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:15,283
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

1134
01:09:15,356 --> 01:09:17,256
Mellish:
How is that, Wade?

1135
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:19,122
Wade: Well, when my
mother was an intern,

1136
01:09:19,193 --> 01:09:22,356
she used to work late
through the night,

1137
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,954
sleep through the day.

1138
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:25,396
So the only time

1139
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:26,694
that we ever got
to talk about anything

1140
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:28,257
was when she'd get home.

1141
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:30,930
So what l used to do,
l used to lie in my bed

1142
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:32,370
and try to stay awake
as long as l could,

1143
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,376
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,

1144
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:38,275
the faster
l'd fall asleep.

1145
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:41,611
Yeah, well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

1146
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:44,048
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

1147
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:46,643
chatted me up till dawn.

1148
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,916
l swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

1149
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,924
Yeah, that's probably
the only time

1150
01:09:50,992 --> 01:09:53,859
she could get a word in.

1151
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:57,360
Funny thing is,

1152
01:09:57,431 --> 01:10:00,525
sometimes she'd
come home early,

1153
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,092
and l'd pretend
to be asleep.

1154
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,968
Mellish: Who?
Your-- Your mom?

1155
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,132
Yeah.

1156
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,738
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

1157
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,841
And l would just
keep my eyes shut.

1158
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:22,179
And l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

1159
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:24,053
that she came home early...

1160
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,124
just to talk to me.

1161
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:32,524
And l still wouldn't move.

1162
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,160
l'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

1163
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:45,074
l don't know why l did that.

1164
01:10:58,626 --> 01:10:59,957
Miller:
We only got a couple hours.

1165
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,961
Shut up and go to sleep.

1166
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:12,699
Captain?

1167
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:14,502
Upham: Sir?

1168
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,374
Corporal?

1169
01:11:22,183 --> 01:11:25,050
How you doin' there?
You all right?

1170
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:30,250
Yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir.

1171
01:11:30,324 --> 01:11:32,622
Really?

1172
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:33,853
How is that?

1173
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,595
''War educates
the senses,

1174
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:42,659
calls into action
the will,

1175
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:45,831
perfects the physical
constitution,

1176
01:11:45,906 --> 01:11:48,841
brings men into such
swift and close collision

1177
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:52,345
in critical moments
that man measures man.''

1178
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:55,678
Yeah, well, l guess
that's Emerson's way of...

1179
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,240
finding the bright side.

1180
01:11:57,318 --> 01:11:59,809
You know Emerson, sir?

1181
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:01,548
l know some.

1182
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:07,793
So where are you from,
Captain?

1183
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,955
What'd you do
before the war?

1184
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:13,467
What's the pool up to?

1185
01:12:17,304 --> 01:12:21,070
You know, l think
it's around 300, sir.

1186
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:23,508
Well,
when it gets up to 500,

1187
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:25,977
l'll give you the answers
and we'll split the money.

1188
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:27,981
How about that?

1189
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,778
Well, if that's
the way you feel, sir,

1190
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,841
l feel it's my duty
under your command

1191
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:33,250
to suggest that we wait

1192
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,914
until it gets up
to a thousand, sir.

1193
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:40,156
What if we don't
live that long?

1194
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:43,954
500?

1195
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,522
500 would be good,
yeah.

1196
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,567
Yes, sir.

1197
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:48,932
Yeah.

1198
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:52,865
Get some sleep,
Corporal.

1199
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,100
Yes, sir.

1200
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:01,999
Soldier:
Who's got sulfa powder?

1201
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:07,580
Soldier: Medic!
My buddy's bleeding!

1202
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:09,081
He needs a tourniquet!

1203
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,082
Wade.

1204
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:11,175
Wade: Yes, sir?

1205
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:12,583
See what you can do.

1206
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:13,585
Yes, sir.

1207
01:14:13,654 --> 01:14:14,746
Hold on, fellas.

1208
01:14:14,822 --> 01:14:16,289
lt won't be
much longer.

1209
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:17,790
How we doing here?

1210
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:20,390
All right.

1211
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:22,929
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

1212
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:24,965
Doc's in town.

1213
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,363
Jackson: lt's all right.
lt's all right.

1214
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:27,866
Don't worry, fellas.

1215
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:29,163
The 29th lnfantry's
breaking through.

1216
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:30,362
They'll be here soon.

1217
01:14:30,437 --> 01:14:32,905
Soldier: Plasma.
Anybody got plasma?

1218
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:34,998
Captain.
Hey, Captain.

1219
01:14:35,075 --> 01:14:36,736
Soldier,
you want to fill me in?

1220
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:38,779
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant Dewindt, sir.

1221
01:14:38,846 --> 01:14:40,108
99th Troop Carrier Squadron

1222
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,706
carrying in
327th Glider lnfantry.

1223
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:44,216
This one was mine, sir.

1224
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:45,616
l was the pilot.

1225
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:46,675
22 men dead.

1226
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:48,688
l ended up over there
without a scratch.

1227
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:50,053
lt took my copilot's head
right off.

1228
01:14:50,124 --> 01:14:51,989
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

1229
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:53,924
Well, the guys
we came in with, sir,

1230
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:56,394
they headed off first night.
Haven't seen them since.

1231
01:14:56,463 --> 01:14:58,658
Meantime, other guys
keep showing up,

1232
01:14:58,732 --> 01:15:00,495
1, 2, half-dozen
at a time.

1233
01:15:00,568 --> 01:15:03,537
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

1234
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:06,038
head off to make trouble, sir.

1235
01:15:06,106 --> 01:15:08,006
We're looking for
a Private James Ryan.

1236
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:10,373
He was in Baker Company
5-0-6 of the 101st.

1237
01:15:10,444 --> 01:15:11,672
No, you got me, sir.

1238
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:13,110
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

1239
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,306
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1240
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:17,316
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

1241
01:15:17,384 --> 01:15:19,215
Yes, sir.

1242
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,378
Reiben.

1243
01:15:20,454 --> 01:15:22,649
Smell that leg
right there.

1244
01:15:22,723 --> 01:15:24,782
Find out if it's
south of cheese.

1245
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:31,094
[Sniffs]
Phew.

1246
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:32,223
Wade: What?

1247
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:35,096
Juden.

1248
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:37,836
Juden.

1249
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:40,271
Soldier: Keep moving.
Keep moving!

1250
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:41,899
Juden.

1251
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:44,274
l'm Juden,
you know?

1252
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:46,609
Ju-den.

1253
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,272
Yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there

1254
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,782
hard as l tried.

1255
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,112
l'd need a winch.

1256
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:52,174
Horvath: Yeah.

1257
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:56,680
Horvath: Stars.

1258
01:15:56,757 --> 01:15:59,988
Yep,
Brigadier General Amend,

1259
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,722
deputy commander, 101st.

1260
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:05,321
Some fucking genius
had the great idea

1261
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:06,832
of welding a couple
of steel plates

1262
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,869
onto our deck to keep
the general safe

1263
01:16:08,936 --> 01:16:10,335
from ground fire.

1264
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:12,099
Unfortunately, they forgot
to tell me about it

1265
01:16:12,172 --> 01:16:14,333
until we were just
getting airborne.

1266
01:16:14,408 --> 01:16:16,433
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train.

1267
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,772
OK?

1268
01:16:17,845 --> 01:16:19,107
Gross overload.

1269
01:16:19,179 --> 01:16:21,943
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

1270
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:25,008
l nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

1271
01:16:25,085 --> 01:16:27,280
And when--
And when we released,

1272
01:16:27,354 --> 01:16:29,515
you know, l cut
as hard as l could,

1273
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,114
tried to gain
some altitude

1274
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:33,125
and still keep her
from stalling.

1275
01:16:33,193 --> 01:16:35,184
We came down
like a fucking meteor.

1276
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:38,095
And this is how
we ended up.

1277
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:40,224
And the others,

1278
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,929
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

1279
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:45,733
We were just--
We were just too damn heavy,

1280
01:16:45,806 --> 01:16:46,966
you know?

1281
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:49,305
The grass was wet.

1282
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,810
Downward slope and all.

1283
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:54,643
22 guys dead.

1284
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,650
All that for a general?

1285
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,880
One man.

1286
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,250
Lot of that going around.

1287
01:17:04,325 --> 01:17:05,883
FUBAR.

1288
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,325
FUBAR.

1289
01:17:07,394 --> 01:17:08,759
FUBAR.

1290
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,160
FUBAR.

1291
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,357
Y'all got that right.

1292
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:15,095
l looked up ''FUBAR'' in
the German dictionary.

1293
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,761
There's no ''FUBAR''
in there.

1294
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:17,861
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1295
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,428
There's more paratroops
out there.

1296
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:20,632
Find out
if one of them's Ryan.

1297
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,732
Yes, sir.

1298
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:24,869
Oh, you might want to
check these out, sir.

1299
01:17:24,945 --> 01:17:26,708
Dog tags.

1300
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,374
More than l really
want to count, sir.

1301
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:33,509
l've-- l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

1302
01:17:33,587 --> 01:17:35,646
Miller: Jackson...

1303
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:37,281
start going
through those.

1304
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:38,416
Yes, sir.

1305
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:41,727
l'll help.

1306
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,822
What do you think,
Jackson?

1307
01:17:44,898 --> 01:17:46,092
Do you think that
little prick's in there?

1308
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,100
Well, if he is,
l'm gonna find him.

1309
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:49,465
l bet that
son of a bitch is.

1310
01:17:49,536 --> 01:17:51,094
Reiben: l got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

1311
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,401
Mellish: 10 bucks
says l nail him first.

1312
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:54,964
Let's see
who we got in here.

1313
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,373
You mugs don't
stand a chance.

1314
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:58,172
All right, you think this little
shit bird's in here or what?

1315
01:17:58,245 --> 01:18:00,042
Just keep looking.

1316
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:02,548
All right.
Gary lanico.

1317
01:18:02,616 --> 01:18:03,981
Ben Rubino.
Mike Cessacchio.

1318
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:06,246
l swear, all the guineas
are buying it, huh?

1319
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,652
Mellish: Oh, come on,
not the right name.

1320
01:18:08,722 --> 01:18:10,917
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

1321
01:18:10,991 --> 01:18:13,186
Reiben:
We gotta find this prick.

1322
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,830
Where is
this son of a bitch?

1323
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,561
Don't mix them up,
Jackson, all right?

1324
01:18:21,635 --> 01:18:22,602
Keep them in your
own fucking pile.

1325
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:25,035
How am l supposed
to know who we got?

1326
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:27,903
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

1327
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:29,237
Mellish:
Everybody be friends.

1328
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:30,936
Reiben:
Cranky there, huh?

1329
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:33,643
l think
l got a winner.

1330
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,204
What are you
talking about?

1331
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:36,749
Ryan.

1332
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:37,841
Ryan?

1333
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:39,818
Take a look at that,
Mellish.

1334
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,514
You know what? You're a genius.
You really are.

1335
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:43,419
R-l-E-N-N-E.

1336
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,424
That's Rienne.
And that's French, all right?

1337
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:46,959
You know what that means?

1338
01:18:47,027 --> 01:18:48,289
Jackson:
lt's means nothing.

1339
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:49,761
Mellish:
What beats 3 of a kind?

1340
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,195
Jackson:
l got shit here.

1341
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:52,755
l got all guys
from New York.

1342
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:54,266
Reiben: Do you need
a hand with that?

1343
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:55,767
Mellish: Ah,
l got a full house.

1344
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:57,861
Reiben: Got you beat.
Straight flush.

1345
01:18:57,938 --> 01:18:59,906
You were looking
at my tags.

1346
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:01,270
You're cheating.
You know?

1347
01:19:01,341 --> 01:19:02,433
Ryan.

1348
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:04,170
Reiben: Fuckin' unreal,
this guy.

1349
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:05,643
Do you need a hand
with that?

1350
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:06,974
Can you read that shit?

1351
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:09,447
Jesus Christ, look at
this poor bastard, huh?

1352
01:19:09,516 --> 01:19:11,347
Mellish: l guess they're
not bulletproof, huh?

1353
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,646
Reiben: Guess not.
All right?

1354
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,209
Mellish: l don't like what
he's got between his ears.

1355
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:16,518
Jackson: Sort of
what you fellas got

1356
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,818
between your legs.

1357
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:20,325
Mellish:
We got to give him that.

1358
01:19:20,394 --> 01:19:21,520
Not bad for you,
Jackson.

1359
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,085
l got 3 of a kind.

1360
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,255
Full house.

1361
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:26,663
The whole goddamn
airborne's watching.

1362
01:19:26,733 --> 01:19:27,995
These aren't poker chips.

1363
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,330
Mellish:
All right, all right.

1364
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:31,337
Wade:
Put 'em back in there!

1365
01:19:55,596 --> 01:19:57,291
He's not here.

1366
01:20:00,067 --> 01:20:01,329
Wade: Put 'em back.

1367
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:02,698
Maybe we should bust up

1368
01:20:02,769 --> 01:20:04,259
into a couple of
different groups, huh?

1369
01:20:04,338 --> 01:20:05,828
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

1370
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:06,930
calling his name.

1371
01:20:07,007 --> 01:20:08,634
He's bound to hear us
sooner or later.

1372
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:10,176
Ryan!

1373
01:20:10,244 --> 01:20:13,441
That might be a little
hard to do, Captain.

1374
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:15,004
Maybe the locals
have seen him.

1375
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,674
Hey, you know--
uh, excusez-moi.

1376
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,718
Parlez-vous Ryan,
James ryan?

1377
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:20,446
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

1378
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:22,512
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

1379
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:24,853
Ryan? You know
a guy named Ryan?

1380
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:26,688
Private James Ryan
from lowa?

1381
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,490
Anybody know a Ryan?

1382
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:30,655
James Ryan?!

1383
01:20:30,731 --> 01:20:33,291
Hey, Joe,

1384
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:34,959
doesn't, uh, Michaelson

1385
01:20:35,035 --> 01:20:37,595
pal around with a Ryan
from ''C'' Company?

1386
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:38,865
Yeah, l think so.

1387
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:41,032
Well, bring him
up here, would you?

1388
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,312
You know
Private Ryan?

1389
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:52,784
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

1390
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:54,150
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir!

1391
01:20:54,221 --> 01:20:55,882
My hearing
is not so good!

1392
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:57,048
lt comes and goes!

1393
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:59,149
A German grenade went off
right by my head!

1394
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:00,318
[Louder]
Got it, got it.

1395
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:02,362
Do you know
Private Ryan?

1396
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:03,862
Who?

1397
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:06,297
Private Ryan?
James Ryan?

1398
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:07,628
Jimmy Ryan?

1399
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:10,693
James.
James Francis Ryan.

1400
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:13,604
No, no, no.
James Francis Ryan.

1401
01:21:13,674 --> 01:21:16,666
Get me a pencil.
Something to write on.

1402
01:21:16,743 --> 01:21:18,734
Quick! Quick!
Come on, a pencil!

1403
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:22,848
Here you are.
A small one, sir.

1404
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:24,884
Write this down.

1405
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:26,920
James Francis Ryan,
Question mark.

1406
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:29,217
lowa, question mark.

1407
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:31,382
Do you know him?
Does he know him?

1408
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,720
Read the message. Look.

1409
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:37,455
Yeah. Of course
l know him, sir.

1410
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,123
Does he know
where he is?

1411
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:43,969
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:46,562
We missed our drop zone
by about 20 miles,

1413
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,939
ended up way over by
Bumville or some damn place.

1414
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,341
Him, me, and a couple
of other guys

1415
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,106
were coming here
to the rally point,

1416
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,808
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1417
01:21:55,882 --> 01:21:59,010
to go to, uh... Ramelle...

1418
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:00,018
Ramelle.

1419
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:01,281
To baby-sit a bridge.

1420
01:22:01,355 --> 01:22:02,617
That's the last
l've seen of him, sir.

1421
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,452
Great! Great!
Thank-- Thank you.

1422
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:06,549
Write thank you.
Read and thank you.

1423
01:22:06,627 --> 01:22:07,855
Michaelson:
You're welcome!

1424
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,190
Assemble on me.

1425
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:13,025
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1426
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:18,331
Ramelle.

1427
01:22:18,405 --> 01:22:21,738
We're here. There.

1428
01:22:21,808 --> 01:22:23,002
Ramelle...

1429
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,010
is on the Merderet River
right here,

1430
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:27,012
just to the southwest
of us.

1431
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,014
You know anything
about this bridge

1432
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:30,674
he was talking
about, Captain?

1433
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:34,209
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1434
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:37,746
We can't push on Paris until
we take a deep water port,

1435
01:22:37,824 --> 01:22:39,621
and Rommel knows that.

1436
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:40,955
So he's gonna try
to get his armor

1437
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:44,191
across the Merderet River
anywhere he can.

1438
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:46,892
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

1439
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:49,231
when we make the big
right turn to Cherbourg.

1440
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:51,362
That makes any village
on that river

1441
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:54,202
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

1442
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:59,439
[Compass Rattling]

1443
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:16,486
Let's go.

1444
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,102
Wade: Captain.

1445
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:07,077
Horvath:
What the hell is that?

1446
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,307
Miller: A radar site.

1447
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:12,079
lt's got to be
out of action.

1448
01:24:12,152 --> 01:24:14,211
Well, it looks like we
got something in that...

1449
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:16,847
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1450
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:18,948
See it?

1451
01:24:19,025 --> 01:24:20,890
Yeah.
That's my guess, too.

1452
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:24,760
What is it?

1453
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:27,231
Machine gun.
Probably MG-42.

1454
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,564
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1455
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:31,604
Maybe one of them's
our boy.

1456
01:24:31,671 --> 01:24:33,332
Miller: No, their
patches are 82nd,

1457
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:34,738
so your luck's
not that good.

1458
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:37,299
l don't know how fast
the rest of you Betties are,

1459
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:39,777
but l'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

1460
01:24:39,846 --> 01:24:41,575
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

1461
01:24:41,648 --> 01:24:44,412
So, Captain, what l'm
trying to say is,

1462
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:46,611
why don't we just
go around the thing?

1463
01:24:46,686 --> 01:24:48,483
l hear what
you're saying,

1464
01:24:48,555 --> 01:24:50,489

Get ready to move on

Corporal Henderson: 101st!
We're coming out!

Corporal Henderson: That was
a recon element, Second S.S.

1794
01:46:13,672 --> 01:46:16,072
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

Yes, sir.
How'd you guess that?

1801
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,664
Miller: Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1802

Henderson: Yes, sir.
Small unit action.

1803

They came in and beat
the hell out of us with 88s.

1804
01:47:03,489 --> 01:47:05,116
Tell you what, sir,
if you're our relief,

1805
01:47:05,157 --> 01:47:07,250
l'm gonna file a complaint.

Who's your C.O.?

lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1809
01:47:15,801 --> 01:47:17,268
l'm afraid the best
we can muster up

1810
01:47:17,302 --> 01:47:19,167
right now is a corporal.

1811
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:22,896
So, what are you guys
all about?

1812
01:47:23,976 --> 01:47:27,844
We're here
for him. Ryan.

1813
01:47:27,913 --> 01:47:29,107
Me, sir?

1814

James Francis Ryan
of lowa?

1815
01:47:42,261 --> 01:47:44,957
Yes, sir. Payton, lowa,
That's correct.

1816
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:47,430
What is this about?

1817
01:47:49,034 --> 01:47:51,798
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1818
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:00,740
Which-- Which ones?

1819
01:48:02,948 --> 01:48:04,347
All of them.

1820
01:48:10,989 --> 01:48:13,355
Uh...

01:48:13,425 --> 01:48:15,916
on-- on the level?

1822
01:48:17,396 --> 01:48:19,489
Yeah. l'm afraid so.

1823
01:48:19,565 --> 01:48:22,125
Uh...

1824
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:23,759
you might want to take
some time with this.

1825
01:48:23,836 --> 01:48:27,033
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...

1826
01:48:36,181 --> 01:48:37,648
What's this all about?

1827
01:48:37,716 --> 01:48:39,308
Ryan lost
his brothers.

1828
01:48:39,384 --> 01:48:40,578
Which one?

1829
01:48:40,652 --> 01:48:42,051
All of them.

1830
01:48:46,124 --> 01:48:48,058
You--

1831
01:48:50,696 --> 01:48:53,494
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1832
01:48:55,567 --> 01:48:57,728
Well, you're--
you're going home.

1833
01:48:59,204 --> 01:49:01,764
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1834
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:07,005
Bring me back?

1835
01:49:09,114 --> 01:49:10,706
Corporal Henderson...

1836
01:49:10,782 --> 01:49:13,216
l don't mean to leave you
even more shorthanded,

1837
01:49:13,285 --> 01:49:15,219
but orders are orders.
Any communication

1838
01:49:15,287 --> 01:49:16,982
about when you're going
to be relieved up here?

1839
01:49:17,055 --> 01:49:18,488
Sir, there's
no way to tell.

1840
01:49:18,557 --> 01:49:20,047
We have no idea what's
happening south of us.

1841
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,059
l have my orders,
too, sir.

1842
01:49:22,127 --> 01:49:23,617
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1843
01:49:23,695 --> 01:49:26,528
l understand that,
but this changes things.

1844
01:49:26,598 --> 01:49:28,657
l don't see
that it does, sir.

1845
01:49:30,502 --> 01:49:32,436
The chief of staff
for the United States Army

1846
01:49:32,504 --> 01:49:33,664
says it does.

1847
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:36,606
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1848
01:49:36,675 --> 01:49:39,508
Our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1849
01:49:39,578 --> 01:49:41,136
across the Merderet
with the exception of 2.

1850
01:49:41,213 --> 01:49:43,078
One at Valognes
and this one here.

1851
01:49:43,148 --> 01:49:44,581
We let the Germans
take 'em,

1852
01:49:44,650 --> 01:49:46,447
we'll lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1853
01:49:46,518 --> 01:49:48,486
Private, your outfit wants
to stay, that's one thing.

1854
01:49:48,553 --> 01:49:50,987
Your party's over here.

1855
01:49:51,056 --> 01:49:53,115
Sir, l can't leave until
at least reinforcements--

1856
01:49:53,191 --> 01:49:55,557
You got 3 minutes
to gather your gear.

1857
01:49:55,627 --> 01:49:57,788
Sir, what about them?
There's barely enough--

1858
01:49:57,863 --> 01:49:59,490
Reiben: Hey, asshole!

1859
01:49:59,564 --> 01:50:03,022
2 of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1860
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,708
Sir?

1861
01:50:10,776 --> 01:50:11,970
That's right.

1862
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,083
What were their names?

1863
01:50:23,155 --> 01:50:25,919
lrwin Wade and
Adrian Caparzo.

1864
01:50:27,859 --> 01:50:29,759
Wade and...

1865
01:50:29,828 --> 01:50:32,763
Caparzo.

1866
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:46,742
lt doesn't make any sense.

1867
01:50:49,114 --> 01:50:51,014
lt doesn't make
any sense, sir.

1868
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:53,643
Why? Why do l
deserve to go?

1869
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:55,152
Why not any of
these guys?

1870
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,551
They all fought
just as hard as me!

1871
01:51:01,226 --> 01:51:04,684
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1872
01:51:04,763 --> 01:51:07,926
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1873
01:51:14,906 --> 01:51:17,431
Tell her
that when you found me,

1874
01:51:17,509 --> 01:51:21,240
l was here with the only
brothers l have left.

1875
01:51:21,313 --> 01:51:25,613
And that there's no way
l was gonna desert them.

1876
01:51:25,684 --> 01:51:28,244
l think
she'll understand that.

1877
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,584
There's no way
l'm leaving this bridge.

1878
01:52:11,863 --> 01:52:13,831
[Sighs]

1879
01:52:13,899 --> 01:52:15,560
What are your orders?

1880
01:52:17,669 --> 01:52:21,730
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1881
01:52:21,807 --> 01:52:24,867
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1882
01:52:24,943 --> 01:52:27,810
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1883
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,313
l don't know.

1884
01:52:30,382 --> 01:52:31,906
What do you think?

1885
01:52:31,983 --> 01:52:34,713
You don't want to know
what l think.

1886
01:52:37,089 --> 01:52:39,580
No, Mike, l do.

1887
01:52:39,658 --> 01:52:42,525
Well...

1888
01:52:42,594 --> 01:52:44,528
part of me thinks
the kid's right.

1889
01:52:44,596 --> 01:52:46,530
What's he done
to deserve this?

1890
01:52:46,598 --> 01:52:48,532
lf he wants
to stay here, fine.

1891
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,864
Let's leave him
and go home.

1892
01:52:50,936 --> 01:52:53,666
Yeah.

1893
01:52:53,738 --> 01:52:55,672
But another
part of me thinks...

1894
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:59,141
what if by
some miracle we stay

1895
01:52:59,211 --> 01:53:01,975
and actually make it
out of here?

1896
01:53:02,047 --> 01:53:04,538
Some day we might look
back on this and decide

1897
01:53:04,616 --> 01:53:09,144
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1898
01:53:09,221 --> 01:53:10,688
we were able
to pull out of

1899
01:53:10,755 --> 01:53:15,783
this whole god-awful,
shitty mess.

1900
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:20,230
That's what
l was thinking, sir.

1901
01:53:20,298 --> 01:53:22,789
Like you said, Captain,

1902
01:53:22,868 --> 01:53:25,803
if we do that...

1903
01:53:25,871 --> 01:53:29,329
we all earn
the right to go home.

1904
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,634
Oh, brother.

1905
01:53:36,448 --> 01:53:40,043
Trask:
This is everything.

1906
01:53:40,118 --> 01:53:42,518
You got the 2 30-caliber
machine guns,

1907
01:53:42,587 --> 01:53:44,111
17 grenades,

1908
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:46,453
11 Hawkins mines.

1909
01:53:46,525 --> 01:53:49,961
You got the 2 bazookas, but
they only got 8 rounds left,

1910
01:53:50,028 --> 01:53:52,087
and assorted small arms.

1911
01:53:52,164 --> 01:53:53,893
We had a 60 mortar,

1912
01:53:53,965 --> 01:53:55,592
but an arty round
took it out.

1913
01:53:55,667 --> 01:53:58,568
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1914
01:53:58,637 --> 01:54:00,696
Which they're sure to do.

1915
01:54:00,772 --> 01:54:01,898
What you thinking, sir?

1916
01:54:01,973 --> 01:54:03,304
Well...

1917
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:04,307
l'm thinking
they're going to try

1918
01:54:04,376 --> 01:54:06,310
to whip around
the flanks--

1919
01:54:11,049 --> 01:54:13,347
Miller: Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1920
01:54:13,418 --> 01:54:14,544
in-between these buildings

1921
01:54:14,619 --> 01:54:18,055
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1922
01:54:18,123 --> 01:54:19,647
Disable 'em?

1923
01:54:19,724 --> 01:54:20,782
lf we can.

1924
01:54:20,859 --> 01:54:22,258
Make that tank
a 60-ton roadblock.

1925
01:54:22,327 --> 01:54:23,851
We do that, we got a fighting
chance at their flanks.

1926
01:54:23,929 --> 01:54:25,419
Yes, sir, that's good.

1927
01:54:25,497 --> 01:54:26,930
Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1928
01:54:26,998 --> 01:54:28,329
Hit them hard as we can
one-on-one

1929
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,027
and fall back
to the bridge.

1930
01:54:30,101 --> 01:54:31,033
Machine gun
on the move down here,

1931
01:54:31,102 --> 01:54:32,091
number 2
up high somewhere

1932
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:34,331
to piss a little bad
news on their heads.

1933
01:54:34,406 --> 01:54:37,000
Miller: That would be
the idea.

1934
01:54:37,075 --> 01:54:39,202
Jackson?

1935
01:54:39,277 --> 01:54:41,040
lf we can, l'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1936
01:54:41,112 --> 01:54:42,579
Yes, sir.

1937
01:54:42,647 --> 01:54:44,808
Give you a little company
if you need it.

1938
01:54:44,883 --> 01:54:46,817
Yes, sir. Some company
couldn't hurt.

1939
01:54:46,885 --> 01:54:48,716
l'd say a...

1940
01:54:48,787 --> 01:54:50,084
a 30 with about
a thousand rounds

1941
01:54:50,155 --> 01:54:51,087
would be OK.

1942
01:54:51,156 --> 01:54:53,181
Parker,
job opportunity.

1943
01:54:53,258 --> 01:54:55,158
Reiben: lt's not the worst
idea ever, Captain.

1944
01:54:55,227 --> 01:54:56,694
lt's just that everything
depends on getting the tank

1945
01:54:56,761 --> 01:54:59,025
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1946
01:54:59,097 --> 01:55:01,725
So, how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1947
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,495
Horvath: Reiben's right.

1948
01:55:03,568 --> 01:55:05,559
As our esteemed colleague
from the airborne pointed out,

1949
01:55:05,637 --> 01:55:07,901
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1950
01:55:07,973 --> 01:55:09,907
so how do we stop the tank

1951
01:55:09,975 --> 01:55:11,909
if we get it to commit?

1952
01:55:11,977 --> 01:55:13,501
Give it a rabbit
to chase.

1953
01:55:14,579 --> 01:55:17,173
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1954
01:55:17,249 --> 01:55:19,046
Yeah, but with what?

1955
01:55:21,653 --> 01:55:23,848
Well, we could try
a sticky bomb.

1956
01:55:23,922 --> 01:55:25,355
Ryan:
Sticky bomb, sir?

1957
01:55:26,491 --> 01:55:28,823
Sir, are you
making that up?

1958
01:55:28,893 --> 01:55:30,053
No. lt's
in the field manual.

1959
01:55:30,128 --> 01:55:31,720
You check it out
if you want to.

1960
01:55:31,796 --> 01:55:34,560
Well, we seem to be
out of field manuals, sir.

1961
01:55:34,633 --> 01:55:36,624
Perhaps you can
enlighten us.

1962
01:55:36,701 --> 01:55:37,963
All right, you have some
demolition, don't you?

1963
01:55:38,036 --> 01:55:40,027
Some TNT or
some composition ''B''?

1964
01:55:40,105 --> 01:55:41,800
That, sir, is the one
thing we got plenty of.

1965
01:55:41,873 --> 01:55:43,602
l got that bridge wired
with enough composition ''B''

1966
01:55:43,675 --> 01:55:44,699
to blow it twice.

1967
01:55:44,776 --> 01:55:46,073
All right, you can
spare some, then.

1968
01:55:46,144 --> 01:55:50,137
You take
a standard-issue G.l. sock,

1969
01:55:50,215 --> 01:55:53,207
cram it with as much
comp ''B'' as it can hold,

1970
01:55:53,285 --> 01:55:55,651
rig up a simple fuse,

1971
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:58,484
then you coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1972
01:55:58,556 --> 01:56:00,581
That way,
when you throw it,

1973
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:02,126
it should stick.

1974
01:56:02,193 --> 01:56:04,753
lt's a bomb that sticks.
lt's a sticky bomb.

1975
01:56:04,829 --> 01:56:05,761
You come up
with a better way

1976
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:07,161
to knock the tracks
off a tank,

1977
01:56:07,232 --> 01:56:08,995
l'm all ears.

1978
01:56:09,067 --> 01:56:10,056
This is good.

1979
01:56:10,135 --> 01:56:13,070
Now we got
to surrender our socks.

1980
01:56:27,018 --> 01:56:28,076

1981

All right, select
the field of fire.

Cross fire with the one
in the bell tower.

1983
01:56:46,571 --> 01:56:48,937
All right. l can cover

Here are the mines.

1987

For being the best
we can do,

1988
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:46,219
that forward machine gun

1989
01:57:46,297 --> 01:57:49,232
is not in a terrible
firing position.

1990

And this position
right here...

1991
01:57:56,307 --> 01:57:58,434
this is the Alamo.

1992

blows the bridge.

1994
01:58:02,213 --> 01:58:04,204
We only got a 30-second
delay on that fuse,

1995
01:58:04,282 --> 01:58:06,273
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man,

1996
01:58:06,351 --> 01:58:07,340
you better hurry
your ass off,

and he's trying
to get it off,

hears this,

02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:21,816
and she screams
and she jumps up

2160
02:05:21,886 --> 02:05:23,410
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

2161
02:05:23,487 --> 02:05:24,818
but she's still got
this shirt over her head.

2162
02:05:24,889 --> 02:05:26,686
She goes running
right into the wall

2163
02:05:26,757 --> 02:05:29,351
and knocks herself out.

2164

So now Dan
is just so mad at us.

2165
02:05:31,796 --> 02:05:33,525
He-- He starts
coming after us,

but at the same time,

2167
02:05:34,699 --> 02:05:35,961
Alice is over there
unconscious.

2168
02:05:36,033 --> 02:05:37,557
He's got to wake her up.

2169
02:05:37,635 --> 02:05:39,728
So he grabs her
by a leg,

2170
02:05:39,804 --> 02:05:40,930
and he's dragging her.

2171
02:05:41,005 --> 02:05:42,666
At the same time,
he picks up a shovel,

2172
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,503
and he's going
after Sean.

2173
02:05:44,575 --> 02:05:46,736
And Sean said, ''What are you
trying to hit me for?

that l write to inform you
your son,

Private James Ryan,

2452

at this very moment,

2453

on his way home from
European battlefields.

2454
02:37:29,845 --> 02:37:33,406

02:37:33,482 --> 02:37:37,282
with great courage
and steadfast dedication

2456
02:37:37,353 --> 02:37:39,947

your family has suffered
in this great campaign

to rid the world of tyranny
and oppression.

Nothing,

2465
02:38:02,578 --> 02:38:05,945
not even the safe return
of a beloved son,

2466
02:38:06,015 --> 02:38:07,414
can compensate you

2467
02:38:07,483 --> 02:38:10,577
or the thousands
of other American families

2468

who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.

And l might share
with you some words

which have sustained me

2471
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:19,159
through long, dark nights

2472
02:38:19,228 --> 02:38:21,958
of peril, loss
and heartache.

2473
02:38:22,031 --> 02:38:24,522
And l quote,

2474

''l pray
that our Heavenly Father

2475

of your bereavement

2476
02:38:29,672 --> 02:38:31,799
and leave you only
the cherished memory

2477
02:38:31,874 --> 02:38:33,739
of the loved and lost

2478
02:38:33,809 --> 02:38:36,277
and the solemn pride
that must be yours

2479
02:38:36,345 --> 02:38:39,314
to have laid
so costly a sacrifice

2480
02:38:39,381 --> 02:38:41,611
upon the altar of freedom.

They wanted
to come with me.

2486

l-- l wasn't sure
how l'd feel

coming back here.

2489
02:39:56,892 --> 02:40:00,453
Every day l think about
what you said to me

2490
02:40:00,529 --> 02:40:02,292
that day on the bridge.

2491
02:40:03,732 --> 02:40:05,996
And l've tried
to live my life

2492
02:40:06,068 --> 02:40:07,865
the best l could.

2493
02:40:08,938 --> 02:40:11,031
l hope
that was enough.

2494
02:40:12,174 --> 02:40:15,075
l hope that,
at least in your eyes...

2495
02:40:16,745 --> 02:40:18,679
l've earned
what all of you

2496
02:40:18,747 --> 02:40:20,578
have done for me.

2497
02:40:33,963 --> 02:40:35,328

2498
02:40:37,633 --> 02:40:39,760
''Captain
John H. Miller.''

2499
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:51,043
Tell me l've led
a good life.

2500
02:40:51,113 --> 02:40:52,205
What?

2501
02:40:53,449 --> 02:40:56,111
Tell me l'm a good man.

2502
02:41:02,925 --> 02:41:04,586
You are.
