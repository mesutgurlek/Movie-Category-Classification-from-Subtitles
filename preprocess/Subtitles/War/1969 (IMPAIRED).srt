00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,428
Not you.

Here you are, Happy. Go on.

You gonna rake the yard
before you go back?

167
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,121
No. Well, I gotta study.

168
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,800
You're gonna rake the yard, aren't you?

169
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,795
On Easter Sunday? Wrong.

170
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:11,248
Come on, cut it out. Beth.

171
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:13,292
Don't do that.

172
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,507
OK.

182
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,413
How's it going? Huh?

183
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,581
All right.

184
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,708
I like your hair.

185
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:36,516
- Yeah, I like yours too.
- Yeah?

- Superintendents, huh?
- Yeah.

187

It's hard to imagine
Dad ever being young like us.

188
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,572
Yeah, well. He might have been
young like you.

189
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,702
He was never young like me.

190
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,931
At my age he was already
married and had me.

191
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:59,408
Well, he was in a hurry to get old.
That's not my trip.

I keep trying to picture myself...

getting out...

194
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,171
and getting married.

You getting any?

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

Yeah, I've been doing that
a long time now.

200

No shit?
I didn't get laid till I was almost 20.

201
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,948
Really? That's a drag.

Yeah.

Well.

210

It's yours.

00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,907
I don't want it.

212

Well, I'm... I'm giving it
to you, Scott.

I don't want your car, Alden.

Look, you can trade it in
on something else, then.

215
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:34,009
- It's OK. I like hitchhiking.
- Then park the car and hitchhike.

Look. I'm trying to be nice to you.

for being a prick to me all my life?

Alden, you might have
everybody impressed.

You come in here like some big hero,

in your little uniform
and your little boy's haircut.

222

said a word to me in three years.

223
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:02,411
You're only being nice to me
cos you're chickenshit about Vietnam.

224
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,953
Shut up.

Yeah. Sure.

231
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,868
You must be really
proud of your brother.

Yeah. Wanna come with me?
Shoot a few Cong?

No. It's not my war.
I don't care about it.

- Is that so?
- Yeah.

It's bullshit.

236

Apologise to your brother.

237
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,737

- You did good.
- Thanks. Thanks for coming.

470
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:08,918
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, Coach. How are you?

471
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,083
I just wanted to say goodbye
before you got run out of town.

472
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,335
Probably woke up
some zombies around here.

473
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,969
- What about this kid?
- Very interesting. Congratulations.

474
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:20,178
Thank you.

475
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:26,312
Oh, Beth, it was a lovely speech.
You made me cry, you made me think.

476
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:30,190
And you. You look like a fortune-teller.

477
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,810
- How you doing, Dad?
- How'd your finals go?

478
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:36,065
Finals. I knew I forgot something.

479
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:40,821
- I saw you.
- Not working at the pool this summer?

480
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:43,741
No, we're going on the road.
That's what hippies do.

481
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,280
You gotta live life while
you still got it.

482
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,735
Did you see me?

483
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,331
Yeah.

484
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:55,133
I'm trading in Alden's car for a van.
We're just gonna groove.

485
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,752
What's your brother
gonna say about that?

486
00:39:57,889 --> 00:40:00,095
He'll probably freak out
and kill someone

487
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:03,843
cos he won't try to understand.
Same as you.

488
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:07,726
Oh, this is the happiest day of my life.

489
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:12,401
Hi, honey. How are you?

490
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:17,859
What is it I'm supposed to understand?

491
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:22,366
- Me, Dad. Fucking me.
- You watch your mouth.

492
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,530
Well, Jessie, I guess I'm
just like you now.

My sister Beth

509
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:34,859
Come on people now,
smile on your brother

Everybody get together,
try to love one another

- Ralph! No!

Some may come and some may go

Returns for us at last

517
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:06,437
Wait. Ralph.

518
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:10,980
Come on, Ralph. Can you hear me?

519
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,685
- Ralph! Ralph!
- Did he flunk out?

520
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,575
- I don't know.
- Did you flunk out, Ralph?

521
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,655

Oh, Ralph. Oh, sweetheart.

524
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:28,917
- What's going on?
- Is he on something, Scottie?

525
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,583
- LSD.
- CLIFF: You guys are on drugs?

526
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,384
- Is this the first time he's taken it?
- I don't know.

527

JESSIE: Cliff, stop that.

What... what is it?

530
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,757
- We'd better get him to the hospital.
- No! No!

531
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,812
You're not gonna take my baby away. No!

532

- JESSIE: Let's go.

00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,375

You are the reason
I've been waiting all these years

Somebody holds the key

Well, I'm near the end

And I Just ain't got the time

and I can't find my way home

This is us.

551
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:48,013
The leaves in the trees.

552
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:56,483
Most people are mushrooms
or toadstools or worms or something.

553
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:00,995
But we're leaves, you know, in the sky.

554
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:05,201
Above all the roots,
the dirt, the dog-doo.

00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:07,539
You get it?

556
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:10,718
You know? Us, leaves.
Like the Beatles...

557
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:14,075
Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, of course.

00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:17,011
Yeah. They are cool cats.

559
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:20,299
Yeah.

560
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:24,222
Probably Kurt Vonnegut.

561
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:27,470
Beckett. Camus.

562
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:29,978
Camus? Yeah. Yeah.

563
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,565
Definitely a cool cat.

564
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:38,239
- Who is he? I forgot.
- He was a writer.

565
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:43,326
Yeah. Right, I remember. God, I read
everything that sucker ever wrote.

00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:46,038
Yeah? So?

- Who else, man?
- Well...

568
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:56,712
The Kennedy brothers,
even though they're dead.

569
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:59,515
Definitely leaves, especially Bobby.

570
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,467
And, uh...

571
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:06,264
probably Eugene McCarthy.

572
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:07,347
Uh...

573
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:10,732
Carlos Castaneda. Eldridge Cleaver.

574
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And what about the Beaver?

575
00:46:13,986 --> 00:46:16,856
And what about Wally? Or no.

576
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:21,403
He's kinda like a root, I guess, right?
Probably a carrot.

577
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:29,541
Eddie Haskell would be...
basically... dogshit. Am I right?

578
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,628
- Yeah. You're feeling better, huh?
- Yeah. I think so.

579
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,544

- I'm groovy. Will you leave me alone?

00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:51,023
You sure?

583
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:58,194
I OD'd one time. I flunked out of college.
That doesn't make me retarded.

584
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:01,577
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You go play in the sand dunes.

No. No. Me, actually, I'm a little
nervous about getting sunburnt.

So, where do you want to go, Ralph?

617
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:41,869
Maybe we should go home.
You know? My mother worries about me.

618
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,034
You are so weird.

619
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:47,000
It's not just that.
Maybe we should get jobs.

620
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:50,958
Jobs? We're leaves, Ralph.
Leaves don't need money.

We have naked people
giving us free food.

622
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:57,256
Maybe I'm not a leaf, OK?

623
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,763
Maybe I'm a rabbit or something.

624
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:08,059
Anyway, I thought that I might go home.

The LEM foot pads are only, uh,

814
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:05,390
depressed in the surface about,
uh, one or two inches,

815
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,980
although the surface appears to be, uh,

816
01:06:10,106 --> 01:06:12,976
very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.

It's almost like a powder down there.
It's very fine.

OK?

827
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,089
I was thinking that I could wake up
in the middle of the night

828
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:27,767
and I could hear my three little men
snoring away.

"This is an insane asylum."

Don't you sleep?

840
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:35,464
I just hope Alden isn't suffering.

841
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:41,471
- I'd rather he be dead than suffer.
- Oh. We can't lose hope.

Yes, we can. It's our hope,

I'm not going with you, Scott.

01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:22,405
What?

944
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:29,368
It's not over there. It's inside of us,
or it doesn't exist at all.

945
01:20:29,918 --> 01:20:31,956
I don't want to run away.

Fine.

No. Fuck you.

If you died I would die too.

951

My father died when I was 11. I know
what it's like to lose someone you love.

I want you to stay with me and fight.

have just gone. It's a free country.

Was blind

But now

01:23:06,455 --> 01:23:10,619
I see

963
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:22,514
Alden Palmer Denny is the first boy...

964
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:25,374
from Culloch County to die in Vietnam.

965
01:23:25,474 --> 01:23:28,309
Let us wish him Godspeed and peace

966
01:23:29,062 --> 01:23:32,561
and pray that he'll be the last. Amen.

ALL: Amen.

968
01:24:36,257 --> 01:24:40,207
I said something to my brother one time,

969
01:24:40,344 --> 01:24:42,385
that this wasn't my war.

970
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,091
I guess I was wrong.

It's everybody's war.

I'm sorry, Alden.

973

My father over there has got medals
to prove that he fought in a good war.

974
01:25:01,657 --> 01:25:06,569
And I'm proud of my father,
even though he doesn't like me right now.

I don't believe that this is a good war.

That's all Ralph was trying to say.

It's all my brother
ended up saying, too.

you can do about it though.

You can disagree.

You can say that it's not right.

327 of us from Culloch County,

marched in Washington
