1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,586
<i>(rowdy voices and blows landed)</i>

2
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,130
MAN: Come on, put some effort in!

3
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,181
Come on, son!

4
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,305
Right in the kisser!

5
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,515
Keep moving.
That's it, son.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,476
Get your hands up, lad!

7
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,021
Come on.
Left, right, left, right!

8
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,691
That's it!
Come on!

9
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,440
That's it!
Into him, Hook!

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,486
Keep fucking going!
Controlled aggression.

11
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,243
That's it, keep throwing.
One, two. One, two.

12
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,450
Lads, keep throwing.
Good work.

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,120
Take it and give it back.

14
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,585
That's it, keep going.
Lovely.

15
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,257
All right, time!

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,710
I said, time! Fucking break 'em!

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,880
Good lads.

18
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,011
You'll do for me, boys.

19
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,014
Back in line.
Next.

20
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,013
Next.

21
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,895
Welcome to the regiment.

22
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,028
<i>Watch your footing, boys.</i>

23
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,944
Open it up a bit.
Open it up a bit.

24
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,276
Come on, stay with me.

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,326
Stay with me.

26
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,530
Steady.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,868
Watch it.

28
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,456
- Keep moving.
- (laughter)

29
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,912
Get back to your fucking feet!

30
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,169
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,214
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

32
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,008
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

33
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,723
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

34
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,388
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

35
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,678
Do not be afraid of the water.

36
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,935
Plough through it.
Plough through it.

37
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,021
Pull yourself up, Thompson.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,317
Keep that head down.

39
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,441
Nice one.
Come on, Hook.
Good work, son.

40
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,029
That's it.

41
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,233
Pull yourself...

42
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,194
Come on, then, Hook.

43
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,870
Help him out, Thompson.

44
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,539
Help him out, Thompson.
Come on, drag him.

45
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,243
(shouts) Up the wall, go!

46
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,036
Go on, get up there!

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,793
Come on, get your back against the wall.
Get him up there.

48
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,169
Come on, stop messing around.

49
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,342
Go on, get him up.
Drag him up.

50
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,012
Go on, that's it, help each other.
Help each other! That's it.

51
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,841
- Come on, Thommo.
- Your lives are in each other's hands.

52
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,302
Teamwork, boys.
Teamwork.

53
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,012
Well done, guys.
Get his knees up.

54
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,472
Go on, keep moving!

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,977
Keep it going!
Keep it going!

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,536
What are you doing?
Leave him!

57
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,034
You can send a medic back
when you reach your objective.

58
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,833
Now get back in formation
before you get everybody killed!

59
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,501
(gunshots)

60
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,747
(gunshot)

61
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,001
Hands off cocks and pull on socks!

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,173
Come on, get fell in!

63
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,635
Platoon... Platoon, 'shun!

64
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,222
Because of the deteriorating
security situation in Belfast,

65
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,559
your regiment is now being deployed there
on an emergency basis.

66
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,269
Any questions?

67
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,697
- We're not going to Germany?
- You're going to Belfast.

68
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,991
I take it you all know
where Belfast is?

69
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,528
Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom.

70
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,905
Here.

71
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,162
You are not leaving this country.

72
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,548
What's up wi' you?

73
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,552
Come on, Darren, our kid, eat your food
before it gets cold, mate.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,391
'Ey up, listen...

75
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,232
I don't want you
worried about me, OK?

76
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,899
I'll be fine.
I promise you.

77
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,952
- Now, come on, eat up.
- (taps tray)

78
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,372
I'm not even leaving the country,
so you've got nothing to worry about.

79
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,413
- Got a girlfriend?
- No.

80
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,794
No?

81
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,210
Let me see your teeth.

82
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,262
You liar! (laughs)

83
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,275
(laughs)

84
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,396
Wa-hey-hey!

85
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,405
Go on, then!
Go on!

86
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,389
Right, I'll be back soon, OK?

87
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,181
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

88
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,804
Hug.

89
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,055
- All children must be back by five pm.
- Go on.

90
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,687
You of all people should remember that,
Hook.

91
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,782
Offload.
Welcome to Ireland.

92
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,198
Come down. I want you lining up
with your gun over there.

93
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,743
Quickly, and up the stairs.

94
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,870
Come on, move.

95
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,668
Move, move, move.

96
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,791
That's right, single file.

97
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,215
Single file.
Drop your gun off.

98
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,757
Right, this is where
you eat and sleep.

99
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,430
I'll show you where
you shit in a minute.

100
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,678
Why you look so gormless?

101
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,475
Were you expecting the fucking Ritz?

102
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,853
Get your kit squared away.

103
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,976
Get a fucking brew on.

104
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,316
You're not at the
depot now, boys.

105
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,527
You've got to look
after yourselves.

106
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,023
And don't worry,

107
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,198
you'll only be staying here till one of
the Paddies shoots you anyway.

108
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,618
Come on, hurry up and organise yourselves.
Hurry up and come inside, man!

109
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,283
Attention!

110
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,621
At ease.

111
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,086
I'm Lieutenant Armitage,
your platoon commander.

112
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,379
I um...

113
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,583
I just wanted to
meet the new boys.

114
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,591
- I'm a bit of a new boy myself, actually.
- (mouths)

115
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,345
Well, looking forward to getting to know
you all over the next couple of days.

116
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,472
Anyway, hello.

117
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,936
(Armitage chuckles)

118
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,352
Well, carry on.

119
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,107
You heard what the man said.
Carry on.

120
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,862
(coughing)

121
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,048
You can't sleep?

122
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,271
Ta.

123
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,199
- Who are they?
- MRF, undercover guys.

124
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,743
Nothing to do with us.

125
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,963
<i>Pay attention. Now, this is basic
information but very necessary.</i>

126
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,632
Roughly, very roughly,

127
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,883
you can divide the city between the
Protestant Loyalist east, here in orange,

128
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,012
friendly.

129
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,846
And the Catholic Nationalist west
in green,

130
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,896
hostile.

131
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:25,227
Both communities have paramilitary
factions itching to get at each other.

132
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,813
You need to be aware that
within the Republican movement

133
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,945
we're seeing a split between
the older official IRA elements

134
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,198
and the younger
more radical street-fighting element,

135
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,699
the Provisionals.

136
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,746
This is the front line, boys.

137
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,373
Catholics and Protestants living
side by side, <i>at</i> each other's throats,

138
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,204
divided by the Falls Road.

139
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,632
You can use the Divis Flats
at the top of the Falls Road

140
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,010
as an orientation point,

141
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,382
but do not enter the flats.

142
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,715
They've become
an IRA stronghold.

143
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,219
Very dangerous.

144
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,427
I think that's all.
Dismissed.

145
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,498
Your rifle.

146
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,008
Look lively!

147
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,974
- Expecting a riot, Sergeant?
- I thought we should be prepared, sir.

148
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,973
Today's operation is to assist the RUC
in conducting a house search

149
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,269
in the Catholic community.

150
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,723
I want berets, Sergeant.
No riot gear.

151
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,727
- Are you sure, sir?
- We need to reassure people.

152
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,155
We're here to protect them. We need to
look them in the eye and tell them that.

153
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,358
Carry on.

154
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,786
All right, boys, you heard the man.

155
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,454
Shields and helmets back here.

156
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,747
Berets on.

157
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,873
<i>Come on, quick as you can! Load up.</i>

158
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,834
Get on.
We have to move out in two minutes.

159
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,719
We've got to reassure the Paddy.

160
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,722
Quick.

161
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,843
Emergency crisis my arse!

162
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,296
Apparently the birds fucking love us
over here, lads.

163
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,553
Mate of mine was out here last year.
"Chucking fucking knickers at us."

164
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Brilliant, mate.

165
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,271
Looks like Leeds.

166
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,817
(continued chatter and laughter)

167
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,243
ARMITAGE: Stop here.

168
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,455
Stop here, Corporal.

169
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,968
No street signs.

170
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,638
If that's north,
then we must be near the Falls Road.

171
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,309
(liquid splashing)

172
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,231
Oh!

173
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,988
Fuck me! We must be near
the Falls Road. It's pish!

174
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,112
Get on to HQ
and advise the road is barricaded.

175
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,538
- (laughter)
- Quickly.

176
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,956
You dickheads!

177
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,659
Get out of here now, you dickheads!

178
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,878
- Oh!
- (laughter)

179
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,207
- Get out of here, you fucking shitbags!
- All units to double one two.

180
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,757
Youse fucking creeps!

181
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,052
Get out of Ireland now!

182
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,052
Get out of this country!
None of us likes you!

183
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,131
Go!

184
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,800
Get down, get down, get down!

185
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,937
Get into a bit of bother, lads?

186
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,442
Follow us.

187
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,819
Right, load up, chaps.

188
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,026
Load up!

189
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,766
(distant clattering)

190
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,851
Come on.
Hurry up, hurry up.

191
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,729
(clattering of dustbin lids)

192
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,950
You want to make
sure you're ready.

193
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,452
We've got to be quick.

194
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,579
OK, boys.

195
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,083
- Dismount!
- (clattering continues)

196
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,504
All right, boys, you want to
cordon off the house both sides.

197
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,802
(clattering continues)

198
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,301
All right, boys, I want you to cordon off
both sides of the house

199
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,759
by forming a line from this side
all the way down to this side.

200
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,890
Move your fucking arses!

201
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,265
(clattering drowns out shouted orders)

202
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,948
Move!

203
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,004
(shouting and clattering continues)

204
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,500
Move your fucking arses!

205
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,589
The guns, where are they?

206
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,638
Where are the fucking guns,
you Fenian bitch?

207
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,890
You're with me, come here.

208
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,221
There are no
guns in this house!

209
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,477
Don't you be fucking lying!
Where's the fucking guns?

210
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,143
Where's the fucking guns?

211
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,232
Right, just stay fucking there.

212
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,567
Stay there.
Just stay there.

213
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,573
That'll do.
That'll do there, thank you.

214
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,451
That'll do there, pal.
Stay back, please, there's a good lad.

215
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,998
Hey, it's just a search!

216
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,577
It's just a stop-and-search.

217
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,128
(overlapping voices)

218
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,754
You don't want to be here.
Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck...

219
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,676
Let me the fuck through!

220
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,634
Just stay there.
Just fucking calm down. Stay there.

221
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,342
(overlapping angry voices)

222
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,351
- It's just a search.
- Just stay there, please.

223
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,478
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop touching us!

224
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,660
(shouting intensifies)

225
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,157
Hey, hey, back it up!

226
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,035
It's got nothing to do with us,
just fucking stay there!

227
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,125
Hey, where's the fucking Lieutenant?

228
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,878
- Find him! Tell him we need more men!
- Yes, Corporal.

229
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,672
...where the fucking guns are!

230
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,516
For God's sake,
will you never leave us alone?

231
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,559
Shut your fucking mouth!

232
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,969
Rip it apart.

233
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,523
- You'll find no guns in this house!
- Shut your fucking mouth!

234
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,981
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Where's my husband?

235
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,109
Shut the fuck up,
you stupid bitch!

236
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,485
Sir.

237
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,316
Answer the fucking question!

238
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,902
- Sir, you're wanted outside, sir.
- Bastard!

239
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,078
WOMAN:
Fucking get off of him!

240
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,532
Get off him!

241
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,662
Hold the line!

242
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,869
(overlapping shouting)

243
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,922
Hold the line!
Hold them back!

244
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,884
Don't you fucking touch me!

245
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,633
Fucking stay where you are!
Do <i>as</i> you're fucking told!

246
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,388
(gunshot)

247
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,098
Hold your fire!

248
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,306
Hold your fire!
Do not shoot. Do not shoot.

249
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,231
Get your fucking heads down!

250
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,777
Do not shoot!

251
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,824
- (overlapping angry voices)
- Hold the line!

252
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,333
We need more men!

253
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,877
What do you want to do?

254
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,501
We've a full-blown fucking riot
on our hands here, sir.

255
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,206
Bring helmets next time.

256
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,461
What do you want to do?

257
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,668
Medic!
Medic!

258
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,174
Boys, get here!
Help the sergeant!

259
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,467
(shouting)

260
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,564
The gun!

261
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,732
Hook, the gun!

262
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,936
Get the fucking gun!

263
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,078
Just the rifle, lad,
just the rifle, that'll do.

264
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,333
Fuck off!

265
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,960
Gaz! Gaz! Gaz!

266
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,335
Go on, get him!

267

(shouting)

268
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,762
Do not fire!
Hold your line!

269
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,889
Go, go!

270

(jeering)

275
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,258
Get off 'em!
Get off 'em!

276
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,931
They've had enough!
Off 'em! They've had enough!

277
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,132
Don't you dare push me!

278
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,639
Get off them.
Conor, you should be ashamed of yourself.

279
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,141
These boys are young enough
to be your sons!

280
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,518
Get back, the lot of you.

281
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,099
We've had enough for today!

282
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,981
Behaving like animals,
you should be ashamed of yourselves.

283
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,858
You want to get to them,
you get through me.

284
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,439
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

285
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,822
Every single one of you.
Now you get up the road now.

286
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,777
Move back! All of youse!
I can see you.

287
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,908
- Move back! Get back!

288
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,910
Oh, Jesus!

289
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,621
Thommo, Thommo, Thommo.

290
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,748
Get the fuck off me!

291
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,871
Shit! Thommo...

292
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,457
Fucking shoot him, Sean!

293
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,052
Sean, shoot him!

294
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,175
Run! Run!

295
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,882
Sean!

296
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,142
Run!

297
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,565
- (gunshots)
- Oh, fuck!

298
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,962
Oh, shit!

299
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,967
(woman shrieks)

300
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,928
(child screams)

301
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,490
Go down.
Check the street.

302
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,504
Fuck!

303
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,348
Oh, shit!

304
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,533
(gunshot)

305
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,049
Fuck.

306
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,529
(panting)

307
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,910
Fuck!

308
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,663
We have to go.

309
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,212
We have to get back and collect the guns
before the Brits come back. Come on.

310
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,426
(sobs)

311
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,190
There was two of them.
One got away.

312
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,900
Why didn't you shoot him?

313
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,155
It jammed.

314
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,826
Oh, for fuck's sake.

315
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,586
- What are youse fucking doing?
- What you're supposed to be doing.

316
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,917
There was an agreement.

317
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,674
D'you understand the shite
this is going to bring down on us now?

318
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,217
Do you?

319
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,267
There's going to be Brits
crawling all over here, kicking doors in.

320
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,596
- We'll fight them.
- No, you fucking won't!

321
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,100
And stand your men down.

322
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,057
You, get away home.

323
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,522
I'll fucking see you later!

324
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,191
Get up that road, you.

325
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,029
Come on.

326
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,362
After the Brit.

327
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,546
Sean, I'm serious.
Don't get involved.

328
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,375
Not with them.

329
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,336
D'you hear me?

330
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,285
(clattering)

331
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,868
(distant shouting)

332
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,200
WOMAN:
Is that you, Sean?

333
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,902
Yeah.

334
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,828
How was college?

335
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,952
Good, good.

336
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,666
Are you hungry, love?

337
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,662
I'm just going to go upstairs
and put my jacket down.

338
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,793
I'm putting it on the table now.

339
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,840
(buzz of shaver)

340
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,347
The new boys are back.
They've taken a right hiding.

341
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,221
Two soldiers missing <i>as</i> well.

342
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,893
It's not good.

343
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,141
They're out there now looking for them.

344
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,432
Are you sure about tonight, sir?

345
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,148
(shouting)

346
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,735
Come back, come back,
there's only a few of them.

347
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,695
- Fucking Catholic bastards.
- Hey, ssh.

348
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,998
Get the fuck off me! What the fuck
are you doing? Get off me!

349
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,412
Please don't bring them back here.

350

Stay quiet.

351
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,003
Ssh.

352

You're a fucking Brit?

353
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,551
A soldier?

354
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,800
A real soldier?

355
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,187
Fucking brilliant!

356
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,639
What barracks are you in?

357
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,269
I dunno, I was in a school.

358
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,101
Was it Maghaberry?

359
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,276
Palace Barracks?

360
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,979
- Holywood?
- I dunno.

361
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,156
- What are you doing out? Get home.
- I am home.

362
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,575
Are you lost?

363
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,199
Come on,
I'll take you back to your barracks.

364
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,660
Come on.
I'll take you to your barracks.

365
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,207
It's up to you.

366

Hurry up, you ball-bag.

370

Make sure you explain everything
to them carefully.

371
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,430
What's your name?

372
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,682
Gary Hook.

373
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,187
You're not a Catholic.

374
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,984
Not with a name like that.

375
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,108
Are you a Protestant?

376
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,360
I don't know.

377
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,157
You don't know?

378
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,281
I've fucking heard it all now.

379
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,821
I'm going to join the Army.

380
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,952
I'm going to join
the Ulster Rifles.

381
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,705
My da was in them.

382
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,832
My granddad was in them, too.

383
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,913
He was at the Somme.

384
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,546
We were the only ones that reached
the German lines. Did you know that?

385
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,172
None of youse English did.

386
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,300
Cos you're rubbish at fighting.

387
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,514
Still, it's good you're here now

388
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,810
cos we can get on and kill
these Fenian bastards, once and for all.

389

390
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,147

391
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,271
They're going to kill us all.

392
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,372
Come on, don't worry.

393
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,294
I know them.
My uncle's in charge of them.

394
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,793
They're OK.
They're on our side.

395
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,171

398
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,148
- I found him at the riot.
- You down at the riot, were you?

399
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,480
Aye. You should have seen it.
It was fucking magic.

400
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,362
I got this bottle and I threw it
at this huge Fenian fucker.

401
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,115
- Oh, was he a giant, was he?
- He was a giant.

402
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,366
And I hit him
right in his dirty Taig face.

403
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,991
Is that what happened, mate?

404

Aye.

405
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:24,089
You didn't notice if this giant came down
a big fucking beanstalk, did you?

406
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,958
- What's your name?
- Listen, wee man,

407
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,295
- he didn't mean anything.
- I'm not talking to you.

408
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,674
I'm talking to him.

409

Who are you?

410
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,765
- Look, wee man...
- Don't you fucking call me "wee man".

411
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,889
Do you know
who my uncle is?

Jake Fullarton.

413

- Sorry.
- You will be fucking sorry.

414
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,144
I didn't mean anything by it.

Didn't he take you with him?

492
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,006
Give us a packet of crisps, Frank.

493
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,398
How are you going to get
up for work in the morning?

494
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,816
What?

495
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,145
Well, you're not getting
your alarm clock back, are you?

496
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,281
Look, it's better than having to
shoot somebody in the head.

497
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,580
Come on,
we'll get this over and done with,

498
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,874
then we'll be back in
time for the darts.

499
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,883
Careful.

500
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,100
What are you doing?

501
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,454
(crashing)

502
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,416
MAN:
Can I have some help, please?

503
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,126
(coughs)

504
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,129
Let's have some help here.

505
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,845
Oh...

506
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,550
(coughing)

507
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,025
He's breathing.

508
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,653
It's all right, son,
we'll get you to the hospital.

509
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,908
Come on, where's the...?

510
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,035
Come here!

511
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,458
It's all right.

512
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,585
Open the door!

513
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,610
(overlapping voices)

514
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,849
(voices shouting)

515
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,680
(groans)

516
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,650
I thought you'd been through
the explosives handling drill with 'em.

517
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,442
I did, sir, a hundred fucking times.

518
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,566
They're <i>as</i> thick as fuck.

519
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,939
Did he see the bomb?

520
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,650
- Did he see the fucking bomb?
- Yes, he saw the bomb.

521
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,747
There's no way he
could survive that, sir.

522
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,261
- Leave him be.
- We can't.

523
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,056
We don't know him.

524
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,014
We can't just leave him.

525
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,182
- Come on.
- Da.

526
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,859
- Help me.
- Oh, God.

527
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,522
Careful.

528
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,194
Jesus.

529
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,979
Come on.

530
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,682
Come on.

531
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,359
No, your room.
Your room.

532
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,562
Go on.

533
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,152
OK.

534
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,279
Careful.
Careful.

535
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,028
OK.

536
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,158
Get his jumper off.

537
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,745
Da, stop.

538
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,792
He's a soldier.

539
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,417
We can't help him.

540
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,336
We have to.

541
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,171
We can take him
to the hospital.

542
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,473
It's too dangerous.
And not just for him.

543
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,303
If we get seen taking a
soldier to the hospital...

544
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,187
Come on.

545
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,482
Come on.

546
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,045
Jesus fucking Christ!

547
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:46,224
So we can't shoot a fucking soldier but
you can blow up a pub on the Shankill?

548
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,395
- It's nothing to do with me.
- Nothing?

549
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,188
- It wasn't us.
- Ah, so who was it?

550
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,060
- It wasn't you, no?
- No.

551
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:02,073
- You sure about that?
- Of course I'm fucking sure.

552
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,821
So where the fuck
have you been all day?

553
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,488
We were driving about
looking for that other soldier.

554
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,083
I told you to stand down.

555
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,957
Well, we didn't.

556
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,208
You better hope he didn't
get a good look at youse.

557
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,838
He'll be sitting in the Palace Barracks
going through those photo albums.

558
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,668
They've got your
photo down there, too.

559
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,004
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

560
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,594
Cheeky bastard.

561
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,810
Fuck's sake, lads.

562
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,229
- There has to be discipline.
- Fuck discipline.

563
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,013
Relax.

564
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,183
Jimmy.

565
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:42,526
Next time you disobey my orders,
I can't protect you.

566
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,903
What's that supposed to mean?

567
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,448
What the fuck do
you think it means?

568
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,004
What do you think?
Do you believe him?

569
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,214
He's lying.

570
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,929
And we're going to kill him.

571
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,343
I'm going to get the guns.

572
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,054
You keep an eye on him,
I'll meet you back here.

573
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,777
Undo his shirt.

574
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,452
OK.

575
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,838
<i>- Oh...
- OK.</i>

576
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,468
- Argh!
- Easy.

577
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,929
Easy. Easy, easy.

578
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,055
It's OK, it's OK.

579
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,761
Help me here.

580
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,687
Hold him.
Hold him down.

581
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,891
- (groans in agony)
- OK, you're safe.

582
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,351
You're safe, you're safe now.

583
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,855
Ssh.

584
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,983
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Ssh.

585
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,903
- Get it done with. Dad...
- You're all right. You're all right.

586
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,111
Here, here.
Bite this.

587
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,872
Ssh, don't look.

588
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,996
Don't look.

589
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,206
It's OK, it's OK.
Don't look. Don't look.

590
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,207
I'm not going
to lie to you.

591
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,338
It's going to
hurt like fuck.

592
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:27,881
Oh, God.

593
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,587
- OK, hold him.
- Yeah.

594
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,547
OK.

595
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,971
(cries out in agony)

596
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,302
- No, Dad!
- OK, OK.

597
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,479
Ssh.

598
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,806
OK.

599
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,390
All right.

600
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,810
- You're all right. Good man.
- Da, I can't do it.

601
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,570
Hold him down, hold him down,
would you?

602
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,693
- (cries out in agony)
- Ssh.

603
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,818
That's it.
That's it.

604
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,745
You're all right.
Good man, good man.

605
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,869
All right.

606
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,372
Good lad.
That's it, that's it.

607
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,205
- No, no, no, no!
- Ssh!

608
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,457
- Quiet!
- Ssh!

609
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,589
It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

610
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,090
- Da, I can't do it.
- It's OK.

611
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,138
Don't look.
Don't look.

612
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,341
Jesus Christ.

613
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,184
Lean on him.
Put your weight on him.

614
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,978
- I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm...
- Put your weight on him!

615
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,226
That's it, OK.

616
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,857
That's it.

617
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,934
- It's OK.
- That's it.

618
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,020
- It's OK.
- OK.

619
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,360
- Fucking hell.
- It's OK, it's OK.

620
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:35,990
You're OK, you're OK.

621
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,663
You're doing great.
It's OK.

622
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,830
It's OK, it's OK.

623
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,749
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

624
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,495
You're doing great.

625
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,205
- It's OK.
- (groans)

626
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,131
Well, look, if he is dead,
it's problem solved, innit?

627
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,508
Let's hope so.

628
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,635
Hope so?

629
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,724
What if he's not dead, Sergeant?

630
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,555
What then, eh?
Hm?

631
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,268
So we've got to fucking find out
if he is dead.

632
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,907
Not now, Lieutenant, we're busy.

633
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,033
- I wondered if you could help.
- We are busy.

634
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,330
I do understand that, sir.

635
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,625
Why aren't you out
there looking for him?

636
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,583
- What?
- Why aren't you out looking for him?

637
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,415
- Who?
- Hook. Private Hook.

638
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,673
- You probably know where they'd take him.
- Don't you fucking dare!

639
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,550
I'm your fucking senior officer.

640
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,677
Stand up straight!

641
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,817
You need to learn to control your men,
Lieutenant.

642
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:53,231
I am not here to clear up
your fucking mistakes.

643
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:57,819
Your men, your fucking responsibility,
not mine.

644
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,989
I'm asking for your help.

645
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,506
There you go.
There's my help.

646
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,600
- Is he dead?
- We do not know.

647
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,724
The situation is confused
to say the least.

648
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,682
Now, if you do not mind,
we have work to do.

649
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,522
Off you go.

650
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,256
It's a fucking mess, Sergeant.

651
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,380
Your fucking mess.

652
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,389
You been in the
Army for long?

653
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,474
No.

654
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,897
I was in the
Army myself.

655
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,558
Medic.

656
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,732
20 years.

657
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:20,618
Posh cunts telling thick cunts
to kill poor cunts.

658
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,450
That's the Army for you.

659
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,580
It's all a lie.

660
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,537
They don't care about you.

661
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,249
You're just a piece
of meat to them.

662
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,089
Piece of meat.

663
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,093
Get yourself some rest, son.

664
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,600
Come on.

665
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,744
D'you want me to
go and get Quinn?

666
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,451
No.

667
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,746
What are we going to do, then?

668
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,583
I'll make a phone call.

669
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,593
And you stay here.
Don't answer the door to anyone.

670
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,181
(front door opens)

671
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,304
(front door shuts)

672
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,238
- I've got to go now.
- You need to rest.

673
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,065
I've got to get back
to the barracks.

674
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:49,197
It's too dangerous just now.
There's rioting.

675
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,778
Careful, careful.

676
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,364
Here, lie down.

677
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,620
- (groans)
- Round that way now. Here.

678
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,632
It's still bleeding here.

679
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,178
Thank you.

680
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,302
♪ LEE HAZLEWOOD:
My Autumn's Done Come/My Autumn's Gone

681
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,351
Do you like David Bowie?

682
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,777
Eh?

683
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,901
Do you not like him?

684
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,942
He's all right.

685
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,153
Just for girls really, ain't he?

686
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,369
Is this your first time away?

687
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,372
Yeah.

688
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,875
Have you got a
girlfriend back home?

689
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,381
No.

690
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,594
Where is it you're from?

691
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,474
Derbyshire.

692
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,598
Got cousins in Nottingham.

693
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,146
What?

694
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,690
It's just Derby and Nottingham
don't really get on.

695
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,397
And why is that?

696
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,567
I don't know really.

697
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,654
(front door opens)

698
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,781
Don't worry, it's just my da.

(programme in background)

700
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,168
Come on, you, concentrate.

701
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,464
It's boring.

702
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,089
I know it's boring
but you've got to stick in.

703
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:14,967
(knock at door)

704
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,099
Get the guns.

705
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,951
What's going on, Sean?

706
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,668
Stay there.

707
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,414
Sean!

708
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,798
Sean, get back here.

709
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,467
Where are you going?

710
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,803
Sean.

711
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,922
(knocks)

712
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,222
(knocks harder)

713
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,528
Thought he was one of yours.

714
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,858
Fuck's sake, Eamon.

715
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,529
- Everybody's looking for him.
- I didn't know he was a soldier.

716
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,206
All right.
You did the right thing to call me.

717
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,335
Right, I'll handle this, Brigid.
All right?

718
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,663
- We don't want involved in this.
- We are involved.

719
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,295
- He can't stay here.
- Right, I won't be long.

720
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,612
BRIGID: We should have called Quinn.
- No.

721
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,538
It's his district now.

722
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,538
If anybody finds out he's a Brit
and we're helping him...

723
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,961
- I'm going to go and get Quinn.
- You can't, Brigid.

724
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,499
There's no talking to
these young lads.

725
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,802
You tell Quinn, that lot...
they'll kill him.

726
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,135
You understand that?

727
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,105
Just leave it to Boyle,
he'll sort it out.

728
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,864
- Where's Boyle?
- He's at Divis Flats.

729
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,996
Eamon McCarthy's.

730
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,828
Get in.

731
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,452
Sir.

732
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,788
Does this concern my missing soldier,
Hook?

733
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,459
It does, doesn't it?
We'll come with you.

734
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,756
- Not possible.
- You'll need back-up.

735
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,834
All right.

736
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,387
But you remember who's in charge here,
eh?

737
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,589
Go, John.

738
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,478
- So where is he?
- First...

739
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,815
You owe me one and
I need a favour.

740
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,067
What?

741
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,985
I need you to take
care of someone.

742
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,941
Who?

743
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,197
James Quinn.

744
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,496
All right.

745
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,996
Now I need to get that soldier
back to the barracks.

746
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,671
- So where is he?
- The Divis.

747
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,047
But it's all right,
the situation's under control.

748
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,370
Francie.
Keep an eye out.

749
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,410
(knocking)

750
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:27,960
Sean?

751
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,584
- Quinn.
- Get in, Brigid. Get inside.

752
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,422
Get in.

753
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,889
Dad.

754
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,220
- Where is he?
- Dad.

755
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,852
- Who?
- Don't play fucking games with me, Eamon.

756
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,854
- Where is he? Where's Boyle?
- Boyle?

757
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,436
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?
I know he was here.

758
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,943
You're hiding something from me.

759
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,070
- Where is he, Brigid?
- Leave her alone.

760
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,776
Shut the fuck up.

761
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,240
And what the fuck
was Boyle doing here?

762
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,955
Tell me!

763
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,879
- Whose side are you on here, Eamon?
- He's a collaborator.

764
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:10,457
- There's a soldier in my room.
- Brigid!

765
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,840
He's not here.

766
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,425
He was here.

767
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,431
- Where's the soldier?
- He was...

768
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,764
- Where's the fucking soldier, Eamon?
- He was here! He was here!

769
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,190
He was here.

770
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,437
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

771
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,565
- Did Boyle take him?
- No, no, he was alone. He, he...

772
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,362
he must have just left.

773
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,236
Go on.

774
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,612
I'll be back for you later.
Come on, Sean.

775
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,236
The Brit's here.

776
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,616
- What?
- Keep an eye on them.

777
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:42,868
Watch the entrances!

778
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,421
It's OK.
It's all right. Ssh.

779
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,624
(Brigid sobs)

780
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,040
Check the other side.

781
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,993
Ssh.

782
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,791
(receding footsteps)

783
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,225
(coughs)

784
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,903
If that soldier's still alive,
we need to get to him first.

785
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,950
Clear up your mess.

786
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,029
When we get there,
you can stay out of fucking sight

787
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,580
and wait for my signal.

788
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,248
<i>Do you understand me, Lieutenant?</i>

789
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,449
Yes, sir.

790
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,511
Get the gun.

791
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,346
Sean!

792
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,360
Get up!

793
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,651
Move!

794
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,371
There's no need for that.

795
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,392
- Who is it?
- Boyle.

796
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,935
What is it?

797
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,524
- Jesus!
- Brigid!

798
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,322
- What the fuck?
- Brigid!

799
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,445
Brigid. Brigid.
Come on.

800
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,991
- You're all right.
- Da. Da.

801
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,457
Right, sit down.

802
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,757
There were a soldier.

803
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,004
Gary Hook.

804
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,460
He was here earlier.

805
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,004
Where is he?

806
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,220
You traitor.

807
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,597
I understand that you
feel that way, I do.

808
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:49,938
But if you do not tell me what I need
to know, then I will shoot this man.

809
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,146
And when I have done that,
then I will shoot you.

810
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,948
And believe me,
I do not want to do that.

811
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,651
So, please, tell me where the soldier is.

812
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,501
I don't know.

813
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,080
He...

814
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,257
- One.
- He left.

815
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,426
- Two.
- He left before Quinn got here!

816
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,754
Quinn was here?
Listen to me.

817
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,964
I know where they'll be.

818
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,845
Trust me.

819
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,163
Move!

820
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,168
- Stay up here.
- No problem.

821
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,890
Come on, Sean.

822
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,768
Don't think about it.

823
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,820
None of us want
to be doing this.

824
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,445
We're at war here, Sean.

825
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,745
Pull the trigger.

826
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,806
Come on, Sean.

827
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,270
Pull it.

828
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,860
I know you can.

829
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,280
Please.

830
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,203
You wanted to be
a gunman, Sean?

831
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,454
This is what being
a gunman means.

832
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,172
Pull it.

833
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,341
Pull the trigger.

834
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,741
Sir, we got to go.

835
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,573
He said to wait
for their signal.

836
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,710
Brits!
It's the fucking Brits!

837
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,568
Go!

838
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,120
Sir, we've got to do something.

839
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,252
We got to go, sir.

840
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:25,421
Go. Go!

841
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,328
It's all right.
It's all right.

842
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,797
Medic.

843
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,633
All right, let's get you home.

844
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,642
- (chokes)
- Ssh.

845
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,312
Shut up. Ssh.

846
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,157
Ssh.

847
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,670
Shut up.
Shut up.

848
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,004
Ssh.

849
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,129
Shut up!

850
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,346
(two gunshots)

851
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,358
No!

852
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,450
Down!
Put the fucking gun down!

853
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,652
Turn around.

854
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,864
Down on your fucking knees!
Now!

855
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,868
Put your hands
behind your head.

856
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,428
Look at me.

857
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,926
Look at me!

858
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:38,968
James Quinn.

859
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,930
Aye, I know your fucking name, son.

860
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,855
Boyle told me.

861
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,648
Says you're trouble.

862
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,772
Says he wants you dead.

863
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:55,950
You need to deal with him.
And soon.

864
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:58,154
You understand me?

865
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,364
Now, we can work together.

866
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:03,333
I'm a reasonable man.

867
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,536
Do you understand?

868
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:06,836
Get up.

869
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,040
Up!

870
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,298
Go on, off you go.

871
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,844
Go!

872
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:18,924
Hey.

873
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,640
I'll be in touch.

874
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,053
<i>CO:
Lieutenant Armitage has come to me</i>

875
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:42,554
<i>with some concerns about
certain incidents that occurred
during the operation.</i>

876
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:46,095
<i>MRF MAN: With respect, sir, I have
my own concerns about the Lieutenant.</i>

877
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:49,432
<i>Because of his mistakes, I have had to
neglect my own operation,</i>

878
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,983
<i>redeploy my own men to go and look
for his missing soldier,</i>

879
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,981
<i>a soldier he left behind earlier that day.</i>

880
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,437
<i>ARMITAGE:
I have a duty of care.</i>

881
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,614
<i>MRF MAN: I also have a duty of care,
sir, to my men,</i>

882
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,612
<i>one of whom happens to be dead now.</i>

883
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,943
<i>But we are at war here, sir.</i>

884
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,530
<i>- Does he understand that?
- We're not at war with our own side.</i>

885
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,283
<i>- I know what I saw.
- I don't care what he saw, sir.</i>

886
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,413
<i>What he thinks he saw.
He's wrong.</i>

887
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:10,995
ARMITAGE:
Sir...

888
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,956
Sergeant Lewis was attempting
to murder Hook. I saw it.

889
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,259
- No. He was trying to restrain him.
- He was not restraining him.

890
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:20,087
Hook panicked.
Probably went for his weapon.

891
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,264
Sergeant Lewis
would have tried to disarm him.

892
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:25,593
Because of this, he was shot,
he was killed. It happens.

893
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,973
CO: It was a confused situation.
- Yes, sir.

894
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:31,307
- Sir, with respect, I know what I saw.
- I want you to listen to me, Lieutenant.

895
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,437
This is very important.

896
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,728
It was a confused situation.

897
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,281
In these circumstances, what you saw,
what you think you saw,

898
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,281
can be a very different thing
to what actually happened.

899
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,577
Do you understand?

900
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,285
Do you understand?

901
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,037
Yes, sir.

902
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,078
I'll show him in, sir.

903
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,540
Hook, in.

904
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,427
At ease, Private.

905
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,187
Now, your Lieutenant has come to me

906
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,516
and told me about
how you're feeling at the moment.

907
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,475
You've had quite an experience.

908
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,937
I think we can all agree
that you've been lucky.

909
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,023
You're very lucky to be alive.

910
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:24,531
It's only down to the actions of the
Captain and his men that you were saved.

911
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,361
A very good soldier
died in the process.

912
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,823
- What about Private Thompson, sir?
- Don't you bloody dare!

913
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,371
You've been through
a very testing ordeal.

914
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,000
The best thing in this situation
is to try and put it behind you.

915
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,418
Do you understand me?

916
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,749
Yes, sir.

917
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,631
We look after our own
in the Army, Hook.

918
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,428
- Dismissed.
- Attention.

919
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,406
Darren!

920
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,411
Hello?

921
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,577
(shouts):
Hello?

922
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,622
Oi!

923
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,421
Darren!

924
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:07,689
Open the door.

925
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,866
- Hang on.
- I said, open the door!

926
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,615
I said, open the fucking door,
you horrible cunt.

927
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:14,325
Yeah.

928
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,912
Stay the fucking hell
out of my way you, an' all.

929
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,791
Darren?
