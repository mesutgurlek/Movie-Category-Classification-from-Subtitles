1
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,852
- Evenin', doc.
- Hello, Rimfire.

2
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,933
- Doesn't the navy ever run out of potatoes?
- This ship sure don't.

3
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,814
- Evenin', Doctor.
- Ellis. Johnny. Hot below.

4
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,209
Sure is. I'm gonna sleep topside tonight.

5
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,531
Not for long. We're getting
the tail end of a storm in the midwatch.

6
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,693
- A man can't plan much ahead at all, can he?
- Not much.

7
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,573
All right, break it up.
Make room for a workin' sailor.

8
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,972
- Just keep workin', man.
- You're lucky you don't get it on your heads.

9
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,169
Come and get it, you hungry buzzards!

10
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,731
Here's another one!

11
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,251
Who's got a light?

12
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,611
Ah, those sharks.

13
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,689
- Ain't they nasty things?
- They're just fish.

14
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,932
Hey, Corky. What do you think of the captain
they sent to take old Pinky's place?

15
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,692
I ain't supposed to think.

16
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,614
You know somethin'? He ain't left
his cabin since we left Trinidad.

17
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,692
What's he doing?
Playing acey-deucy by himself?

18
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,419
I'll tell you what he's doin'.

19
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,014
He's seasick!
That's what the navy's comin' to.

20
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,172
Seasick feather merchants
takin' the place of regular navy.

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,334
Oh, man, I just hope this guy knows port
from starboard. That's all I hope.

22
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,934
You know what I'd do if I was you, Robbins?

23
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,739
I'd just put in for the skipper's job
if I was you.

24
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,811
The skipper!

25
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,293
All right. Did you have your laugh?

26
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,491
Well, now I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

27
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,734
The guy who walks that bridge has got your
neck in his hands, and don't you forget it.

28
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,211
Oh, thanks, Salvador.

29
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,818
- You've got us down 200, partner.
- Sorry, sir.

30
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,334
- Six spades.
- I thought I could do it, sir.

31
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,935
- Well, don't go off half-cocked again.
- No, sir.

32
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,614
- Any sign of the weather, doc?
- Filling up in the east.

33
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,817
Oh, jolly, jolly. And I've got the watch.

34
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,173
- I pass.
- What? Haven't you got anything?

35
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,616
- Why don't you just look at his hand?
- Well, I have to help him along.

36
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,012
- I suppose I could try a heart, sir.
- He supposes he could try a heart, sir.

37
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,819
- Two clubs.
- Captain Murrell still holed up, doc?

38
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,936
- Far as I know.
- Three diamonds.

39
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,659
They might have sent us
a captain who had his sea legs.

40
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,731
I guess they do the best they can.

41
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,811
I don't see why they didn't move Ware up,
He's been exec long enough.

42
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,098
Mackeson, the only craft I ever commanded
was a yawl in the Miami yacht races.

43
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,455
The nearest I ever came to winning was 29th.

44
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,690
The navy was desperate enough to take me,

45
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,658
but not foolish enough
to let me sail away by myself.

46
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,970
- Beats me how I ever got this far.
- Money.

47
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,733
- Oh, I know you're rich.
- Don't be bitter, grandpa.

48
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,288
- Your bid, Mackeson.
- Uh...

49
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,452
- Four spades.
- I'm not bitter. I just wanna go home.

50
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,976
When I've bought a ranch in Nevada,
I never expect to see water again.

51
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,051
- Uh, Ensign Merry?
- Sir?

52
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,131
Your bid.

53
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,699
- Careful.
- Yes, sir. I'm thinking about it.

54
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,170
- Your mouth's open, Ensign.
- Sir?

55
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,216
- Are you gonna bid?
- Six diamonds.

56
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,133
- Six diamonds?
- I'm just backing you up, sir.

57
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,688
You are deliberately
distracting my partner.

58
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,055
Pass and double.

59
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,813
All right, Mr Merry. Dummy.

60
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,893
This Murrell seems like a cold sort of a fish.

61
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,889
Captain Murrell oughtn't to be here at all.
He's as weak as a kitten.

62
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,292
A man who gets his ship torpedoed and
spends 25 days on a raft in the North Atlantic

63
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,929
oughtn't to have to hit the ball again
with only a few weeks in the hospital.

64
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,137
I guess there aren't enough
commanding officers to go around.

65
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,734
Well, at least they gave him an easy ship.

66
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,608
Boy, easy's no word for it.
Listen, he'll get more rest on this boat...

67
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,850
- Ship.
- Ship, boat. What's the difference?

68
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,091
He'll still get more rest here
than he would if he were in a feather bed.

69
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,138
Now, me, I'd like something
to happen once in a while.

70
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,532
If the navy ever gets a load of this crew
in battle, they'll send us back to boot camp.

71
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,815
I'll look ridiculous with my head shaved.

72
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,655
Kid, couldn't you have indicated clubs?
Then I could have gone to no-trump.

73
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,255
We are going down again. And doubled!

74
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,331
Sorry, sir.

75
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,097
- All right.
- <i>(ship's whistle)</i>

76
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,569
- Your lead, Mackeson.
- <i>Now hear this.</i>

77
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,333
<i>Lay before the mast all eight o'clock reports.</i>

78
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,129
<i>Darken ship. The smoking lamp</i>
<i>is out on all weather decks.</i>

79
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,169
We'll slow her down a little.
All engines ahead two-thirds.

80
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,017
Bridge, Radar. I've got a spook.

81
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,776
- Radar contact, Mr Ware.
- What?

82
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,851
- Radar contact!
- Good heavens.

83
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,211
- Bridge, aye?
- <i>Definite spook, sir.</i>

84
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,690
- Strong enough to plot?
- <i>Range: 12,000 off the starboard bow.</i>

85
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,738
- Get on the plot, Mackeson.
- <i>Captain, aye.</i>

86
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,209
Radar reports a contact
off starboard bow, sir.

87
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,609
- <i>Run a plot on it.</i>
- Plot's working, sir.

88
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,850
- <i>Then head for the target.</i>
- Aye aye, sir.

89
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,057
- Oh, uh... Zigzag, sir?
- <i>What would you say, mister?</i>

90
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,656
Me? Well, uh... Negative zigzag, sir.
Give the plot a chance to steady on.

91
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,731
<i>That's right, mister.</i>

92
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,009
- Give me that again, Radar.
- Did you get it?

93
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,336
Estimated target's course 140,

94
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,733
speed ten knots, bearing 124 true.

95
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,539
Bring her around to 124.
All engines ahead flank.

96
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,418
- 124, sir.
- All engines ahead flank, sir.

97
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,414
- Can't seem to make up his mind, can he?
- Maybe he wants to see if I'm awake.

98
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,171
<i>(rumble of propellers)</i>

99
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,537
- What's the rush?
- I don't know, but we're sure juicin' it up.

100
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,169
- Hey. What's the word?
- Radar's got somethin'. We're going after it.

101
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,774
- What's up?
- He says they got a bogey!

102
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,976
Hurry! Come on, wake up!

103
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,052
- We're going after it.
- You don't wanna miss it.

104
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,737
Gangway.

105
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,175
Gangway. Gangway, please.

106
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,820
I was here first! Gangway yourself!

107
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,812
Excuse me, sir. Hey, break it up.
Let the captain in.

108
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,368
- What's all the crowd about, sailor?
- Well, sir, I...

109
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,577
I guess we don't get much excitement
aboard this ship.

110
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,015
- Keep your seat. What's your name?
- Andrews, sir.

111
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,568
- What do you make of it?
- I don't know, Captain.

112
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,652
- Our speed's rattling the set.
- Guess. You're the operator.

113
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,655
It's doing ten knots. It's got some power, but
it's too small a spook to be a heavy vessel.

114
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,814
It might be a fishing smack or... well, it
might be the conning tower of a sub, sir.

115
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,890
- <i>Bridge. Lieutenant Ware.</i>
- Mr Ware.

116
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,813
We're about to lose radar contact
at the rate we're going.

117
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,858
Reduce speed to speed of target
and get on its tail.

118
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,932
At this distance, we'll
make visual contact at daybreak.

119
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,410
- <i>Shall I shake the ship out for a standby?</i>
- Not much shaking out to be done.

120
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,492
But ready underwater search gear.
If this spook is a U-boat,

121
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,129
he might pull the plug,
and we'll have to go after him.

122
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,973
- Who's the senior radarman, Andrews?
- That's me, sir.

123
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,494
You'll have to track the target.
Any turn he makes

124
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,458
or change in speed,
no matter how small, don't miss a move.

125
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,532
I'll stick on him, don't you worry, Captain.

126
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,656
All right, I won't.

127
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,779
If anybody's gonna be caught
with his pants down, it oughtn't to be us.

128
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,379
Seems like he knows his business, to me.

129
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,248
Feather merchant, that's all I got to say.
Feather merchant!

130
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,291
<i>(sonar pings)</i>

131
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,534
Signal is to stern, Herr Kapitän. 8,000 metres.

132
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,611
It's either a ship or a false echo.

133
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,619
- You've lost it.
- <i>Ja, Kapitän.</i>

134
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,770
It comes and goes.

135
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,375
The sea return makes it difficult
to keep the image.

136
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,610
There, Kapitän. There it comes.

137
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,576
Port 20 degrees, Schwaffer.

138
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,130
- Port 20 degrees.
- Port 20 degrees.

139
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,130
- Target's course changing to port.
- Target's turning left, Captain.

140
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,133
- 25... 20 degrees.
- Maintain present speed. Steady as you go.

141
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,495
- Steady as you go,
- Steady as you go.

142
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,650
May I ask what your procedure is, sir?

143
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,618
If it <i>is</i> an enemy ship,
our signal may be on his oscillator

144
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,693
and he's trying to feel us out - make
a couple of turns, see if we change position.

145
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,499
If we can hold
an unchanging position behind him,

146
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,333
he may mistake us
for a ghost echo on these heavy seas.

147
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,896
- The signal does not change, Herr Kapitän.
- Starboard 40 degrees.

148
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,529
- Starboard 40 degrees.
- Starboard 40 degrees.

149
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,775
- Target's turning sharp starboard, sir.
- Can you estimate the degree, Andrews?

150
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,059
- Oh... 40... 45 degrees, Captain.
- All engines stop.

151
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,529
- All engines stop.
- All engines stop, sir.

152
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,180
You think it might be a U-boat, sir?

153
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,252
Wiggling like one. He may take the bait.

154
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,412
- If he doesn't, he'll crash-dive.
- Excuse me, sir.

155
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,652
- It holds the same place, Herr Kapitän.
- Hm.

156
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,656
Resume course 140.

157
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,891
- 140.
- 140.

158
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,851
Yes?

159
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,328
He's on the hook.
He's come back into course 140.

160
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,254
- All engines ahead two-thirds, steer 140.
- Aye aye, sir. 140.

161
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,854
- All engines ahead two-thirds.
- Well done, Andrews.

162
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,535
The target won't be satisfied with one check.
Look for him to make a turn.

163
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,134
Or he may slow down
or speed up. Thank you.

164
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,738
- Sir?
- Well?

165
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,449
- Do you wanna send a dispatch, sir?
- Why? Are you anxious to take one?

166
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,169
- Oh no, sir. I just thought...
- We have to keep radio silence tonight.

167
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,094
We might tip our hand to the target.
But I'll get one out in the morning, OK?

168
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,171
Yes, sir.

169
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,859
This is the captain. I guess you're all
waiting for some kind of word.

170
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,375
<i>We're tracking an unidentified ship. We're</i>
<i>going to try to stay on his tail until morning.</i>

171
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,010
<i>We will breakfast early,</i>
<i>and go to battle stations at 0530.</i>

172
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,012
<i>Don't be surprised if we tangle</i>
<i>with a pig-boat a little after dawn.</i>

173
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,299
<i>Do your jobs efficiently and we'll</i>
<i>chalk one up for the "Haynes". That's all.</i>

174
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,892
I reckon we'll just drop an egg
right down his periscope.

175
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,175
That'll be the end of one more Nazi, huh?

176
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,697
Or he'll just pop a fish right in our guts,
and that'll be the end of this tin can.

177
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,568
- Man, a sub ain't no match for us.
- Oh, they ain't, huh?

178
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,618
Then how come they hunt U-boats
with three destroyers

179
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,260
workin' together up in the North Atlantic?

180
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,296
Yeah. How come?

181
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,371
Your bet.

182
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,415
- Whose watch is next?
- Leutnant Kunz, Herr Kapitän.

183
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,253
- Have him come here.
- <i>Jawohl, Herr Kapitän.</i>

184
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,971
Leutnant Kunz, report forward.

185
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,658
You wanted me, Herr Kapitän?

186
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,450
<i>Ja,</i> Kunz. Yours is the next watch on topside.

187
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,249
We have a signal on the FMB.
I think it's a false echo.

188
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,253
But to check its reaction, you will
zigzag twice an hour until daybreak.

189
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,457
If it moves in closer,
you will awaken me immediately.

190
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,531
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kapitän.</i>

191
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,611
- Schwaffer.
- Hm?

192
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,251
Come in, Heini.

193
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,211
Ah, that Kunz annoys me.
Remind him that we do not salute at sea.

194
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,620
He is new, Herr Kapitän. He will tire of it.

195
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,978
He is new, hm?
Like our new Germany. A machine.

196
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,690
Herr Kapitän. You think we are wise
in risking that image to be a false echo?

197
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,578
Wise? Expedient.
Time is important, Heini,

198
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,049
and we would travel
too slowly underwater.

199
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,938
In 48 hours, we rendezvous with Raider M.

200
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,252
We take the captured British code book
and we go home with it.

201
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,696
And this is the important thing.
Not the code book,

202
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,090
but because, when we have it,
we can go home.

203
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,694
- <i>Auf dein Wohl.</i>
- <i>Zum Wohl, Herr Kapitän.</i>

204
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,449
Ah. Tastes like oil and bilge and green mould.

205
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,531
Sit down, Heini.

206
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,579
Tastes like a U-boat.

207
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,379
I've been in the U-boats too long, Heini.

208
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,054
There was a time when
I went to sea with a fresh heart.

209
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,131
That was many years ago.

210
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,013
Now I can only think of going home.

211
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,098
- You want more?
- No more, Herr Kapitän.

212
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,370
You think I take too much?

213
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,735
Just enough to sleep.

214
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,812
I cannot rest without it. I think too much.

215
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,569
Never think, Heini.
Be a good warrior and never think.

216
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,340
You pay a penalty for thinking.

217
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,411
You cannot rest.

218
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,218
I taught these sons of mine
to be good warriors.

219
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,736
Country. Duty. Ask no question.

220
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,091
One is at the bottom of the sea,

221
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,973
and this one is a cinder in a burned airplane.

222
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,770
And I'm glad.

223
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,455
That's the way for warriors to die.
Young, and with faith.

224
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,651
I have lived too long.

225
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,809
- We are friends, Heini?
- I have been with you since I was a cadet.

226
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,891
That's not what I asked you.

227
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,776
I do not know.

228
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,819
Sometimes I am afraid of you.
Many times I do not understand you.

229
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,575
- I am not certain we are friends.
- We are friends. Believe that.

230
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,699
We are friends. Because we are friends,
I'll tell you something.

231
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,414
I am sick of this war.

232
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,491
It's not a good war.

233
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,460
You don't remember the first one.

234
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,136
I was a <i>Fähnrich</i> in the U-boats.
And, oh, how proud I was!

235
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,450
We went out in those little sardine tins,

236
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,658
and if we submerged, we couldn't
always be sure we'd come up again.

237
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,935
Oh, it was a good game we played.

238
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,137
The captain would look through
his periscope and sight a target,

239
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,814
and then he did arithmetic in his head

240
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,368
and said <i>"Torpedo los!"</i>

241
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,338
And you know something? Sometimes
the torpedo wouldn't even leave the tube.

242
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,449
And if it did, we were
most lucky to hit something.

243
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,890
And now... now I look in the periscope
and it gives me the distance and the speed.

244
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,653
I pass this information to the attack table,

245
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,131
and the machinery turns and
the lights flash, and we get the answer.

246
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,211
The torpedo runs to its target,

247
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,369
and there's no human error in this.

248
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,739
They've taken human error
out of war, Heini.

249
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,050
They've taken the human out of war.

250
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,731
War was different then.

251
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,773
It put iron in the country's backbone,

252
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,249
gave them brave memory.

253
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,774
And even in defeat, it gave them honour.

254
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,451
There is no honour in this war.

255
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,854
The memories will be ugly, even if we win.

256
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,055
And if we die,

257
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,529
we die without God.

258
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,215
You know that, Heini?

259
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,892
I listen to what you say, Herr Kapitän.

260
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,977
Oh, it's a bad war.

261
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,815
Its reason is twisted.

262
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,651
Its purpose is dark.

263
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,731
It's not for a simple man.

264
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,169
Lieutenant Crain is coming up, sir.
Port side.

265
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,938
Mr Crain, what's your best time
on reloading depth charges?

266
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,853
It's not so hot, Captain.
Some of my boys are pretty green,

267
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,012
but I'd say, oh... three minutes, or four.

268
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,297
- Well, you've got to do better than that.
- I can try, sir.

269
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,769
That's not good enough.
It might be the difference

270
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,057
between stopping the enemy
and getting stopped ourselves.

271
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,736
- If that's the case, sir, we'll be good enough.
- I'll depend on it.

272
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,171
Mr Ware? I'd like you to stick with the plot
in the pilot house for the time being, please.

273
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,251
Aye aye, sir.

274
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,289
Looks like we've run out of the squall.

275
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,659
Yeah.

276
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,653
- Why don't you lay in your cabin for a while?
- Oh, I'm all right, Doctor.

277
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,731
You getting the feel of a ship again?

278
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,176
Either that, or that pig-boat
out there is strong medicine.

279
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,218
I don't see how you can know it's the enemy.

280
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,019
Well, call it a sixth sense if you want to.

281
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,255
I always know when a mind is working
the other end of that radar beam.

282
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,855
Interesting. I've heard
hunters say the same thing.

283
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,135
They can sense the presence of game.

284
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,974
In any case, this is going to be
a disappointed ship if it isn't the enemy.

285
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,530
Yes, they all seem to be a bloodthirsty crew.

286
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,418
The men would like a chance
to do what they're here for.

287
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,333
Not much other reason for existence.
Not now, anyway.

288
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,298
No, I sometimes wonder
if there ever was another reason.

289
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,371
I know what you mean.

290
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,011
I had a baby clinic up in Ohio.
It was pretty important to me.

291
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,810
Now it seems like something that happened
on another planet and in another century.

292
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,336
- What was your work, Captain?
- This. The sea.

293
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,218
- You were a sailor?
- Third officer on a freighter

294
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,451
out of Boston, to Liverpool,
Le Havre, and back again.

295
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,610
Some of our crew will be glad to know that.

296
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,978
Our saltiest boys were complaining mightily
about getting a civilian skipper.

297
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,689
- Feather merchant, I think they call it.
- Well, I am a feather merchant.

298
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,453
- Well, yes, but not exactly.
- No, exactly.

299
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,895
On the freighter, we were men against
the sea. Here, we're men against men.

300
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,336
Like every other civilian in the war,
I had to learn a new way to think.

301
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,173
Why did you change over to the navy?

302
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,411
The freighter I was on
was cut in half by a torpedo.

303
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,889
Thought I'd be
on the shooting end for a change.

304
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,971
<i>(speaker) Captain!</i>

305
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,418
- Captain, aye?
- <i>Target's increased speed to 13 knots, sir.</i>

306
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,968
Ring up a compensating speed, Mr Ware.

307
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,088
<i>Aye aye, sir.</i>
<i>All engines ahead standard, 203 rpm, sir.</i>

308
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,171
Very well.

309
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,490
Well, in time we'll all
get back to our own stuff again.

310
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,458
The war'll get swallowed up
and seem like it never happened.

311
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,054
Yes, but it won't be the same as it was.

312
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,450
It won't have that feeling of permanency
that we had before.

313
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,850
- We've learned a hard truth.
- How do you mean?

314
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,738
That there's no end
to misery and destruction.

315
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,018
You cut the head off a snake, it grows another
one. You cut that one off, you find another.

316
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,568
We can't kill it because
it's within ourselves.

317
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,778
You can call it the enemy if you want to,
but it's part of us. We're all men.

318
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,217
I suppose there is some reason to lose hope,
but... you know, I reject it.

319
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,772
I have a family, and I want something better
for them than war, and I think it's possible.

320
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,169
Have you any children, Captain?

321
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,251
- No.
- Married?

322
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,133
I married a girl in England. She was killed.

323
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,296
Bombers?

324
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,692
No. When the war broke out, I got passage
for her on my freighter for home -

325
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,055
the one that was torpedoed in half.

326
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,133
I was aft when it happened. I watched
the other half of the ship just slide away.

327
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,609
There wasn't anything I could do about it.

328
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,932
I saw her run out on the foredeck,
and I heard her call my name,

329
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,569
then that half of the ship
just turned over and went down.

330
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,930
We hadn't been married very long.

331
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,054
Ring up the fire room.
Tell 'em we're making smoke.

332
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,973
- I don't wanna see that at dawn.
- Aye aye, sir.

333
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,929
You got more reason than the rest of us
to wanna catch this submarine.

334
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,536
- It might be the one that...
- Oh, it might be, but this isn't my private war.

335
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,169
I'm just doing what I have to do.
Like that German captain out there.

336
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,297
I don't like the job,
and maybe he doesn't either.

337
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,816
- Weather from Fleet Weather Control, sir.
- Thank you.

338
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,370
Well, we're moving into a high-pressure area.
We're going to have a clear day.

339
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,251
<i>(whistle)</i>

340
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,978
Set ASW condition one.
All hands, man your battle stations.

341
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,371
<i>(alarm bell)</i>

342
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,858
All repair parties manned and ready.
Condition able.

343
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,819
- Quartermaster Quiroga at the helm.
- Quartermaster Spencer on annunciator.

344
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,892
Engineering spaces manned and ready.
All boilers on the line.

345
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,971
Maximum speed available, 24 knots.

346
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,530
- Sonar gear manned and ready.
- Magazines manned and ready.

347
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,977

- Sky one, mount 32, manned and ready, sir.

348
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,972
- 41, manned and ready.
- Mount 31, manned and ready.

349
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,813
- All guns manned and ready.
- Very well.

350
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,695
- The ship is smart and quick, Mr Ware.
- We've a willing bunch of boys.

351
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,771
Messenger.

352
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,648
When that U-boat pulls the plug,
code this dispatch for Fleet Operations.

353
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,860
"Have tracked U-boat 130 miles,
bearing 140. Now engaging enemy."

354
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,610
And give our grid position.

355
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,411
Let's get after the target.
Mr Merry, ring up flank speed.

356
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,979
All engines ahead flank.

357
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,174
I've got him, sir! A conning tower!

358
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,251
Where away?

359
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,217
Three degrees off
the starboard bow. 6,000 yards.

360
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,648
- Main batteries ready?
- Reported ready, sir.

361
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,538
We might get close enough for a shot
before he pops under.

362
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,770
Ship off stern, Herr Schwaffer.

363
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,248
Alarm!

364
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,649
<i>(alarm)</i>

365
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,056
- Target diving!
- Target diving!

366
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,016
Right ten degrees rudder.
Steady up on 170.

367
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,859
Slow to two-thirds speed.

368
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,294
<i>Slow</i> to two-thirds speed, sir?

369
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,089
<i>It's not necessary</i>
<i>to repeat the order, Quartermaster.</i>

370
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,092
- Aye aye, sir.
- Zigzag, sir?

371
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,650
- <i>Negative zigzag.</i>
- Aye aye, sir.

372
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,459
170 at ten knots.

373
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,135
We're a sittin' duck, that's what we are.

374
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,815
- We're presenting our beam to the enemy?
- I'm giving him a shot with the stern tubes.

375
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,370
You can't reload those tubes.
We can attack up his tail when we want.

376
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,169
Yes, sir. How will we know
when he's firing, sir?

377
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,651
I'll give him five minutes to get to emergency
depth, three to come up to periscope depth,

378
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,970
another two minutes to get us in his sights.

379
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,611
If he's any kind of a captain,
he'll spit the fish out ten minutes from now.

380
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,931
Level.

381
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,531
- Seal.
- Seal!

382
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,939
- Seal.
- Seal.

383
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,339
<i>Engine room clear. Forward torpedo room</i>
<i>clear. Aft torpedo room clear.</i>

384
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,411
U-boat all ready for action.

385
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,331
- Silent routine.
- Silent routine!

386
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,775
- Silent routine.
- Silent routine.

387
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,969
He is crossing our stern
to starboard, Herr Kapitän.

388
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,851
He does not approach.

389
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,618
I do not understand, Herr Kapitän. He doesn't
zigzag, and he holds course away from us.

390
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,691
Give them to me.

391
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,618
He is clever, or he is a fool.

392
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,698
Maybe he is too clever, or too foolish.

393
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,857
We'll see. Bring the ship
up to periscope depth.

394
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,931
Periscope depth!

395
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,689
45.

396
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,018
30.

397
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,251
25.

398
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,691
18 metres, Herr Kapitän.

399
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,929
Aha.

400
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,212
- American escort destroyer.
- Escort destroyer.

401
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,972
- One stack.
- One stack.

402
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,409

Maximum speed 25 knots.

405
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,059
Carries stern racks and K-guns.
Capable of dropping 17 patterns.

406
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,291
Carries latest underwater detection gear.

407
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,371
I think we use the stern tubes.

408
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,018
- Ready stern tubes for underwater attack.
- <i>Jawohl, Herr Kapitän.</i>

409
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,819
Ready stern tubes for underwater attack.

410

413
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,939
<i>Firing position six degrees,</i>
<i>torpedo deflection ten.</i>

<i>Running speed 30, depth two metres.</i>
<i>Fire both torpedoes.</i>

415
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,776
- On.
- On.

416
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,930
- Yeah.
- On.

417
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,454

00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,334
- Yeah.
- On. Standing by.

421
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,611
Port six degrees.

422
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,810
Firing position, Herr Kapitän.

423
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,136
- Torpedoes ready?
- Torpedoes ready?

424
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,733
- <i>Ready.</i>
- Ready.

425
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,975
- Count.
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

426
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,291
five, four, three,

427
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,940
two, one, zero.

428
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,415
<i>Torpedos... los!</i>

429
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,689
- Torpedoes running.
- Torpedoes running.

430
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,771
Running time?

431
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,620
One minute, 40 seconds, Herr Kapitän.

432
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,414
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder.

433
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,816
High-speed propellers
coming in from port side.

434
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,415
- High speed propellers. Port.
- Stop port engine. Starboard ahead full.

435
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,492
Stop port engine.
Starboard engine ahead full.

436
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,499
- Torpedoes off the port bow.
- All ahead standard.

437
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,732
- Stop your swing and steady up.
- All ahead standard. Steady up.

438
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,612
The Miami yacht races were never like this.

439
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,933
Hey, Corky. How do you suppose
the captain knew when to turn this old tub?

440
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,218
Because he's the captain,
and that's the reason he is and you ain't.

441
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,691
All right, let's go get 'em. All engines ahead

442
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,817
All engines ahead full.
Ring up 18 knots. Steady as you go.

443
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,171
Aye aye, sir.

444
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,532
- Down to 100. Emergency.
- Emergency 100.

445
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,894
- Steer 140.
- 140.

446
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,695
I do not see how we missed at that range.

447
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,771
We shouldn't have.

448
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,738
I think this American captain is no amateur.

449
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,811
Well, neither am I.

450
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,814
<i>Sonar, Captain.</i>
<i>Commence underwater search.</i>

<i>Make sure it's piped through</i>
<i>onto the bridge speaker.</i>

452
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,169
Aye aye, sir. Lowering sonar projector.

<i>(sonar pings)</i>

<i>(sonar pings steadily)</i>

456
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,856
- Who's on sonar, Mr Ware?
- Lewis, sir. He's good at the job.

457
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,011
<i>(ping echoes back)</i>

Got him, sir.

460
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,855
Keep that open.

461
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,812
- Target's still on the old course of 140.
- We'll turn to 140 when we're astern of him.

462
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,451
<i>(sonar ping hits roof)</i>

Sonar lash, Herr Kapitän.
He has made contact.

464
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,452
- Do you wish to change course?
- No, not yet.

465
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,974
We wait until he thinks he has our depth.

466
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,012
- We're gonna be on him pretty quickly, sir.
- <i>Depth-charge party wants depth setting.</i>

467

Set to 75. But I may want
to alter that before we fire.

He's coming out of it now, sir,

Mr Mackeson.

00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,139
- I'm giving you a hypothetical problem.
- Aye, Captain?

514
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,609
Take our last contact
with the target as a start.

515
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,975
Our course was 164, sir.

516
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,531
Give the target a course of 260, keep him on it
for 30 minutes at a speed of four knots.

517
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,975
260, 30 minutes, four knots.

518
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,939
Bring him back on course 140
for 30 minutes at a speed of eight knots.

519
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,251
140, 30 minutes, eight knots.

520
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,492
We'll hold our present course
and speed for half an hour.

521
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,013
30 at 18.

522
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,331
From there, give me a course
and speed to intercept the target.

523
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,572
- Will we make a lost-contact search?
- We won't catch this bird in a search pattern.

524
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,050
I'm sure he's come off our keel
and scooted in the opposite direction.

525
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,337
Our course would be 239 degrees,
speed 19 knots.

526
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,095
We would intercept in 28 minutes
from the beginning of the run, sir.

527
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,729
- All right, we'll try it.
- Target might not come back on course 140.

528
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,416
I think he will. He's got an important mission.
Nothing'll stop him short of being sunk.

529
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,776
- Pass the word to battle stations: Stand easy.
- Aye aye, sir.

530
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,095
He fades, Herr Kapitän.

531
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,171
He goes away.

532
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,297
You think he's given up, Herr Kapitän?

533
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,655
It's possible.

534
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,699
But, to be certain,
we hold this course for a while,

535
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,771
before we turn again to 140.

536
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,012
- Captain, sir?
- Well?

537
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,137
- How're we doin'?
- You're doin' all right, sailors.

538
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,290
That guy Robbins is 180 out.

539
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,689
- <i>He</i> ain't no feather merchant.
- You said it.

540
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,331
I had to amputate his fingers.

541
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,449
What was your time on reloading, Mr Crain?

542
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,657
Three minutes three, the first time.
Two minutes 40, the second.

543
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,935
Right on. Give your crew
a "well done" for me.

544
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,011
Thank you, sir.

545
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,613
Lie still, sailor. You're out of the war now.

546
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,896
Is it... bad?

547
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,614
You've lost your fingers. It's my fault.
I shouldn't have tripped the racks so quickly.

548
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,817
No, sir. I oughtn't
to have had my hand on the rail.

549
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,891
I guess I got excited, sir.

550
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,015
We'll get you flown stateside
as soon as we put back into Trinidad.

551
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,092
You'll be back in your
civvy job in no time at all.

552
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,894
I was a watchmaker.

553
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,974
Operational priority dispatch coming in, sir.

554
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,496
Ask the executive officer
to join me in the crypto room.

555
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,176
Well, you won't be
making any watches again.

556
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,017
No, sir. But I'll make out all right.

557
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,091
I'd bet on that.

558
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,732
- All right, let's get him to bed.
- Did we get the sub, sir?

559
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,811
No, we missed him.

560
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,815
I'd have given my fingers to get that sub.

561
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,020
I don't know anything about sub-chasing,
but I rather think our new captain does. Joe.

562
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,890
If that U-boat is still in the ocean. I wouldn't
give a plugged duck for its chances.

563
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,810
The dispatch is just
coming through the decoder, sir.

564
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,534
"Destroyers <i>Luckman, Wald, Green,</i>
detached to aid you."

565
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:27,172
"Anticipate U-boat may be attempting to
rendezvous with German Raider S, U or M."

566
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,489
"Reduce radio traffic
to position signal once every hour. End."

567
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,811
But it'll take 14 or 15 hours for
the destroyers to catch up with us.

568
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,334
Yes. If we're lucky enough to find that U-boat,

569
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,777
he may tow us up against a raider before
help comes, and that wouldn't be so lucky.

570
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,897
Those murdering wolves can
outgun and outrun us.

571
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,650
How do you feel about it, Mr Ware?

572
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,369
We're closing the triangle in... 14 minutes, sir.

573
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,451
Well?

574
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,171
Let's push our luck.

575
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,252
- Alert battle stations, Mr Ware.
- Aye aye, sir.

576
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,289
Voltage is low on port generator.

577
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,178
- I'll call the LE.
- More soup, Herr Kapitän?

578
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,774
- <i>Ja.</i>
- More power on the port generator.

579
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,339
It does not taste
like tennis shoes, Herr Kapitän?

580
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,059
It's very good. The men mistreat you, Cookie.

581
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,257
They make jokes when they are happy.
I don't mind.

582
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,730
- Are they happy now?
- They are proud of you, Herr Kapitän.

583
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,811
Thank you, Cookie.

584
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,769
- It's now nearly 50 minutes, Herr Kapitän.
- <i>Ja.</i> Kunz!

585
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,012
- <i>Ja,</i> Herr Kapitän?
- Bring the ship up to periscope depth.

586
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,378
<i>Jawohl,</i> Herr Kapitän.
The manoeuvres were brilliant, Herr Kapitän.

587
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,451
The Führer would be pleased.

588
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,979
Herr Kapitän? Propellers. 1200 metres.

589
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,857
- Which quarter?
- Port.

590
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,454
- 18 metres.
- Be ready for emergency dive.

591
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,531
Stand by, emergency dive.

592
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,254
- Emergency. Down to 80.
- 80! Down to 80!

593
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,331
- The American has read my mind, Heini.
- <i>Ja.</i>

Set depth charges to 150.

599

Set depth charges to 150.

602
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,451
- Where is the bottom?
- A plateau, Herr Kapitän.

603
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,531
About 310 metres.

604
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,299
Hm.

605
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,613
It's not possible, Herr Kapitän, to go
that deep. The pressure would crush the hull.

606
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,256
<i>(explosion)</i>

607
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,296

608
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,011
- The bottom.
- Herr Kapitän...

609
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,771
The bottom.

610
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,771
<i>Jawohl,</i> Herr Kapitän. Bottom.

611
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,331
- Level.

00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,809

We build them good in Germany,
eh, Heini?

615
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,291
<i>Ja.</i>

616
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,691
<i>(sonar pings)</i>

617
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,776
He's given me the slip again.
I'm only getting bottom echoes.

618
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,451
Sonar's lost him, Captain.

619
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,611
Give me a Fathometer reading.

620
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,089
150 fathoms, sir.

621
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,617
That's 310 metres...
That's over a thousand feet.

622
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,736
Can he go that deep?

623
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,209
He might like us to think he can't.

624
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,695
Slow down turbines easy until stopped.

625
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,534
- Slow down turbines easy until stopped.
- I want absolute silence.

626
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:30,092
Sonar, this is the captain. Secure, but keep
a close listening watch on the hydrophone.

627
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,297
If he is down there,
I don't think he'll have time to linger.

628
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,731
His engines are fading.

629
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,811
He's not circling?

630
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,379
<i>Nein.</i> He's gone, Herr Kapitän.

631
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,411
Hm.

632
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,571
Hm.

633
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,651
We will listen for a while.

634
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,651
- Ow!
- Sh!

635
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,971
Ah, doc, this is really a hot one.

636
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,615
At least they're keeping cool down there.

637
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,931
- "A painted ship on a painted ocean."
- What's that, doc?

638
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,456
I was reminded of "The Ancient Mariner".
It rather fits us right now.

639
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,737
Something unreal about this
waiting out here on a deserted sea.

640
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,176
It'll be real enough
if that pig-boat puts a fish in us.

641
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,851
- Any luck, Rimfire?
- No, sir.

642
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,455
Them fish are afraid
they'll make some noise if they bite.

643
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,656
Here, let me try it.

644
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,095
I guess you're finding this sun
hard to take after the North Atlantic.

645
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,810
Oh, it doesn't matter. It's always either
too cold or too hot wherever there's a war on.

646
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,095
- Well, have a salt pill.
- Thanks.

647
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,819
We've been floating around for quite a while.

648
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,858
Think the U-boat's
gotten away from us again?

649
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,374
No, he's down there all right.

650
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,419
- Beats me how they get men to do it.
- Do what?

651
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,889
Go and sit in that coffin down there.

652
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,571
Oh, they're not so bad off.

653
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,495
Actually, they stand a better chance
than we do, in this case.

654
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,174
Pretty hard for one ship to surprise them.

655
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,616
Their commander might be able
to knock us off if he's smart enough.

656
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,578
- D'you think he is?
- What, smart enough?

657
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,010
We'll know that when it happens.

658
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,091
I wonder what sort of man he is.

659
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,420
Well, he's got his share of guts, I know that.

660
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,651
If he weren't so bull-headed
about coming back on course 140,

661
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:16,256
he could have kissed us goodbye
a long time ago, that's all I know.

662
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,934
I have no idea what he is, or what he thinks.

663
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,777
I don't wanna know the men
I'm... trying to destroy.

664
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,769
- Herr Kapitän.
- Hm?

665
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,648
- Yes, I know.
- The American must be far away by this time.

666
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:44,132
It's a curious thing,
but I know he's there, waiting.

667
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:49,257
All right, we go. Silent routine, 140.

668
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,410
- Level.
- Level.

669
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,491
- Course will be 140.
- 140.

670
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,571
Continue silent routine.

671
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,331
<i>(propeller noise)</i>

672
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,251
Lewis, get up. We got somethin'.

673
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,298
- Bridge, Sonar.
- Go ahead, Sonar.

674
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,412
- Propeller cavitation, deep and slow.
- Can you get a heading?

675
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,890
Can you figure a heading?
Lewis thinks he's moving southeast.

676
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,052
Coming back on 140 again.
Alert battle stations.

677
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,052
- Alert battle stations.
- Commence underwater search.

678
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,849
Give me minimum rpm
on both shafts. Steer 140.

679
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,131
Propellors, Herr Kapitän.

680
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,611
He's a devil, Heini.

681
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,331
Somehow...

682
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,211
somehow we must lose him.

683
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,851
Or kill him.

684
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,251
- He's pinpointed.
- Ready to close in?

685
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:35,334
No. Pass the word: I want a conference
with all officers and chiefs in the wardroom.

686
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,210
Boatswain's mate. Pass the word. All officers
and chiefs in the wardroom on the double.

687
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,578
We're at a disadvantage
because he can turn sharper than we can.

688
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,255
We can shake him up,
but a death blow'd be pure luck.

689
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,335
We've expended a third of our depth charges.

690
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,379
The U-boat can stay underwater
for another 24 hours if he wants to.

691
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,338
If we run out of depth charges,
the offensive will be theirs,

692
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,049
and we'd have to break contact
to get away from his torpedoes.

693
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,973
But we just can't follow him
and wait for our ships to join us

694
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:13,417
because we might get pulled into a trap
with a German raider before they get here.

695
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,129
What we're going to do
is to fight sort of a delaying action.

696
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,218
The enemy's about a thousand yards ahead.

697
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,531
We'll hold this distance for a little while.

698
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,817
Then we'll run in, lay one pattern of charges,

699
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,892
drop back, wait for one hour,
and attack again.

700
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,213
We can keep this routine up for seven hours.

701
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,734
He can't get anywhere very fast,

702
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,574
and our ships should be here
by the end of that period.

703
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,571
He might even surface.

704
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:48,529
Being inside a submarine under attack
is the worst experience you can imagine.

705
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:54,411
After they see what we're doing, they might
prefer to surrender, or at least shoot it out.

706
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,570
I want you all to get as much rest as you can.

707
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,891
Stand easy at your stations,
but be ready every time we lunge.

708
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,053
It's going to be a long, dull job,
but it's a damn sight worse for the Germans.

709
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,859
We'll begin the routine at 1500.

710
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,971

Herr Kapitän! Aft torpedo room.
We've got trouble here.

715
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,091
Take command.

716
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,499
Stay away from me! Stay away!

717
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,658
We can do nothing with him, Herr Kapitän.

718
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,851
Come here, son.

719
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,571
Come here!

720
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,531
Give me the wrench.

721
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,331
Give it to me.

722
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,091
You will come to attention.

723
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,251
It's a part of our work to die.

724
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,451
But we are not going to die.

725
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,132
Do you believe me?

726
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,409
Do you believe me?

727
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:05,255
He gets more accurate.
He will tear us apart the next time.

728
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,050
- What do you suggest, Kunz?
- Surface, Herr Kapitän. Surrender.

729
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,098
- Holem?
- I am not concerned, Herr Kapitän.

730
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,740
- Schwaffer?
- I say go on.

731
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,334
- The condition of the ship?
- We are not yet hurt.

732
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,411
But we cannot escape.

733
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:28,698
It will be your privilege to die for the new
Germany. Put this on the ship's turntable.

734
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,217
But the sound will carry, Herr Kapitän. It will
help the American to know our position.

735
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,291
Put it on.

736
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,011

01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,694
Sing it, everybody!

743
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,850
#... as we sing loud and strong

# We'll give a skol and shout <i>"Jawohl!"</i>
In lasting fellowship

746
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:27,531
# And when we eye a Lorelei
with captivating ways

747
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,898
# May we drink to love all our livelong days

748
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,972
<i>Jawohl! Jawohl!</i>

749
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,658
# To you, my friend, and you, my friend,
and all of us together

750
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,092
# Here's a toast to life
and to laughter and song

751
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,537
# Good beer, my friend, good cheer,
my friend, through every kind of weather

752
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,659
# Make the welkin ring

01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,451
<i>(muffled singing)</i>

756
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:17,776
Bridge, Sonar. I'm getting
screwy noises from the hydrophone.

757
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:22,411
- Sonar reports screwy noises from the target.
- Tell him to cut it in on speaker, Ensign.

758
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,889
Put it on the line, Lewis.

759

They're havin' a ball down there.

763
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,777
I don't think our psychology's working,
Captain.

764
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,455
No, it's working all right.
I almost wish it wasn't.

765
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,175
All ahead for attack, Mr Ware. Maybe we can
rip him open in the middle of a waltz.

766
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:31,375
Schwaffer!

767
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,379
Secure oil valves two and three.
Secure oil valves two and three!

768
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,539
<i>(explosion)</i>

769
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,895
Number four.

770
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,097
The valves will not
contain the oil, Herr Kapitän.

771
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,210
- Empty belly tanks into the sea.
- Empty belly tanks into the sea.

772
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,214
Oil slick off the starboard quarter,
sir. It's a big one.

773
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,693
Sonar, we may have hit him hard.
Are his props turning?

774
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:19,058
Sorry, sir, he doesn't seem to be a bit dead.
He's going away at a good clip to starboard.

775
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,337
- Right ten degree rudder.
- Stand by to fire, sir?

776
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,933
No, we'll ride his tail again.

777
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,092
Let him digest that last one.
He can't stay down much longer.

778
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,579
- Come back on 140.
- 140.

779
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,651
- 140.
- Schwaffer?

780
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,014
Yeah?

781
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,695
Ask Braun which way
the American turned after the attack.

782
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,609
- He turned to starboard, Herr Kapitän.
- Uh-huh.

783
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,691
Now I will show you something.

784
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,771
Each time he has attacked,

785
01:12:54,860 --> 01:13:00,218
we have turned off to port
or starboard to avoid the attack.

786
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,975
He drops his water bombs
and runs on for 300 or 400 metres,

787
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,530
and then turns, to fall back on our stern.

788
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,610
He doesn't always turn
the same way, but twice he did,

789
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:16,490
to run parallel with our course
for a very few minutes.

790
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,810
In those minutes he was vulnerable.

791
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,495
If he does it again, we will be ready.

792
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:28,091
There will not be time
to come up to periscope depth.

793
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,330
But it's possible.

794
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:37,212
If we spread the four bow torpedoes,
fired all at once, angled a few degrees apart,

795
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,291
one may hit.

796
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,330
One will be enough.

797
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,936
But... if he does not turn parallel
to our course, what can we do?

798
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,891
We will survive until he does.

799
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,934
Weather from Fleet Weather Control, sir.

800
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,095
- Mr Ware.
- Yes, sir?

801
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,172
The weather's gonna get worse
before dawn. There's wind in it.

802
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,570
It's gonna be difficult to keep
a fix on the target in the heavy sea.

803
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,128
- We may as well try to finish him off.
- Immediately?

804
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,179
Lmmediately. Inform Mr Crain we'll throw
everything we have left at the target.

805
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,530
- You understand?
- <i>Herr Kapitän, the destroyer is closing.</i>

806
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,054
- Oh. He comes early.
- We are ready, Herr Kapitän.

807
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:40,815
- Understand it will not be the usual routine.
- <i>Jawohl,</i> Herr Kapitän.

808
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,891
Seal torpedo.

809
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,771
Seal.

810
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,538
- Mr Ware, set depth charges to 100.
- <i>Aye aye, sir.</i>

811
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,214
- Target turning to port, sir.
- Stand by to fire.

812
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,814
- Left ten degrees rudder.
- Left ten degrees rudder.

813
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,458
Fire!

814
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,013
- He fires too shallow. Up to 50.
- 50!

815
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,091
50.

816
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:31,052
Now, American, turn the right way
and I'll give you a pretty present.

817
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:37,818
Plot reports he's off our stern.
Course still 140.

818
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,609
Give her a right 15 degree rudder.
We'll make a beam attack.

819
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,056
- He is turning. Starboard 20 degrees.
- Starboard 20.

820
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,210
Starboard 20.

821
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,370
- Halt course!
- Halt course.

822
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,291
<i>Torpedos... los!</i>

823
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,371
<i>Los!</i>

824
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:12,649
Go ahead, Sonar. High-speed
propeller effect, all on starboard side.

825
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,253
Stop port engine. Left full rudder.

826
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,891
- It's a hit!
- <i>(cheering)</i>

827
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,978
Silence!

828
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,051
<i>(alarm)</i>

829
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,580
Come on now!
Under both arms, man! Both arms!

830
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,733
- He's only got one arm, sir.
- Get him to starboard. Easy. Easy, boys.

831
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:52,617
We took the fish to forward fire room.
Fore and aft bulkheads, blown out.

832
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,897
- Fire room and engine room, flooded.
- Can the pumps keep us afloat?

833
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:01,452
- Well, if they can, it won't be for long.
- Well, make it as long as you can.

834
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,179
- Aft engine, what's your damage?
- A few valves loose,

835
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,377
and we're taking water,
but we're still getting steam.

836
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:11,009
- How long before you flood out?
- 30 minutes, maybe a little more.

837
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,332
Stop your engines, but be ready to give me
all the power you have the instant I ask for it.

838
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,413
Mr Ware, get a party and light some fires
on deck. Use mattresses and gasoline.

839
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,491
I want it to look as if the ship is burning.

840
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,140
The pumps are operating,
but it's hopeless.

841
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:28,452
I'm sure it is. You go along with Ware
and see if you can give him a hand.

842
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,212
Radio, this is the captain. Send this
emergency dispatch to Operations.

843
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,212
"Hit by torpedo.
Request immediate assistance."

844
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,131
His engines have stopped.
We'll go up to periscope depth.

845
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,694
- Periscope depth.
- 18 metres.

846
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,336
That's enough! Get out of here!

847
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:18,212
Attention, everyone. This is the captain.
I want all of you to listen carefully.

848
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:23,018
<i>They got one in where it would do the most</i>
<i>damage and we're going to lose the ship.</i>

849
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,456
<i>But we still have a kick left.</i>
<i>We're going to try to use it.</i>

850
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:31,336
<i>I am hoping that playing dead and the fire</i>
<i>will bring the enemy to the surface.</i>

851
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:36,892
<i>Except for securing crew and the gun crew</i>
<i>of mount 31, I want you all to abandon ship.</i>

852
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,740
<i>Repeat: Abandon ship.</i>

853
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,979
<i>Get as far away as quickly as you can.</i>

854
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,179
It's possible the enemy
will put another fish into us without warning.

855
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,979
Now get going. Good luck.

856
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,935
- 18 metres, Herr Kapitän.
- Steady keel.

857
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,011
<i>Jawohl.</i>

858
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:51,329
- We torpedo on the surface. Take it up.
- Surface!

859
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,896
<i>(buzzer)</i>

860
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,448
- Captain.
- Submarine off starboard bow.

861
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,411
This side.

862
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:19,615
I'm half-surprised he took the bait. The first
foolish thing he's done. That makes us even.

863
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,855
Tell him that in five minutes
I will finish off his ship.

864
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,339
Ready, Herr Kapitän.

865
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,773
He's given us five minutes. Signalman!

866
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:51,413
Take this message. Say
"Message understood." Add a "thank you".

867
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,851
Mount 31, this is the captain.

868
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:59,452
<i>That sub'll come close abeam. As soon as</i>
<i>he's broadside, give him a shell in the stern.</i>

869
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,008
If we're lucky, we oughta have a sitting duck.

870
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:06,491
Your second target is his deck gun, but be
quick, cos he'll start shooting when we do.

871
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,094
When I give the command to fire,
continue at will.

872
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:25,889
Signalman, no point in you and the talker
staying aboard any longer.

873
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,540
- Aye aye, sir. Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, sir.

874
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:33,250
Mr Ware. Your papers say you were
captain of a racing yacht before the war.

875
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,649
You must have a good eye
for speed and distance.

876
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,129
- I think I do.
- Would you like to take the helm?

877
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,211
My pleasure, Captain.

878
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:45,653
This will not take long.
Use only one torpedo, Schwaffer.

879
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,618
Engine room, this is the captain.
Can I still depend on you?

880
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,930
Say the word,
and I'll give you all we've got.

881
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,611
- Crack your throttle wide and get out!
- Turn it on full and get outta here!

882
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,819
Fire!

883
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:27,092
Fire, Kunz! Fire!

884
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,448
Secondary, fire at the bridge.

885
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,657
Set the automatic detonators
and get the men out of the ship.

886
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,971
Get going.

887
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,216
- Where's Schwaffer?
- I don't know, Herr Kapitän.

888
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,895
- But the detonators are set, Herr Kapitän.
- Get overboard.

889
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:20,057
- Herr Kapitän.
- I'll take you up, Heini. Come on.

890
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,414
- Hurry up!
- Come on! Come on, let's go!

891
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,975
- Come on, hurry it up!
- Come on, let's go!

892
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,411
Come on, Heini.

893
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,891
Come on.

894
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,578
- All clear. The boat's laying off stern for us.
- Right behind you.

895
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,011
<i>(ticking)</i>

896
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,134
Can't you get in closer?
The captain's behind me.

897
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:20,417
The captain's still aboard. There, on the deck.

898
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,736
- We gotta help him! Get in there!
- Those U-boats have detonators.

899
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,892
I don't care what they have!
Take this boat in - now!

900
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,617
There's no fire on the port side.
We go over that way.

901
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,089
Do you understand English? Port side!

902
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,489
Not much time. You go. I'll bring this man.

903
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,935
Can't you see? This man's dying.

904
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,011
He is my friend.

905
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,979
Stay where you are, Captain!

906
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,574
Come on, you guys, let's get up there!

907
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,379
<i>Warten Sie!</i>

908
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,771
This way! Get up there!

909
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,858
<i>Herr Kapitän!</i>
<i>Kommen Sie! Kommen Sie! Schnell!</i>

910
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:20,730
<i>Herr Kapitän! Kommen Sie! Schnell!</i>

911
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,175
Hurry, sir, I'm double-parked downstairs.

912
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,331
<i>(ticking)</i>

913
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,333
- That's it, Mr Ware! That's everybody!
- OK, get this thing outta here!

Remember our talk on the bridge,
the weighty one? Death and destruction?

927
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:05,649
You might be interested to know
that I've seen another reason for hope.

928
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,935
Found it in a funny place, too.

929
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:11,376
In the middle of an ocean,
right in the middle of a war.

930
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,054
You had to come a long way to find it,
didn't you, doc?

931
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,256
It was worth the trip.

932
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,331
Maybe.

933
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,369
I should have died many times, Captain,

934
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:49,410
but I continue to survive, somehow.

935
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:54,048
This time, it was your fault.

936
01:32:56,580 --> 01:33:00,858
I didn't know. Next time,
I won't throw you the rope.

937
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,731
I think you will.
