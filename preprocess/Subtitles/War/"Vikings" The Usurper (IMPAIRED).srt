that I have not prepared for that?

11

between us and the Christians.

15

The triumph of the Christ-God

16
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,869
will mean the death and destruction
of all of ours.

I was visiting a monastery in Frankia,
outside of Paris.

26
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:08,129
And one day,
the monks took me to see it.

27
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:10,950
It was amazing.

28
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:15,603
It just appears
as if it rises out of the water.

29
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,641
I've never in my whole life
seen anything like it.

30
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,259
It was like a dream.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,679
It has these huge walls,
and inside the walls

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,515
are these buildings
made of marble and stone

33
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,933
and churches, such churches.

34
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,353
I remember the clamor of their bells,

35
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:32,787
calling the faithful to prayer.

But what I remember more

38
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,761
is the beautiful women.

39
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,832
You never told me that part before!

40
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,033
I almost

41
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,704
questioned my vows of celibacy.

What are they talking about?

43

Who?

44
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:03,551
Ragnar and that priest.

45
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,521
Look at them,

46
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,823

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,226

You are lucky.

Why?

50
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,887
Because you have never been married.

51
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,908
I would not come back here

52
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,744

53
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,348
At least you have children.

How?

Ubbe and Hvitserk fell through

Siggy saved their lives,
but she drowned.

169
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,456
Bjorn!

170
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:06,825
What?

171
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,879
What do you mean "what"?
What happened to you?

172
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,367
I got into a fight with my uncle.

173
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,236
You fought with Rollo?

174
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:18,387
I wanted to stop them killing him.

175
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,706
I don't understand.

176
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:22,541
It doesn't matter.

177
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:26,445
Are you going to see Porunn?

178
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,016
No. She does not want to see me.

179
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:34,319
If she needs me, she will tell me.

180
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:36,355
She is a woman, not a child.

181
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,292
Good night.

182
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,938
What are you hiding?

183
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,408
I'm not a fool, Helga.

184
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,012
Something happened here
when we were away.

185
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,049
Something happened
that led to the death of Siggy.

186
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,092
A wanderer came here.

187
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:20,132
We had all dreamed of him.
Aslaug, Siggy and me.

188
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,037
He said his name was Harbard.
And he possessed some gifts.

189
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,521
He told stories,
and he could cure people.

190
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,641
He cured Ivar of his pains.

191
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,579
- His name was Harbard?
- Yes.

192
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:35,881
That is what he said.

193
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,786
And what else did he do?
This, Harbard?

194
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:48,727
He seduced Aslaug.
She slept with him.

195
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,298
It was because of him that
she was not looking after the children.

196
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,068
And this...
He said his name was Harbard?

197
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,921
- Are you sure he said that?
- Yes, he said that.

198
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,406
But what does it matter?

199
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,643
He took Aslaug away from the children.

200
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:07,813
- It's his fault that Siggy died.
- No. Not his fault.

201
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,483
Her fault, your fault, everyone's fault.

202
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:11,750
What do you mean?

203
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:13,703
You frighten me.

204
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:16,356
Harbard is not a human being.

205
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:17,940
Harbard is a god.

206
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,760
He came to visit.

207
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,730
And such a visit
must always be celebrated.

208
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:25,414
Even if it leads to death?

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,001
If it leads to death,
it also leads to life.

210

That is the way with the gods.

211
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,107
That is what Ragnar must understand.

212
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:37,276
But I don't want to tell Ragnar.

213
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,444
- It is not my business to tell Ragnar.
- No, no, no.

214
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,530
No, you're right.

215
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,449
It is my business.

Your properties,
your lands, your Earldom...

All have been usurped.

- It's the truth!

You have been removed from power.

- Forgive me. I am only the messenger.
- Who has done this?

Who has usurped me?

228

- That's impossible.
- And yet it has happened.

232

Kalf has made himself
the new Earl of Hedeby.

233
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,560
I supported you in Wessex,
now you must support me.

234
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,963
Together we can overthrow this usurper.

235
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:47,548
Firstly, you came to Wessex
of your own volition.

236
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,034
Secondly, if there is a civil war,

237
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,538
many of our own people will die.

238
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:57,409
Is your Earldom really
that important to you?

239
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,928
- Yes.
- Why?

240
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,063
Because it is rightfully mine!

241

We shall go and talk to him.

I'll tell you about Harbard.

249
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,021
I'll tell you about
who he was to your son.

250
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,324
The son you leave behind.

251
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:08,012
When you went away,
Harbard helped him.

252

He took away Ivar's pain.

253

Look how peaceful he is.

He never slept before.

Some conflict between the Northmen
and some of the landowners.

The usual stuff between us farmers.

296

But then it got serious.
There were threats.

297
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,263

Yes, never mind about that.
What happened next?

301
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:48,526
One of the farms of the Northmen
was attacked and burned down.

302
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,028
Some people died.

303
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:56,834
And what did the attackers
say to the Northmen?

304
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,012
They said it was just the beginning.

305
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,941
That they would come back
and kill them all.

306
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:09,915
Now you know that this settlement,

307
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,451
and my agreement with Ragnar Lothbrok,

308
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,685
mean a great deal to me.

309
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:19,224
So I want someone, someone I can trust,

310
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,927
to go out to the settlement
with a large force,

not want to leave them again so soon.

I can see that not the living,

332
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:14,335
but the dead, will conquer Paris.

333
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:21,225
Not the living but the dead?

334
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:27,181
And I also see that the bear
will be crowned by a princess.

335
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,519
Which does not bode too well for you,
King Ragnar.

(TALKING STOPS)

343
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,217
I have made up my mind.

344
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:07,288
And this year, we shall attack Paris.

345
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,290
ROLLO:
Paris?

346
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:12,777
What is Paris?

347
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,529
That is a good question, brother.

348
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,047
Paris is a city
in the country of Frankia.

349
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:19,333
Next!

350
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,486
Why haven't you told us
all about this before?

351
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:26,808
Because I'm telling you now.

(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

353
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:32,547
I understand that this,
this will not be easy.

354
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:37,719
By all accounts, Paris is a huge,

355
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,472
walled, well-protected city.

356
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,226
This is something that our people

357
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:49,064
have never attempted
or dreamt of before.

358
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:52,466
But I have begun to think

359
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,819
and dream of it.

360
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:04,945
Athelstan.

361
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:07,481
Come! Come!

362
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:11,836
Athelstan has been to Paris.

363
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,789
And the wanderer
who first told me about England,

364
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,291
he too told me about this city.

365
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,978
We must find him.

For it is good to travel
with hope and with courage.

368
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:34,476
But it is still better
to travel with knowledge!

What about your promise?

373
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:00,000
What promise?

374
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:02,871
To visit my Earldom.
To go to Hedeby.

375
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,555
To speak to the usurper.

376
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:09,511
Kalf!

377
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,248
You know why we've come.

378
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:18,620
You have usurped my rights and my lands,

379
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:21,722
to whom you were sworn
in fealty and trust.

380
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:25,592
I expect you to hand
both land and title back.

(CHUCKLES)

382
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,232
Hello, Kalf.

383
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,521
Perhaps we might discuss
these matters privately.

384
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,693
As you wish, King Ragnar.

385
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:01,628
Please, sit.

386
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:09,958
I would prefer to avoid
the unnecessary loss of lives

387
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:12,612
fighting a civil war with you.

388
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,947
Do you mind if I call you Earl, Kalf?

389
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,583
Uh-huh.

390
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,052
Come the spring,

391
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:26,870
I will be invading
a country called Frankia.

392
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:32,861
And I would like to invite you,

393
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:36,396
your men and your ships,
to join me on this expedition.

394
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,833
And if I refuse?

395
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,653
- You will lose everything.
- Even my Earldom?

396
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,872
You mean my Earldom.

397
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,243

That is between you and my ex-wife.

And good luck with that.

Won't you sit down, Lagertha?

400
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,055
I know you must hate me.

401
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,493
Just let me say that I
was born here in Hedeby.

402
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:08,262
I belong here and have
a fierce pride in being its earl.

403
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,166
I have a better claim than you do

404
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:16,687
even though I share
the world's admiration for you.

405
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,409
I'm not sure I believe
so much in titles.

406
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,496
A title is only an opportunity
to do good things for the folk here.

407
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:28,298
I want to do that.

408
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,969
You betrayed me.

409
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,422
And the fact is,
you planned to betray me.

410
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:37,007
And you must have planned it
for a long time.

411
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:41,311
I did, yes...

412
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:45,682
Despite the fact that I desired you.

413
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:48,486
You desired me?

414
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:49,938
Yes.

415
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:54,525
All the time that I was planning
on overthrowing you, I desired you.

416
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,244
I never stopped desiring you.

417
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:03,000
What am I supposed
to do with that knowledge?

Ragnar was always chosen over me.

421
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:22,596
By my father. And my mother.

422
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,332
Then by Lagertha.

423
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:29,187
Why would I not want to betray him?

424
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,972
Why would I not want to scream at him,

425

"You see, I am alive too!"

426
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:40,547
Being alive is nothing.
It doesn't matter what I do.

427
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:43,017
Ragnar is my father, he is my mother,

428

he is Lagertha, he is Siggy.

429

He is everything I cannot do,

everything I cannot be.

431
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:54,828
I love him.

432
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:57,064
He is my brother.

433
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:00,067
He has taken me back.

434
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,753
But I am so angry!

435
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:07,458
Why am I still so angry?

436
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,376
You tell me, wise one!

437
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:12,145
- Hmm.
- Or I will tell you!

438
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:16,451
It is because I am useless, feckless,

439
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,854
hollowed-out by failed ambitions,

440

by failed loves.

would take Aslaug away

from her children,
away from your sons.

They would go off together.

Then they would sneak
into the fish huts and...

Do you not know who Harbard is?

495
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,404
Harbard is another name for Odin.

496
00:39:03,405 --> 00:39:05,572
- It was Odin who slept with your wife.
- (SIGHS)

497
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,740
The god, Odin, who came to Kattegat.

498
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:23,056
I am ashamed

499
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:30,551
that my word as king
meant nothing to some of you!

500
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,336
That you organized this...

501
00:39:35,337 --> 00:39:38,906
this catastrophe among yourselves!

502
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:45,112
That you took it upon yourselves
to violate a treaty

503
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:48,298
that I had signed in good faith!

504
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:56,990
God knows what the Northmen
will make of these terrible events.

505
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,329
My name and my word as King of Wessex

506
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,765
will mean nothing to them!

507
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,121
But it cannot be, it cannot be!

508
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,173
It cannot be!

509
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,710
I cannot allow
and I cannot tolerate treason.

510
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:17,744
Guards!

511
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,464
Arrest this man! This man! And this!

512
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:24,283
And him! All for treason!

513
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:29,273
And my Lord Radolf. Arrest him also.

514
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:33,210
- Wait, Sire...
- For I showed him nothing,

515
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,329
nothing but love,

516
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,948
and this, this treachery is my reward?

517
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,603
- Out of my sight!
- (GRUNTS)

518
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:48,558
And Aethelwulf,
you think you will escape so lightly?

519
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:55,149
All of you! Leave!

520
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,784
I need to speak alone with my son!

521
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,079
(LAUGHS)

522
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,982
Thank you.

523
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:33,019
Thank you, my son.

524
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,524
You did the business so well.

525
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:42,863
How could we ever have
allowed these Northmen

526
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:47,033
to establish themselves here?
It's... It's unthinkable!

527
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,756
And I played my part well, did I not?

528
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,841
Yes, Father. Very well.

529
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,678
And by this ruse,

530
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,932
we have now caught out
all those nobles who question my rule

531
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:06,269
and we have reason now
to rid ourselves of them, permanently.

532
00:42:07,388 --> 00:42:09,355
- Mmm.
- It worked out well.

533
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:12,892
No...

534
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:18,231
It worked out beautifully, my son.

535
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:22,985
Even Charlemagne would have approved.

536
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:25,538
Don't you think so?

537
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,786
