00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,551
MAN:
Let the Jews burn!

161
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,656
Kill the Jews!

162
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,454
Hey, you, Fodor,
whatever your name is.

163
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,392
How do we know we can trust you?

164
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,395
Papa, we can.

165
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,466
He has friends.
They're fighting for us.

166
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,666
Friends? Zionist hoodlums.

167
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:05,206
- Nikki, what'll we do?
- Follow me.

168
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,468
I know the back alleys.

169
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,338
Eichmann told the council
we would be safe.

170
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:14,142
We... We would be safe
if we followed orders.

171
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,775
- We are Hungarians.
- Follow me.

172
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,513
EICHMANN: The Führer will tolerate
no further delays

173
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:24,023
- in eliminating Jewish sabotage.
HORTHY: Colonel Eichmann...

174
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,559
There are still a quarter of a million
Jews in Budapest,

175
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,459
including three individuals
whose wealth and power

176
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,430
you personally continue to shield.

177
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,001
I really must protest.

178
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,529
Colonel Eichmann,

179
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,840
I was an anti-Semite
before you were born.

180
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,446
I bow to no one in my distaste
for the chosen people.

181
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,974
I drafted Hungary's best,
most vigorous anti-Jewish laws.

182
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,644
But death camps like Auschwitz
were never what I had in mind.

183
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,622
Auschwitz, Auschwitz. No.

184
00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:00,661
Even our enemies, by their silence,

185
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,027
acknowledge that we are right
about the Jew.

186
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,500
Colonel, it is tradition in our country

187
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,902
to leave all matters of commerce
and finance to the Jew.

188
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:16,978
And I am not going to violate
this ancient Hungarian tradition.

189
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,943
- Certain Jews...
- All Jews must go.

190
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,845
You will not be allowed to interfere
any longer with deportations.

191
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,486
Not be allowed?
I will not be spoken to in this...

192
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,817
The Führer demands
a favorable ruling from your cabinet.

193
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,716
The deportations will be intensified.

194
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,884
The final solution
has been set in motion.

195
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,121
JACOB:
Your behavior was outrageous.

196
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,391
You humiliated your mother.

197
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,626
It's a good thing von Fremd
is a tolerant man.

198
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:43,602
Tolerant? Germany's collapsing,
he needs your money

199
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,105
for all those ambitious new projects
such as Auschwitz.

200
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,902
MAJ:
Raoul.

201
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,874
Is that really a good investment,
Uncle?

202
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,775
MAJ:
Oh, Raoul, please.

203
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,280
You're not only impertinent,
you're naive.

204
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,509
Of course we do business
with the Germans.

205
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,278
Who hasn't?

206
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:02,184
But we are also working closely
with the anti-Hitler movement.

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,586
Banking is not a business
for moralists.

208
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,862
And you certainly demonstrated that
when we sent you to Heifer in '37.

209
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:15,128
Somehow I wasn't made to sit
behind a desk and say no to people.

210
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,204
But instead
of calculating exchange rates,

211
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,738
you brooded into your wine glass

212
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,705
and talked philosophy
with your new friends.

213
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,310
Brooded? We did that some.

214
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:23,945
We also talked about movies
and women.

215
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,775
Oh, please, stop, both of you.

216
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,440
Raoul, with your goading.

217
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,588
And, Jacob, you do make Raoul out
such a dilettante.

218
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,985
It simply isn't true.

219
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:38,184
He worked very well in Heifer.
He always works well,

220
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,296
at the university and as an architect.

221
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:45,222
I thought his plans for the new spa
were quite stunning.

222
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,562
The fact that you and your brother
rejected them

223
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,069
tells more about your own limitations
than about Raoul's.

224
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,608
JACOB: The bath he designed for it
was outrageous.

225
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,208
It was brilliant.

226
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,072
Not really, Mother.

227
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,941
But my quick cork, that was brilliant.

228
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,614
Popped right out of the bottle
without a corkscrew.

229
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,309
And without a single customer
among wine merchants everywhere.

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,944
[LAUGHS]

231
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,646
But was I discouraged? Never.

232
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,190
I went right on
to cheap Japanese zippers,

233
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,259
which led directly
to my current involvement

234
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:15,158
with a middle-European
trading company, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

235
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,996
Where I'm a leading authority
on the importation

236
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,796
of smoked goose breast
and pickled cucumbers.

237
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,132
JACOB:
Kalman Lauer is a generous man,

238
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,504
and his philanthropic zeal has led him
to offer you a desk and a phone

239
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,736
and to send you off to any place

240
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,903
where your gift of languages
could be useful to him.

241
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:35,175
Not to mention your talent
for locating the wild truffle.

242
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,320
A talent I share with rooting hogs.

243
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,417
Raoul,

244
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:45,493
you said you were drilling
your home guards this afternoon.

245
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,492
- Can you drop me off in town?
- Yes.

246
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,654
JACOB:
Don't turn away from this, Maj.

247
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,960
- I'm not turning away from anything.
- Please don't deny it.

248
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,033
You have confided to me your sorrow
at Raoul's indifference.

249
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,229
RAOUL:
Indifference?

250
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,431
JACOB:
Towards having a worthy career.

251
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,009
- That's a source of sorrow for me too.
RAOUL: Uncle.

252
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:04,946
Just the opposite may be true.

253
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,112
I have felt so keenly

254
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:14,916
the enormous advantages I came into,
the privilege,

255
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,652
the love that has surrounded me.

256
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,296
And I'm afraid
I've made so little of it all.

257
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,797
That I find myself going about my
business in the middle of a nightmare,

258
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,972
trading shrewdly for shipments
of wild truffles in countries

259
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,508
where people are herded like cattle
into freight cars and gas chambers.

260
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,078
JACOB:
We can't change the world.

261
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,906
The war is practically over.
The nightmare will end.

262
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:45,944
But if you go on wandering through life
in search of perfect justice,

263
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:47,384
you'll starve, my boy.

264
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,816
Swedes don't starve, Uncle.
They're neutral.

265
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,423
Especially Wallenbergs.

266
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:07,169
MAN 1: The assignment requires
an experienced diplomat.

267
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,903
MAN 2: It also calls for
a persuasive one, doctor,

268
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,207
and it looks like our man
just qualified himself.

269
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,748
MAN 3:
Once Raoul makes a commitment...

270
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,385
Now, just for your information,

271
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,647
our American ambassador
has talked to your foreign ministry

272
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,519
and we're sure
that they'll respond favorably.

273
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:27,891
Oh, Raoul, you're improving.
Only 25 minutes late.

274
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,929
My apologies, Kalman.

275
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,465
Iver Olsen,
my friend Raoul Wallenberg.

276
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,399
- How do you do?
- I believe you already know Dr. Preiss.

277
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,199
- Always a pleasure.
- Indeed, sir.

278
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:43,438
Well, I hear
that we're practically fellow Americans.

279
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,046
Well, you spent five years
in Michigan, didn't you?

280
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,207
RAOUL:
Much more. Maine to Mexico.

281
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,319
Nice to see you, sir. Champagne?

282
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,279
Beer, please.

283
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,252
My champagne cousins
own the hotel,

284
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:58,120
so the employees
are under the misconception

285
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,592
that I have some share
in the Wallenberg fortune.

286
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,787
[MEN LAUGH]

287
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,524
WAITER: Sir.
RAOUL: Thank you.

288
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,963
- Skoal.
LAUER: Skoal.

289
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:13,239
As you know, Mr. Olsen's
with the War Refugee Board

290
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,400
set up by President Roosevelt.

291
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:19,776
Yes, we're looking for someone
to represent us in Budapest.

292
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,915
Mr. Lauer has told me
that the purpose of your organization

293
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,543
is to save the 250,000 Jews
left in Hungary.

294
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:30,852
Then you can understand why it is
so important to choose the right man.

295
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,428
LAUER: Dr. Preiss is head of the
Jewish Committee here in Stockholm.

296
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,428
OLSEN: Yes, as foreigners,
we thought it proper

297
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,726
to consult with an advisory group.

298
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,495
I've told Mr. Olsen
about the many trips

299
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,900
you've taken for me to Budapest.

300
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:48,637
Business as well as in search
of my wife's family.

301
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,870
He knows the city.

302
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,173
He has contacts.

303
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:57,385
But Dr. Preiss still has his doubts
about me.

304
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,852
Only about your seriousness,
Mr. Wallenberg.

305
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,356
If I am selected

306
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:10,056
and if the Foreign Office agrees
to give me the latitude I need,

307
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,060
I would be relentless, gentlemen.

308
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,228
You'd be a fully accredited
Swedish diplomat

309
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,374
attached to the legation.

310
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:22,744
What the mystery writers call
"a cover."

311
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,675
Ha. Precisely.

312
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,542
Now, my contact tells me

313
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,684
that your country is ready
to increase its representation.

320

The fear of crowding the vault
if too many more Jews come here.

- If you must.

What did Monsignor Rotha mean
when he asked God

to forgive everyone
who kept silent about the Jews?

The nuncio is a meddlesome

with Admiral Horthy

Including the statement

saying that he would soon
fight his way into Berlin

as if he were a snake.

Yes, there it is. There's your pass.

Go on, he has a pass. Good.

1560

the others will follow on behind.

to your superiors.

Thank you, gentlemen.

- Who is he?
- You didn't ask for his papers.

1564
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:21,463
He has a Swedish flag on his car,
hasn't he?

"Times are extraordinarily exciting.

1589

The main thing is that we are working

to preserve the gift of life,
as you like to call it.

1591
01:40:07,337 --> 01:40:12,036
I'm gaining a truer sense of that gift
in helping to save others here.

1592
01:40:12,242 --> 01:40:16,406
And so you must think of me
as one of the most fortunate of men.

1593
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:19,208
It is not given to many
to live such a life.

1594

Then why the long face?

According to Kalman Lauer,
conditions are worse than ever there.

1601

Raoul has become
something of a hero.

And what is conceivably wrong
with that?

Tell me if I'm wrong,

I sensed you eagerly reaching out
to know, to help.

And now the situation is so critical,

I don't know your husband,

LISL:
He's his own person.

He could never destroy
innocent lives.

Then let's put it to the test
while we help shape his policies.

That is where you expect
to make use of me?

By allowing your passions,
your attitudes to shape mine.

01:42:05,489 --> 01:42:08,856
They are already your attitudes, Lisl.

1623
01:42:11,662 --> 01:42:14,529
I will not be disloyal to him.

1624

I'm asking you to keep him alive.

1625
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:19,226
Because unless he can turn
his new power

1626
01:42:19,403 --> 01:42:22,463
to save lives and not crush them,

1627
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,632
he will be tried when the war ends,
and executed.

- Oh, my God.
- The point is that need not happen.

to honor the passes.

To ease restrictions on the Jews.
To refuse to cooperate with the Nazis.

01:57:26,676 --> 01:57:28,837
The fact is my great-great-grandfather
was a Jew,

1863
01:57:29,011 --> 01:57:30,774
which makes me
one-sixteenth Jewish,

1864
01:57:30,947 --> 01:57:34,110
and not as much
as I would have preferred.

1865
01:57:34,484 --> 01:57:36,577
And now, may I make a suggestion?

1866
01:57:37,587 --> 01:57:39,612
Please.

1867
01:57:40,389 --> 01:57:43,847
Let's open your Scotch. I'm thirsty.

1868
01:57:55,605 --> 01:57:59,234
Shall we drink to...?
To honor. To duty.

1869
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:02,801
Can you still feel secure, colonel,

1870
01:58:02,979 --> 01:58:07,473
in continuing to carry out your orders
to murder helpless civilians?

1871
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:12,947
They give me orders.
"Get them to the camps."

1872
01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:15,784
Well, by God, I'll do it.
And I'll keep on doing it until...

1873
01:58:15,958 --> 01:58:19,257
Until Valhalla crashes down
around your head.

1874
01:58:19,428 --> 01:58:22,022
Not the twilight of the gods
but the death of monsters.

1875
01:58:22,431 --> 01:58:25,332
Shall we drink
to the death of monsters, Eichmann?

1876
01:58:25,501 --> 01:58:28,732
Get out of here, Wallenberg.
Your charm wears thin.

1877
01:58:28,905 --> 01:58:32,272
I cannot consider this conversation
as private. The Vatican and...

1878
01:58:32,441 --> 01:58:34,671
To hell with them!

1879
01:58:45,555 --> 01:58:47,386
Wallenberg.

1880
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,060
I'll do you a favor.

1881
01:58:53,229 --> 01:58:55,220
I'm open to offers.

1882
01:58:55,531 --> 01:58:57,328
I'll find a train for your Hebrews.

1883
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:02,631
For 750,000 francs,
made payable to me personally,

1884
01:59:02,805 --> 01:59:05,330
you can take a few hundred Jews
anywhere you want.

1885
01:59:06,142 --> 01:59:09,236
- And the others?
- They remain.

1886
01:59:10,279 --> 01:59:13,146
I'll consider it. Good day, colonel.

1887
01:59:15,017 --> 01:59:17,884
- Thank you, major.
- Wallenberg.

1888
01:59:25,394 --> 01:59:29,330
I want that Jew lover dead
before the day ends.

1890

- Sonja?
- I'm really quite all right.

1891
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:10,104
Well, the doctor's
coming right away.

1892
02:00:10,406 --> 02:00:13,671
You won't be riding that bicycle
of yours for a few days.

1893
02:00:13,843 --> 02:00:16,073
- I don't know. Why not?
- Are you sure you're all right?

1894
02:00:16,245 --> 02:00:17,439
Colonel Eichmann, please.

1895
02:00:17,613 --> 02:00:20,548
No, I'll, uh... I'll need it
until Vilmos gets us a new car.

1896
02:00:20,716 --> 02:00:23,480

on my car.

- Not in the car.

- What do you want, colonel?
- I'll tell you what I want.

1904
02:00:53,316 --> 02:00:55,580
I want you
to start marching the Jews.

1905
02:00:55,751 --> 02:00:58,879
And you can march them
until they drop.

1906
02:00:59,055 --> 02:01:01,046
This time, I will tolerate no delay.

One warm coat, one pair of shoes
and one valise.

Religion: Catholic.
Perfectly acceptable.

1973
02:05:02,197 --> 02:05:05,098
As you can see,
we're also feeding the sisters.

1974
02:05:05,267 --> 02:05:07,827
I'm not here to eat.

Except the part
about my being Polish.

1977
02:05:21,817 --> 02:05:25,446
Teicholz. You're with the Walde.

1978
02:05:26,288 --> 02:05:28,153
I hear you're good,

1979
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:31,082
but, uh, difficult.

1980
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:35,629
Did you get your head busted
fighting with the partisans in Poland?

1981
02:05:35,798 --> 02:05:38,130
Did you have to come to this country
illegally like me?

1982
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:41,428
I'm impressed.
That's why I sought you out.

1983
02:05:41,537 --> 02:05:43,266
Why should I do anything for you?

1984
02:05:43,672 --> 02:05:46,800
- Walde's doing fine by itself.
- Indeed it is.

1985
02:05:46,976 --> 02:05:50,275
But we are overlapping
in certain areas,

1986
02:05:50,446 --> 02:05:53,938
with your printing business,
in particular.

1987
02:05:54,116 --> 02:05:56,141
Who in hell are you
to complain about our passes?

1988
02:05:56,318 --> 02:05:58,218
Do you know how many lives
we've saved with them?

1989
02:05:58,387 --> 02:06:01,379
Hundreds. Nevertheless,
you and I are beginning to overlap.

1990
02:06:01,557 --> 02:06:03,548
It's causing problems
for people carrying our passes

1991
02:06:03,726 --> 02:06:05,819
- and we're saving thousands.
- That's your claim.

1992
02:06:05,995 --> 02:06:07,792
That's the truth.

1993
02:06:07,963 --> 02:06:10,727
So redirect your hostility,
if you would, toward the enemy.

1994
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:12,730
I'm on your side.

1995
02:06:12,901 --> 02:06:16,735
What do you want from me,
Wallenberg? Not that I'm delivering.

1996
02:06:16,905 --> 02:06:20,033
I want access to the Walde's
underground bunkers, Mr. Teicholz.

1997
02:06:21,276 --> 02:06:24,837
And you damn well better deliver,
because if you don't,

1998
02:06:25,014 --> 02:06:28,313
every one of these people
will be rounded up,

I got room for about 300.

A thousand and make room.

2004

I'll make room.

I came to tell you
that your life is in danger.

I know that.

2059

Not only from Eichmann,

Szálasi also.

And I wanted you to know

2062
02:11:57,045 --> 02:12:01,880
that Gabor tried to stop the marches
from starting again.

2063

Then you came here
to feed your husband's case?

You are a neutral witness.

2065

You might be asked to testify.

2066
02:12:13,495 --> 02:12:15,861
But you could've told me that
on the phone.

2067
02:12:16,031 --> 02:12:21,025
Yes, but the climate is worsening,
as you predicted,

2068
02:12:22,237 --> 02:12:25,434
and I wanted to be sure
that I saw you again

2069

to tell you these things directly.

What things, Lisl?

2071
02:12:30,579 --> 02:12:34,845
- That Gabor is not an evil man.
- Simply misguided.

2072

I am still carrying our child.

What other things, Lisl?

2076
02:12:50,098 --> 02:12:52,225
I am here...

2077
02:12:54,336 --> 02:12:58,067
...because it was impossible for me
not to be here.

And if I take one step towards you,

2081
02:13:18,794 --> 02:13:22,560
I will forget why I came here
in the first place.

2082
02:13:46,588 --> 02:13:48,647

He said the Nazis' greatest victory

2089
02:14:30,265 --> 02:14:33,200
was convincing the Jews
that they were doomed,

for thousands of them.

It's happening. Death march.

2170
02:21:11,966 --> 02:21:14,434
Sonja's building's empty.
She and the boy are gone.

2171
02:21:14,602 --> 02:21:17,093
What? Police or SS?

2172
02:21:17,272 --> 02:21:19,137
- I didn't ask.
- Didn't they respect our flags?

2173
02:21:19,307 --> 02:21:21,537
- Apparently not.
- Damn them!

2174
02:21:23,211 --> 02:21:25,873
Once they get the Jews
out of Hungary, they're doomed.

2175
02:21:26,047 --> 02:21:28,515
At least here,
I have some bargaining power.

2176
02:21:28,683 --> 02:21:29,809
With the Russians, you mean?

2177
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:33,078
Well, so long as I can threaten
these savages with the Red Army,

2178
02:21:33,254 --> 02:21:35,085
we have a chance.

2179
02:21:35,256 --> 02:21:36,883
Like all murderers, they're cowards.

2180
02:21:37,058 --> 02:21:40,619
Lutz? Wallenberg.
Do you have the report also?

2181
02:21:40,728 --> 02:21:45,165
Yes, tens of thousands of them.
Sick, dying, starving.

2182
02:21:45,333 --> 02:21:50,202
Yes, a massive rescue operation.
Trucks, food, clothes, medicine.

2183
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:37,677
- Stop complaining.
- Come on.

2184
02:22:37,852 --> 02:22:41,219
Faster. There's a road ahead.

2185
02:22:50,765 --> 02:22:52,164
Good God.

2186
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:07,313
Come on. Move, move, move.

2187
02:23:14,956 --> 02:23:16,116
- Move.
- Go on.

2188
02:23:31,539 --> 02:23:34,235
- Go, go, go.
- Come on.

2189
02:23:37,745 --> 02:23:39,269
Get moving.

2190
02:23:39,447 --> 02:23:41,972
You don't need to hit.
Don't need to hit.

2191
02:23:47,588 --> 02:23:50,557
Stay away. I can't...

2192
02:23:53,061 --> 02:23:55,086
- Don't.
- Come on.

2193
02:24:00,034 --> 02:24:02,264
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

2194
02:24:06,708 --> 02:24:09,700
- Come on. Get up.
- I'm up.

2195
02:24:15,383 --> 02:24:17,578
Get away from there.

2196
02:25:00,561 --> 02:25:02,893
Shall I stop, sir?

2197
02:25:03,264 --> 02:25:04,925
WOMAN:
Mr. Wallenberg. Mr. Wallenberg.

2198
02:25:05,099 --> 02:25:06,396
No.

2199
02:25:07,068 --> 02:25:09,935
We can try to stop this
only at the trains.

2200
02:25:10,104 --> 02:25:12,766
WOMAN: Please, help me.
- Drive on to the station.

2201
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,204
Mr. Wallenberg, please help me.

2202
02:25:19,914 --> 02:25:22,576
CROWD:
Help us. Save us.

2203
02:25:23,518 --> 02:25:25,110
Per,

2204
02:25:26,187 --> 02:25:31,250
what does our Christian faith
tell us about these Nazi scoundrels?

2205
02:25:33,027 --> 02:25:37,396
Who are they? What shaped them?

2206
02:25:39,167 --> 02:25:41,567
I am no theologian.

2207
02:25:41,669 --> 02:25:45,127
CROWD: Please, Mr. Wallenberg.
Save us. Help us.

2208
02:25:45,306 --> 02:25:50,471
Perhaps we are witnessing
the death of God himself.

2209
02:25:51,078 --> 02:25:52,102
CROWD:
Please.

2210
02:26:18,272 --> 02:26:20,502
Move! Move!

2211
02:26:27,882 --> 02:26:30,476
Keep moving. Keep moving.

2212
02:26:42,029 --> 02:26:44,520
Train is ready for you.

2213
02:26:45,099 --> 02:26:47,033
Let's go.

2214
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,665
Keep that line tight.

2215
02:27:00,848 --> 02:27:02,338
Move.

2216
02:27:10,424 --> 02:27:12,585
MAN:
Watch out where you're going.

2217
02:27:33,247 --> 02:27:35,977
Go on, we're going up ahead now.

2218
02:27:40,087 --> 02:27:41,748
Move it.

2219
02:27:41,989 --> 02:27:44,253
Don't fall behind.

2220
02:27:48,429 --> 02:27:51,364
- Come on, Jews.
- Come on.

2221
02:27:57,538 --> 02:27:59,529
Get away from that car.

2222
02:28:00,608 --> 02:28:02,667
Keep away from there.

2223
02:28:08,149 --> 02:28:10,413
Off the road. Off the road.

2224
02:28:15,089 --> 02:28:17,614
Let the car through.

2225
02:28:19,327 --> 02:28:21,192
Get away from the car.

2226
02:28:31,138 --> 02:28:33,629
The main thing is statistics.

2227
02:28:33,808 --> 02:28:37,505
Too many died after they got here
before we could load them.

2228
02:28:37,678 --> 02:28:40,670
DIETER: You, you have to take back
the pregnant women and the sick.

2229
02:28:40,781 --> 02:28:43,875
- My orders are otherwise, major.
MAN: Up, up, up. On your feet.

2230
02:28:44,051 --> 02:28:47,509
I want live bodies on the train.

2231
02:28:48,522 --> 02:28:50,717
- You, on the train.
SOLDIER: We're arguing whether Jews

2232
02:28:50,891 --> 02:28:53,883
should die on the train or on the road
to Budapest, what's the difference?

2233
02:28:54,061 --> 02:28:55,790
The useless ones don't go.

2234
02:28:55,963 --> 02:28:57,726
- Look at him.
- You heard what I said!

2235
02:28:57,898 --> 02:29:00,696
DIETER: Shoot them or hang them,
for all I care. The sick ones don't go.

2236
02:29:00,868 --> 02:29:02,927
I'll kill you all with my bare hands!

2237
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:05,129
Come on, you too.

2238
02:29:05,306 --> 02:29:06,637
You with the beard.

2239
02:29:06,807 --> 02:29:11,141
Perhaps we call Budapest, I'll get
a clarification from Minister Biner.

2240
02:29:11,312 --> 02:29:13,212
DIETER:
You do that.

2241
02:29:14,115 --> 02:29:18,279
How did we end up on the same side
with all the garbage of Europe?

2242
02:29:20,087 --> 02:29:21,952
Statistics.

2243
02:29:23,024 --> 02:29:24,423
Where is Teicholz?

2244
02:29:27,461 --> 02:29:30,055
- No, please. Please.
- Get on the train!

2245
02:29:32,767 --> 02:29:34,667
Out of the way.

2246
02:29:37,505 --> 02:29:40,531
Come on, move. Move. Come on.

2247
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:44,810
Move forward.
Come on, on your feet.

2248
02:29:44,979 --> 02:29:47,846
Never mind all that.
Come on, move forward.

2249
02:29:48,015 --> 02:29:49,949
What are you doing?

2250
02:29:55,489 --> 02:29:59,550
Nobody touch the medicine.
It's not for you.

2251
02:30:01,162 --> 02:30:03,255
- Get away from here.
- Get back.

2252
02:30:06,167 --> 02:30:09,102
- Step back!
- Get out of here. Get away.

2253
02:30:09,537 --> 02:30:11,630
Step back or I'll shoot you.

2254
02:30:12,473 --> 02:30:15,203
RAOUL: Ferenczy.
PER: What are you going to do?

2255
02:30:15,376 --> 02:30:18,709
I'm not sure. Vilmos.

2256
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:22,206
Get me some whiskey, cigarettes
and big packets of money.

2257
02:30:22,383 --> 02:30:24,283
You want me with you?

2258
02:30:24,452 --> 02:30:28,047
No. You and Charles do everything
you can to stop the trains from leaving.

2259
02:30:28,222 --> 02:30:30,213
And write down the names
of people without passes.

2260
02:30:30,391 --> 02:30:34,122
Fill in the blanks
for the young and strong ones.

2261
02:30:44,605 --> 02:30:46,368
Wait for me, huh?

2262
02:30:47,041 --> 02:30:49,635
- Colonel Ferenczy.
- Oh, the Swedes.

2263
02:30:49,810 --> 02:30:51,744
What a nice reunion, colonel.

2264
02:30:51,912 --> 02:30:55,370
Christmas is upon us.
I thought we might celebrate early.

2265
02:30:55,549 --> 02:30:57,176
Celebrate?

2266
02:30:57,351 --> 02:31:01,811
To warm the hearts
of your splendid policemen, huh?

2267
02:31:01,989 --> 02:31:04,253
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Ha, ha.

2268
02:31:06,327 --> 02:31:10,127
So this fellow, this foreign office chap,
he asks,

2269
02:31:10,297 --> 02:31:14,256
"How can Hungarian Jews
becomes Swedes overnight?"

2270
02:31:14,869 --> 02:31:19,465
And I said, "Didn't you know,
the Swedes are the lost tribe of Israel?

2271
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:21,198
These Jews are going home."

2272
02:31:22,409 --> 02:31:25,276
Going home? That's a good one.

2273
02:31:25,446 --> 02:31:28,973
- Stockholm, the new Jerusalem, huh?
- Yes. Yes.

2274
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:33,484
I said, "It's been proven, by measuring
skulls and matching fingerprints,

2275
02:31:33,654 --> 02:31:36,248
the Swedes are descended
from King David.

2276
02:31:36,423 --> 02:31:37,447
[ALL CHUCKLING]

2277
02:31:37,625 --> 02:31:40,856
The Royal House of Sweden
has Jewish roots.

2278
02:31:41,595 --> 02:31:45,588
Our constitution is based
on the Ten Commandments."

2279
02:31:48,369 --> 02:31:53,204
And now for the real Christmas,
huh?

2280
02:31:55,943 --> 02:31:58,309
Dollars? American dollars?

2281
02:31:58,712 --> 02:32:00,111
What do you want from us?

2282
02:32:00,781 --> 02:32:02,408
You know what I want, colonel.

2283
02:32:04,451 --> 02:32:08,114
You all know what I want.

2284
02:32:14,962 --> 02:32:16,657
MAN:
Come on, move it.

2285
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:20,095
Please, please.
Let me help with the boy.

2286
02:32:20,634 --> 02:32:22,295
- You come with me.
- Leave this to me.

2287
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:24,528
- I've got my orders.
- Leave the child alone.

2288
02:32:24,705 --> 02:32:27,265
Stop! There are people here
who are Swiss citizens.

2289
02:32:27,441 --> 02:32:28,465
Get them out of here!

2290
02:32:28,642 --> 02:32:30,610
There are many people here,
Swedish persons.

2291
02:32:30,778 --> 02:32:31,802
Close the doors.

2292
02:32:31,979 --> 02:32:35,710
Stop! Stop! Keep those doors open!

2293
02:32:35,883 --> 02:32:37,475
Stop!

2294
02:32:37,785 --> 02:32:40,618
Are there any
Swedish protected people here?

2295
02:32:40,721 --> 02:32:41,847
Take these.

2296
02:32:42,022 --> 02:32:45,389
If so, come forward at once.

2297
02:32:46,126 --> 02:32:48,094
You are in violation
of international law!

2298
02:32:48,262 --> 02:32:50,753
Let them get away with that?
Get those men out of here.

2299
02:32:50,931 --> 02:32:52,899
Take these. Pass them out.

2300
02:32:53,067 --> 02:32:54,659
- Those are ours.
- Stop!

2301
02:32:54,835 --> 02:32:56,427
- We have to move the train.
- Stay back.

2302
02:32:56,604 --> 02:32:59,266
I am the secretary
of the Swedish Legation.

2303
02:33:00,274 --> 02:33:04,472
If you have a pass or if you have
lost one, step forward at once.

2304
02:33:04,645 --> 02:33:07,478
Get off the trains at once.

2305
02:33:08,549 --> 02:33:10,107
Josef?

2306
02:33:10,284 --> 02:33:12,149
Mrs. Khan.

2307
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:14,287
Mrs. Khan of the legation.

2308
02:33:14,455 --> 02:33:16,252
- Vilmos.
- I'll take her.

2309
02:33:16,423 --> 02:33:18,755
- Take her to the car.
- Let me have him. Come on, my boy.

2310
02:33:18,926 --> 02:33:21,952
Please. He is very ill.

2311
02:33:22,129 --> 02:33:25,098
- Get him down.
- Anyone with a pass, step forward.

2312
02:33:27,768 --> 02:33:29,998
Take your filthy hands off him.

2313
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:32,502
Mr. Wallenberg is a diplomat.

2314
02:33:32,673 --> 02:33:34,470
Ferenczy, our agreement!

2315
02:33:34,642 --> 02:33:36,405
Stop. Leave him alone!

2316
02:33:36,577 --> 02:33:40,638
I have made an arrangement
with this man, sergeant.

2317
02:33:41,348 --> 02:33:43,782
- We have passes.
- Raise your hands.

2318
02:33:43,951 --> 02:33:46,181
- Raise your hands.
- What's a handful of yids to us?

2319
02:33:46,353 --> 02:33:48,218
RAOUL: Raise your hand
if you have a Swiss pass.

2320
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:51,790
It does not matter if you have lost it.
You are here in the ledger.

2321
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:54,484
You have the full protection
of the King of Sweden

2322
02:33:54,662 --> 02:33:55,959
and the Swiss Republic.

2323
02:33:56,897 --> 02:33:59,331

2633
02:59:22,888 --> 02:59:27,587
And you,
call off those Arrow Cross pips.

2634
02:59:29,562 --> 02:59:34,329
You have my personal guarantee
there will be no such action.

2635
02:59:36,435 --> 02:59:38,232
Thank you.

2636
02:59:40,439 --> 02:59:42,031
Eichmann is a madman,
but if we stop now,

2637
02:59:42,208 --> 02:59:44,005
- it's a confession of guilt.
- Silence.

2638
02:59:44,176 --> 02:59:45,837
Wallenberg.

2639
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:49,076
Wallenberg.

2640
02:59:52,184 --> 02:59:54,550
Don't work too hard
at saving some necks.

2641
03:00:11,136 --> 03:00:12,660
- We have to move out.
- All right.

2642
03:00:12,838 --> 03:00:15,534
- Move out?
- All right.

2643
03:00:15,708 --> 03:00:18,302
Come on, men, we're moving out.
Pack up.

2644
03:00:18,477 --> 03:00:20,707
- Attention, everybody.
- All right, on the truck.

2645
03:00:21,981 --> 03:00:24,449
Everyone in the trucks.

2646
03:00:30,756 --> 03:00:32,451
Move out.

2647
03:00:34,460 --> 03:00:37,293
All you men, move on it.

2648
03:00:45,371 --> 03:00:46,963
Hannah.

2649
03:00:55,814 --> 03:00:59,147
Rabbi, they're going away.

2650
03:00:59,652 --> 03:01:02,052
I wish you'd change your mind.
The city isn't secure.

2651
03:01:02,221 --> 03:01:05,349
Nonsense, I've already made contact
with the Russians.

2652
03:01:05,524 --> 03:01:07,856
Look, Malinovsky has sent
an escort for me.

2653
03:01:08,027 --> 03:01:10,154
But the streets aren't safe,
they're still fighting.

2654
03:01:10,329 --> 03:01:12,388
Well, I have absolute faith in Vilmos.

2655
03:01:12,564 --> 03:01:15,089
Oh, Per, I've left some money
with the minister.

2656
03:01:15,267 --> 03:01:17,827
Please see that it's used to buy
food and medicine for the ghetto.

2657
03:01:18,003 --> 03:01:21,939
- I am. You can depend on us.
- I always have.

2658
03:01:22,574 --> 03:01:24,508
God bless you, Per.

2659
03:01:25,978 --> 03:01:27,002
And you.

2660
03:01:28,714 --> 03:01:32,241
Well, I'll back in a week, making my
usual impossible demands on you all.

2661
03:01:32,418 --> 03:01:33,851
Good luck, Mr. Wallenberg.

2662
03:01:34,019 --> 03:01:36,647
Meanwhile, Sonja will
keep you on your toes, huh?

2663
03:01:37,022 --> 03:01:39,456
Maybe Mr. Anger is right, sir.

2664
03:01:40,893 --> 03:01:42,758
Maybe you should wait.

2665
03:01:42,928 --> 03:01:45,795
Our new friends
don't look threatening.

2666
03:01:46,065 --> 03:01:47,396
Good morning, comrades.

2667
03:01:51,270 --> 03:01:52,294
Sonja.

2668
03:01:54,673 --> 03:01:56,766
- It's going well, huh?
- Yes.

2669
03:01:58,777 --> 03:02:03,043
I'm only sorry I, uh...
I didn't teach Josef to smile.

2670
03:02:07,486 --> 03:02:09,386
- Ready, comrades.
- Goodbye.

2671
03:02:09,888 --> 03:02:13,722
- Thank you, bye-bye.
MAN: Bye.

2672
03:02:34,847 --> 03:02:39,614
Come on, let's get our people out!
Bring the bar.

2673
03:02:41,820 --> 03:02:43,344
Take that.

2674
03:02:47,926 --> 03:02:51,191
Move that one. Stand back.

2675
03:02:58,937 --> 03:02:59,961
Come out!

2676
03:03:01,707 --> 03:03:03,766
What's the matter,
you wanna stay in here?

2677
03:03:03,942 --> 03:03:05,136
Come on, you're free!

2678
03:03:16,121 --> 03:03:20,114
Is it possible, Vilmos,
that we did make a difference, huh?

2679
03:03:26,265 --> 03:03:28,233
WOMAN:
Mr. Wallenberg.

2680
03:03:28,801 --> 03:03:29,893
Mr. Wallenberg.

2681
03:04:16,515 --> 03:04:18,244
Captain.

2682
03:04:20,686 --> 03:04:23,120
I'm the second secretary
of the Swedish Legation.

2683
03:04:24,189 --> 03:04:26,783
I have an appointment
with Marshal Malinovsky at Debrecen.

2684
03:04:27,326 --> 03:04:29,021
Raoul.

2685
03:04:30,395 --> 03:04:32,955
What? What are they doing?

2686
03:04:33,499 --> 03:04:35,797
My name is Wallenberg,
here are my credentials.

2687
03:04:39,238 --> 03:04:42,935
The driver to the truck,
you are going with me.

2688
03:04:43,041 --> 03:04:45,441
I am in direct contact
with your commander.

2689
03:04:45,978 --> 03:04:49,675
Come, I have my own orders.
Please come.

2690
03:04:52,251 --> 03:04:54,617
RAOUL:
What the hell are you doing?

2691
03:04:55,687 --> 03:04:57,814
What the hell are you doing?

2692
03:04:57,990 --> 03:04:59,719
Do you realize
I have diplomatic immunity?

2693
03:04:59,892 --> 03:05:02,383
I demand an explanation.

2694
03:05:02,728 --> 03:05:04,559
Go!

2695
03:05:38,130 --> 03:05:41,998
LISL:
<i>Dear beloved Raoul,</i>

2696
03:05:42,868 --> 03:05:48,397
<i>after many years of despair</i>
<i>and infinite sorrow,</i>

2697
03:05:48,974 --> 03:05:53,775
<i>we have never given up hope</i>
<i>of seeing you again.</i>

2698
03:05:54,746 --> 03:05:58,375
<i>Despite the fact</i>
<i>that all our efforts to contact you</i>

2699
03:05:58,550 --> 03:06:01,018
<i>have been unsuccessful.</i>

2700
03:06:02,521 --> 03:06:05,649
<i>From other prisoners</i>
<i>who have returned</i>

2701
03:06:05,824 --> 03:06:08,952
<i>and who have shared cells</i>
<i>with you,</i>

2702
03:06:09,328 --> 03:06:12,695
<i>we have learned</i>
<i>about your life in prison.</i>

2703
03:06:13,565 --> 03:06:18,195
<i>However, nothing sustains us more</i>

2704
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:22,101
<i>than your thought</i>
<i>that it is given to few men</i>

2705
03:06:22,274 --> 03:06:25,835
<i>to lead a life such as yours.</i>

2706
03:06:26,778 --> 03:06:30,544
<i>There is a room waiting for you</i>
<i>when you return.</i>

2707
03:06:32,718 --> 03:06:39,385
NARRATOR: <i>On January 17th, 1945,</i>
<i>Raoul Wallenberg vanished.</i>

2708
03:06:39,558 --> 03:06:43,551
<i>After repeated requests</i>
<i>for information as to his fate,</i>

2709
03:06:43,662 --> 03:06:45,630
<i>all of which were rebuffed,</i>

2710
03:06:45,797 --> 03:06:51,429
<i>the Soviet Union announced</i>
<i>that he had died in July, 1947.</i>

2711
03:06:51,603 --> 03:06:55,300
<i>No evidence was produced</i>
<i>to support their claims.</i>

2712
03:06:55,474 --> 03:06:58,637
<i>And over the years,</i>
<i>reports about him persist</i>

2713
03:06:58,810 --> 03:07:04,339
<i>from those who claimed to have spent</i>
<i>time with him in Soviet captivity.</i>

2714
03:07:04,516 --> 03:07:08,919
<i>I, Per Anger, was Raoul's colleague</i>
<i>for seven months in Budapest.</i>

2715
03:07:09,087 --> 03:07:13,683
<i>I believe to this day,</i>
<i>he still may be alive.</i>
