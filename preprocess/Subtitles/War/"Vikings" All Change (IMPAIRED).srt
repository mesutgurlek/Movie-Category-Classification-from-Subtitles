Previously on "Vikings":

00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:03,898
We shall ask the gods
why do they make me earl,

3
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,769
yet kill my son?

4
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:08,360
- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?

5
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:11,265
Fill me with seed
before it's too late.

6
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,121
If you really want
to be a great man,

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,240
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?

8
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,393
That's where your brother is.

9
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:19,040
He's already boasting
how he sailed west alone.

10
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:22,038
But you weren't invited.
You didn't even know about it.

11
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:24,943
King Horik: There is a Jarl
in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.

12
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:28,527
He continues to claim he has legal
rights over some of my land.

13
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:31,178
And now, once again,
he's making threatening noises.

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,673
How can I be of help?

15
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,155
Travel to Gotaland
as my emissary?

16
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:37,420
I shall be forever
in your debt.

17
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,015
Please stay.

How can you make peace,
Jarl Borg,

if you insist on
humiliating him?

Jarl Borg:
If I invade and defeat him,

will he not be
even more humiliated?

59
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:28,109
Ragnar:
Not if he fights well.

60
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,522
In any case,

61
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:34,670

the one who sailed west?

67
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,551

Siggy:
Go to the Seer,

85
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,548
ask if your fears
will come true.

86

It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.

87
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,775
Jarl Borg: I take it, from
what you said yesterday,

88
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,505
that King Horik is
prepared to compromise

89
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:39,830
and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,

90
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,521
which he still occupies?

91
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:43,110
He is prepared to pay you

92
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,402
to renounce your illegal claims

93
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,108
of his lands.

94
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,152
Jarl Borg: You disappoint
me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.

95
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,179
I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.

96
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,568
- If you would just name your price.
- Jarl Borg: The land is priceless,

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,856
which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.

98
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,958
Rollo: Every piece
of land has a price,

99
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,609
just like every human.

100
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,321
Jarl Borg:
Well, you don't understand.

101
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:07,430
This is not a small plot of land on
which to grow turnips and onions.

102
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:09,535
We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,

103
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,646
and on this land,
in the earth, are minerals,

104
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,483
things of great value.

105
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,560
Why else would I assert
my claim?

106
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,780
Ragnar:
King Horik resists your claim,

107
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:21,705
but still, in good faith,

108
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,803
he is willing
to settle with you.

109
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,447
Rollo: If you will name
a reasonable price.

110
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,700
At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.

111
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,160
(Borg's men laugh)

112

Ragnar: Well then,

113
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:38,691
it seems I am done.

114
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:41,553
Jarl Borg: Hold on, please,
sit down, sit down.

115
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,556
Let's see if we can find
another way.

116
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,456
What do you have in mind?

117
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,401
What if my claim
was acknowledged

118
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,944
but I was willing to lease the land
back to the king during his lifetime?

119
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,927
Or what if we deferred judgment
on ownership,

120
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,499
but shared the mineral rights?

121
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,394
What do you say,

122
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,607
can we start negotiating
in this manner?

123
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,125
(Cutlery clatters,
Rollo claps Ragnar on the back)

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,308
Why not?

125
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:14,494
Ragnar: I have not been
given the authority to...

126
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:17,874
negotiate in this manner.

127
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:21,459
You mean King Horik sent you
here with nothing but a demand?

128
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,776
And yet he speaks of peace!

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,242
I don't know
what is in his mind.

130
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:29,287
Jarl Borg: Well then,
maybe you should ask him.

131
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,502
(Borg's men laugh)

132
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,697
Jarl Borg:
Let me make a suggestion:

133
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,241
Why don't you send
one of your men back

134
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,173
so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy.

135
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:43,012
If you think that will work.

136
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:45,814
Jarl Borg: Good. Your messenger
will take several days.

137
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:50,312
So, in the meantime, why don't you and
your men go and visit our famous ash tree?

138
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:53,812
It is famous not only for its size but
because it never loses its leaves,

139
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,726
summer or winter.

140
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,580
Some people even say
it's Yggdrasil,

141
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,729
the tree that holds up the sky.

142
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:03,091
And I will provide you
an escort.

143
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,186
I only have one,
very small request.

144
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,388
I would like one of your men to stay
behind here as a kind of security.

145
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,345
You understand, I hope?

146
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,788
(Swishes drink through teeth)

147

Bjorn:
So how long must we travel?

154
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,962
Guide: It can take us three
days to reach the tree.

155
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,775
It looks like rain.

156
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,392
Come.

157
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,936

Why have you come?

159
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:11,599
Lagertha:
I am frightened for my husband.

160
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,399
Seer: Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?

161

I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.

162
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,659
What happens in your dreams?

163
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:25,917
Lagertha: Dark shapes
come to me at night.

164
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:28,719
Monstrous forms.

165
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,781
When I wake,

166
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,940
they skulk in the shadows,
shapeless,

167
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:37,193
but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.

168
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:39,174
Seer:
Ah, yes.

169
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,816
The shadows come from
hell's hall.

170
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,584
No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.

171
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:49,514
Lagertha:
What is it that they want?

172
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:52,543
To take something from you.

173
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,899
My life?

174
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:58,268
Seer: No, something far more
important to you than that.

175
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,597
My husband's life?

176
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:02,494
(Sighs)

177
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,411
Tell me.

178
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,070
Seer: Why must you
all force me up

179
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,760
and unearth me to sorrows?

180
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,859
Your husband is in danger,

181
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,709
but not for his life.

182
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,041
He is in danger
from the magical world.

183
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:23,648
How?

184
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,304
(Sighs)

185
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:28,672
Answer me.

186
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:32,649
Seer: I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!

187
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,679
(Twig snaps)

188
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,931
So, Rollo,

189
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,047
how do you get on
with your brother?

190
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,910
We get along fine.

191
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,392
Why shouldn't we?

192
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,433
No reason.

193
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,621
But not all brothers
get on so well.

194
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:11,702
I know that
from personal experience.

195
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,137
What do you mean?

196
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:16,913
I too had a brother.

197
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,150
I loved him.

198
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,927
We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.

199
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,840
We fought together
in the shield-wall.

200
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,996
We shared the same women.

201
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:32,779
When my father was killed, there was
fierce competition to replace him as jarl.

202
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,627
And although
I was his eldest son

203
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:37,744
I was not sure
I was going to succeed.

204
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,803
However, I was elected
at the thing.

205
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:42,012
We had a feast to celebrate.

206
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,068
My wife was there...

207
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,974
my young, beautiful wife -

208
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,572
we'd just gotten married -

209
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:53,423
and all the others who had stood
for election against me.

210
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:58,599
My brother poisoned them...

211
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,920
all.

212
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,636
I only survived because...

213
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,716
my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from

214
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,828
and drained it herself
in celebration.

215
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,264
I will never forget
her screams.

216
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,933
It's my wife's screams that will
haunt me for the rest of my life.

217
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,574
My brother denied
responsibility,

218
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,646
but his guilt was too obvious.

219
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:30,524
So I blinded him
with my own hands,

220
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,996
and then I burned him alive.

221
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,787
That's what I know about
the love between brothers.

222
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,115
(Fire crackles)

223
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:46,261
Ragnar...

224
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,391
would never do such a thing.

225
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,447
Of course not.

226
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:53,692
No, your brother is different.

227
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,678
Your brother's a great man,

228
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,746
a great warrior.

229
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,413
As am I.

230
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:07,131
I'm sure you are.

231
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:10,510
And yet I've never heard
of you.

232
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,098
(Retreating footsteps)

233
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,822
(Rushing water)

234
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,403
Nils:
Whoa...

235
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,897
Our camp is set up over here.

236
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:27,643
There's some excellent fishing,
upstream, under the waterfall.

237
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,356
I will go.

238
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,449
And I also,

239
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,530
for everybody knows...

240
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,465
- Three eyes are be.
- Ugh!

241
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,865
(Horses splash through water)

242
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,929
(Rushing water)

243
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,600
(Rushing water)

244
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,963
(Water splashes lightly
and drips)

245
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:20,014
Servant 1:
You! Look away!

246
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,407
- Servant 2: Who are you?
- Servant 1: Look away at once!

247
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,625
What are we suppose
to be looking at?

248
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,210
Arne: I'm blind! See?!
I can't see anything!

249
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,396
(Laughing)

250
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,470
Agh!
(Blade slices)

251
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,077
Agh!

252
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,840
Arne: (Struggling grunts)
Torstein: Arne!

253
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,869
Servant 1: What? You're
going to try to kill us

254
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,057
for protecting the reputation
of our mistress?

255
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,727
Ha! Shame on you!

256
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,943
Arne: We came upon your
mistress by chance.

257
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,113
We are strangers here,

258
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,052
traveling to the great ash
tree, guests of Jarl Borg.

259
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,998
Servant 1: Jarl Borg? Then why
didn't you say so at once?

260
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:55,076
Torstein: We will just
return to our horses then.

261
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,316
You spied on me.

262
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:08,305
We meant no harm.

263
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:11,839
Servant 1: They say they
are guests of Jarl Borg.

264
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,527
Are you alone?

265
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:17,902
We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.

266
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:23,724
Then I think that Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.

267
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,975
Don't you?

268
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:32,226
Ragnar: I never knew that

269
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:35,628
fresh fish was also
packed in salt.

270
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,653
Listen, it's not our fault.

271
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:43,117
We just saw her bathing.
What were we supposed to do?

272
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,799
Fish.

273
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,215
You did not see her, Ragnar.

274
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,390
So you get your cheek slashed

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,194
and now I'm supposed
to apologize

276
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:55,822
for you two staring
at a naked body.

277
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,153
That's what she said.

278
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:01,737
Who is she, anyway, to put such
a high price on her nakedness?

279
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,449
We didn't ask.

280
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm intrigued.

281
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,221
What's so intriguing?

282
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,953
Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us

283
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,998
as some kind of test.

284
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,229
She has set me a challenge

285
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,010
and I am up to task.

286
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,109
See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,

287
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,419
than what I suspect is her wit.

288
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,862
So tell her

289
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:30,301
I invite her here to join us...

290
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,497
Neither dressed

291
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,690
nor undressed.

292
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:39,113
What else?

293
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:41,237
Neither hungry

294
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,064
nor full,

295
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,870
neither in company

296
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:48,101
nor alone.

297
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,878
Can you remember all of that,

298
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,450
one eye?

299
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,932
(Goats bleat, geese honk)

300
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,229
Siggy:
What did the Seer tell you?

301
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:02,805
He said that it's true;
That Ragnar is in danger.

302
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,563
From whom?

303
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,554
I don't know.

304
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,446
Who do you think?

305
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:21,708
(Seagulls cry outside)

306
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:27,097
I think he is in danger
from himself.

307
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,818
(Water rushes nearby,
men chatter quietly)

308
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:36,110
Man: Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?

309
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,369
Man 2:
No.

310
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:40,429
(Birds chirp,
chatter dies down)

311
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,948
Young woman: So, Earl Ragnar,

312
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:52,100
I come to you as you desired:

313
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,681
Neither dressed nor undressed,

314
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,034
neither hungry nor full,

315
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,413
neither alone...

316
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:00,438
nor yet in company.

317
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,755
Do I pass your test?

318
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,724
I owe you an apology.

319
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,707
I accept.

320
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,891
Could I offer you some,
uh, horrible salted fish?

321
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,410
I'm very tempted.

322
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,801
You can get tired
of fresh fish.

323
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,439
Come.

324
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,963
Sit, please.

325
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,438
May I ask your name?

326
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,057
My name is Aslaug.

327
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:52,601
We're on our way to see
the great ash tree.

328
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,765
Of course.

329
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,490
You are welcome to join us.

330
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:05,670
Will you come along, Aslaug?

331
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,820
(Low hum of chatter,
fire crackles)

332
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:17,590
Siggy:
(Gasps)

333
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:22,631
- Siggy, what is it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

334
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,713
Oh, I visited my cousin
a few days ago.

335
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,422
She had just buried
her young son.

336
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:34,011
Why did he die?

337
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,750
One day he was fine,
and the next he

338
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,366
caught a fever that

339
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:44,222
made him sweat and cry out in
the night, and the next day...

340
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,983
she put him in the ground.

341
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,756
(Exhales shakily)

342
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,835
(Goat bleats nearby,
baby cries)

343
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,876
Siggy:
(Exhales slowly and shakily)

344
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,890
(Baby cries)

345
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:13,848
(Slicing and chopping sounds)

346
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:18,385
(Distorted thump)

347
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:23,832
(Distorted wheezed breath)

348
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,764
(Long, slow exhale)

349
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,902
(Labored breath)

350
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,807
(Breath hisses)

351
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,776
(Distorted landing thud)

352
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,630
Bjorn:
But if it is Yggdrasil,

353
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,351
then it must be the same tree

354
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,435
that Lord Odin
once hanged himself from.

355
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:56,675
Aslaug:
Why not?

356
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,132
All things are possible.

357
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:04,018
(Birds chirp)

358
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:18,156
Ragnar: "I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,

359
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:19,851
wounded by a spear,

360
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,898
dedicated to Odin,

361
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:25,254
from that tree of which
no man knows

362
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,027
from where its roots run."

363
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,874
(Doors burst open)

364
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:35,232
(People coughing)

365
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,984
(Labored whisper)
No, please...

366
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,388
Look after my daughter...

367
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,217
First.

368
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,243
Athelstan:
It's all right.

369
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:53,474
(Wheezing)

370
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,980
(Coughing)

371
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:11,613
(Men chatter and laugh)

372
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,483
Arne: (Sighs drunkenly)

373
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:16,789
What's wrong, boy?

374
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,084
What do you think?

375
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:20,844
My father is making
a fool of himself.

376
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,301
Arne: He's enjoying himself in the
company of a beautiful woman.

377
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,081
What's foolish about that?

378
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,003
Some day you'll do
the same thing.

379
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:29,889
If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.

380
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:30,874
Arne: (Laughs)

381
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:33,014
Then it's a good
thing she's not.

382
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:35,290
Listen to me, my friend.

383
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:37,751
Your father and mother
are a famous couple.

384
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:40,908
They love each other.
Everybody knows that.

385
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:44,151
So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?

386
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,483
(Claps Bjorn on the back,
laughs heartily)

387
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:56,140
(Ragnar and Aslaug
murmur quietly)

388
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:03,274
(Flames crackle)

389
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,544
(Approaching footsteps)

390
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,455
(Ale pours from pitcher)

391
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,567
Jarl Borg: I trust all
is to your satisfaction.

392
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,744
You feed me very well.

393
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,097
Jarl Borg:
You're an important guest.

394
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:22,371
We would like to keep you entertained
until your brother returns.

395
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:26,890
You always talk
about my brother.

396
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,907
What choice do I have?

397
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,250
He is your earl.

398
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:33,184
(Sighs, annoyed)

399
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,932
Which one would you like
tonight?

400
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,687
Why don't you take
both of them?

401
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,965
I don't need to be bribed
with women.

402
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,225
What is it you want, Rollo?

403
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:57,644
What is it you really want?

404
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:04,317
(Thunder of galloping hooves)

405
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:07,682
Floki:
Fenrir, the giant wolf,

406
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:11,389
could not be constrained
by any means known to man,

407
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:15,410
so the dwarves forged a chain,

408
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,756
but not from metal.

409
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,542
Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,

410
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,839
so they forged it
from the things we cannot see

411
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:27,666
and the things we cannot hear.

412
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:30,230
Like the breath of a fish...

413
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,215
the sound a moving cat makes.

414
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,933
The roots...

415
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:37,101
of a mountain.

416
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:38,221
You know?

417
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:39,846
(Laughs)

418
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,802
Of course I know!

419
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,222
These things interest me!

420
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,062
(Horse whinnies nearby)

421
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:49,464
I came to ask about Jarl Borg.

422
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:52,313
He won't sell.

423
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:54,442
He wants to make a deal.

424
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,207
King Horik:
I'm not interested in deals.

425
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,282
That would make it hard
for Ragnar.

426
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:04,475
King Horik: Ragnar will come
to the right conclusion,

427
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:06,604
and make the right decision.

428
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:09,884
Don't you care
if the negotiations fail?

429
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,744
(Non-committal)
Mm...

430
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:13,008
(Gasps)

431
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,759
Look!

432
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:25,050
(Rain patters)

433
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,546
(Water pours)

434
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:33,307
(Coughs and gasps)

435
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:43,107
(People cough and wheeze)

436
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:50,931
(Water drips
as Lagertha wrings out a cloth)

437
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:53,389
(Weakly)
I am going to die.

438
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:55,964
No,

439
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:58,008
you are not going to die.

440
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:01,680
The Seer might think that he
is the only one in Kattegat

441
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,861
with the gift of prophecy,

442
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,716
but he's wrong,

443
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:09,665
and I know you are not
going to die.

444
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,726
(Coughing and wheezing)

445
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:18,706
Aslaug: I should tell you the
truth about who I really am.

446
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:23,104
I am Princess Aslaug.

447
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,908
My mother was
the shield-maiden Brunhilde.

448
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:33,512
Everyone knows the
renown of your mother.

449
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,777
But I am not her.

450
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:39,300
I am myself.

451
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:42,504
Both my parents are dead now,

452
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:44,957
and I did not know them anyway.

453
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,712
Why did you come along with me?

454
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,187
Because I had no choice.

455
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:51,968
Hmm...

456
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,612
(Kissing)

457
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,753
Why did you do that?

458
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:09,004
Because I had no choice.

459
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:16,958
(Men snore softly)

460
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:33,135
(Soft sighs of pleasure)

461
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:46,153
(Kissing,
sighing with pleasure)

462
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:59,685
(Birds chirping)

463
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:02,254
(Horse nickers)

464
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,075
Bjorn:
I hate you.

465
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:06,904
It's disgusting.

466
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,169
I could not help myself.

467
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:12,216
Shall I tell that to Lagertha,

468
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:13,343
your wife?

469
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,075
If you want to.

470
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:19,503
You cannot love her that much
after all,

471
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,984
no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.

472
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:25,601
I don't care what people think.

473
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:28,809
Of course I love your mother.

474
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,718
(Men chatter quietly)

475
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:39,273
Bjorn: Swear to me that
it will not happen again.

476
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:49,233
I swear to you
it won't happen again.

477
00:28:58,074 --> 00:28:59,808
I love you.
(Swift kiss)

478
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,841
Now, go play.

479
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:08,955
(Chuckles)

480
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,261
(Bird chirps)

481
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:17,594
Man:
(Coughing violently)

482
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,435
(Coughing)

483
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:27,712
(Harness jingles, goats bleat)

484
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:31,716
(Chickens cluck)

485
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,333
Unnngh!

486
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:40,023
(Wagon rattles
as it trundles away)

487
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:46,431
(People coughing and wheezing)

488
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,079
Siggy: (Screaming hysterically)
No!

489
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:57,568
(Wailing)
No!

490
00:29:58,236 --> 00:30:00,671
(Wailing)
