<i>Narrator: Previously on TURN:

2
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:04,922
This was torn from the loyal
exchequer's balance ledger.

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,931
This seal must reach Versailles.

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:09,113
I will depart from camp at once.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,124
(heavy breathing)

6
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:15,447
Fierce word to King George that
I would kill who ever saw this.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,785
You wanted to be caught.

Male voice: You haven't learned a thing.

9
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,170
If we get Hewlett back from Setauket
he can release Abe from prison.

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,480
I'll finish Hewlett.

11
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,347
Happy New Year major.

Caleb: <i>Tracks lead south.</i>

19
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,211
15, maybe 20 men.

20
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,685
But it don't look like
regular army to me, you know?

21
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,296
Tallmadge. They went south.

22
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,301
Yeah, well, it doesn't
matter. We were too late.

23
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:17,646
We were late? No, we were lucky.

24
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:20,121
What, you wanted to turn
up in time for all of this?

25
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,056
The Lord's watching out for us, Ben.

26
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:26,198
It's like that word your
father used to preach about.

27
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,799
What's that word?

28
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,371
- Providence.
- Yeah, providence.

29
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:31,640
Look at that.

30
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,882
I found that on the lieutenant there.

31
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,753
Turns out Washington decided
to pardon Hewlett after all,

32
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,595
but the day before these
poor bastards executed him.

33
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,369
And in doing so they've all but signed

34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,142
the execution order for Abraham in New York.

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,916
God, huh? God's watching?

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,291
- He's laughing at us.
- Hey, Abe isn't dead yet, all right?

37
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:55,802
Without Hewlett's word, Abe will hang.

38
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,083
- Three days.
- What?

39
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,223
It'll take three days for news of
this to reach New York at least.

40
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:08,695
- Yeah, so?
- So we've got three whole days to get into the city,

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,765
break Woody out of jail, and
haul his ass back to safety.

42
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,334
- <i> Yeah, three whole days.</i>
- That's right.

43
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,870
Because it only took us three
months to properly infiltrate

44
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:17,774
a man onto the island in
the first place, right?

45
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah. Well, that was your
plan. This one's mine.

53

There ain't a living creature out there.

<i>Ain't no creature 'cept us.</i>

We're sailing on to Oyster Bay

58
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,423
with orders from Major John André

59
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,156
to hunt down some hidden rebels there.

60
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,895
- Sir?
- Hewlett's no frontiersman.

61
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,263
He could never have
eluded us in good health.

Ben: <i>I thought that Sackett moved</i>

00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:53,279
-<i> all of his devices to Valley Forge.</i> 
- Mostly did.

80
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:55,281
But not all his treasures
could fit in his wagon.

81
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,447
Including...

82
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,017
our way into New York Harbor.

83
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,318
- My God, is this...
- Yeah.

84
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,451
Davey Bushnell's underwater machine.

85
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,318
The Turtle, he calls it.

86
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,551
The Turtle?

87
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,588
I knew Bushnell at Yale.

88
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,290
I can't recall much about the man

89
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,057
other than stories that he exploded

90
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,757
kegs of gunpowder on the Mill River.

91
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,258
Like the one you're touching now?

92
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,693
150 pounds of powder fired by a gunlock.

93
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,362
You see, you yank that there

94
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,232
and then a watchwork timer,
it ignites the magazine.

95
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:33,568
Then you got 10 minutes to
row away before it goes boom.

96
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:36,335
My God.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,472
I thought that Sackett wouldn't
let you touch this thing.

98
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,141
Let's just say I grew on the bastard.

99
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,479
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

100
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,345
How on earth do you navigate
this while underwater?

101
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,714
Ah, Ben Franklin suggested to Sackett

102
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,946
to coat the gauges with foxfire.

103
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,248
You know, from dead trees.

104

<i>So now the compass glows in the dark.</i>

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,217
And I'll be damned, Benny, but it works.

106
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:08,299
All right.

107
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,835
All right, well, I'm coming with you.

108
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,838
Sorry, but it's a one-man craft.

109
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,672
Tight as a fish's arsehole in there.

110
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,041
You can ride along on
the whaleboat if you like

111
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,909
as it tows me into harbor,
but once we get close...

112
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,577
Wait, if there's only room for one,

113
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,144
then how the hell do you get Abe back?

114
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,446
I said it was myay into New York, Ben.

115
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,249
Never said it was my way out.

116
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,718
No, Caleb, I'm sorry. I
can't let you do this alone.

117
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,786
That's all right, Benny.

118
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,787
'Cause I ain't asking your permission.

119
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,356
Our little spy ring might be done for,

120
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,957
but Abe is still alive.

121
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,093
And you know I'd do the same for you.

122
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:45,399
So let's get that bastard in the water.

123
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:50,867
This, gentlemen, will be
the last battle of the war.

124
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,195
You mean for them or for us?

125
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,130
Their ships will sail into the river
and reinforce the garrison.

126
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,161
Yes, I should hope so.

127
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,395
Our main force will
cross into Staten Island,

128
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,529
march up its eastern coast,

129
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,193
and with their fleet occupied,

130
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:08,961
you will be free to cross
the narrows into Brooklyn.

131
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,227
It's precisely what Howe
did not two years ago.

132
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:13,594
I will take a good idea
wherever it comes from.

133
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,294
He did it in August, not the dead of winter.

134
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,895
All the more reason they
won't be expecting us.

135
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:26,501
I assure you, the whole of
the king's troops in New York

136
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,204
does not exceed 3,500 men.

137
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:36,241
How did you come by this intelligence?

138
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,747
Are you certain it's accurate?

139
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:43,348
- Completely.
- ( whispers )

140
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,317
Because you risk the entire army.

141
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,887
If you're not up to leading
the men, Charles, then I will.

142
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,459
Excuse me.

143
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,039
- Your Excellency.
- Marquis.

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,211
Tell me, Lafayette, did
Albany agree with you?

145
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,045
I confess I never made it there.

146
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,146
I was summoned to Boston instead.

147
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,381
Who summoned you?

148
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,586
Conrad Gérard, the new
emissary from Versailles.

149
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,856
I hope you expressed my deep regret

150
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,859
at the loss of his predecessor

151
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,963
as well as the vital
intelligence he was carrying.

152
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,599
That was not the purpose of
the meeting, I assure you.

153
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:40,266
He wished me to convey a
message to you personally.

154
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,071
King Louis has commenced negotiations

155
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,973
with Messieurs Franklin and Adams

156
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,841
of the American delegation.

157
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,441
Negotiations?

158
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,138
A treaty of alliance between France

159
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:55,943
and the United States is imminent.

160
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:02,979
The number of regulars
taken prisoner at Saratoga,

161

According to the letter

I'm assuming it's the property of our king

stolen from his throne
room by an American spy.

What else has London told you?

Only that I'm to verify the seal
and witness you destroy it.

Well, I'd explain it to you,

will accept a letter of credit.

259

00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,201
Philadelphia

326
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,438
will soon be recovered.

327
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,207
And I wish you to serve

328
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:03,312
as military commandant of the city.

329
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,017
I've longed to drive them from the capital.

330
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,184
House by house if need be.

331
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,919
There shall be no such need.

332
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:15,992
The regulars will soon be evacuating
to New York within the week.

333
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,392
And am I to pursue them?

334
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:20,431
That task falls to the army in the field.

335
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,907
How long am I

336
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:30,512
to remain in Philadelphia?

337
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,747
How long?

338
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:34,484
Well, surely you understand my concern.

339
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,186
No, I'm afraid I don't.

340
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:39,522
This is the promotion you've long sought.

341
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,192
Who the hell am I going to fight

342
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:45,993
from behind my glorious
desk in Philadelphia?

343
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,763
You know, the French wouldn't even be here

344
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,164
if it weren't for my victory at Saratoga.

345
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:52,665
And it was<i> my</i> victory,

346
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:55,870
no matter what laurels General
Gates lays at his own feet.

347
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,036
This isn't about Gates.

348
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,603
But he's behind this, isn't he?

349
00:21:58,637 --> 00:22:00,437
Gates or Lee.

350
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,006
Or those Judases in Cgress.

351
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,610
The decision is mine.

352
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,950
You need more time to recuperate.

353
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,922
You are a commander who joins the fray

354
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,559
and engages the enemy personally.

355
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,431
If you can't lead by example,

356
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,634
your men will lose heart.

357
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:31,340
The men are mindful of my leg, sir.

358
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:33,644
But it gives them heart.

359
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:35,612
It reminds them of victory

360
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,784
and the sacrifice that victory requires.

361
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:43,158
I can fight.

362
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:45,325
Let me prove it to you.

363
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,596
And I assure you that my glory
will not detract from your own.

364
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,734
It will only enhance it.

365
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:03,677
This has nothing to do with glory.

366
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:08,685
Says the glorified.

367
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:15,893
Right, right.

368
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,761
Guard: What the devil did you sail in?

369
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,134
Well, the inventor,
he called it an Infernal.

370
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,736
And by God, was he right.

371
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,406
I sent a man for rope.

372
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,441
<i>Perhaps we'll hang you with it.</i>

373
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,042
Doubt we'll have time for all that.

374
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:30,147
What's that?

375
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:34,221
Three, two, one.

380
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,503
It's been 10 minutes by my count.

381
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:50,772
Although arithmetic was never my strong...

Yes.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

You have a visitor.

402
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,188
You're going to wish you had confessed.

403

Yates: <i>He don't look like much, sir,</i>

404

but he's a snake in the grass.

405
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,801
Thank you, Warden. I'll take it from here.

406

( Door closes )

407
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,527
Huh?

408
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,698
( Grunts )

409
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,603

00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:56,543
- Mine came off.
- ( laughs )

412
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:58,645
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,881
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

414
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,916
I'm here to save your bacon.

415
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,449
You're walking out that door today, huh?

416
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:08,051
Right through the city gates
and all the way to Valley Forge.

417
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,819
- No.
- What?

418
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:11,520
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

419
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:12,887
- I mean you have to go.
- What?

420
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,988
- You have... shh.
- No. No.

421
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,754
- What, without you?
- They still think I'm a Loyalist.

422
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,391
- I've maintained innocence and my story.
- Abe, but...

423
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:22,593
And when Hewlett gets traded
back and he writes to them,

424
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:23,894
that story will be intact.

425
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,968
- You have to go.
- Listen, Hewlett is dead.

426
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,542
What?

427
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,013
He's dead.

428
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:36,982
Are you... Are you certain?

429
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,819
Are you certain?

430
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:42,689
- I stood over his grave.
- ( sighs )

431
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:45,827
Now look, we rode out to Connecticut

432
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,497
to free him, right?

433
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,398
We did all we could.

434
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,365
Washington even wrote the man a pardon,

435
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,401
but it was too late.

436
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:56,502
Now look,

437
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,571
Culper is dead.

438
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:01,741
But you don't have to be.

439
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,542
Now let's get out of here.

440
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,579
Come on. Come on.

441
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,815
- No.
- What are you doing?

442
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,084
- Abe...
- No, no, there is still a chance.

443
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,125
Did you... did you not
hear what I just said?

444
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,227
If they were going to kill me,
they would have done it already.

445
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,631
This place, this prison is a business.

446
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:25,401
All right? Yates gets a stipend

447
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,037
for each person that's in here,
but it's not enough to turn a profit.

448
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:30,338
So for that, he relies
on family gifts, bribes.

449
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:33,909
Mary, she sends provisions, cutlery,

450
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:36,146
guineas every week like clockwork.

451
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,883
So if I die, so does his revenue, all right?

452
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,523
I'm not even sure if he's told the
commissary that I'm even a spy yet.

453
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:43,992
Do you know what I had to do to get in here?

454
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,828
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't ask you to come here.

455
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:48,798
I shaved off my beard for
you, you ungrateful shite.

456
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,333
- Well, you missed a spot.
- What are you doing?

457
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:55,035
Washington pardoned Hewlett.

458
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,904
That means that he still
holds out hope for me, for us.

459
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,139
And now that the French
have joined our cause,

460
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,241
the British will relocate their
headquarters to New York.

461
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:06,840
Our operation is needed
here now more than ever.

462
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,075
Do you understand?

463
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,578
Lower the knife.

464
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,812
Now you listen to me, Woodhull.

465
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,650
If you do make it out of here
Tory bona fides and all,

466
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:23,089
there is no way Samuel Culper can
skulk around in New York in the future.

467
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,657
That's why we need a man here.

468
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,659
I've already told Ben about him.

469
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,429
- What, Townsley?
- Townsend.

470
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,831
His name's Townsend. He owns
a boardinghouse in the Bowery.

471
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,732
I left my bag there before I was arrested.

472
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,601
- All right, slow down.
- Hidden in the bottom of it is a vial of invisible ink.

473
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,102
You need to get that ink to him.

474
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,102
You need to show him how to use it.

475
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,206
What if he doesn't take it?

476
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,975
You're gonna have to convince him.

477
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,510
But I know this man.

478
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,946
He is the answer to our problem.

479
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,350
And Culper is not dead.

480
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,052
Neither is our ring.

481
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,122
It's just not completed yet.

482
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,106

00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:26,789

me this entire day, Mrs. Woodhull.

485
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,725
It was no trouble.

486
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,225
How do you feel?

487
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,159
Oh, wretched.

488
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:37,358
But I no longer despair.

489
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:46,693
I never thought to have a roof over me.

490
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:49,265
Never sleep in my own bed.

491
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,632
It's good to be home.

492
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:59,403
Richard.

493
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:01,905
Glad to see you, old friend.

494
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,474
I'm so sorry that you got
caught up in all of this, Richard.

495
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:08,805
- You and your family.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

496
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,075
We recovered from it as will you.

497
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,541
And now, if there's anything
I can do to be of service...

498
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:16,177
You already have. You've kept
the town running in my stead.

499
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:20,045
- Well, it wasn't just me.
- No doubt young Abraham was helpful, too.

500
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,952
Abraham remains in New York.

501
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,654
<i>What?</i>

502
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:29,188
I take it his studies are going well.

503
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:33,091
He's been in prison this whole time.

504
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,228
They say he's been spying.

505
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:39,198
<i>But I know that this is some
kind of misunderstanding.</i>

506
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,100
Indeed there is, Mrs. Woodhull.

507
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,167
He was operating under my sanction.

508
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,136
Have you not communicated
with the authorities, Richard?

509
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,473
As a father, I feared my testimony

510
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,708
would be perceived as biased.

511
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:57,178
Fortunately the major has no such bias.

512
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,446
I will write to his jailers

513
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,050
and order them to release him.

514
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:06,750
But there is another matter
that I must attend to first

515
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,454
now that I've recovered some strength.

516
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:20,130
<i>- ( Carriage wheels rattling )
- ( horse neighs )</i>

517
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,198
I was thinking of taking some
of Mr. Franklin's inventions

518
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,364
<i>as mementos from my time here.</i>

519
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:30,433
Is that really necessary, John?

520
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:33,903
What better memento could you
have of this place than a wife?

521
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:40,980
Something the matter?

522
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:44,380
Not for me. It's for General Arnold.

523
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:46,514
I would think he'd be
crowing about the French.

524
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,182
To the contrary. He seems melancholic.

525
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,585
"I do not relish the coming of spring.

526
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,956
<i>I would prefer the hardships of the field</i>

527
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,656
<i>to the comforts of the city.</i>

528
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,522
Yet if glory is beyond my grasp,

529
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:01,161
my sole consolation will be
to resume our acquaintance

530
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:04,933
and cast my eyes upon you on a daily basis."

531
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,143
They're giving him Philadelphia.

532
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:19,412
He's coming here?

533
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,355
John, what's wrong?

534
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:27,953
This could be a blessing in disguise.

535
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,857
Margaret...

536
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,459
Why are you calling me that?

537
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:41,138
I need you to remain here.

538
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:44,977
To befriend Arnold and
make an introduction to me.

539
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:47,612
Remain here?

540
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,284
I... I thought we were going to be together.

541
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:51,918
We shall be.

542
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:54,188
And with the blessing of your father.

543
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:57,490
<i>The man who contrives the
defection of Arnold will be lauded,</i>

544
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:59,524
hailed as the savior of the colonies.

545
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:01,489
I'll be given land and title,

546
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:04,191
all the things your father thinks I lack.

547
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:09,226
What if Benedict Arnold
doesn't want my friendship?

548
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,928
I suppose there's a first
time for everything.

549
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:13,431
I mean, what if he wants something more?

550
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,899
Peggy, you are an expert

551
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:19,870
in the art of fending off an ardent suitor.

552
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,903
And you can look to your father for help.

553
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,537
If he found my pedigree lacking,

554
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:27,074
I can only imagine what he would
think of an apothecary's son.

555
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,584
Peggy...

556
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,854
don't you understand?

557
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,193
We wouldn't have to elope.

558
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,165
Make me a man you can marry

559
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,432
and your father will give me your hand.

560
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,825
Planning to sketch me?

561
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,660
Trying to commit you to memory.

562
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:18,994
You have drawings of me, but I
have nothing to remember you by.

563
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,983
My great-great-grandmother
was forbidden to marry

564
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,885
the man she loved, yet
they ended up together.

565
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,754
Then there is precedent.

566
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:49,190
She wed him in secret.

567
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,625
They were Quakers.

568
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:53,060
They didn't require a
meetinghouse or a clergyman,

569
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:57,435
just a simple vow such as we are married.

570
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,604
And it wouldn't matter that
there were no witnesses,

571
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:02,572
- for the only ones needed to be...
- We are married.

572
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,446
If you'll have me, that is.

573
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:13,016
Yes, we are married.

574
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,009

<i>( silverware clinking )</i>

580
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,762
I've just returned from a long journey.

581
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,465
I'm in need of a drink.

582
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,140
Where is the major?

583
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,809
Perhaps you should be seated.

584
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,080
He didn't return?

585
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:34,252
I did my best, Mrs. Strong.

586
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,521
The brutes murdered
Hewlett before we arrived.

587
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,457
- ( Crying )
- My sole consolation

588
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,862
was meting out the same rough
treatment they'd given him.

589
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,867
I even sustained this wound.

590
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,736
( Sobbing )

591
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,546
I'm here to console you

592
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,416
if you so require.

593
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,550
You're not alone.

594
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,454
Good evening, Mrs. Strong.

595
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:12,929
I thought you were lost.

596
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:15,462
I feared for you, too.

597
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,804
Major.

598
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:26,407
- This is...
- Somewhat of a surprise?

599
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:32,411
I did everything I could to rescue you,

600
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:34,615
as my men will attest.

601
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,656
I have no doubt of it.

602
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,827
But I outwitted the rebels

603
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:45,529
and escaped.

604
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,765
Were you injured, Captain?

605
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:51,470
Was it the young rebel lieutenant?

606
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,274
An adversary of no consequence.

607
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,743
Hmm.

608
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:59,316
Well, it is a pity that
you sustained an injury.

609
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:03,621
I do hope that it didn't cut too deeply.

610
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:14,663
Mrs. Strong, I have come to
escort you back to Whitehall.

611
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:18,233
That is, if you are ready to travel.

612
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:20,168
