that night you asked for
a table for one, not two.

1288
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:58,175
I have nothing more to add
to my original statement.

1289
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:02,682
Nothing?

1290
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,984
You know I didn't kill him.

1291
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,290
There's a war on.

Ask another girl.

1295
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,515
I don't want another girl.

1296
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,477
Will you come back now, Phuong?

1297
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,288
- Will you come back to me?
- To London?

1298

No. Not to London.

1299
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:32,728
Then I don't come back.

Please, I...

I can't take you to London...

Yes.

Yes.

I'm sorry.

Why are you sorry?

I don't know.

I ought to apologize
to someone.
