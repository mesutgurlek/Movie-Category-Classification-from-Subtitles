(reciting story)

3
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,249
(Dutch) It's cold.

4
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,860
Lotte, Lotte, Lotte.

5
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,749
The Twins

6
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,108
(giggling)

7
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,942
(chanting) Catch it, Anna.

8
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,176
~ Dear little sister, dance with me

9
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,345
~ Take both your little hands

10
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,015
~ One time back, one time forth

11
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,492
~ Turn around and then it's done

12
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,190
~ Now give me your right hand

13
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,427
~ And we dance very gallantly

14
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,800
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet

15
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,170
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other

16
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,222
(father, in German) It's time.

17
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:13,700
(whispering) You have no right. I am
a cousin. You have absolutely no right.

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,970
I'm family too, aren't I?
They're better off with us.

19
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,802
- (coughing)
- I'm not trying to be difficult, but...

20
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,849
So many nice things.
Music, a big house...

21
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:29,148
Aren't we good enough?
Not posh enough? Are you any better?

22
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,711
<i>(coughing)</i>

23
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,933
They will have
every opportunity with us.

24
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:49,099
Be honest. I'm not saying that
we're any better than you, but really...

25
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,257
(minister)
... in Thee find eternal happiness.

26
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:21,169
Lord, grant the deceased eternal peace.

27
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,838
Let perpetual light shine on him.

28
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:30,708
Lord, grant him eternal rest. Amen.

29

<i>(coughing)</i>

30
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,145
You can have the sick one.
Just the sick one. Final offer.

31
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,451
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

32
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,825
dust to dust, in sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection.

33
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,694
It's a disgrace.
Twins belong together.

34
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:52,726
Be quiet, Ferdinand. We'll go along with it.
Everyone will get something.

35
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,915
Let me go!

36
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,421
Anna!

37
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,388
Lotte!

38
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,119
Anna!

39
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,626
- Anna!
- Lotte!

40
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,132
- Bonjour, Madame.
- Bonjour.

41
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,943
(Dutch) Not bad, eh, Jet?

42
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,180
It turns with the sun.

43
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,089
No Swiss sanatorium could match it.

44
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,056
For you.

45
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,821
For you.

46
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,694
We're going to get Lotte well again.

47
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,067
Lotte is going to be well cared for
in her new country.

48
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,705
(German) Go on.

49
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,275
Come.

50
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,249
- When is Lotte coming?
- When you've finished.

51
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,692
Start at the front.

52
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,266
Not all in one go.

53
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,706
Lotte won't be coming.
She has consumption. So that's that.

54
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,039
<i>(coughing)</i>

55
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:27,175
Look, this is my mummy.
She's not alive anymore.

56
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,119
Just like your mummy.

57
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,123
And now I'm your new mummy.

58
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,682
Give me that handkerchief.

59
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,859
You know these words, don't you?
Handkerchief? Mummy?

60
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,898
Say "mummy".
They are Dutch words. Say it.

61
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,966
<i>(coughing)</i>

62
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,413

<i>(Coughs)</i>

64
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:39,316
Dear Lotte, when are you coming?

65
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,050
- What are you writing?
- A letter.

66
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,756
- To whom?
- Lotte.

67
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,495
- And where will you send it to?
- Holland.

68
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,165
Do you know the address?

69
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,237
- She thinks we know the address.
- (husband chuckles)

70
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,306
No, no, no.

71
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,578
We don't have the address either.

72
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:13,180
They don't want us to know it.
Afraid we'll drop by.

73
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,317
Stuck-up lot.

74
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,995
Maybe Lotte will write to you.

75
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,167
(wife) If she's still alive.

76
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,937
(Dutch) Dear Anna.

77
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,610
Tomorrow I will get on the train
and come to you.

78
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,416
Tomorrow I will be with you again.

79
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,125
You'll never guess
what delicious things I have.

80
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,290
That's good.
Write a nice letter to your sister.

81
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,501
Later. After your meal.

82
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,570
Dinand? We have to decide now.

83
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,010
Do we send it?

84
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,917
And then?

85
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,451
She'll want to go there
when she's better.

86
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,792
And then they'll keep her.

87
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:34,762
- I can't bear to see it.
- They're barbarians, Jetje.

88
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,242
Stupid farmers.

89
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,945
Stupid, Catholic farmers.
Do you want her to grow up there?

90
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,350
No.

91
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,119
She has to forget Anna.

92
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,960
Believe me, Jetje.

93
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,397
For her own good.

94
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,765
She simply has to forget Anna.

95
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,449
(German) Why is there no letter?

96
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,013
- Harder.
- No.

97
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,829
- Because there won't be a letter.
- Why not?

98
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,924
- I'll tell you some day. Go on.
- No.

99
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:45,107
Lotte doesn't want anything to do with you.
She thinks you're stupid and dirty.

100
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,777
And besides, she's dead.

101
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
Ach!

102
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,302
Anna! Anna!

103
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,240
- Anna!
- Sweetie...

104
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,606
(Dutch) Did something make you
call out for Anna?

105
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,745
Shall I tell you about Anna?

106
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:40,084
You understand me perfectly,
don't you? Clever little girl.

107
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,324
Anna is living with the barbarians.

108
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,093
They are really stupid people
who have no stationery.

109
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,660
And that's why there is never a letter.
But not to worry.

110
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,833
Anna is very happy with the barbarians.
She likes it there.

111
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
With all the animals.

112
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:07,579
And she wants Lotte to be happy, too.
Anna doesn't want Lotte to cry.

113
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,291
You have to go to sleep now.

114
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,200
Sleep well.

115
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,870
Sleep well.

116
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:46,017
- Is she getting milk?
- The milk is to sell.

117
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,923
And why don't I see her in school?

118
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,018
(whispers)

119
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,698
Really?

120
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,664
She doesn't seem that way to me.
In fact, she seems rather clever.

121
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,397
Anna.

122
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,336
(woman) What is it?

123
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,951
"The grace of help
is a supernatural assistance

124
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:20,989
through which God lightens
our understanding and moves us

125
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,858
to shun evil and do good."

126
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,265
- I want to go to school.
- You're coming with me.

127
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,850
- (German) Why are you here?
- My hands, you see.

128
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,599
I don't play the piano anymore.

129
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:07,535
- Both hands?
- Only the right. Arm and hand.

130
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,439
I have everything low in the kitchen.
But other than that...

131
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,499
Bonjour, Madame.

132
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,674
We just have to make the best of it.

133
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,614
I'll see you tomorrow.

134
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,450
What's wrong with you?

135
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,517
- Arthritis?
- Yes.

136
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,027
Me, too. I have that, too.

137
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:39,727
- It runs in our family.
- Oh, well. Not in mine.

138
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,134
Yes, it does.

139
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,407
It does.

140
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,179
It certainly does.

141
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,880
Lotte.

142
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,690
Anna?

143
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,327
Yes.

144
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,530
(German) Why are you looking
in the mirror?

145
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,536
Your father had consumption.

146
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,805
So did your sister.

147
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,147
And your mother had cancer.

148
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,918
But I'm still alive.

149
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,851
~ He, the most splendid of all

150
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:14,592
~ So gentle and so kind

151
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,996
~ Beautiful lips

152
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,230
(Dutch) Our Lot has been on the radio
twice already.

153
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,294
(continues singing)

154
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,534
With a choir.

155
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:31,047
~ Purposeful and determined

156
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,189
~ Like there in the blue depths

157
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:50,826
~ Bright and shiny, that star

158
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,135
~ So he is in my heaven

159
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,878
- It's not about you, you know.
- Sing, sing.

160
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,710
(resumes hesitantly)

161
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,114
Here comes Schumann.

162
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,183
(plays beautifully)

163
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,566
Third year, conservatory.
I'm a rotten player. Go on.

164
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,005
- (German) The farmer who marries you...
- Does not exist.

165
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,479
- Oh no?
- No.

166
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,955
I won't marry a farmer.
I won't be a farmer's wife.

167
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,148
(singing)

168
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,554
(Dutch) You have a beautiful voice.

169
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,861
Are you coming to the conservatory?

170
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,526
No, I'm going to study German.

171
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,234
Pity. Why? Why German?

172
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,571
I think German is a beautiful language.

173
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,043
Are you the milkman's?
You don't look like your sisters at all.

174
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,922
Yet they're sisters all the same.
Imagine.

175
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,492
You're much more beautiful.

176
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,802
(German) Please.

177
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,398
- The axle of our hay cart. Is it ready?
- Not yet.

178
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,956
What are you doing?

179
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,300
- He looks like he wants to fight.
- He does.

180
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,069
Fight for us. For all of us.

181
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,077
Against unemployment
and against poverty.

182
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,380
That man has big plans for us.

183
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,543
(Dutch) It's incredible

184
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:27,079
that this Hitler, this mudslinger,
is so successful.

185
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,585
Germany, Germany...

186
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,357
It's in the papers every day.
I'm sick of it.

187
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,989
Our Bram has just returned
from Germany.

188
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,933
- Oh really?
- Yes.

189
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,533
A born raconteur, my brother.

190
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:51,343
They said that you had to go to Germany
for proper training in violin making.

191
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,178
And?

192
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,876
He was back after fourteen days,
devastated.

193
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,819
Why?

194
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,923
Oh, I don't know...

195
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,893
I can listen to him for hours.

196
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:11,560
- Tell us, go on.
- It's just not easy to get a position there.

197
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:17,637
For Jews, he means. He was given
the cold shoulder everywhere he went.

198
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,972
We're no longer welcome there.

199
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:26,375
Oh, you shouldn't take those Nazis
too seriously, you know.

200
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,843
(German) We belong to the first class.
Did you know that?

201
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,685
Farmers belong to the first class.

202
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,521
If he succeeds, everything will be better.

203
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,894
Then you can take on a workman
and I can go to school.

204
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,994
- Who gave you this paper?
- Bernd Möller. He told me all this.

205
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,970
Bernd Möller is an idiot.

206
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,373
We are Catholics.

207
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,641
Adolf Hitler is fighting for us.
It says so there.

208
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,978
You'll get a workman, I'll go to school.

209
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:05,215
- Never let me catch you near that boy.
- Why? I only want to go to school.

210
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,020
Never let me catch you
near that bastard, you hear me?

211
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:14,894
So that's how they do it.
Enlisting young people.

212
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:20,528
Idiots. Bunch of sheep!
And you're falling for this as well!

213
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,538
Never again, do you hear?

214
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,036
If I ever catch you near that stupid ass...

215
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,575
Let them talk, ignorant farmers.

216
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,926
Your uncle is an ignorant farmer.

217
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,864
Obedient Catholics.
They don't know any better.

218
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:54,768
Like animals who have lived too long in a
cage. Open the door and they stay inside.

219
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,142
What has the Church ever done for us?

220
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,873
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in filth?

221
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,177
We'll do it differently.

222
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:13,212
If there were more women like you,
we'd have the new Germany in no time.

223
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,727
(Dutch) You sit here.

224
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,596
- (German) Well, what do you think?
- Nice.

225
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,128
I've joined, Anna.

226
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,072
A new order, and I'm part of it.

227
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,770
- You should join as well.
- Yes.

228
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,980
Do you want to make me happy?

229
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,717
- And Germany? And our Fuhrer?
- I want to go to grammar school.

230
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:24,158
I'll build you a house.
With a gable roof. And shutters.

231
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,595
A Bavarian veranda.
And a solid oak door.

232
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:33,796
I have to go home. They don't know
where I am. And there's a storm coming.

233
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,277
Heinrich, come here!

234
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,918
Anna kissed him.

235
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:20,171
Would you have dared
if your father were still alive?

236
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,621
Would you?

237
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:31,323
Would you have dared if your father
were still alive? Come here, you!

238
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,835
Come here!

239
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,036
(thunder)

240
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,736
(Sobs)

241
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,964
(gasps for breath)

242
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,411
(Dutch) What's wrong?

243
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
Anna.

244
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:44,097
Separating twins - what an idea.
It's just criminal.

245
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,500
I've written so many letters.

246
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,132
Sitting up in my bed.

247
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:56,942
"Anna, where are you? Anna, write back.
Anna, Anna, Anna."

248
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,614
But she never replied.

249
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,416
I talked to her in my head.

250
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,926
They thought I was a quiet child,
but I was talking all day.

251
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,462
- Like this I can see both of you.
- Don't.

252
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,300
But which one is Anna?

253
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,837
Why don't you visit her?

254
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,906
She never gave me a sign
she was alive.

255
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,021
Shall I go with you? I'll go with you.

256
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:44,456
David, you cannot talk about this.

257
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,488
- We never talk about it at home.
- Why not?

258
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,461
I told you. Now you must forget it again.

259
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,710
(thunder)

260
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,346
Anna.

261
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,059
(German) That does it.
I'm taking you away from here.

262
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,652
(hums "Dear little sister, dance with me")

263
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,695
(Dutch)~ Dear little sister, dance with me

264
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:37,365
~ Take both your little hands

265
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:44,472
~ One time back, one time forth

266
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,913
(military band plays outside)

267
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,646
(German) That cupboard
on Monday morning, I told you.

268
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,779
The outside only.

269
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,887
- And the floor?
- I wanted to do that later.

270
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,952
Come here, girl.

271
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,992
I check everything myself, like this.

272
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,307
There can be no dust,
no dirt anywhere.

273
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,213
No rest until all the dirt is gone.

274
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,277
It's a struggle.
Dust plagues our lives.

275
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,619
Don't forget the portrait of our Fuhrer.

276
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,025
(Dutch)~ Now give me your right hand

277
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,969
~ And we dance very gallantly

278
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:46,475
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet

279
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,911
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other

280
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,884
- I can't find it. Schumann.
- Higher, I think.

281
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,687
Oh, Schumann! Schumann!

282
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,454
(whistles)
Schu-Schu-Schu-Schu-Schumann!

283
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,295
That's not very gentlemanly.

284
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,869
No, it's not.

285
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,345
What is that?

286
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,139
It's cruel.

287
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,902
All those letters.

288
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,248
My sister.

289
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:42,485
How could you?
Something so terrible.

290
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:46,957
You don't know
what you're talking about.

291
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,191
Where are her letters?

292
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,735
Or did you throw them away?

293
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,540
- No, darling. No.
- Give me those letters then.

294
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,438
No letter ever came.

295
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,003
Why not?

296
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,580
Did she know where I lived?

297
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,162
All that time she was waiting
for a letter from me?

298
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,332
Who would do such a thing?

299
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,205
Why? Explain it to me!

300
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,405
We saved you
from a bunch of illiterate barbarians.

301
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,243
Why didn't you save her then?

302
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:43,911
You were sick. And if you had visited Anna,
they would have kept you there.

303
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,481
- Your life wouldn't have been as nice!
- I would have still had my sister!

304
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:53,017
You would now both be marching
behind Mr. Hitler, waving flags!

305
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,823
(door slams)

306
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:08,165
Does she still live there?
With the barbarians?

307
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,610
Why?

308
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,579
Because I'm going to her.

309
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,858
(German) Good day, madam.

310
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,493
Hereditary Health Department.
Could we have a word?

311
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,699
According to our information,
you have a servant called Anna Bamberg.

312
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,763
May we come in?

313
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,536
What about Anna Bamberg?

314
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,645
As you know,
Anna Bamberg is mentally retarded.

315
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:52,681
- She looks quite normal, I thought.
- Yes, yes. That's not unusual.

316
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,122
But these papers leave no doubts.

317
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,117
What do you want from her?

318
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:03,757
You know the government is looking
to solve the problem of retarded people?

319
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,728
I don't understand.

320
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,000
It has been decided
that Anna Bamberg is to be sterilized.

321
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,140
Sterilized?

322
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:19,238
Such things are hereditary, madam.
Surely you know that.

323
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,243
Anna Bamberg, retarded?

324
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,049
It's right here
in the guardianship deed.

325
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,252
"Anna Bamberg, foster daughter
of Heinrich and Martha, is retarded

326
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,023
and too delicate of health
to be educated."

327
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,089
"She is so weak..."

328
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:41,159
That they had to keep her home
from school. And so on.

329
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,337
Read for yourself.

330
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,586
He was paid?

331
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,509
She's right in front of you,
Anna Bamberg.

332
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,272
I'm that delicate, retarded girl.

333
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:30,012
I could read and write
when I was six years old.

334
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,453
My uncle kept me home
to work for him for free.

335
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:38,984
He allowed his wife to terrorize me,
he beat me up. And no one...

336
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:44,689
No one ever came to check
whether what he'd written was true.

337
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:50,467
And now you're going to sterilize me?
I've had quite enough of this. Out.

338
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,938
- Excuse us.
- Get out!

339
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
(pottery smashes)

340
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:29,234
Don't you worry.
I won't break any more of your vases.

341
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,820
You know what your problem is?

342
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,561
You have ideas above your station.

343
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,459
- Good luck.
- You're a servant and you always will be.

344
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,167
Anna!

345
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,556
(Lotte) My dear sister.

346
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,361
This is my first letter to you,
but also my hundredth.

347
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,495
I'm writing this with thumping heart,
because I think, dear Anna,

348
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,565
that we will see each other again soon.
I have found you.

349
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,707
(Anna) So you're still alive. Lotte...

350
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,980
What a surprise. I've asked myself
so often why you didn't write.

351
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,748
We were both lied to.

352
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,420
Your letter took five weeks to get here.

353
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,727
<i>Dear Anna, do you know
where you're going yet?</i>

354
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:02,635
<i>I'm tutoring in German. I have nearly
enough for the trip. Will you write to me?</i>

355
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:08,476
<i>(Anna) Dear Lotte. Your fetter
came yesterday, after eight weeks.</i>

356
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,274
It was opened at Customs.

357
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,578
I have a new position,
near Cologne, with a countess.

358
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,814
We live in a villa with a swimming pool.
Can you imagine?

359
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:23,882
The countess is beautiful. And she smells
so nice, of powder and cigarettes.

360
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,723
Are you coming soon?

361
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,327
(Dutch) I've gone ahead and bought one.

362
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,148
(train whistle)

363
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,863
Lotte!

364
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,767
Anna.

365
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,827
(German) Do you remember me?

366
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,870
Everything-

367
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:00,914
Your eyebrows... Everything.

368
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,882
Your eyes.

369
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,113
Daddy's eyes.

370
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,992
This car belongs to the countess.

371
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,997
Everyone else's cars
are commandeered.

372
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,090
- Nice car.
- Mm-hm.

373
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,447
You can only stay one night.

374
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,629
I couldn't reach you.
Everything has changed again.

375
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,463
We're heading east.
The countess is afraid.

376
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,697
Afraid that the English
will start bombing us.

377
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,465
Thank you, Gunther.

378
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:47,817
There she is. Charlotte von Garlitz
Dublow, Countess of Falkenau.

379
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:52,156
They have an old castle on the Oder.
That's where we're going.

380
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,827
Beautiful, isn't she?

381
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,070
(sighs)

382
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,819
- Is this all right?
- Yes.

383
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,793
Yes.

384
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,994
When do you have to leave?

385
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,962
Tomorrow morning.

386
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,199
The countess can't do without me.

387
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,404
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Pity. The war...

388
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,478
(bell rings)

389
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,521
I have to go downstairs.

390
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,088
What about me?

391
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,564
Can I come? I'll help you.

392
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:14,539
Why not? You'll find out
what a proper maid's life is like.

393
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:19,011
You're like a board.
As straight as an arrow.

394
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,447
(giggling)

395
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,610
- Thanks.
- Not too tight?

396
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,676
(giggling)

397
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:51,304
- Why are they here?
- They're on leave. Guests of the count.

398
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,847
Come on.

399
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,917
I don't know what it's like there
or how long we'll stay.

400
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,580
It's mad. We're taking everything with us.

401
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,853
The whole family is dining here.
Plus spouses and children.

402
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,885
The officers, the guests...

403
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,989
Let me think. Who is sewing?

404
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,968
- We used to have the same glasses.
- Hannele and I. And Lotte.

405
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,165
Hermann will pour the wine.
Did we have crystal?

406
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:22,142
No, in Holland.
At my mother and father's house.

407
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,810
Anna, the silverware. We can't find it.
Has it been packed?

408
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,410
Madam, this is my sister.

409
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,980
Not now, darling.
Silverware. Come, rescue me.

410
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,163
What's it like, university?

411
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,700
Oh, nice.

412
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,260
But I don't study enough.

413
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,763
I much prefer singing.

414
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,977
I've got an accompanist
at the moment.

415
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,811
I can play, but he's much better.

416
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,341
Do you still play the piano?

417
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,116
A... very nice boy.

418
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,355
Do you want to know a secret?

419
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,661
We're going to get engaged.

420
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,361
Anna, dear Anna.
What would I do without you?

421
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,971
Engaged? Really? Tell me about it.

422
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,709
When are you finished?

423
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,773
(swing music)

424
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,080
Is it the champagne,
or are there more maids here?

425
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,850
(drunken singing)

426
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:31,132
~ Jews live shamelessly
in our German fatherland

427
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:38,578
~ Soldiers, comrades,
put the Jews against the wall

428
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:45,951
~ When the soldier goes into battle
he is in high spirits

429
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:52,858
~ With the Jew's blood dripping
from his knife, things look even better

430
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,625
~ For we are going into battle

431
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,633
~ For we are going into battle

432
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:04,866
~ Against England, England

433
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:09,343
Our side has suffered the first casualty!

434
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,073
(Lotte sighs)

435
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:16,481
This is the hardest I've ever worked.

436
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,586
Do you want to stay here?

437
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,919
Why?

438
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:34,264
You can come with me to Holland.

439
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,305
There is no war there.

440
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,275
And I'm sure my... mother
would be pleased.

441
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,076
Go with you to Holland?

442
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,537
I don't have anything for you.

443
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,397
That many?

444
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:06,259
You don't have to read them now.
Silly children's letters.

445
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,933
If I had received all those letters...

446
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,414
Remember this?

447
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,495
Mum's.

448
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,264
Now you can have it for a while.

449
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:59,041
- She couldn't embroider.
- (gunshots, shouting)

450
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,104
(men laughing)

451
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,476
(lambs bleating)

452
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,098
What are they doing?

453
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:25,765
- Why are they doing that?
- They've gone mad.

454
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:34,147
Anna, you have to leave.
You can't stay here.

455
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:39,153
Come with me.
Come with me to Holland.

456
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,020
Please.

457
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,252
Why not?

458
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:53,699
I can't abandon the countess right now.
She was so kind to me.

459
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:08,480
Two weeks. Three, at the most.
Until we settle in there. Then I'll come.

460
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,916
Two weeks...

461
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:19,024
I don't understand.
I couldn't stick it here for another day.

462
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,025
(exchange of greetings)

463
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,838
Until we've settled in.
Then I'll come.

464
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,610
Why can't you decide for yourself?

465
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,380
Forty-five rooms.
She doesn't know what to do.

466
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:50,391
It's not up to that woman.
It's your life.

467
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:55,226
Three weeks.
Then I'll come. I promise.

468
00:55:55,285 --> 00:56:00,030
I want to meet everybody.
Your sisters. Your fiancé.

469
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,503
Want to see him?

470
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,176
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing. He's handsome.

471
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:25,490
- What was it?
- For a moment I thought he was a Jew.

472
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,528
Madam?

473
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,495
If you want me to take you to the station,
you'd better come now.

474
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,094
Safe journey.

475
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,867
See you soon.

476
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,843
Bye.

477
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,981
Bye, Lotte.

478
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,788
Bye, Lotte.

479
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,393
Bye.

480
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,390
Anna.

481
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,330
Everyone is waiting for you.

482
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,694
Lotte.

483
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,245
Lotte?

484
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,725
Lotte!

485
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,783
Lotte!

486
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,358
Lotte!

487
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,695
Lotte!

488
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,156
Lotte.

489
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:46,064
Lotte, come.
Please, Lotte. Come.

490
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:56,438
This endless running... I'm old.

491
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,914
Then don't.
I didn't ask you to run after me.

492
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:06,511
- I'm your sister. I'm alive, I exist.
- I didn't ask you for anything.

493
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:11,047
- I've looked for you, I've telephoned.
- Telephoned?

494
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,960
Yes, telephoned. I asked for you.
And then she doesn't know who I am.

495
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,225
- Who?
- Your daughter.

496
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,392
- Did you call Hester?
- Yes.

497
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:25,667
I said: Anna. Nothing. Anna Grosalie.
Nothing. Anna Bamberg. Nothing.

498
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:32,577
- She must have thought I was crazy.
- Bother my daughter? How dare you?

499
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,640
All this time you pretended
that I didn't exist.

500
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,244
But I'm alive,
and I want to talk to you.

501
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,851
Why are you bothering me?
You were gone. Why didn't you stay away?

502
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,920
Why didn't you tell anyone about me?

503
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,626
What should I have told my children?

504
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,693
Were you ashamed of me?

505
00:59:56,392 --> 01:00:01,364
- I'll walk with you and we will talk.
- I don't want to talk.

506
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,604
Then I'll talk.

507
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,680
I can't hear anything.

508
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:36,300
My God, what a pigsty.

509
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:45,549
Forty-five rooms.

510
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:49,316
You have to help me.

511
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,948
The emperor Wilhelm slept here.

512
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:01,155
You can still smell him.

513
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,635
Stuffy and sour.

514
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:13,804
I'd like to go to Holland in two weeks,
to visit my sister. Is that all right?

515
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:16,039
Of course not.

516
01:01:16,102 --> 01:01:21,176
The rooms, I don't know where
everything is. The linen and suchlike.

517
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,948
But after that
I want to go to visit my sister.

518
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:30,450
Darling, that's impossible. Then we have to
get the cellars ready for the Poles.

519
01:01:30,516 --> 01:01:33,087
- Which Poles?
- Forced labor.

520
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:38,363
Coming to replace our workers,
who have to fight in Poland. Funny, isn't it?

521
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:40,301
(Dutch) She's an anti-Semite.

522
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:43,704
Don't be silly. Just because
she thought I was a Jew?

523
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:44,764
Yes.

524
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,679
You want to know something? I am a Jew.
I look like three Jews put together.

525
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:52,842
So bring your sister over.

526
01:01:52,905 --> 01:01:58,116
I won't have anything to do
with that whole German thing.

527
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:01,181
And I'm giving up my studies, too.

528
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:09,689
(Lotte) Considering the circumstances,
I think it's better if you don't come here.

529
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:12,236
Your country is at war. Better not.

530
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,397
Anna! Anna.

531
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:20,069
We're going. Are you coming?

532
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:26,548
Something wrong with your sister?

533
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,180
I have no sister.

534
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:40,686
(~ "Beer Bane! Polka")

535
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:55,439
Do you want to dance?

536
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:03,644
Are you all right?

537
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:05,313
- Come, drink.
- No, no.

538
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:08,120
How about you?

539
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:14,154
I'm so hot, so terribly hot.
Are my cheeks really red?

540
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,530
Will you be staying long?

541
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:19,492
Yes.

542
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,061
(man) Come.

543
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:16,086
Why does she say that? "Better not."
Better for whom?

544
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:18,150
- Who said that?
- Lotte.

545
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:22,256
- First I had to come, and now I can't.
- Lotte. Is that the fat woman?

546
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:27,202
- My sister in Holland. The letter.
- Oh, your sister.

547
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:30,833
- Why not, all of a sudden?
- Why not what?

548
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:34,709
What have I done wrong?
I only want to go to her.

549
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:37,008
To Holland?

550
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:41,713
- We're twin sisters.
- Yes, twins.

551
01:04:41,774 --> 01:04:47,588
We had one of those in Czechoslovakia.
A non-commissioned artillery officer.

552
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:52,494
I won't write back. "Better not."
I've done without her all my life.

553
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:54,588
Seriously?

554
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:02,030
You were in Czechoslovakia?

555
01:05:06,899 --> 01:05:09,971
Do you look alike?

556
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:16,044
My sister knows all about music.
She's a wonderful singer. Songs by...

557
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:21,114
I don't know who.
With a pianist, that's her fiancé.

558
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,319
Can you sing?

559
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:27,455
Me neither.

560
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,593
She studies at a university.
German. My sister.

561
01:05:31,657 --> 01:05:37,573
She teaches, too. Speaks really good
German, better than me. So clever...

562
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,941
With such a nose.

563
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:45,473
And her eyes...

564
01:05:46,505 --> 01:05:50,681
- The way she sometimes looks...
- What way is that?

565
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:55,454
Exactly like our father.

566
01:05:55,514 --> 01:05:59,155
Then she doesn't need to say anything.

567
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:02,290
Neither of us says anything.

568
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:17,270
I could see her thinking. And looking.
Why would she do that?

569
01:06:17,336 --> 01:06:19,043
It's clean.

570
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:22,245
She's German herself.

571
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:31,590
What a nice handkerchief.

572
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:35,598
It's good that you've got
a handkerchief like that with you.

573
01:06:36,522 --> 01:06:38,263
(blows her nose)

574
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:49,474
- Maybe she thinks I'm stupid.
- Stupid? You?

575
01:06:49,535 --> 01:06:53,915
Impossible. Out of the question.

576
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:57,750
I'm on to you, you Ostmarker.

577
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:03,059
Or should I say Austrian?
Since you're with us now.

578
01:07:28,774 --> 01:07:31,550
Now it's dirty.

579
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:50,432
Why don't you lie down for a while?

580
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:13,127
Austrians. They're those
operetta soldiers, aren't they?

581
01:08:13,185 --> 01:08:15,756
With roses in their rifles.

582
01:08:17,523 --> 01:08:20,697
I'm a conscript.

583
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:26,072
If I had a choice,
I'd be at home in Vienna.

584
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:29,306
With a rose in my rifle.

585
01:08:32,037 --> 01:08:34,039
(laughing)

586
01:08:35,374 --> 01:08:37,445
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

587
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,512
<i>(Coughs)</i>

588
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,533
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,634
- Good?
- Yes.

590
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:00,966
Anna.

591
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,743
What's this I hear?
What have you done?

592
01:09:05,804 --> 01:09:08,944
Did you lend the beet press
to the Poles?

593
01:09:09,008 --> 01:09:12,012
Otherwise they have to do it by hand.

594
01:09:12,077 --> 01:09:16,457
Silly goose. You don't think
they'd do the same for us, do you?

595
01:09:16,515 --> 01:09:20,759
- They hate us.
- But we don't hate them.

596
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:26,459
They are subhuman.
We are the master race.

597
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,535
Shouldn't we lend them the beet press,
if we are the master race?

598
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,871
Go ahead, then. You do
what you want anyway. Bolshevik.

599
01:09:36,936 --> 01:09:38,938
Anna. Anna.

600
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:43,045
- Come.
- What is it?

601
01:09:49,682 --> 01:09:51,684
(squeals with delight)

602
01:09:57,022 --> 01:09:58,763
Listen carefully.

603
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:02,663
I wanted to see you.

604
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:06,699
I'm not allowed to leave the barracks,
so I climbed over the wall.

605
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:11,938
- It's a secret. We're marching off.
- Where to?

606
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:19,384
I don't have time. I have to go back.
If they find out...

607
01:10:19,445 --> 01:10:21,618
I just wanted to see you.

608
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,392
Where to?

609
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:29,490
I have to go back.
All leave has been canceled.

610
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:32,559
We're off, Anna. Oh, my dearest.

611
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:34,605
I'll write.

612
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,905
Will you wait for me?

613
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:55,991
When are you coming back?

614
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:16,406
Why has all leave
suddenly been canceled?

615
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:18,414
(plane overhead)

616
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,143
(Dutch official on radio) My people.

617
01:11:20,205 --> 01:11:27,851
Despite having maintained strict
neutrality during the past months,

618
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:31,554
our country was attacked last night,

619
01:11:31,617 --> 01:11:37,363
suddenly and without warning,
by the German Wehrmacht,

620
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:40,597
despite their solemn promise

621
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:46,007
that our neutrality would be respected
as long as we maintained it ourselves.

622
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,067
(planes overhead)

623
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:53,815
(Dutch) Who do they think they are?

624
01:11:53,872 --> 01:11:56,318
Bloody Huns.

625
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:07,928
Let's go.

626
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:11,129
- To do what?
- Sailing.

627
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,171
Today? It's war.

628
01:12:14,226 --> 01:12:18,697
- People are advised not to go out.
- We're going anyway.

629
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:24,546
(I breezy love song on radio)

630
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:36,893
Lotte, hold on. Stop.

631
01:12:49,061 --> 01:12:51,507
We said we would wait.

632
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:58,344
- First we get married. That's the deal.
- I don't want to wait any longer.

633
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,412
(plane overhead)

634
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:10,686
Stop. Why don't you want to wait?

635
01:13:10,749 --> 01:13:12,751
David!

636
01:13:13,752 --> 01:13:17,894
- You're mad.
- No, I'm very serious.

637
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:23,006
- We could be dead tomorrow.
- Seriously.

638
01:13:24,463 --> 01:13:28,912
I don't know. Forget it.

639
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:32,244
Forget everything.
Forget me. What does it matter?

640
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:36,810
- What's wrong with you?
- And we're not getting married either.

641
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:41,287
Don't be stupid.

642
01:13:41,847 --> 01:13:43,588
Here.

643
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:48,925
I'm breaking it off. Take it.

644
01:13:50,456 --> 01:13:52,936
OK?

645
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,565
Then don't. All the same to me.

646
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,611
- Can we go back?
- No.

647
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:04,409
Come on, I want to go now.

648
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:08,077
- Go on, then.
- Come.

649
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:14,386
Don't forget the peak halyard.

650
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:18,050
(David chuckles)

651
01:14:21,453 --> 01:14:24,024
David, come on.

652
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,835
No.

653
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:32,973
- I'm going.
- Bye.

654
01:14:33,665 --> 01:14:36,043
- Bye.
- Bye.

655
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:43,084
What's the matter, silly rabbit?

656
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:49,656
- Why don't you break it off?
- Why should I?

657
01:14:51,817 --> 01:14:54,855
Because I'm German, of course.

658
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,336
I'm German.

659
01:15:02,928 --> 01:15:07,274
You know how it is. All those refugees...

660
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:09,972
The way Germans think about Jews...

661
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:15,110
- And now they're here.
- (plane overhead)

662
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:19,747
It's war.
I'm German, and you'll hate me.

663
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:27,820
To me you're Lotte.
The girl I love so much.

664
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:31,356
The girl who sings so beautifully.
My bunny rabbit.

665
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:36,429
- Who is German.
- And who thinks she can sail.

666
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:42,472
We're Lotte and David,
and politics have nothing to do with it.

667
01:15:43,769 --> 01:15:47,376
- (protests)
- Lotte, don't.

668
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:22,779
(German) I've come for Martin Grosalie.
His training is done. He has leave today.

669
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,346
Leave has been canceled.

670
01:16:28,113 --> 01:16:30,218
What?

671
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:39,228
- They're being punished.
- What for?

672
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:44,070
They were almost done.
All they had to do was shout "Sieg Heil".

673
01:16:44,129 --> 01:16:48,942
Brand-new SS officers.
Shouldn't be a problem.

674
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:56,044
The commanding officer didn't think
it sounded enthusiastic enough.

675
01:16:59,177 --> 01:17:01,521
Do you understand?

676
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,858
Poland, Russia. Fighting, fighting...

677
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:10,366
He's been trying to get leave
for two years. He must have it now.

678
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:15,294
It was the only reason
he wanted to do this stupid training.

679
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,102
Do you think he really wanted
to be an officer?

680
01:17:18,163 --> 01:17:22,168
He doesn't give a damn
about the whole war.

681
01:17:41,153 --> 01:17:45,693
(SS officer shouts at soldiers)

682
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:46,758
- Sieg...
- (soldiers) Heil!

683
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:48,896
(repeated two more times)

684
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,409
(SS officer continues addressing soldiers)

685
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,571
- Sieg...
- Heil!

686
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:01,709
(repeated two more times)

687
01:18:01,773 --> 01:18:04,253
(SS officer shouts order)

688
01:18:06,978 --> 01:18:09,686
(SS officer shouts out the drill)

689
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:16,755
- Sieg...
- Heil!

690
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:21,032
(repeated four more times)

691
01:18:22,127 --> 01:18:24,835
(SS officer addresses soldiers)

692
01:18:24,896 --> 01:18:25,897
- Sieg...
- Heil!

693
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:28,638
(repeated three more times)

694
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:54,036
(Dutch) At least you can't throw that one
in the water.

695
01:18:57,829 --> 01:19:00,366
David, I want to become a Jew.

696
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:05,770
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

697
01:19:05,837 --> 01:19:09,842
- I want to convert.
- You'd be mad.

698
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:13,117
Why? Because of the situation?

699
01:19:13,178 --> 01:19:17,388
No, because of all the fuss.

700
01:19:27,926 --> 01:19:30,406
My silly rabbit.

701
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:49,885
My bag. I forgot my bag.

702
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:54,158
- Where?
- In the cafe. The train tickets, everything.

703
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:58,190
- You'll never make it. Seven minutes.
- Easily.

704
01:19:59,224 --> 01:20:01,226
David!

705
01:20:10,302 --> 01:20:14,011
- I'm your silly rabbit.
- And don't you forget it.

706
01:20:14,072 --> 01:20:16,143
I'm sorry.

707
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,540
Buchenwald?

708
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:35,230
Buchenwald, Buchenwald.

709
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:40,566
- What is there, Buchenwald?
- A sort of work camp, for young men.

710
01:21:41,526 --> 01:21:47,067
"I'm doing fine.
We're working hard. David."

711
01:21:47,132 --> 01:21:49,408
In German.

712
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:53,016
What is the charge? Is there a charge?

713
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:58,680
No, no. We think the Germans
wanted to set an example.

714
01:21:58,743 --> 01:22:01,223
After the strike in Amsterdam.

715
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:03,816
"Watch out, don't make trouble."

716
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:09,389
He's not so badly off there.
He's healthy. He's always practiced sports.

717
01:22:10,155 --> 01:22:14,262
It could easily
last a few months, though.

718
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:19,867
Strange how things go, isn't it?
If you hadn't forgotten your bag...

719
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,587
Shall I make tea?

720
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:51,530
Please forgive me, Anna,
for not contacting you for so long.

721
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:54,202
We're all confused here.

722
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:57,974
But I think about you a lot,
and I need you.

723
01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:06,584
I'm scared, Anna. Help me.

724
01:23:06,644 --> 01:23:11,115
David has been taken to Buchenwald.
It's my own fault.

725
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:13,856
Do you know what's in Buchenwald?

726
01:23:13,918 --> 01:23:15,864
(gasps)

727
01:23:20,725 --> 01:23:22,398
(German) Tell me.

728
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:26,272
We're getting married, if I want to.
And I want to.

729
01:23:26,664 --> 01:23:29,201
Anna. Sweet, dear Anna.

730
01:23:29,267 --> 01:23:34,307
- He wants me in Vienna. He has leave.
- How can he have leave now?

731
01:23:34,372 --> 01:23:38,081
"Got tired. Russia too big.
Eight days too late for Stalingrad."

732
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:42,148
"Official leave. Come to Vienna.
Get married, if you want. Martin."

733
01:23:42,213 --> 01:23:45,956
I don't understand, but I want to.
I want to.

734
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:00,573
Good luck.

735
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,211
Goodbye.

736
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:14,348
(Polish) Anna. Goodbye, Anna.

737
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:22,756
Anna, wait!

738
01:24:22,821 --> 01:24:25,859
Anna, wait! From Holland!

739
01:24:25,924 --> 01:24:28,928
From your sister.

740
01:24:30,628 --> 01:24:33,438
(Dutch) Just for a few months,
of course.

741
01:24:33,498 --> 01:24:37,810
But of course.
I think it will be a lot of fun.

742
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:40,406
Don't you, Dinand?

743
01:24:40,472 --> 01:24:43,112
We'll pay all the expenses.
Have I made that clear?

744
01:24:43,174 --> 01:24:44,676
Yes, yes.

745
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:50,420
Plenty of space now that the girls have
left home. Such lovely little rooms.

746
01:24:50,482 --> 01:24:53,827
- Until we find a definite solution.
- Jet's room...

747
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:55,523
Dad.

748
01:24:57,822 --> 01:25:01,497
- Is it all right?
- Oh, did I not make that clear?

749
01:25:01,559 --> 01:25:06,201
Of course it is.
It's our humane duty.

750
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:09,845
Welcome.

751
01:25:23,548 --> 01:25:25,721
From David.

752
01:25:31,222 --> 01:25:36,865
"If I don't get my sailboat soon,
it will be too late. David."

753
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:44,068
- He's asking for help.
- Auschwitz. Now it's Auschwitz.

754
01:25:45,336 --> 01:25:51,685
My darling, my sweet.
I want to go to him.

755
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,231
- (quietly sobbing)
- (knock on door)

756
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:08,126
Mother.

757
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:16,009
Just for once, let me be alone...

758
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:18,479
in this stupid house.

759
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:35,119
(Organ music)

760
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:40,160
(minister recites wedding ceremony)

761
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:53,509
(German) Welcome home,
Mr. and Mrs. Grosalie.

762
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:56,279
(humming "Here Comes the Bride")

763
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:16,928
Did it hurt?

764
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:22,036
It hurt terribly.

765
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:26,140
Did you cry?

766
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:31,780
I'm a man.

767
01:27:32,343 --> 01:27:34,721
Oh, my hero.

768
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:36,781
(giggling)

769
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,652
(train whistle)

770
01:27:40,985 --> 01:27:45,764
Don't worry. I'm with the signals unit.
They're not in any danger.

771
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:02,277
Goodbye!

772
01:28:48,953 --> 01:28:51,559
(Dutch) What's this supposed to be?

773
01:28:53,925 --> 01:28:55,996
What is this?

774
01:28:56,894 --> 01:28:58,999
Mash?

775
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:04,308
Looks more and more like water.

776
01:29:07,305 --> 01:29:12,755
Is that it? Do I not get any more?

777
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,812
Hmm?

778
01:29:17,115 --> 01:29:19,493
Never mind, then.

779
01:29:31,129 --> 01:29:33,234
(women singing in German)

780
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:43,845
I'm so nervous. I hope I recognize him.

781
01:29:43,908 --> 01:29:47,788
- As long as he recognizes you.
- I'm sure he will.

782
01:29:53,418 --> 01:29:55,762
- The girls.
- (men cheer)

783
01:30:01,726 --> 01:30:03,728
(squeals of excitement)

784
01:30:05,496 --> 01:30:07,498
Martin. Martin!

785
01:31:28,112 --> 01:31:34,028
- They say it's almost over.
- The Russians are at West Prussia.

786
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:37,528
Maybe you won't have to go back.

787
01:31:38,489 --> 01:31:40,969
Then we'll go back to Vienna.

788
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,918
Don't look.

789
01:32:01,312 --> 01:32:03,189
Now.

790
01:32:03,247 --> 01:32:08,492
It's a bit premature, but I don't have
much to do at your parents'.

791
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:18,701
That's what I want. A baby.

792
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:26,605
As long as I have a lot. A big family.
On Sundays we'll go for walks.

793
01:32:26,671 --> 01:32:27,979
Will you come?

794
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:33,818
Actually, I'd like a girl first.
I don't know why.

795
01:32:34,912 --> 01:32:38,519
Now I know what I really want.
Twins. Two girls.

796
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,627
And they'll always stay together.

797
01:32:47,491 --> 01:32:51,906
- (Dutch) Gas?
- Yes, gas.

798
01:32:52,663 --> 01:32:55,234
What kind of sick idea is that?

799
01:32:55,299 --> 01:32:59,008
It was in the paper. I'm not making it up.

800
01:33:00,605 --> 01:33:03,142
(Lotte) What was in the paper?

801
01:33:04,642 --> 01:33:12,026
Something about shower rooms,
where the enemy prisoners, it said,

802
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:15,621
were driven in naked and gassed.

803
01:33:16,153 --> 01:33:19,657
- Naked?
- And that the capacity of the chambers

804
01:33:19,724 --> 01:33:27,609
has been raised...
from 200 to 1,000 people per day.

805
01:33:27,665 --> 01:33:34,446
- Of course that isn't true.
- Are you calling me a liar?

806
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:40,216
(air-raid siren)

807
01:33:40,277 --> 01:33:42,450
(planes overhead)

808
01:33:57,294 --> 01:33:59,296
<i>(bombing)</i>

809
01:33:59,363 --> 01:34:01,365
(glass smashing)

810
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:21,658
(German) There's mail?

811
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:27,697
There hasn't been a letter
for a long time.

812
01:34:30,594 --> 01:34:33,837
There is mail.

813
01:34:57,655 --> 01:34:59,999
"Dear Frau Grosalie."

814
01:35:00,057 --> 01:35:02,367
"it is my duty as company commander

815
01:35:02,426 --> 01:35:07,171
to inform you
of your husband's heroic death."

816
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:12,274
In the Eiffel. Shellfire.

817
01:35:26,984 --> 01:35:34,027
(tearfully) "Certain of our victory,
and our rightful cause, I remain..."

818
01:35:38,195 --> 01:35:43,611
"Your husband's heroic death."

819
01:35:45,436 --> 01:35:52,445
They swept him together
and buried him in that village.

820
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:56,157
At least you had a grave.

821
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:59,990
There was no cemetery in Auschwitz.

822
01:36:13,364 --> 01:36:15,366
(distant bombing)

823
01:37:08,619 --> 01:37:10,621
(sobbing)

824
01:37:27,137 --> 01:37:29,139
(brass band music)

825
01:37:36,547 --> 01:37:38,549
(Dutch) Father?

826
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,128
Do you know where Lotte is?

827
01:37:43,587 --> 01:37:45,589
Lotte!

828
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:58,373
Lotte, are you coming?
Everyone's going. Are you coming?

829
01:37:58,435 --> 01:38:02,781
I want to see the Canadians.
We don't want to be late.

830
01:38:05,976 --> 01:38:08,957
Do you think David will still want me?

831
01:38:12,449 --> 01:38:16,022
I don't think David is coming back.

832
01:38:22,259 --> 01:38:26,935
And I think...
that you think that, too.

833
01:38:34,905 --> 01:38:37,215
Are you awake?

834
01:38:41,845 --> 01:38:44,951
My little girl.

835
01:38:49,353 --> 01:38:54,268
(sings "Dear little sister, dance with me")

836
01:38:54,325 --> 01:38:56,327
(baby cries)

837
01:38:56,393 --> 01:38:58,395
(continues singing)

838
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:08,906
Lotte?

839
01:39:11,475 --> 01:39:13,978
(continues singing)

840
01:39:16,013 --> 01:39:18,584
An official notice about David.

841
01:39:21,385 --> 01:39:23,456
Do you want to read it?

842
01:39:34,298 --> 01:39:37,074
Well, what it boils down to...

843
01:39:40,404 --> 01:39:42,884
It's what we already suspected.

844
01:39:44,608 --> 01:39:47,020
In Auschwitz.

845
01:39:48,112 --> 01:39:50,422
What we suspected.

846
01:39:52,983 --> 01:39:54,985
Lotte.

847
01:40:13,537 --> 01:40:16,916
My little bunny rabbit.

848
01:40:23,147 --> 01:40:25,218
(Dutch) Can I help you?

849
01:40:25,282 --> 01:40:27,387
(German)
Yes. Could you tell me where...

850
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:32,127
Damn, a bloody Hun.
Piss off, won't you?

851
01:40:47,838 --> 01:40:49,840
Lotte.

852
01:40:50,507 --> 01:40:52,748
You have a baby.

853
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,812
(baby cries)

854
01:40:55,913 --> 01:40:58,189
I didn't know that.

855
01:41:00,284 --> 01:41:02,195
Never again.

856
01:41:14,331 --> 01:41:16,333
(goes downstairs)

857
01:41:21,472 --> 01:41:24,942
Start a fight, curse her,
hit her, I don't know,

858
01:41:25,008 --> 01:41:28,217
- but do something. This is terrible.
- (Anna hums "Dear little sister")

859
01:41:28,278 --> 01:41:32,954
You have to talk to her.
Get over it. She can't help it.

860
01:41:33,016 --> 01:41:38,227
And you don't know anything about her.
They're not all Nazis.

861
01:41:39,656 --> 01:41:43,604
Talk to her. You'll find out.

862
01:41:44,895 --> 01:41:50,846
She's family, Lotte.
Your twin sister, for God's sake.

863
01:42:00,711 --> 01:42:02,713
(footsteps approach)

864
01:42:20,864 --> 01:42:23,367
(German) Lotte, please.

865
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,543
Lotte.

866
01:43:15,852 --> 01:43:17,627
Come.

867
01:43:26,897 --> 01:43:29,434
All glued together.

868
01:43:29,499 --> 01:43:32,571
For the sound.

869
01:43:34,338 --> 01:43:36,614
I came for her.

870
01:43:36,673 --> 01:43:38,812
(footsteps descending)

871
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,912
She's the only one I have left.

872
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:30,064
Get out!

873
01:44:30,727 --> 01:44:33,867
Get out of my house, Nazi!

874
01:44:35,265 --> 01:44:38,940
Nazi. You killed him.
You and that man.

875
01:44:39,002 --> 01:44:41,915
Do you want an SS whore
in your home?

876
01:44:41,972 --> 01:44:44,976
Get out!

877
01:44:45,042 --> 01:44:47,044
(yelling)

878
01:44:58,021 --> 01:45:02,470
Get out of my life.
I never want to see you again.

879
01:45:04,394 --> 01:45:07,466
You're not my sister anymore.

880
01:45:18,175 --> 01:45:20,451
(German) So that's what it was.

881
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:24,014
Your twin sister,
the wife of an SS officer.

882
01:45:24,081 --> 01:45:26,561
And now you speak Dutch.

883
01:45:26,616 --> 01:45:30,758
Good, eh? I thought:
I won't let that happen to me twice.

884
01:45:30,821 --> 01:45:33,700
We should get back. It's getting late.

885
01:45:34,991 --> 01:45:37,972
I hardly knew
what was happening in Holland.

886
01:45:38,028 --> 01:45:43,307
And about what happened to the Jews
we didn't find out until much later.

887
01:45:43,367 --> 01:45:45,847
"We didn't know." Hmm?

888
01:45:45,902 --> 01:45:48,143
Yes.

889
01:45:48,205 --> 01:45:52,153
- We didn't know.
- We have to get back.

890
01:45:52,209 --> 01:45:56,749
If I'd had TB instead of you,
our roles would have been reversed.

891
01:45:56,813 --> 01:45:59,760
But would I have made the same choices?

892
01:45:59,816 --> 01:46:04,265
Of course. You wouldn't have known
any better, just like me.

893
01:46:04,321 --> 01:46:07,564
I would never have married an SS officer.

894
01:46:07,624 --> 01:46:11,299
I didn't fall in love with an SS officer,

895
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:14,604
but with Martin,
the best man in the whole world.

896
01:46:14,664 --> 01:46:17,611
I would never have fallen in love
with a murderer.

897
01:46:17,667 --> 01:46:20,375
Martin was no murderer.

898
01:46:21,071 --> 01:46:24,416
Where are we, for God's sake?

899
01:46:25,008 --> 01:46:29,013
We've both been victims of circumstance.

900
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:32,617
Sorry, but I'm not going
to compare my life to yours.

901
01:46:32,682 --> 01:46:37,324
Why not? Is my sorrow
worth any less than yours?

902
01:46:37,387 --> 01:46:42,336
Damn it, Lotte. If you and I can't
understand each other, then who can?

903
01:46:42,392 --> 01:46:46,169
- What will happen to the world?
- Shut up. I don't want to hear it.

904
01:46:46,229 --> 01:46:50,905
I don't want to understand.
By forgiving you I'd betray David.

905
01:46:50,967 --> 01:46:55,382
You don't have to forgive me.
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

906
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:58,477
I haven't done anything wrong.

907
01:46:59,276 --> 01:47:05,591
I've always tried to do the right thing
and you're treating me like a monster.

908
01:47:05,649 --> 01:47:10,997
- I didn't kill David!
- Oh, stop it, Anna.

909
01:47:11,054 --> 01:47:15,400
You and I live in two different worlds.
They can never, ever meet.

910
01:47:15,459 --> 01:47:20,568
I'm going this way. You go back.
I'll find another route.

911
01:47:38,782 --> 01:47:42,992
- (Anna grunts)
- Hold on.

912
01:47:44,888 --> 01:47:47,368
- We'll climb down slowly.
- Yes.

913
01:47:53,263 --> 01:48:00,841
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."

914
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:07,515
Well, there we are.

915
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:13,090
Dinner can be served here,
as far as I'm concerned.

916
01:48:16,853 --> 01:48:22,098
Lotte, I didn't kill David.

917
01:48:23,927 --> 01:48:27,238
I know that.

918
01:48:27,898 --> 01:48:30,504
But you feel I'm responsible.

919
01:48:32,769 --> 01:48:38,685
I'm not really sure that I do.

920
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,140
- The very last one.
- Mm-hm.

921
01:49:08,104 --> 01:49:09,913
Mmm.

922
01:49:09,973 --> 01:49:11,577
Lovely.

923
01:49:12,943 --> 01:49:14,945
A feast.

924
01:49:18,348 --> 01:49:23,161
- Do you have any children?
- No.

925
01:49:24,454 --> 01:49:31,963
I couldn't have any,
thanks to Uncle Heinrich's beatings.

926
01:49:32,028 --> 01:49:38,445
I later got a job
with the Child Welfare Council.

927
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:43,109
That's where I worked
for the rest of my life.

928
01:49:43,173 --> 01:49:45,585
And I really enjoyed it.

929
01:49:50,213 --> 01:49:54,093
(both sing "Dear little sister,
dance with me")

930
01:50:08,999 --> 01:50:11,001
(laughing)

931
01:50:18,408 --> 01:50:20,285
Little Anna.

932
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:28,695
I'm so cold, so cold.

933
01:50:42,165 --> 01:50:44,167
(birdsong)

934
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,759
I understand.

935
01:52:13,556 --> 01:52:15,729
(dog barking)

936
01:52:22,465 --> 01:52:25,275
(Dutch) She knew that she...

937
01:52:25,702 --> 01:52:28,444
She wanted me...

938
01:52:29,005 --> 01:52:31,485
for me to...

939
01:52:32,075 --> 01:52:34,521
before she...

940
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:41,357
- That's what it was.
- Madam.

941
01:52:43,186 --> 01:52:46,190
I understand.

942
01:52:47,423 --> 01:52:49,460
(woman) Who is this woman?

943
01:52:53,096 --> 01:52:57,943
Anna. My sister.

944
01:52:59,569 --> 01:53:02,880
My twin sister.
