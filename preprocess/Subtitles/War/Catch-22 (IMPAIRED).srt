00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,921
What about the others?
I'd be playing a dirty trick on them.

16
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:15,438
[man] They'll be happy you're gone.
[2nd man] They have a war to win.

17
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,558
Well...what the hell.

18
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:23,885
of they don't want any more missions,
let them stand up and say so.

19
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,680
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

20
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,442
[planes droning overhead]

21
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,636

[wind whistling]

00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,763
[man] Help him!

24
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:46,241
- What?
- Help him! Help him!

25
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,279
- Help who?
- Help the bombardier!

26
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:53,878
- I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.
- Then help him! Help HIM!

27
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,566
- Snowden.
- [1st medic] What'd he say?

28
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:13,759
[2nd medic] He said, "Snowden".
[1st medic] Snowden's dead.

29
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,279
Snowden?

30
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:22,481
- Why's he talking to a dead man?
- He's Yossarian. He's crazy.

31
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,282
- Who says so?
- I do.

32
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,557
- Cos I hate that son of a bitch?
- Who?

33
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,996
- Colonel Cathcart.
- I didn't ask you.

34
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,766
- Cathcart isn't here.
- Who mentioned him?

35
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,765
- Colonel Korn isn't here.
- Who mentioned him?

36
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:39,560
- Who do you hate?
- What son of a bitch lS here?

37
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,883
- You don't make sense.
- You got a persecution complex.

38
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,883
- Damn right.
- You admit it!

39
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:47,760
I admit I'm being persecuted,
by them!

40
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:52,437
- Who specifically is "them"?
- All of them! Who do you think?

41
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,320
- I've no idea!
- Then how do you know they aren't?

42
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,641
[men] Ahhh!

43
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,679
- That's sheer what-do-you-call-it...
- Sophistry.

44
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,844
Like hell it is, McWatt.
They're trying to kill me!

45
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,799
No one's trying to kill you.
Eat your dessert.

46
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:09,920
- Then why are they shooting at me?
- They're shooting at everyone.

47
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:14,643
- What difference does that make?
- Suppose everyone thought like you?

48
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:19,363
- I'd be a fool to think different.
- You need your head examined.

49
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:22,558
There's nothing wrong with it.

50
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:26,316
- Look at it once, will you?
- Yossarian, your head is OK.

51
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,518
- [man screaming]
- Please, don't do that.

52
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,800
- Yes. What?
- Doc? Doc?

53
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,237
- I want you to ground me.
- Don't start that again.

54
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,800
- Doc, I don't want to fly any more.
- Why?

55
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,803
- It's dangerous.
- [screams]

56
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:53,920
Listen, I told you...
Let's get out of here, huh?

57
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:59,478
[Yossarian] I've flown 35 missions.
Now that nut has raised it to 50.

58
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:03,520
In any other outfit I would've been
rotated after 25. Help me out.

59
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,320
[Doc] I'm due for rotation
myself soon

60
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:09,404
if I don't cause trouble
or break any rules.

61
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:13,360
One rule says I can't ground anyone
just because he asks me to.

62
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:17,844
- Can you ground someone who's crazy?
- Of course. A rule says I have to.

63
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,845
- I'm crazy!
- Who says so?

64
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:24,038
Ask Nately, Dobbs, McWatt...
Hey, Orr, tell him!

65
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,157
- Tell him what?
- Am I crazy?

66
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,721
He's crazy, Doc.
He won't fly with me.

67
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:32,646
I'd take good care of him
but he won't. He's crazy, all right.

68
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,963
- See that? They all say I'm crazy.
- They're crazy.

69
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,805
- Why don't you ground them?
- Why don't they ask me?

70
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:41,998
- Because they're crazy!
- Of course they're crazy.

71
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:46,837
You can't let crazy people decide
whether you're crazy or not, can you?

72
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,156
- Is Orr crazy?
- Of course he is.

73
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:54,995
He has to be if he keeps flying
after all those close calls.

74
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:57,880
- Then why don't you ground him?
- He has to ask me.

75
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:00,282
- That's all he's gotta do?
- That's all.

76
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:04,081
- Then you can ground him?
- No. Then I cannot ground him.

77
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:05,719
There's a catch.

78
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,723
- A catch?
- Sure, Catch-22.

79
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:11,396
Anyone who wants to get out of combat
isn't really crazy,

80
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,438
so I can't ground him.

81
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,395
OK. Let me see
if I got this straight.

82
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:20,359
In order to be grounded,
I've got to be crazy

83
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,637
and I must be crazy to keep flying.

84
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,963
But if I ask to be grounded,
I'm not crazy any more

85
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:29,204
- and I have to keep flying.
- You've got it! That's Catch-22.

86
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,238
Whoooo!

87
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:40,079
- That's some catch, that Catch-22.
- It's the best there is!

88
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:47,397
Good afternoon, this is Major Danby,
your flight operations officer,

89
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,756
welcoming you to today's mission.

90
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:54,198
You've all been briefed on this
morning's run, so I won't go over it.

91
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:58,638
There's no sense naming names
since the enemy is probably listening

92
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,882
and there's no reason I can think of

93
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,441
to tell him
where we're going to strike.

94
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:07,082
That's the stupidest goddamn thing
I ever heard him say.

95
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:08,321
That's right!

96
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,076
[Danby] Weather conditions
have improved tremendously,

97
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,358
so you won't have any trouble
seeing the target.

98
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,398
Of course, you mustn't forget,

99
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:21,235
that means that they will have
no trouble at all seeing you.

100
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:25,439
Colonel Cathcart would like to say
a few words before takeoff.

101
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,923
- And so, without further ado...
- Give me that!

102
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:33,006
Men, I'm not gonna waste
any more of your time than I have to.

103
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:36,084
I wanna wish you good luck
on today's mission.

104
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,846
To those of you
who won't be coming back,

105
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:43,278
we're gonna do our best to take care
of your wives and/or sweethearts.

106
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,124
And don't forget,

107
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:49,046
General Dreedle wants to see
a nice, tight bombing pattern

108
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,396
on those aerial photographs.

109
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,438
Everyone ready to go?

110
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,438
[birds twittering]

111
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,757
- Colonel Korn, stay in the tower.
- Sir?

112
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:09,244
Stay on top of this. I'd like to know
when my boys make target.

113
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,118
[Korn] Yes, sir!

114
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,204
What is it, Lieutenant Minderbinder?

115
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:18,445
- An egg, sir.
- I know that, Lieutenant.

116
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:22,241
- A fresh egg, sir.
- Where did you get the egg?

117
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:27,759
In Malta, sir, where there are
enough chickens to lay fresh eggs

118
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,116
for every officer in the squadron,

119
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:34,126
at five cents apiece
from the mess fund.

120
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:38,843
- Yes?
- With a profit of two cents per egg.

121
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,764
For whom?

122
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:46,359
Sir, for whomever sells the eggs
to the mess.

123
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:50,525
- And who may that be, Milo?
- Ah, sir.

124
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,764
- Oranges from Marrakech, pecans...
- Pecans?

125
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:58,119
And in Palermo, 10,000 gallons
of the finest Italian olive oil.

126
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:01,603
The Sicilians need blankets.
It would be a fair trade.

127
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,922
They're interested in Sardinia.

128
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:08,279
All we need is the cooperation
of the countries we're dealing with.

129
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,840
What countries?

130
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:14,278
The African nations, countries
in the Greater Mediterranean area.

131
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:18,081
So what we need is an additional
assignment of personnel,

132
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,846
- a little time and a plane.
- [crashing]

133
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,845
- What plane?
- One of ours, sir. If I had one,

134
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,277
I could get the gasoline to Malta
and bring the eggs back.

135
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,919
[Cathcart] All right.

136
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:33,643
And if I was taken off combat duty
until I get this into operation...

137
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:34,881
But Milo...

138
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,839
I know, sir,
I'm just an acting mess officer

139
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:41,880
but it requires my full attention.
It's to everyone's benefit.

140
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:44,566
- Take whatever you need.
- Thank you.

141
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:48,441
I hope to give the men the finest
cuisine in the entire world.

142
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:49,886
Uh-huh...

143
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:54,318
- Isn't that something to shoot at?
- Yes, Milo, it certainly is.

144
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,358
[explosion]

145
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,762
[sirens]

146
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:06,883
With your permission, I'd like to
show you something I've had printed.

147
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,999
- What is it?
- Just an idea, sir. It's a share.

148
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:12,641
- A share?
- In M&M Enterprises.

149
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:17,238
If we get my ideas into practice,
it should be organised like a mart.

150
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:19,755
- A mart?
- Yes, sir, a syndicate.

151
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:23,516
An enterprise. There are tremendous
profits to be made, Colonel.

152
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,523
- For us?
- For everyone.

153
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:30,516
What will be good for M&M Enterprises
will be good for the country.

154
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,765
- You'll have our full cooperation.
- Thank you, sir.

155
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:39,597
of I take a plane this afternoon,
I'll get this material to Alexandria.

156
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,605
- There's a huge cotton crop.
- Cotton?

157
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:45,639
- Cotton is a very liquid commodity.
- How much?

158
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,997
- We'll trade for it, sir.
- With what?

159
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,322
Silk! 4,000 yards of silk.

160
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,564
How in the world
did you get hold of so much silk?

161
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,802
Where the hell's my parachute?

162
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:04,365
OK, all right, which one of you
bastards stole my parachute?

163
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:15,996
Hello, hello, this is the bombardier
here. We gotta turn back.

164
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:19,164
Uh, Nately, we gotta turn back now.

165
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,842
Nately! Do you hear me up there?

166
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:26,243
We gotta turn back.
OK, we're gonna turn back now.

167
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:30,246
Nately, let's turn back.
We're gonna turn back!

168
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:33,245
What is it this time, Yossarian?

169
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:36,677
Some bastard stole my chute! Aahh!

170
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:40,800
- Anything the matter?
- My parachute. It's gone!

171
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,600
- Don't worry about it.
- What do you mean?

172
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:47,322
What do I do if I have to bail out,
use my handkerchief?!

173
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:51,838
That kind of humour in the face
of adversity keeps America strong.

174
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,445
I like you, Yossarian.

175
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,559
Aardvark, I'd like to kill you
but I haven't got time.

176
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,644
You could have my chute
but I gave it to Milo.

177
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,679
- You gave it to Milo?
- He's got all the chutes.

178
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:06,242
He's got a hell of a deal going
for silk in Alexandria.

179
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,562
Maybe I do have time to kill...

180
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:12,282
- Looks like they've seen us coming.
- They've seen us!

181
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:17,117
- Oh, God, they've seen us!
- Get ready to dump those eggs.

182
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,079
[shrieking]

183
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:25,245
They're shooting at me! Where are we?

184
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:29,041
Aardvark, where are we?

185
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,282
[gunfire explodes outside]

186
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,796
- I think we're there.
- [Yossarian] 'We're there?'

187
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,279
We're there? We're there!

188
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,718
Get ready to turn!

189
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,680
Four, three...

190
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,676
two, one, drop! Let's go!

191
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:58,481
Turn right hard! Turn, turn!

192
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:02,281
Turn, you son of a bitch! Turn right!

193
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:06,002
- Turn, turn right!
- Look at that, will you?

194
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,845
I think we've got 'em this time,
where it hurts.

195
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:10,798
- Get out.
- I can't hear you.

196
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:13,315
- Get back in the ship!
- What's that?

197
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:17,599
Oh, climb, you bastard! Climb! Climb!

198
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:23,558
- Fire! Fire on board!
- Fire? Where's the fire?

199
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:27,202
- Get out of the nose!
- [Nately] 'I'm not in the nose.'

200
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,317
Speak up. I still can't hear you.

201
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,006
They're trying to kill us.
Get out of here!

202
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:36,438
- [Nately] 'Which way should I go?'
- Turn left, you son of a bitch!

203
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,966
Look, there goes Orr.

204
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:47,236
That stupid little bastard. Pull out!

205
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,243
[explosion]

206
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:59,280
Hey, I think you've caught
a little something there.

207
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,397
Is it my leg?

208
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,244
Hey, is that my leg?

209
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,644
- What's with my leg?
- Take it easy.

210
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,678
My leg!

211
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,521
[Aardvark] Yossarian's caught one.

212
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,637
- What's that?
- [McWatt] 'Help him!'

213
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:26,041
- What?
- 'Help him! Help him!'

214
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:29,045
- Help who?
- 'Help the bombardier!'

215
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:33,399
- I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.
- 'Then help him! Help HIM!'

216
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,642
[wind whistling]

217
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,767
It's, uh...

218
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,356
- What's his name, the new gunner?
- [McWatt] 'Snowden.'

219
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,398
Yeah.

220
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,238
Snowden.

221
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:05,039
- I'm cold.
- OK. You're gonna be OK.

222
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:08,557
I'm cold. I'm cold.

223
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:24,197
[woman] Over here! Hurry up!

224
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,363
Hey!

225
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,478
[birds twittering]

226
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:36,556
- What?
- [man] I asked how you were feeling.

227
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,483
Oh.

228
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:48,247
Better, thank you.

229
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:50,403
What about you?

230
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:55,557
Me? Fairly well, thank you.

231
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,837
You're welcome.

232
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:02,721
- Except for a slight head cold.
- Mmm.

233
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:07,123
Had it for about a week,
can't seem to shake it.

234
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,556
Well, you know what they're like.

235
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:13,202
No, I, uh... I don't.

236
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:18,036
I've never really had a head cold.
I've tried but...

237
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,676
Can't seem to be able to get one.

238
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,321
Well, you're very lucky.

239
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:31,039
Yes, I suppose I am.

240
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:36,082
Except for this piece of shrapnel
I caught in my leg.

241
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,238
Yes.

242
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:46,325
I've never caught
a piece of shrapnel.

243
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,642
Mmm.

244
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,642
You're a chaplain!

245
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:04,406
Yes. Didn't you know that?

246
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:09,567
No, I didn't. I've never
really seen a chaplain before.

247
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:13,395
I had no idea chaplains
looked like that.

248
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,005
Well...

249
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:19,438
Well, if I can do anything
to help you, anything at all, you...

250
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:21,762
Anything?

251
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:26,038
Like books, or-or... cigarettes.

252
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,679
Toys?

253
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,083
No, I have everything I need,
thank you very much.

254
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:35,516
Ah...

255
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,127
- You could do one thing for me.
- What?

256
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:42,046
- You could speak to Major Duluth.
- The Squadron Commander?

257
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,964
I don't want to fly any more.

258
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:48,285
Cathcart raised the number of
missions! He's trying to kill us all!

259
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:51,876
- I can't do it, I'm desperate!
- It's not my business...

260
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,681
- I'm desperate!
- I'll see what I can do.

261
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:58,799
I really will,
I'll... I'm gonna do my best.

262
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,838
[man screaming]

263
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,841
[whispering, indistinct]

264
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,523
[whispering] It takes me 45 minutes
to do this thing.

265
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,876
First I saut the chicken parts,

266
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:22,566
then I put the raisins
and the onions in.

267
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:26,043
Three packets of garlic,
don't forget the garlic.

268
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,681
[conversation becomes indistinct]

269
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,162
[laughing]

270
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:45,442
[tyres squealing]

271
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,478
He-he yelled.

272
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,443
I'm...I'm awfully sorry, sir.

273
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,365
- What's your name?
- Major, sir.

274
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,126
Not your rank, I asked your name.

275
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:03,161
No, sir. I'm a captain.
My name is Major. Captain Major.

276
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,596
Just about as clear as mud, isn't it?

277
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:08,207
That's what it's just about
as clear as.

278
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:13,037
Listen, Captain. You know
Major Duluth, the Squadron Commander?

279
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:15,317
- He's a fine man, sir.
- Was.

280
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,086
- Sir?
- Major Duluth is dead.

281
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:20,322
I'm distraught to hear that, sir.

282
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:25,441
You may be distraught but he's dead.
Shot down over Perugia today.

283
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:30,641
That'll teach him to go on missions
when he should be in the office.

284
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:34,202
- I don't see...
- We need a new Squadron Commander.

285
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:38,286
And you're the only major available
on our headquarters staff.

286
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,522
No, Major is my name, not my rank.

287
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,355
That's close enough for me, Major.
Consider yourself a major.

288
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:47,558
I don't know anything
about being a commander.

289
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,246
We all have to make sacrifices,
Major.

290
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,596
Sir, I'm in Billeting and Laundry!

291
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:56,606
I know that, sir, but we all
have to do our part, I guess.

292
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,320
Well, I don't like my part.

293
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:11,160
Sergeant, I'm going to take
the rest of the afternoon off

294
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:15,917
and lie down in my tent
and think about things.

295
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,084
Sir, there's someone
waiting to see you.

296
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:21,402
- Now?
- Yes, sir.

297
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:26,322
- Who is it?
- Captain Tappman, Group Chaplain.

298
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,846
What does he want?

299
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:31,800
I don't know, sir, something to do
with Captain Yossarian.

300
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:37,086
Look, um, Sergeant...

301
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,638
My job is tough enough

302
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:45,124
without having to deal all the time
with people who want something.

303
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,522
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,762
I suppose
you're wondering about this.

305
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:52,401
Sir, it's not my place to wonder.

306
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:55,883
- Did you know people stare at me?
- No, sir.

307
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:58,395
They think, "Who is that Major Major,

308
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,235
"that he gets to be commander
without ever having flown?"

309
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:05,996
- I don't think people think that.
- Well, they do.

310
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:09,244
When I have this on,
they don't know who I am.

311
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,960
Did... Did you know
in the Middle Ages

312
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:17,319
princes and kings put on disguises
and walked around their subjects?

313
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:21,121
- I didn't know that.
- You don't know everything, do you?

314
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:25,524
- No, sir. Why did they do that?
- Why did who do what?!

315
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,320
Why did they walk around in disguise?

316
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:33,077
How the hell am I supposed to know?
I'm not some historian or anything.

317
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:38,042
I'm just a guy trying to do his job.
Good afternoon, Sergeant.

318
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,759
Sir?

319
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:43,765
- What is it now?
- What do I do with the Chaplain?

320
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:48,085
I don't want anyone to come
and see me while I'm in my office.

321
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,846
What do I say to people
who want to see you?

322
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,196
- Ask them to wait.
- For how long?

323
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:54,646
Until I've left.

324
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,484
- Then what?
- I don't care.

325
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,166
- I send them in after you've left?
- Yes.

326
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,437
- You won't be here then.
- No.

327
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:04,479
Also, I don't want you coming in
while I'm here

328
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:06,961
asking if there's anything
you can do.

329
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,805
When should I ask
if there's anything I can do?

330
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:11,678
When I'm not there!

331
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,764
- What do I do then?
- Whatever has to be done.

332
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:19,437
I'm sorry to have to talk
to you this way, but I have to.

333
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:21,876
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

334
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,764
[thud]

335
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,962
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?

336
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:33,556
- Thank you, for everything.
- Thank you, sir.

337
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,797
Major will see you now, Father.

338
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,838
- [phone]
- Thank you.

339
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:47,085
- You don't have to call me Father.
- Sergeant Towser speaking.

340
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:49,038
Will you go in?

341
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,204
Yes, sir. I have it here, sir.

342
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:00,963
There's no one here.

343
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,475
- Where?
- In Major Major's office.

344
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:07,406
- When?
- When you go to see him.

345
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:11,326
What I mean is you can't see him
when he's there,

346
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:15,155
when he's in his office,
I've tried several times.

347
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,926
- When can you see him? Ever?
- Yes, yes.

348
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:21,596
Yes, indeed, you can see him
when he isn't there.

349
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:24,962
That is, he'll see you, all right,

350
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:28,556
but only in his office
and only when he's not there.

351
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:31,519
The other times, when he's in...

352
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:36,116
he's not...there...

353
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,123
to be seen.

354
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,919
Except when he's out.

355
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,401
What the hell
are you talking about, Father?

356
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:46,359
- Sir?
- Get your ass in here, Padre.

357
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,884
Are you describing
some mystical experience?

358
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,395
Some peculiar things are happening.

359
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:57,644
- You haven't had ecstatic visions?
- No, sir.

360
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,759
Didn't see a burning bush,
hear any voices?

361
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,879
- Nothing quite so extraordinary.
- I hope not.

362
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:07,715
We have to keep our supernatural
episodes down to a minimum,

363
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:11,521
- with a war to win and all that.
- Absolutely, sir.

364
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:15,037
- May I ask where we're going?
- Where WE'RE going?

365
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:17,965
You are going
to Colonel Cathcart's office.

366
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:21,886
- Now?
- That's the general idea, Padre.

367
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:25,522
Uh, i-is there anything wrong?
Have I done anything?

368
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:29,640
I don't know. Are you and
Captain Yossarian up to something?

369
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:32,565
- I don't know what you mean.
- Then who does?

370
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:36,759
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know much about anything.

371
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:40,163
- No, sir. Sir?
- What is it?

372
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:44,405
It's not necessary to call me Father.
I'm an anabaptist.

373
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:47,598
Well, thanks for
setting me straight on that.

374
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:51,435
- I thought you'd like to know.
- You're a captain, right?

375
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:55,162
- I'm a lieutenant colonel. Correct?
- Yes, sir, it is.

376
00:32:55,207 --> 00:33:00,076
Then I can call you anything I want,
unless you have some objections.

377
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:02,322
- Out!
- Thank you, sir.

378
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,960
Uh, sir, do you think now...?

379
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:12,319
- Morning. Anything I can get you?
- Morning, Lieutenant. What?

380
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,756
- Do you need any supplies?
- No.

381
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:17,879
Whiskey, silk stockings, fresh fruit?

382
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:22,239
The Colonel loves fresh fruit.
What about religious supplies?

383
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:25,962
I can get hold of an entire
shipment of religious relics,

384
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:27,998
blessed by the Pope himself.

385
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,403
Includes the wrist and collar bones
of some of your top saints.

386
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:36,123
- That's very kind of you.
- If you need anything, ask for Milo.

387
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:40,240
- I've never been issued a blanket.
- Anything at all, now!

388
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:53,479
[clears throat]

389
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:55,882
Yeah?

390
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:59,044
I think the Colonel wants to see me.

391
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:01,885
- He does?
- I believe so. I'm...

392
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:05,719
- Chaplain Tappman.
- You're Chaplain Tappman?

393
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:09,521
Have a seat. I'll tell the Colonel
you're here, Father.

394
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,558
It's not...

395
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,522
You'd better get some dry things.

396
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,082
Oh, I will, as soon as the Colonel
is through with me.

397
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:36,198
- They just got me out of the sea.
- They did?

398
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:40,763
- I drifted for almost three days.
- You should report to the hospital.

399
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:44,197
- You could catch pneumonia.
- Oh, no, not me.

400
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:47,284
- This is my fourth time.
- How do you mean?

401
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:50,956
I've put down in the Mediterranean
once, once in the Adriatic,

402
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:54,556
then I crash-landed one plane
and I bailed out once.

403
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:59,004
- You're very lucky.
- That's what some folks say.

404
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:03,279
Yossarian says they're gonna start
taking it out of my salary.

405
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:04,760
Yossarian?

406
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:08,686
- He's a friend. Do you know him?
- Yes, as a matter of fact...

407
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:11,525
- Captain Tappman!
- Yes?

408
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:17,320
- Perhaps you shouldn't fly any more.
- It's good practice.

409
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:22,525
- Tappman, the Colonel is a busy man.
- Yes, of course.

410
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:34,079
Well, Chaplain, we don't see
much of you around here lately.

411
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:38,484
Well, sir, I try to stay
out of the way as much as possible.

412
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:42,566
- I make the men uncomfortable.
- Nonsense!

413
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:47,078
I can't imagine any man not enjoying
the benefits of your presence.

414
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:50,358
Unless, of course, they're atheists.

415
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,956
- Not much chance of that, though.
- I don't know, sir.

416
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,567
- Isn't atheism against the law?
- No.

417
00:35:56,607 --> 00:36:00,316
It isn't?
Then it's un-American, isn't it?

418
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,961
- I'm not sure.
- Well, I am.

419
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,282
If I find any atheists on this base,

420
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:08,876
you can bet they'll soon
start believing in something.

421
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:12,044
That's not why
I called you in, Chaplain.

422
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,885
I want you to take a look at this.

423
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,283
Page 48.

424
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:25,837
Don't read the whole thing. You can
get the point from the photographs.

425
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,959
There's a full-page picture
of a colonel in England

426
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:32,443
whose chaplain conducts prayers
before every mission.

427
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:35,365
I see no reason why
the Saturday Evening Post

428
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,683
should not be interested
in the story of my outfit.

429
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:43,801
Think up some nice, snappy prayers
to send the men out feeling good.

430
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:46,725
Can you do that? Hm?

431
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:50,237
- I'll try.
- Well, good! Let's get to it!

432
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,278
Yes, sir.

433
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,681
Is there something else?

434
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,877
Sir, it may be none of my business

435
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:08,637
but some of the men are
particularly upset about the fact

436
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,760
that you keep raising the number
of missions they have to fly.

437
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,285
- You're right, Chaplain.
- I am, sir?

438
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:22,286
That it's none of your business.
And it's none of theirs either.

439
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,921
Their business is to fly missions.

440
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,720
Your business is to
think up catchy prayers

441
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:30,565
that'll get me into
the Saturday Evening Post.

442
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:33,440
- Good afternoon, Chaplain!
- Yes, sir.

443
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:40,285
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, Padre.

444
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,957
He says the men are upset because l
keep raising the number of missions.

445
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,282
- Yossarian.
- What?

446
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:56,718
It's that Captain Yossarian. He's
always bitching and making trouble.

447
00:37:56,767 --> 00:38:00,840
- What can we do about it?
- What would General Dreedle do?

448
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,964
He'd crush him.

449
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,282
- Tear him apart!
- Smack him in the face!

450
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,283
- Jab him in the kidneys!
- Kick him in the balls!

451
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:10,003
[howls]

452
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:18,002
Keep your head down
between your legs.

453
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,481
Try to breathe deeply and evenly.

454
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:24,566
I'm sorry, Captain.
I know how that must feel.

455
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,996
- I don't think so.
- Try not to talk.

456
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:29,766
Just think about nice things.

457
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,640
Think about how lovely it is here,

458
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:37,886
how lovely it could be if someone
didn't always try to spoil it.

459
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:41,363
- Why do you always try to spoil it?
- Because I love you.

460
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:44,365
I know that, Captain. I know that.

461
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:48,366
But this is wartime.
We've got a job to do, soldier.

462
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:52,195
We just can't give in to ourselves.
Think how it is for me.

463
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,638
One of a handful of women
on an island with thousands of men.

464
00:38:56,687 --> 00:39:00,965
Men who are giving up their lives
for our country, for me.

465
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:04,477
Think about... Captain Yossarian!

466
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:07,041
What are you doing?

467
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,078
Listen, I'm gonna die.

468
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:12,164
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
- Yes, mm!

469
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:16,519
[Yossarian groaning] Oh, God. Oh...

470
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:20,037
- [whispering] What is it?
- [Yossarian groaning]

471
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:22,317
- What's the matter?
- Oh!

472
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:27,282
The name of the town is Ferrara
and it's right around here.

473
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:30,717
It's a very pretty town,
on the coast...

474
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,201
[groaning]

475
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,125
- You all right?
- It's her, it's her!

476
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,318
- Who? Who?
- Dreedle's WAC!

477
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:43,724
[Danby] If you do your job well,
there won't be much left, anyway.

478
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:49,477
Intelligence reports indicate you
shouldn't have to worry about flak.

479
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:53,361
We were hoping for some
new recon photos of the area.

480
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:58,003
UnfortuNately, they haven't arrived
but then, no news is good news.

481
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:00,277
A lot of you may ask yourselves,

482
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:04,115
"How come we're out
to destroy a town with no industry,

483
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,681
"no enemy bases,
no strategic value to anyone?"

484
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:11,638
[man] Attention!

485
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:23,323
[Cathcart] As you were.
Good morning, gentlemen.

486
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:27,645
We're honoured to have
General Dreedle at today's briefing.

487
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:31,566
Don't pay any attention to me,
just carry on as usual.

488
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:35,646
- Don't pay any attention to Dad.
- Will you clam up?

489
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:38,923
Don't call me Dad.

490
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:44,280
- Go ahead with your briefing, Major.
- Yes, well... Thank you, sir.

491
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:48,000
I was just telling
the men here that...

492
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:51,960
- Don't tell me. Tell them!
- Tell the men, Danby.

493
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:57,605
Yes. I was just explaining
why we're going to obliterate...

494
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:00,605
- What about a chair?
- Sir?

495
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,646
- A chair.
- I beg your pardon, General?

496
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:08,281
A chair!

497
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,841
Doesn't anyone know what a chair is?!

498
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,681
Can't you see a lady is standing?

499
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,560
A chair for Dad's gir...for the lady!

500
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:36,364
Carry on.

501
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:39,877
[Danby] We're now going
to synchronize our watches.

502
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:42,202
Now, we've all done this before,

503
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:45,239
so I don't think
we're going to have any problem.

504
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:51,726
If everyone will be kind enough to
look down at his watch, we'll begin.

505
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:57,364
It is now 1 1 15 hours minus 50...

506
00:41:57,407 --> 00:42:00,877
- 49, 48, 47...
- Mmm.

507
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:05,443
- 46, 45, 44, 43...
- [Yossarian groaning]

508
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,842
- Mmmmm.
- Yossarian.

509
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:13,041
- Ohh... Oh-oh...
- [Danby] ..40, 39, 38, 37...

510
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:15,476
- ..36, 35...
- [Yossarian moaning]

511
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:19,406
- ..34, 33, 32...
- [Yossarian] Mmm.

512
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:22,439
- ..31 , 30...
- [Yossarian] Ohh-oh...

513
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:26,958
..29, 28, 27...

514
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:31,364
- [men yelping and sighing]
- ..26, 25, 24...

515
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:36,879
- Somebody's gonna get it!
- ..22, 21 , 20...

516
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,602
- ..19, 18, 1 7...
- [men moaning]

517
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:45,402
..16, 15, 1 4, 1 3, 1 2...

518
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:49,235
- All right, at ease!
- ..1 1 , 10, 9...

519
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:52,802
There'll be no more moaning
in this outfit.

520
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:56,726
The next man who moans
is going to be very sorry.

521
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,200
..one!

522
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,276
Ohhh.

523
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,480
- Who is this man?
- [whimpering]

524
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,439
- Major Danby, sir.
- Danby. D-A-N-B-Y.

525
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,001
- Take him out and shoot him.
- Sir?

526
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:17,802
- [Dreedle] I said shoot him.
- Take Major Danby out and shoot him.

527
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:20,600
I think you'd better
wait a minute, Dad.

528
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,366
- What?
- I don't think you can shoot him.

529
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,477
Why the hell can't l?

530
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:27,483
Why not?

531
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:30,564
You mean I can't shoot
whoever I want to?

532
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,440
- Is that a fact?
- I'm afraid it is, Dad.

533
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,285
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

534
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,639
Just because my half-wit daughter
married you for some reason...

535
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:42,439
Oh, no, Dad, it's just...

536
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:46,446
Let the insubordinate son of a bitch
go but get him out of here.

537
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:52,082
- Better do something.
- All right, men, I think we...

538
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:56,757
owe a vote of thanks to the General
for visiting us and cheering us up.

539
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:59,560
In his honour,
I'd like to make an announcement

540
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:01,598
which may be of interest.

541
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:04,241
I know you're anxious
to do your part...

542
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:05,959
Here it comes.

543
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:09,602
As of now,
the number of missions required

544
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,606
before you are eligible for rotation
is raised to 75.

545
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:17,845
I know we'll all do our best.
Ten-hut!

546
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:25,801
[Yossarian] What are you smiling at,
you silly bastard?

547
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,486
- Now I won't have to go home.
- You what?

548
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,995
I can stay.
I don't have to leave her.

549
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:34,642
- What are you saying?
- I love her.

550
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,279
[gibbers]

551
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:41,799
I do. I really do. I've never feIt
like this, not even for my mom.

552
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,202
Men don't fall for girls like that.

553
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,681
Men always fall for girls like that.

554
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,922
Ah, one or the other.

555
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,606
I'm gonna take her back
to Long Island.

556
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,037
You don't really love her.
You think you love her.

557
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:59,399
How can you tell the difference
between love and thinking it's love?

558
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,359
- You have to be objective.
- Who's objective?

559
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:05,126
I am,
because I'm not in love with her.

560
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,886
- You mean you think you're not.
- Right.

561
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:10,361
Then how can you tell the difference?

562
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,363
Wait a second...

563
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:15,080
Hey, look!

564
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:19,598
- [Yossarian] Look what Aarfy's got.
- Say goodbye, McWatt. Come on!

565
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:24,198
- Figli di puttana!
- My dear, we had a lovely day.

566
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:28,320
Did you see what he did?
Make him tell you what he did.

567
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:34,959
- What'd you do, Aarfy?
- Nothing. Nice girl. Very nice girl.

568
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:38,795
She wanted us to go home with her
to show us a good time.

569
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:42,886
We had a good time. We saw
the Colosseum and other swell sights.

570
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:46,966
- Why didn't you take her home?
- I can't take advantage of a kid.

571
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:50,556
- Old Aarfy's got some principles.
- You've got a diseased mind.

572
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:52,882
She just wanted to jump in the sack.

573
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:55,919
She's mixed up.
I gave her a good talking to.

574
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,878
He did!

575
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:00,725
I straightened her out
and sent her home.

576
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:03,565
- You crazy bastard!
- You're beneath contempt.

577
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:06,838
- He's got a dirty mind.
- I don't see it that way.

578
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:09,845
- They want us to go home with them.
- How much?

579
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:12,003
- $30!
- Who's the little runt?

580
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:13,878
Nately's whore's kid sister.

581
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:17,283
I wanna spend some time with my girl.
I'll pay for us.

582
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:20,444
Give her the 30 bucks
and send the other two away.

583
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:23,081
She'll be angry with me
for making her work.

584
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:26,722
She said if I really loved her,
I'd sleep with the other two.

585
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,758
I swear, you fellas...!

586
00:46:29,647 --> 00:46:31,956
Come on, Yossarian, let's go!

587
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,158
Go on, you go.

588
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:38,958
- What's wrong?
- What isn't wrong?

589
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:43,319
- Two more missions and we go home.
- You know what's gonna happen.

590
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:47,201
No. Some replacement
pilots came into Naples yesterday.

591
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:48,646
- Who says?
- Milo.

592
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:51,326
He just left there
with loads of coconuts.

593
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:54,837
We'll never see those replacements
or those coconuts.

594
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:58,004
Cathcart wouldn't dare
raise the number again.

595
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,518
- Who's gonna stop him?
- [bicycle bell]

596
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,717
Somebody will.

597
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:11,238
Come on!

All right. I want to get this clear.

As I see it, we're giving these men
medals for doing a lousy job, right?

604
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,843
That's not quite the situation.

- You better.

Yesterday's mission was to bomb
a town called Ferrara.

608
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:37,361
Ferrara?

609
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,161
- Why Ferrara?
- What do you mean, "Why Ferrara?"

610
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:45,280
- Do you know what Ferrara is?
- It's a town on a hill.

611
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:48,876
- Do you know what's in that town?
- Five minutes to target.

- What's in it?
- Nothing.

613
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:54,846
- What?
- Nothing. No Germans, no munitions,

614
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:58,357
no railroad crossing,
no harbour, nothing.

615
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:04,401
- Nothing at all?
- No, except people. Italian people.

616
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:06,597
And a monastery.

617
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:11,322
Yossarian, maybe it's some kind
of strategy thing.

00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:16,804
- What the hell are we doing?
- It's not our business to ask.

619
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,645
- Whose business is it?
- Four minutes.

620
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:23,077
- Are you ready to go in?
- Get ready to dump.

621

- We're not there yet!
- Get away, Aardvark!

622
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:29,563
- You'll screw up the whole mission!
- What's going on?

- Get ready to turn!
- What are you doing?

00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:35,364
- Cut it out, Yossarian!

Yes, sir. A marvellous bomb pattern.

We have aerial photographs
if you'd like to see them.

628
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:59,997
We're decorating men who dropped
20 tons of very expensive bombs

629

- on the Mediterranean?
- If you consider the alternative...

630
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:08,803
The alternative is that we take
the whole crew out and shoot 'em.

631
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:12,601
- Might be a problem there, sir.
- All right, I know.

632
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:17,084
If we can't shoot the sons
of bitches, we can court-martial 'em,

Why doesn't Daneeka jump?
He's got a chute.

752
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,364
I'm right here, Sergeant.
I'm not in the plane.

753
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:16,477
Jump, Doc, jump!

754
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:20,644
Jump. Jump, Doc...

755
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:22,678
Please jump.

756
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:27,805
Jump. Jump!

757
01:01:39,807 --> 01:01:41,798
Poor Hungry Joe.

758
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:45,642
Poor McWatt.

759
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:47,882
Poor Doc.

760
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:50,999
Yeah. Poor Doc.

761
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,642
I'll need a full report on this,
Captain Yossarian.

762
01:01:57,687 --> 01:02:02,556
Yossarian.
I haven't seen you in some time.

763
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:06,363
Not since...

764
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:11,884
- Snowden's funeral.
- Snowden.

765
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:19,403
- Do you want to say something, sir?
- What?

766
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:23,996
I just wondered
if you wanted to say anything.

767
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:28,438
No, I didn't actually know
the young fellow.

768
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:33,356
It was his first mission.
Did you know him, Danby?

769
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:37,286
No, I don't think I ever
heard the name. What was it?

770
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:40,319
- Snowden, I think.
- Oh, yes.

771
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:45,156
Well, I'll just read something.

772
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:48,040
Yes, you...you do that.

773
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:55,963
- Is something wrong?
- No, I just thought I saw something.

774
01:02:56,007 --> 01:02:58,601
[clears throat]

775
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:02,276
- A naked man in a tree?
- Yes, that's it.

776
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:10,276
- That's just Yossarian.
- Oh.

777
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:14,683
Oh. Well, in that case...

778
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:21,246
"The...Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

779
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,484
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures..."

780
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:27,121
Hey!

781
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:32,036
- I've been looking all over for you.
- You should've looked in this tree.

782
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:36,319
I don't want to butt in but why
aren't you wearing your uniform?

783
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:38,562
- I don't want to.
- Aha.

784
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:43,681
I want you to do something for me.
I want to serve this to the men.

785
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:46,719
Taste it and let me know
what you think.

786
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,839
- What is it?
- Chocolate-covered cotton.

787
01:03:54,007 --> 01:03:55,998
- Are you crazy?
- No good?

788
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,117
You didn't take the seeds out!

789
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,727
- Is it really that bad?
- It's cotton!

790
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,406
- They've got to learn to like it.
- Why?

791
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:07,520
I saw a chance to corner the market,
I didn't know there'd be a glut.

792
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:11,560
I've got warehouses full all over
Europe. I can't get rid of it.

793
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:15,043
People eat cotton candy.
This is better, it's real cotton.

794
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:19,319
- People can't eat cotton!
- They've got to, for the syndicate.

795
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:23,360
It will make them sick. Try it
yourself if you don't believe me.

796
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:26,444
- I did and it made me sick.
- [gunshots]

797
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,396
Look at that. Looks like a funeral.

798
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,325
It's that kid
that got killed in my plane.

799
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:38,440
- Oh? What happened to him?
- He got killed.

800
01:04:38,487 --> 01:04:39,761
[gunshots]

801
01:04:39,807 --> 01:04:43,402
- What?
- [Yossarian] I said he got killed.

802
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,642
I'm sorry.

803
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:52,761
- He was your friend?
- Maybe, I don't know.

804
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,999
- He was very old.
- But he was a boy.

805
01:04:58,047 --> 01:05:01,323
Well, he died.
You don't get any older than that.

806
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:15,159
- Where do you work?
- I'm not a whore.

807
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,198
I didn't say you were.

808
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,478
- I work in big American company.
- Me, too!

809
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:24,437
- You want to see me again?
- Mm.

810
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,126
- Why?
- Why not?

811
01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:30,317
You think I'm beautiful?

812
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,837
- I think you're perfect.
- That's not true.

813
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:36,162
- It is true.
- No.

814
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,122
See this?

815
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:43,398
- Jesus, how did you...?
- Air raid.

816
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,598
- Germans?
- Americani.

817
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,602
[sighs]

818
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:58,880
You do not want me now?

819
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:02,363
What are you talking about?
I want you everything.

820
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:04,762
- I want you to marry me.
- You crazy.

821
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,241
- Why?
- You can't want to marry me.

822
01:06:07,287 --> 01:06:09,847
- Why not?
- I'm not a virgin.

823
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:12,606
- So?
- Nobody wants a girl who isn't.

824
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:16,196
- I do. I wanna marry you.
- Not possible.

825
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:18,317
- Why not?
- Because you crazy.

826
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:21,120
- Why am I crazy?
- Because you want to marry me.

827
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:26,116
You won't marry me because I'm crazy,
I'm crazy because I wanna marry you?

828
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,397
- You're crazy.
- Why?

829
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:33,685
Because I love you.
Ti amo. Ti amo molto.

830
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:38,123
How can you love a girl
who is not a virgin?

831
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:40,522
Because I can't marry you.

832
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,843
Why you can't marry me?
Because I'm not a virgin?

833
01:06:43,887 --> 01:06:45,878
No, because you're crazy!

834
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:47,804
- You crazy!
- You're crazy!

835
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:51,601
- You all crazy!
- Why are we crazy?

836
01:06:51,647 --> 01:06:54,684
Because you don't know
how to stay alive

837
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:57,241
and that's the secret of life.

838
01:06:57,287 --> 01:06:59,357
But we have a war to win.

839
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:03,605
Ah. But America will lose the war.
Italy will win it.

840
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:06,525
America's the strongest nation
on earth.

841
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:11,357
The American fighter is the best
trained, best equipped, best fed...

842
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:16,037
Exactly. Italy, however, is
one of the weakest nations on earth

843
01:07:16,087 --> 01:07:21,002
and the Italian fighting man
is hardly equipped at all.

844
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:25,882
That's why my country is doing so
well while yours is doing so poorly.

845
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:29,964
That's silly!
Italy was occupied by the Germans

846
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:31,998
and is now being occupied by us.

847
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:34,766
- You call that doing well?
- Of course I do.

848
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:38,482
The Germans are being driven out
and we are still here.

849
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:42,042
In a few years, you'll be gone
and we'll still be here.

850
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:45,124
You see, Italy is a very poor,
weak country,

851
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:48,364
yet that is what makes us so strong,

852
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:54,004
strong enough to survive this war
and still be in existence

853
01:07:54,047 --> 01:07:57,164
long after your country
has been destroyed.

854
01:07:57,207 --> 01:08:00,404
What are you saying?
America won't be destroyed.

855
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:04,076
- Never?
- Well...

856
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:07,278
Rome was destroyed.
Greece was destroyed.

857
01:08:07,327 --> 01:08:11,115
Persia was destroyed.
Spain was destroyed.

858
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:15,843
All great countries are destroyed.
Why not yours?

859
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:20,244
How much longer do you think
your country will last?

860
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:21,879
Forever?

861
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:29,637
Well, forever is a long time,
I guess.

862
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:31,484
Very long.

863
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:33,961
[woman, laughing] Ciao.

864
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:38,756
- Please, we're talking.
- We go to bed now?

865
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:43,642
No. Would you go put some clothes on?
You're practically naked.

866
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,281
Mmm! [giggling]

867
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:49,205
I wish she wouldn't
walk around like that.

868
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:52,319
But it is her business
to walk around like that.

869
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:55,564
- But it's not nice.
- Of course it's nice.

870
01:08:55,607 --> 01:08:57,962
Mmm, she's nice to look at.

871
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,966
This life is not nice.
I don't want her to do this.

872
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:07,125
[woman] When we go to America?
[sister] When we go to America?

873
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:12,400
You will take her to America?
Away from a healthy, active life?

874
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:17,680
Away from good business
opportunities? Away from her friends?

875
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:21,959
- Don't you have any principles?
- Of course not.

876
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:26,046
- No morality?
- I'm a very moral man.

877
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:29,762
[chuckling]
And Italy is a very moral country.

878
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:33,641
That's why we will certainly
come out on top again

879
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:36,759
if we succeed in being defeated.

880
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:38,684
You talk like a madman.

881
01:09:38,727 --> 01:09:41,844
But I live like a sane one.

882
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:46,765
I was a Fascist
when Mussolini was on top.

883
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,846
Now that he has been deposed,
I am anti-Fascist.

884
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:56,206
When the Germans were here,
I was fanatically pro-German.

885
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:58,841
Now I'm fanatically pro-America!

886
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:04,996
You'll find no more loyal partisan
in all of Italy than myself.

887
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:08,680
You're a shameful opportunist!

888
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:12,686
It's better to die on your feet
than to live on your knees.

889
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:15,195
You have it backwards.

890
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:19,320
It's better to live on your feet
than to die on your knees.

891
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,757
- I know.
- How do you know?

892
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:27,595
Because I am 107 years old.

893
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,643
How old are you?

894
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,564
I'll be 20 in January.

895
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:39,076
If you live.

896
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:45,164
[door opens]

897
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,517
- Ciao, Yossarian.
- Hiya, how are ya?

898
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:52,162
We gotta go back.
All the leaves have been cancelled.

899
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:54,801
- Ciao, Yossarian.
- Hello, my dear.

900
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:58,681
You give me a dollar? I pay you back
when we get to America.

901
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:03,437
OK. Just one. Just one.
One! Gimme that. Here.

902
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:06,285
Come on, Dobbs.
Milo's gonna fly us back.

903
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:09,285
- Why are the leaves cancelled?
- I don't know.

904
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:12,285
Milo says the base is on
some kind of alert.

905
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:15,956
Oh, yeah. Cathcart raised
the number of missions to 80.

906
01:11:16,007 --> 01:11:17,759
- 80!
- Yeah.

907
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,402
He's mad because Captain Orr
lost another airplane.

908
01:11:21,447 --> 01:11:23,039
Where?

909
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:27,239
Ditched coming back from Bologna,
went down in the Mediterranean.

910
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,323
Air-Sea Rescue out there?

911
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,239
Yeah.

912
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:34,676
They picked up everybody but Orr.

913
01:11:45,607 --> 01:11:49,680
Will you fellas stay away
from the airstrip tonight?

914
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:54,276
- What for?
- Just do as I say.

915
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:58,444
- Stay in your tents.
- Why?

916
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:02,676
- There it is.
- What?

917
01:12:02,727 --> 01:12:04,922
[Milo] Orr's plane!

918
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,996
Oh, he'll find his way back.
He always does.

919
01:12:10,047 --> 01:12:12,038
[Yossarian] He'll turn up,

920
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:15,238
he'll sneak in
with that rat-toothed giggle.

921
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:22,038
Aarfy, if anything happens to me,
will you take care of my girl?

922
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,157
Listen to him, "his" girl!

923
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:26,198
- Yossarian?
- Don't worry.

924
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:30,604
Nothing's gonna happen to you
that won't happen to the rest of us.

925
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,844
[Yossarian] 'Orr?

926
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:47,878
'Orr?'

927
01:12:49,007 --> 01:12:51,043
Orr?

928
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:55,437
Orr.

929
01:12:56,487 --> 01:13:00,844
- I'll be through in a minute.
- No, you won't. You always say that,

930
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:05,358
then I watch you fit some tiny thing
into that masterpiece of junk.

931
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:10,197
- Then I guess you haven't seen it.
- You guess I haven't seen what?

932
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:14,160
A little square gasket,
about this big.

933
01:13:14,207 --> 01:13:15,959
- Have you seen it?
- No.

934
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:20,239
- I'll have to start all over again.
- Please don't do that.

935
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:23,757
- Why?
- It gives me a terrible pain.

936
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:26,958
- Why?
- Why what?

937
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:28,998
Why won't you fly with me?

938
01:13:29,047 --> 01:13:33,120
What's that got to do with the pain
that you and your bolts give me?

939
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:35,556
It's got everything to do with it.

940
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:37,916
Are you trying to tell me something?

941
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:41,926
Just that if you were smart,
you'd fly with me.

942
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:45,323
- You've cracked up three planes.
- Four.

943
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,164
I'm a good pilot.

944
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:50,358
- I don't want to end up in the sea.
- You'd thank me.

945
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:53,558
- For getting me drowned?
- For finishing this stove.

946
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:56,804
Winter's coming.
You'll have heat, hot water...

947
01:13:56,847 --> 01:13:59,919
You'll be able to boil eggs
and everything.

948
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:04,757
- Me? Where are you gonna be?
- I dunno. Here and there.

949
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:08,846
No one wants to fly with you.
You're a one-man disaster area.

950
01:14:08,887 --> 01:14:12,641
- They're crazy.
- I agree with them.

951
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,678
You're crazy.

952
01:14:42,407 --> 01:14:44,716
Orr?

953
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:09,678
Orr?

954
01:15:41,607 --> 01:15:43,199
Orr?

955
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,966
[Doc] He's dead.
[Yossarian] Who's "he"?

956
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:48,202
He's just a kid from my home town.

957
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:51,523
He just died.
They came from the States to see him.

958
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:54,161
- Get in the bed, will you?
- What?

959
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:58,644
His mother, father and brother flew
out here. They know he's dying.

960
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,599
- So what do you want me to do?
- Be him.

961
01:16:01,647 --> 01:16:04,719
Just for a few minutes,
then they'll go away.

962
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:08,157
They came 5,000 miles
to see you before you die.

963
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:11,324
- I'm not dying.
- Of course you are, we all are.

964
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:14,484
Doc, they'll know!
They came to see their son.

965
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:16,597
They'll have to take
what they can get.

966
01:16:16,647 --> 01:16:19,684
One dying boy
is as good as another. Or as bad!

967
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:22,844
- It won't work.
- Look, they've come a long way.

968
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:27,085
I don't wanna disappoint them.
I'm sentimental about old people.

969
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:31,279
- What if they start crying?
- They probably will start crying.

970
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:36,321
I'll wait outside and if it gets
sticky, I'll come in and break it up.

971
01:16:37,687 --> 01:16:39,678
I don't think it's gonna work.

972
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:42,878
Look, do this for me
and I'll do something for you.

973
01:16:42,927 --> 01:16:45,725
- Will you ground me?
- You know I can't.

974
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:49,806
You can write a slip saying I'm
on the verge of a nervous collapse.

975
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:51,678
Sure I can.

976
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:02,842
But there's a catch.

977
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:09,324
- Catch-22.
- Group won't approve my action.

978
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:11,597
They'll put you back on combat status

979
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:14,036
and send me to rot in
the Pacific Ocean.

980
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,123
- [knocking]
- God, here they are.

981
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:17,839
Start dying.

982
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:21,800
Do this for me and I'll send you
to Rome on a five-day R and R.

983
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,923
He looks terrible.

984
01:17:40,967 --> 01:17:44,118
- He's sick, Pa.
- Harvey?

985
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,838
My name is Yossarian.

986
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:50,276
His name is Yossarian, Ma.

987
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:55,242
Yossarian, don't you recognise me?

988
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:59,200
I'm your brother John.
Don't you know who I am?

989
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:03,035
- Sure I do. You're my brother John.
- Pa, he knows me.

990
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:08,036
Yossarian, look, here's Papa.
Say hello to Papa.

991
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:11,045
- Hello, Papa.
- Hello, Harvey.

992
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:14,523
- His name is Yossarian, Pa.
- He looks so bad.

993
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:18,321
He's very sick, Pa.
The Doctor says he's gonna die.

994
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:23,566
- Harvey?
- Ma, his name is Yossarian.

995
01:18:24,607 --> 01:18:27,804
She doesn't remember things too good
any more.

996
01:18:27,847 --> 01:18:32,204
It's OK. She can call me Harvey
if she wants to.

997
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:36,002
Harvey.

998
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:38,038
Psst.

999
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:44,119
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1000
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:46,362
[Yossarian] I know.

1001
01:18:50,047 --> 01:18:52,197
We came all the way from New York.

1002
01:18:52,247 --> 01:18:55,523
We were afraid
we wouldn't get here in time.

1003
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:59,879
- In time for what?
- In time to see you before you died.

1004
01:19:00,927 --> 01:19:03,395
What difference would it make?

1005
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,723
[John] We didn't want you to die
by yourself.

1006
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:08,997
What difference would it make?

1007
01:19:09,047 --> 01:19:13,040
He's getting delirious,
he keeps repeating the same thing.

1008
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:16,841
- [sobbing] Harvey.
- It's not Harvey, it's Yossarian.

1009
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:19,765
What difference does it make?
He's dying.

Listen, kid. It's-it's not bad.

1012
01:19:53,127 --> 01:19:55,721
I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it.

1013
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:32,357
There. It's good.
It's a good bandage.

1014
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:34,841
I'm cold.

1015
01:20:34,887 --> 01:20:37,481
Cold. God.

1016
01:20:37,527 --> 01:20:41,998
It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.

- It's me, Nately.

Nately. What's happening?
Jesus, it's 3:30 in the morning.

1022
01:21:16,727 --> 01:21:21,198
It's Dobbs, we've gotta stop him.
He's gonna kill the Colonel.

- Cathcart?
- Yes.

Nothing. It's the first sane thing
I've ever done.

01:41:31,807 --> 01:41:35,436
Oh, no, not me.
I never paid for it in my life.

1205

[jeep pulls up outside, doors slam]

1206
01:41:38,247 --> 01:41:41,956
[man] Come on, get back!
Back up, folks.

1207
01:41:50,087 --> 01:41:54,080
Aarfy, are you insane?
They're gonna throw you in jail.

1208
01:41:55,407 --> 01:41:58,717
You just killed a girl.
She's lying in the street!

1209
01:41:58,767 --> 01:42:02,601
She has no right to be there,
you know. It's after curfew.

1210
01:42:14,847 --> 01:42:17,839
Don't you realise what you've done?

1211
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:21,436
You've murdered a human being!
They can hang you!

1212
01:42:21,487 --> 01:42:25,196
I don't think they'll do that,
not to good old Aarfy.

1213
01:42:25,247 --> 01:42:29,923
They won't care about one Italian
girl when thousands die every day.

1214
01:42:29,967 --> 01:42:32,959
Aarfy, listen.
They're coming to arrest you.

1215
01:42:33,007 --> 01:42:36,795
You can't take the life of another
human and get away with it!

1216
01:42:36,847 --> 01:42:41,045
- They're coming to get you!
- [footsteps pounding up stairs]

1217
01:42:51,367 --> 01:42:53,562
- Captain Yossarian?
- Yes?

1218
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:56,326
- You're under arrest.
- But I didn't...

1219
01:42:57,367 --> 01:42:59,483
You're AWOL.

1220
01:42:59,527 --> 01:43:01,643
[sirens approaching]

1221
01:43:03,847 --> 01:43:06,645
[Cathcart] 'We're sending you home.'
[Yossarian] 'What?'

1222
01:43:08,287 --> 01:43:10,801
I said we're sending you home.

1223
01:43:10,847 --> 01:43:15,637
[Korn] You've made things terribly
difficult for Colonel Cathcart.

1224
01:43:15,687 --> 01:43:19,680
The men are unhappy,
morale is beginning to deteriorate.

1225
01:43:19,727 --> 01:43:23,561
- It's all your fault.
- It's his, for raising the number.

1226
01:43:23,607 --> 01:43:27,486
[Korn] You refuse to fly.
[Cathcart] Have you no patriotism?

1227
01:43:27,527 --> 01:43:31,759
Wouldn't you give your life for your
country? For Colonel Korn and me?

1228
01:43:31,807 --> 01:43:35,163
What have you and Colonel Korn
got to do with my country?

1229
01:43:35,207 --> 01:43:39,439
You're a disgrace to your country!
How did you get to be a captain?

1230
01:43:39,487 --> 01:43:43,685
- You promoted me.
- That has got nothing to do with it!

1231
01:43:43,727 --> 01:43:46,605
Let me. Let me.

1232
01:43:46,647 --> 01:43:51,675
Captain, I'd like to appeal to
your better judgment one more time.

1233
01:43:51,727 --> 01:43:55,879
There's a mission about to start.
You can get on that plane

1234
01:43:55,927 --> 01:43:59,681
and we'll just pretend
that all of this never happened.

1235
01:43:59,727 --> 01:44:04,642
Yossarian, won't it make you feel
proud to know you served in an outfit

1236
01:44:04,687 --> 01:44:08,919
that averaged more combat missions
per person than any other?

1237
01:44:08,967 --> 01:44:11,276
Don't you want more unit citations

1238
01:44:11,327 --> 01:44:14,444
and more oak-leaf clusters
on your air medal?

1239
01:44:14,487 --> 01:44:18,400
Don't you want to contribute
further to this fleet record

1240
01:44:18,447 --> 01:44:20,642
by flying more missions?

1241
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,200
No.

1242
01:44:23,247 --> 01:44:27,718
[Korn] In that case,
we'll just have to send you home.

1243
01:44:27,767 --> 01:44:30,201
Of course, there's one catch.

1244
01:44:31,487 --> 01:44:33,284
Yeah? What's that?

1245
01:44:34,367 --> 01:44:38,918
Well, we will issue orders
sending you back to the States

1246
01:44:38,967 --> 01:44:43,324
and there's one thing
you have to do for us in return.

1247
01:44:43,367 --> 01:44:45,562
What would that be?

1248
01:44:53,727 --> 01:44:56,002
Like us.

1249
01:45:11,727 --> 01:45:14,195
Like you?

1250
01:45:15,447 --> 01:45:17,244
Like us.

1251
01:45:17,287 --> 01:45:20,996
You'll be surprised how easy it is
to like us once you begin.

1252
01:45:21,047 --> 01:45:24,164
You see, we're going to put you
on Easy Street.

1253
01:45:24,207 --> 01:45:28,166
[Cathcart] Make you a major.
[Korn] Give you another medal.

1254
01:45:28,207 --> 01:45:32,086
- Send you home a hero.
- You'll have parades in your honour.

1255
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:35,483
You can make speeches,
raise money for war bonds.

1256
01:45:35,527 --> 01:45:38,758
[Korn] And all you have to do
is be our pal.

1257
01:45:38,807 --> 01:45:41,321
[Cathcart] Say nice things about us.

1258
01:45:41,367 --> 01:45:45,519
[Korn] Tell the folks at home
what a good job we're doing.

1259
01:45:45,567 --> 01:45:47,717
[plane roars by]

1260
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:51,641
Take our offer, Yossarian.

1261
01:45:51,687 --> 01:45:55,999
[Cathcart] It's either that
or a court martial for desertion.

1262
01:46:02,887 --> 01:46:07,438
What about the others?
I'd be playing a dirty trick on them.

1263
01:46:07,487 --> 01:46:12,356
[Korn] They'll be happy you're gone.
[Cathcart] They have a war to win.

1264
01:46:16,967 --> 01:46:18,958
Well, what the hell.

1265
01:46:19,007 --> 01:46:22,317
If they don't want more missions,
let them say so.

1266
01:46:22,367 --> 01:46:25,643
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

1267
01:46:29,167 --> 01:46:31,362
It's a deal.

- What?
- 'Help him! Help him!'

1274

- Help who?
- 'Help the bombardier!'

1275

- I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.

It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.

- Yep.

Well, you're going home.

- I don't know if I am.
- I've got your orders right here.

1290
01:49:58,847 --> 01:50:02,920
That parade they're rehearsing
is for you. You're a hero.

And you're gonna get a medal for
stopping that Nazi killing Cathcart.

That wasn't a nazi.
That was Nately's whore.

01:50:11,967 --> 01:50:15,846
She tried to kill me
because I told her about Nately.

- But-but the Colonel said that...
- It's a deal I made with them.

They send me home a hero

about them back in the States.

Oh.

That's a lousy deal, isn't it?

- Isn't it?
- Well...

1300

Isn't it?

What are you here for?

1303

I'm not too sure about that either.

1304

What would you do if you were me?

1305

I don't know. I mean, I'm not you.

Imagine that you are me.

1307
01:51:13,887 --> 01:51:19,086
That's hard. Sometimes I even have
trouble imagining that I'm me,

if you know what I mean.

1309
01:51:24,847 --> 01:51:27,077
Well, I'm gonna call the deal off.

1310
01:51:27,127 --> 01:51:31,040
Let them send me home
because I've flown over 50 missions.

- That's their problem.

No, it's yours because
they'll court-martial you.

- No.

No what?

1315

I've been lying in this bed
for three weeks thinking about it

1316

and all I know is
I don't want to go to prison

1317

and I can't play Cathcart's game.

1318

Well, what else can you do?

1319
01:52:00,407 --> 01:52:02,796
I can run away.

1320
01:52:03,847 --> 01:52:06,122
- You'd desert?
- Why not?

1321
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:09,125
How would you get off the base?
That's insane.

1322
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:11,442
That's why it's so sensible.

1323

They'll call you a coward.
It's your country.

- He rowed?
- In that tiny little raft!

Think of that, all the way to Sweden!

- He'll sit out the rest of the war.
- It's a miracle!

1345

It's no miracle.
He has to have planned it.

- He went to Sweden deliberately?
- It's 4,000 miles away!

He always said that
crash-landing was good practice.

- Getting shot down in the sea.
