00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
MORNING, CONSUL.

5
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
HOW GOES YOUR DAY?

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
( grunting )

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,100
STOP!

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU.

9
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,300
OUR NAME IS REDEEMED.
THE REPUBLIC IS SAFE.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
IT WAS HORRIBLE,
MOTHER.

11
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
HE WOULDN'T DIE.
( shudders )

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,500
BUT HE IS DEAD
NOW, EH?

13
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
HE TRIED TO SPEAK TO ME.

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,300
BUT NO WORDS CAME OUT.

15
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,900
WE MUST BE STRONG NOW.

16
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,100
YES.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
THE SENATE WILL LOOK
TO US FOR LEADERSHIP.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
THE PEOPLE WILL NEED
A FIRM HAND.

19
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
HM?

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
ARE YOU UP
TO THE TASK?

21
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
( sobbing )

22
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,700
DOMINUS.

23
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,000
( sobbing )

24
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,700
WHO ARE YOU?
WHOSE CHILD IS THIS?

25
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,800
WHAT DID YOU DO?
LET HIM GO, LET HIM GO!

26
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,800
- ( grunting )
- NO, NO, DON'T!

27
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,900
PLEASE HAVE MERCY.

28
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
( sobbing )

29
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,800
I CURSE YOU.
CURSE YOU.

30
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,500
( spits )

31
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,800
I CURSE YOU ALL!

32
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,400
BY ALL THE GODS BELOW.

33
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,100
I CURSE YOU
TO DAMNATION.

34
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,900
( all crying )

35
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
( grunts )

36
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
Man:
CAESAR IS DEAD!
CAESAR IS DEAD!

37
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
HE'S DEAD!
HE'S DEAD!

38
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
CAESAR IS DEAD!

 <i>( garbled shouting )</i>

Man:
 <i>LEAVE IT, FORGET IT.</i>

41
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,700
Man:
 <i>YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID!</i>

42
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,100
( sobbing )

43
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,300
MOTHER?

44
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
LEAVE ME ALONE.

45
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,200
GODS, NOT YOU AS WELL?
CRYING WILL NOT HELP US.

46
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
I'M NOT CRYING.
I'M ANGRY.

47
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,500
MAY DIS DEVOUR
THAT BITCH PIG SERVILIA.

48
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
WHAT A FOOL I WAS.

49
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,500
IF I'D NOT TOLD HER
OF VORENUS AND HIS WIFE...

50
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
LISTEN TO ME.
WE MUST NEVER SPEAK
OF OUR PART IN THIS.

51
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,500
IT MAY BE MISTAKEN
FOR COMPLICITY.

52
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- <i>( door opens )</i>

53
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
I'LL SEE HER
EATEN BY DOGS.

54
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
WE MAY HOPE.

55
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
DOMINUS,
TIMON IS HERE.

56
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
TIMON, GOOD OF YOU
TO COME.

57
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
( panting )
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
- BAD BUSINESS.
- IT IS.

59
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,700
YOUR MOTHER'S
ALL RIGHT, IS SHE?

60
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
SHE'S NOT
RECEIVING VISITORS.

61
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,600
BUT SHE'S WELL ENOUGH.
HAVE YOU MEN WITH YOU?

62
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
10. SO, SHE'S
ALL RIGHT, THEN?

63
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
AS I SAID.
HOW'S THE CITY?

64
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,300
ALL'S INDOORS.
EVERYWHERE'S DEAD QUIET.

65
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
TIMON, THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I AM SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

67
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,600
I CAME AS SOON
AS I HEARD.

68
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,300
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.

69
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,500
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,
THANK YOU.

70
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,200
ARE THE STREETS SAFE?
CAN WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
- WE CAN.
- <i>WE SHOULD WAIT A WHILE,</i>

72
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION.
WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR VIEW
OF THE POSITION.

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
- ANTONY MAY WELL--
-  ANTONY WERE ALIVE,
 HE WOULD COME TO ME.

74
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
OR SEND WORD,
AT LEAST.

75
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I MUST ASSUME
ANTONY IS DEAD.

76
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE,
BUT WE CANNOT KNOW
THAT AS YET.

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
PERHAPS HE'S
FLED THE CITY.

78
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,200
AND LEAVE ME HERE?
NEVER.

79
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,000
PUT ON YOUR
TRAVELING CLOTHES.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
- NOTHING FANCY.
- MOTHER, THINK.

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
YOU HEARD WHAT SERVILIA SAID.
SHE WANTS YOU TO RUN AWAY.

82
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
MORE FOOL HER.
LET HER TRY TO FIND ME.

83
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,900
SHE WILL FIND YOU.
YOU HAVE NO TALENT FOR HIDING.

84
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,800
CASTOR, PACK THE MONEY
AND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS.

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
IMMEDIATELY,
DOMINA.

86
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
COME ALONG,
NO TIME TO WASTE.

87
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,000
( panting )

88
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,500
( spits )

89
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
ANTONY.

90
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,000
I SWEAR ON THE BLACK STO
THAT I WILL KILL THEM ALL.

91
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,000
BRUTUS AND CASSIUS
AND CASCA AND THE WHOLE
DAMN LOT OF THEM.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,900
EY'RE JUST
SERVILIA'S MINIONS.
THIS IS ALL HER DOING.

93
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,300
I TOLD CAESAR.

94
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
I TOLD HIM
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I SWEAR, I WILL PISS
ON THEM AS THEY DIE.

96
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,200
THAT I-- I SHOULD
HAVE RUN AND HIDE

97
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
FROM THOSE--
THOSE WORMS.

98
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,000
ARE YOU CERTAIN?
ARE YOU CERTAIN SURE
HE'S DEAD?

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,300
OH, YEAH.
HE'S DEAD ALL RIGHT.

100
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
I WAS THERE,
I SAW HIM.

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,700
YOU WERE THERE?

102
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
BUT THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU STOP THEM?

103
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,400
I-I WASN'T THERE.

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
I WAS--
THEY DELAYED ME

105
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,100
OUTSIDE ON THE STEPS.
BY THE TIME I GOT INSIDE
THE DEED HAD BEEN DONE.

106
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,100
AND THE LICTORS HAD ALL
RUN OFF LIKE RABBITS.

107
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
THAT TREACHEROUS
BASTARD VORENUS,

108
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
PAID OFF.

109
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,000
HE'D LEFT US
BEFORE WE EVEN GOT
TO THE SENATE HOUSE.

110
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,600
HE WAS LURED AWAY.

111
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,000
THE WITCH SERVILIA'S WOMAN
TOLD HIM AN EVIL TALE
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

112
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
- OH.
- WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

113
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,000
WHAT DID I DO?

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
WHY, NOTHING
I COULD DO.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
CAESAR WAS DEAD.
I WAS UNARMED.

116
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,300
WELL I WOULD HAVE...

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,600
RIPPED THEM TO PIECES
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

118
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

119
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,600

12 MANGY DOGS
CAN KILL A LION.

120
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

121
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,300
WHAT SHALL WE
DO NOW?

122
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE.

123
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
I WILL GO NORTH...

124
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
AND RAISE AN ARMY
OF MONSTERS.

125
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,700
THEN I WILL
COME BACK HERE

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
AND I WILL CRUCIFY
EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE
SONS OF BITCHE

127
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I MAY "DO AS I LIKE"?

128
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,400
WHY ARE YOU HERE
IF I MAY DO AS I LIKE?

129
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I MEANT NOTHING.
OF COURSE I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,500
PLEASE,  YOU'D RATHER
TAKE SOME OTHER LOVER,
I WILL NOT PROTEST.

131
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
OH, I MEANT ONLY THAT--

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
THAT I CANNOT FORCE YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,100
THAT'S WHERE YOU WER
THESE LAST HOURS, I SUPPOSE?

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,700
PUTTING YOUR WHORES INTO--
INTO BAGGAGE CARTS.

135
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,900
I HAVE NO STOMACH
FOR A FIGHT WITH YOU.

136
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,600
NOT NOW, EH?

137
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
I DON'T WANT
TO GO NORTH.

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,100
THE NORTH IS GHASTLY.

139
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
( chuckles )

140
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
- TIMON.

141
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
TIMON, WE'RE GOING NORTH.
YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL
PROTECT THE FAMILY

142
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,800
UNTIL I CAN GATHER
MY OWN PEOPLE TOGETHER.

143
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
- IT'LL COST YOU.
- OF COURSE.

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,600
I EXPECT NO PUBLIC
SERVICE FROM A JEW.

145
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
WE SHALL BE TAKING
CALPURNIA WITH US, SO WE
MUST LEAVE VIA THE SUBURA.

146
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,100
CALPURNIA?

147
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
 <i>BUT WHY DO WE NEED</i>
 <i>TO TAKE HER?</i>

148
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
WE MUST BE SURE
THAT SHE IS SAFE.

149
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,100
WELL, I DON'T SEE HER
RUSHING TO SEE THAT
WE'RE SAFE.

150
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
MY DEA WE CANNOT LEAVE
CAESAR'S WIDOW BEHIND.

151
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
IT WOULD LOOK ILL WITH
THE PEOPLE, AS IF WE'D
ABANDONED HER.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
WHAT A BORE.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
( singing in Latin )

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
( grunts )
FATHER.

155
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,100
FATHER, WAKE ME.

156
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
- HUSH.
- WAKE ME.

157
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
HUSH NOW,
BE CALM.

I KNOW I DIDN'T GET US
STARTED OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT--

165
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,900
KILLING YOUR MAN AND ALL,
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

166
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,800
BUT, VA, I'LL JUST COME
STRAIGHT OUT WITH IT.

167
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,900
I HAVE A QUESTION
TO ASK YOU.

WITH PERMISSION
OF VENUS AND MARS...

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,100
I ASK YOU
TO BE MY WIFE.

170
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
YOUR WIFE?
MARRIED?

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,100
MARRIED.
YOU AND ME.

172

IF-- IF YOU
WISH IT SO, MASTER.

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
NO NO NO, I'M NOT
YOUR MASTER ANYMORE.
YORE A FREE WOMAN.

YOU CAN REFUSE ME,
I WON'T BE ANGRY.

175
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,500
WELL, I WON'T BE BEST
PLEASED, BUT YOU KNOW,

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
I WON'T BEAT YOU

177

A MAN LIKE ME
CAN ALWAYS MAKE
GOOD MONEY.

YOU'LL HAVE A ROOF

I'LL BUY YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT, DRESSES, SHOES.

YES.

AN END ON IT.

ANTONY LISTEN, BRUTUS
IS IN A LEGAL BIND.

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,600
I THINK WE CAN FORCE HIM
INTO MAKING A DEAL WITH US.

266
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,000
GO ON.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,900
BRUTUS MUST DECLARE CAESAR
A TYRANT OR ELSE THE ACT
OF KILLING CAESAR IS MURDER.

268
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,700
BUT ALL THE ACTS OF
A TYRANT ARE UNLAWFUL,

CASSIUS AS PROCONSUL,

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
IF BRUTUS HONORS
THE LAW,

273
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,000
HE LOSES ALL RANK
AND POSITION.

274
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
IT'S LAWYERS' PRATTLE.

275
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,600
I DON'T THINK SO.
IF YOU OFFER THEM AMNESTY

276
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
- IN RETURN--
- AMNESTY?

ENOUGH! YOU THINK YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANTONY?

280
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,900

YOU ARE MOTHER TO
THE RICHEST MAN IN ROME.

THERE.

314
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,700
SEE HOW FINE SHE LOOKS?

315
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,400
SHE'LL BE
WELL RESPECTED.

316
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,100
A WOMAN FROM
GOOD PEOPLE.

317
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
HELLO, CHILDREN.

318
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
IMMORTALS!

319
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,000
IMMORTALS, I SAY.

320
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,900
YOU NOBLEMEN HAVE
CARVED YOUR NAMES

321
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,200
DEEP IN THE
ETERNAL STONE.

322
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
THAT IS VERY HIGH
PRAISE INDEED.

323
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
I WOULD EMBRACE YOU ALL
BUT I'M DESOLATED

324
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,000
THAT YOU DID NOT ENLIST ME
IN YOUR COHORT OF HEROES.

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
TO WIELD THE
LIBERATORS' KNIFE--

326
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
WHAT JOY YOU
HAVE DENIED ME.

327
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,700
OH, FORGIVE US.

328
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
BUT WE RATHER THOUGHT
YOU'D PREFER NOT TO KNOW.

329
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
IT IS DONE.

330
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,500
I CANNOT SHARE
IN YOUR GLORY.

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
I CAN ONLY APPLAUD.

332
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,800
( chuckles )

333
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,100
NOW TELL ME,
IS THE CITY SECURE?

334

 <i>WE HAVE 2,000</i>
 <i>MEN UNDER ARMS.</i>

335
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,300
CAESAR'S PEOPLE
HAVE FLED.

336
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,700
THE CITY IS OURS.

337
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,100
EXCELLENT, AND MARK ANTONY,

- <i>HE IS NOT.</i>
- MARK ANTONY IS ALIVE?

339
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,500
AN ERROR!

340
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,900
I THINK,
A DEEP ERROR.

341
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,800
WE ARE SENATORS,
NOT HIRED THUGS.

342
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,100
KILL HIM YOURSELF
IF YOU WANT IT SO.

343
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,600
WELL, WELL YOU
KNOW BEST WHAT IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

344
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
I-I MUST GO.
I'M AWAY TO THE COUNTRY.

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,800
BROTHER?

 SECOND SENTRY, FIRST COHORT.
- WHAT'S HAPPENED?

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,700
FIRST COHORT.

355
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
BROTHER VORENUS,
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

356
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,400
SHE'S MOTHER
TO THE BOY LUCIUS.

357
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
I WAS...
GOING TO KILL HER.

358
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,900
I HAD THE KNIFE
IN MY HAND.

359
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,700
SHE DID IT HERSELF.

360
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
MISERIA.

361
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,300
- WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?
- GONE.

362
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,600
GONE WHERE?

363
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
I CURSED THEM.

364
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,900
I CURSED THEM
TO HADES.

365
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
vi
GET SOME WATER.

366
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,200

00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,100
COME SIT DOWN.

369
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,600
LET'S GET YOU
CLEANED UP, EH?

370
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,500
CONSUL ANTONY,
I AM HERE

371
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
STRICTLY AS AN
IMPARTIAL ARBITER.

372
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,600
I KNEW NOTHING OF
THIS DISTURBING ACT.

373
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,500
OH?

374
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,600
I WAS AS SURPRISED AND--
AND SHOCKED AS YOU WERE.

375
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
 <i>AS BRUTUS CAN CONFIRM.</i>

UH, CICERO KNEW NOTHING.

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
YOU HAVE LOST A GOOD
FRIEND AND PATRON TODAY.

378
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,100
 <i>WE ARE SORRY.</i>

379
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,400
IF THAT MONKEY REMAINS
I SHALL HAVE TO EN HIS NECK.

380
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,000
HE TRIED TO
KILL ME THIS MORNING.
HIS PRESENCE IS AN INSULT.

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,900
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
NO ONE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,700
IT WAS MY EXPRESS ORDER
THAT YOU BE SPARED.

383

AM I, CASSIUS?
MISTAKEN?

384
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
WE DO APOLOGIZE IF
THIS MAN'S BEEN OVERZEALOUS.

 <i>TELL US, ANTONY...</i>

THIS UNEXPECTED PLEASURE?

389
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,000
LISTEN.

390
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
WHY SO QUIET?

391
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,200
A TYRANT IS DEAD.

392
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
SURELY THE PEOPLE
SHOULD BE HAPPY.

393
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,800
WHERE IS THE CHEERING THRONG
AT YOUR DOOR?

394
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,700
WHERE ARE THE JOYOUS CRIES
OF LIBERTY? HM?

395
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
 <i>THE PEOPLE FEAR CHANGE.</i>

396
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
A SOMBER MOOD
IS ONLY NATURAL.

397
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,900
WHEN THEY REALIZE
THEY ARE FREE FROM TYRANNY,

398
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,200
THE PEOPLE WILL BE GLAD.

399
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,700
THE PEOPLE LOVED CAESAR.

400
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,600
AND THEY WILL HATE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

401
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,200
THEY LOVED HIM ONCE.
AS I DID.

402
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
OH, SOME HAVE TURNED
AGAINST HIM, NO DOUBT.

403
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,700
IT CANNOT BE DENIED HE WAS
SOMETHING OF A TYRANT.

404
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,900
BUT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WILL
WORSHIP CAESAR UNTIL THEY DIE.

405
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
 <i>A GREAT MANY.</i>

406
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,700
AND THOSE PEOPLE
ARE MINE NOW.

407
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
WE DO NOT NEED
SUCH PEOPLE.

408
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,800
 <i>OUR MEN-AT-ARMS</i>
 <i>HAVE SECURED THE CITY.</i>

409

REPRESENTATIVES FROM
ALL THE BEST ELEMENTS.

410
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,200
THE SENATE IS WITH US,
THE KNIGHTS ARE WITH US.

411
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,800
THE PONTIFFS, THE URBAN
COHORTS, THE LICTORS' GUILD.

412
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,800
MM, THE LICTORS' GUILD,
VERY GOOD.

413
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,300
ONLY RALLY THE BAKERS
AND THE FLUTPLAYERS,

414
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
AND YOU CAN PUT ON
A FESTIVAL.

415
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
BEST WAIT TILL AFTER
THE ELECTIONS, THOUGH.

416
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
WHAT ELECTIONS?

417
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,800
SURELY YOU'VE THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH?

418
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,700
IF CAESAR WAS,
AS YOU INSIST, A TYRANT,

419
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,400
THEN ALL HIS ACTS
AND APPOINTMENTS
ARE NULLIFIED.

420
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,900
I AM NO LONGER CONSUL,

YOU'RE NO LONGER PRAETOR,
YOU'RE NO LONGER PROCONSUL.

422
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
ELECTIONS WILL
HAVE TO BE HELD.

423
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,600
THAT IS SO.

424
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,800
MESSY THINGS,
ELECTIONS.

425
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
YOU SPOKE OF HELPING US?

426
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100

427
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,000
ALL THOSE TH LOVED CAESAR,
BUT HATE TYRANNY...

428
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,300
I MAY BE ABLE TO BRING
TO YOUR SIDE.

429
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,900
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?


430
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
NEITHER OF US
CAN WIN OUTRIGHT.

431
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,600
NOT WITHOUT MUCH BLOOD
SPILLED TO PROVE THE ISSUE.

432
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
I WANT NO MORE BLOOD.

433
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,700
I WANT PEACE

434
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,300
HOW?

435
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,800
FIRST,
A GENERAL AMNESTY.

436
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,400
CAESAR IS NOT DECLARED TYRANT,
NOR YOU DECLARED KILLERS.

437
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,700
ALL CAESAR'S ACTS
AND HIS WILL

438
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,200
SHALL STAND.

439
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,100
WE SHALL ALL
KEEP OUR POSTS.

440
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,300
IT WL BE AS IF
HE WERE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

441
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
A NATURAL DEATH.

442
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
GO ON.

443
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,200
THEN A SHOW OF UNITY.
A PUBLIC FUNERAL FOR CAESAR,

444
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,800
LED BY YOU AND I
TOGETHER.

445
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,900
WE SHALL MOURN THE MAN
AND BURN THE TYRANT.

446
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,500
AND THEN,
I SHALL SERVE OUT

447
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,300
THE REST
OF MY TERM AS CONSUL,

448
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,900
AND THEN RETIRE QUIETLY
TO THE PROVINCES

449
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,500
WHERE I WILL PLOUGH
MY FIELDS

450
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,300
AND FUCK MY SLAVES.

451
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,000
JUST LIKE OLD
NCINNATUS.

452
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
AND THE REPUBLIC SHALL
ROLL ON WITHOUT ME.

453
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,900
I SWEAR
ON THE BLACK STONE,

454
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,400
I AM DONE WITH POLITICS.

455
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,300
OH, YOU PEOPLE
PLAY TOO ROUGH

456
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,000
FOR A SIMPLE SOLDIER
LIKE ME.

457

KNIVES
IN THE SENATE HOUSE.

458
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,200
DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

459
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,500
AND IF WE DO NOT WISH
TO BE RECONCILED WITH YOU?

460
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,200
WELL, IF WE CANNOT BE FRIENDS,
THEN WE SHALL BE ENEMIES.

461
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500

462
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,400
TO ANNIHILATE YOU.

463
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,100
PERHAPS YOU WOULD GIVE US
SOME TIME TO TALK THIS OVER?

464
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,600
HM.

465

YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU LIKE.

466
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
I SHALL WAIT OUTSIDE.

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,700
YOU TRIED TO KILL HIM
DESPITE EVERYTHING I SAID?

470
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,400
FORGIVE ME.

471
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,700
YOUR SCRUPLES DO YOU CREDIT,
BUT WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE

472
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,800
HIS DEATH COULD NOT HAVE
DISHONORED YOU--

473
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,100
TO THE CONTRARY,
I WILL BE TWICE DISHONORED--

474
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,400
A KILLER AND A FOOL.

475

 <i>IS YOUR HONOR WORTH MORE</i>

IT IS NOT TOO LATE.

477
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,500
HE'S HERE,
IN YOUR HANDS.

478
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,100
 <i>I'M SIMPLY STATING</i>
 <i>THE FACTS.</i>

YOU TO ANY

PARTICULAR CRSE
OF ACTION.

481
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,700
NOR WILL I TAKE THE
COURSE YOU DO NOT URGE.

482
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
BROTHER.

483
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,100
IT IS THE ONLY
RATIONAL THING TO DO.

484
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
HE'S BROKEN
NO CAPITAL LAW.

485
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
AND HE OFFERS A TRUCE
WHICH WILL PRESERVE
THE PUBLIC ORDER.

486
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,900
WE HAVE NO RIGHT
TO TAKE HIS LIFE.

487
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,500
DAMN THE LAW IN HIS CASE.
HE'S TOO DANGEROUS TO LIVE.

488
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,400
YOU EXAGGERATE HIM.
HE IS A VULGAR BEAST.

489
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
WITHOUT CAESAR HE WILL
DESTROY HIMSELF SOON ENOUGH.

490
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
- HE IS--
- HE IS A GUEST IN MY HOUSE.

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,500
HE IS NOT IN THE HOUSE.
HE IS ON THE STREET.

492
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,900

- I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.
- WHAT'S THAT?

503
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,300
I CURSED MY
OWN CHILDREN, PULLO.

504
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,500
IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT.

505
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,900
DON'T WORRY,
THEY'LL BE BACK.

506
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,700
YOU CAN LIFT
THE CURSE THEN,
NO TROUBLE.

507

YOU DIDN'T KILL
AN ANIMAL ON IT,
DID YOU?

508
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,700
- NO.
- THERE YOU GO THEN.

509
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,800
THE CURSE ISN'T SEALED.

510
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,100
AND WHEN THEY COME BACK,
YOU CAN LIFT IT.

511
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,500
NO HARM DONE.

512
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,100
WHAT IF THEY DON'T
COME BACK?

513
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,400
WHERE ELSE
THEY GONNA GO?

514
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,900

COMING BACK.

TOMORROW,

516
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,600
A FUNERAL SERVICE
WILL BE HELD FOR

GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.

518
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,900
UNDER TERMS OF TRU
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF UNITY

519
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,600
AND FORGIVENESS,
EULOGIES WILL BE DELIVERED

520
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,100
BY PRAETOR
MARCUS JUNIUS BRUNUS

521
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,300
AND CONSUL
MARK ANTONY.

522
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,000
NO PROSTITUTES, ACTORS

523
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,200
OR UNCLEAN
TRADESMEN MAY ATTEND.

524
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,400
I AM COME TO PAY
MY RESPECTS TO YOUR HUSBAND.

YOU ARE GRIEVING.

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,600
( spits )

528
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
SHOW HER
WHAT SHE'S DONE.

529
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,300
SO VORENUS WENT HOME
TO CONFRONT HIS WIFE

530
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,000
AND CAESAR WENT TO THE SENATE
ALONE AND UNPROTECTED.

531
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,800
BASTARDS.

532
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,300
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

533
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,600
IS HOW THEY KNEW
ABOUT NIOBE AND ALL THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

534
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
YOU AND I WERE THE ONLY
ONES THAT KNEW THE TRUTH.

535
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,900
I TOLD MY SISTER.

536
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,700
AND SHE TOLD SERVILIA.

537
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,700
MY SISTER WAS--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

538
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
THE JUG IS BROKEN,
I CANNOT MEND IT
WITH REGRET.

539
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,800
I ASK FOR YOUR
FORGIVENESS.

540
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,300
OF COURSE.

541
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,400
I CAN'T EXPECT A YOUNG LAD
LIKE YOURSELF TO BE--

542
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,700
TO BE--
ANYWAY,

543
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,700
IT'S DONE,
AS YOU SAY.

544
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,100
YOU SHOULD NOT REPEAT
WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU.

545
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,900
IT'S NOT THAT I'M ASHAMED,
THOUGH I AM.

546
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,500
IT'S ONLY THAT
IT WILL NOT LOOK GOOD
WITH THE PEOPLE.

547
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
IT'S FORGOTTEN ALREADY.

548
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,700
SORRY ABOUT YOUR UNCLE.

549
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,300
I AM MADE HIS SON

CONGRATULATIONS.

552

VENGEANCE, THEN?

00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
AT SOME POINT.

554
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,100
I'LL BE UP FOR
THE DUTY, OF COURSE.

555

556
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,400
OH COME ON, GET UP.

557
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT DAY IT IS?

558
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,400
OH,
WHAT DAY IS IT?

559
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,700
DON'T PLAY WITH ME.
I'M NOT UP FOR IT TODAY.

560
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,600
AH.
RELAX.

561
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
IT'S GONNA BE MY DAY.

562
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,900
I CAN FEEL IT.

563
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,600
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER FUCKED A WOMAN

564
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
IN A FUNERAL DRESS
BEFORE.

565
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
NOR SHALL YOU NOW.

566
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
THAT'S A SHAME.

COME HERE, OLD GIRL.
JUMP ON.

- HM.

570

COME ON, THIS IS
NO MORNING FOR FOOLERY.
JUST GET UP.

OH COME HERE.

STOP FOOLING AROUND
AND JUSTET UP!

SOMEONE.

NIOBE ON HER WAY NOW.

WE CAN'T LEAVE IT
ANY LONGER, CAN WE?

590
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,300

WILL BE VEXED.

HIM AND HIS FRIENDS
MUST LEAVE THE CITY.
