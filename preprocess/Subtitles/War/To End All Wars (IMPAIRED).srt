I was at the university studying to be
a teacher when the call to arms occurred.

11
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,038
I was only too eager to put aside my studies
for the glory of action.

12
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,054
I stopped reading history
and became a part of it.

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,649

the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders...

My commanding officer was
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart McLean,

16
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,059
the finest commander

And it was our loyalties
that would eventually be tested.

23
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,392
The Argylls had a legacy
or being the last line of defense,

24
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,435

without the Nips seeing you?

480
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:22,201
In the one place that the Nips
will never go near.

481
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,485
- This stench is intolerable.
- Shut your cake hole!

We're doing the best we can.
Get used to it!

483
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,157
Right, lads.
Eh, make yourself as comfortable as you can,

484
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,129
and let's get started, eh?

485
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,502
I'd like to speak to you about Plato.
[Chuckles]

486
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,597
Um...

487
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,733
All right.

488
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,641
What...

489
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,648
is justice?

[Indistinct Shout]

491
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,502
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

492
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,442
- Is it true you're giving educational classes?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,882
We'd like to help teach.

494
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,045
Well, what's your story?

495
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,817
Roger Primrose,
trained in the fine arts.

496
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,882
Lieutenant Foxworth here
used to teach Shakespeare at Cambridge.

497
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,292
I'm his platoon sergeant.

498
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:56,196
Poor blighter's at a loss
without his books and the Bard.

499
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,135
I figure if I can
keep him busy long enough,

500
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,569
he won't end up killing himself.

501
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,237
I'm... not joking, sir.

502
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,543
Well, unfortunately,
we don't have any Shakespeare.

503
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,409
To die, to sleep...

504
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,420
no more...

505
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,514
and by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

506
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,049
and the thousand natural shocks
that fesh is heir to.

507
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,291
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

508
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,732
To die, to sleep...

509
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,703
to sleep,
perchance to dream.

510
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,763
Ay, there's the rub,
for in that sleep of death...

511
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:42,744
what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

512
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,214
must give us pause.

513
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:51,346
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

514
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,517
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time.

515
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,255
Th'oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

516
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,889
the pangs of despised love,

517
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:06,095
the law's delay,
the insolence of office...

518
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,128
Hmm. Looks like we do have
the old Bard after all, sir.

519
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,108
- Looks like we do.
- He'll handle it.

520
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,569
[Whispers]
Come on, Foxworth.

521
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:28,322
Th' oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

522
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,920
the pangs of despised love,
the law's delay,

523
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,328
the insolence of office,
and the spurns...

524
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:38,334
that patient merit
of th' unworthy takes,

525
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,101
when he himself might his quietus
make with a bare bodkin?

526

- That's nice, David.
- Who would fardels bear,

527

to grunt and sweat
under weary life,

Of something after death,
the undiscovered country...

530
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,153
from whose bourn
and no traveller returns,

531
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,157
puzzles the will,
and makes us rather bear those ills we have...

532
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,753
than fy to others
that we know not of?

533
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,567
In the second book
of The Republic,

534
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,806
Plato says,
"What will happen to the just man...

535
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,571
should he enter this world?"

536
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,637
Well, thejust man
will be scourged,

537
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,309
racked, chained.

538
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,013
Then after every kind of misery,

539
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:37,387
he will be crucified
on a pole for all to see.

540
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,454
Any questions?

541
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,397
I've got a question.

542
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,905
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

543
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,807
My question:

544
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,149
If the just man...

545
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,382
is treated as you say,

546
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,687
then what's the just response?

547
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,994
Roll over and let evil
have its wicked way?

548
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,900
Well, what would
you recommend, Major?

549
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,370
Oh, I'd recommend defiance.

550
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,430
Justice for the captors.

00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,874
An eye for an eye.

552

- At what price mercy?

00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,483
Yeah, mercy.

554

The last bastion
of traitors and cowards.

555
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,750
So you would take a man
and crucify him on a pole for all to see?

- I would seek justice.

[Gordon Narrating] Major Campbell
was a natural leader amongst men.

563
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,323
He seemed to draw them
from all nationalities and groups,

564
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:59,232
- #[Ethereal Vocalizing]
- And he had a way with
uniting them in a common cause...

5:00 and half 5:00 every single day,

569
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,657
- so we have to be there, men.
- Sorry, Major.

570
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,390
Are we interrupting
a church service?

571
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,903
So what's the story?

572
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,772
Major, let's say
your plan works, right?

573
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:47,046
You've confiscated the guns,
captured the guards,

574
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,449
taken over the whole camp.

575

What then?

576
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,450
You have still nowhere to go.

You can't possibly
hope to survive.

Who's talkin' about survival?

582
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,012
So that's what this is,
a suicide mission.

So what are you gonna do, eh?
What are you gonna do?

Aye, now that would be suicide.

Some of his best trades are with theJaps.
