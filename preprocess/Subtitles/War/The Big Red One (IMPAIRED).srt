Look, nobody's firing at us.

763
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:00,891
One minute after
midnight, official.

764
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,020
The war's been over for four hours.

765
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:08,732
ZAB: Hey, sarge, the dead
Kraut, he's still warm.

766
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:19,413
- You didn't know it was over.
- SERGEANT: He did.

767
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:29,506
GRIFF: He's still alive!

768
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:41,100
Sulfa.

769
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,978
Come on.

770
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:50,395
- Pills?
- ZAB: Right here.

771
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,671
Live, you son of a bitch.

772
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:11,924
You're gonna live if I have
to blow your brains out.

773
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:36,108
<i>ZAB: Saving that Kraut was the final
joke of the whole goddamned war.</i>

774
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:38,025
<i>We had more in common with him...</i>

775
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:42,163
<i>than with all our replacements who got
killed whose names we never knew.</i>

776
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,245
<i>We'd all made it through.
We were alive.</i>

777
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:49,586
<i>I'm gonna dedicate my book to those
who shot but didn't get shot...</i>

778
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:51,964
<i>because it's about survivors.</i>

779
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:56,127
<i>And surviving is the only glory
in war, if you know what I mean.</i>

780
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,704
