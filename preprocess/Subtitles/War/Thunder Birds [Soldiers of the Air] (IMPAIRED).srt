00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,693
Halt!

00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,630

[ Shouts, Indistinct ]

154
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,898
Stand at ease!

155
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,032
(Barratt)
Stand easy. Gentlemen...

156
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:55,079
I brought you out here to meet Steve Britt,
one of your new instructors.

157
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,207
I'm sure he's already known
to many of you by reputation...

158
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,911
not only because of
his record in the last war...

159
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,217
but for his many
flying achievements since then.

160
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,291
He believes, as we do...

161
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,418
that this war is going to be won
in the air.

162
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,294
That's why he's chosen to come here
to Thunderbird to teach you to do the job.

163
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,169
It's a great pleasure and a real privilege
to have him with us...

164
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,261
and I'm sure that you'll
find him an understanding...

165
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,340
and a sympathetic man
with whom to work.

166
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,432
Like to say a few words, Britt?

167
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,569
Thanks.
I'll do my talking later.

168
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,410
I say, old man, that's good.

169
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,254
Gentlemen, this is an airplane.

170
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,524
The idea is to get it up
and keep it up.

171
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,329
But the most important thing of all
is to bring it back.

172
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,047
Just one more thing you have to remember.
That's your parachute.

173
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,450
If anything unusual happens,
you grab that ring...

174
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,456
count 10, and pull it hard.

175
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,493
If it opens, you haven't got
a thing to worry about. If it doesn't-

176
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,653
- Do we get a new one, sir?
- Nope.

177
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,958
From then on,
you can fly without 'em.

178
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,904
Well, who wants to see
what it's like up there?

179
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,532
- [ All ] Aye, sir.
- Okay, hop in.

180
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,707
Fasten your safety belt...

181
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,307
good and tight so if I decide
to fly upside down...

182
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,319
I won't have to worry about
you digging holes in the runway.

183
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,855
Come on, lads.
Get your morning exercise.

184
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,982
Give 'em the crank.

185
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,963
Ow!

186
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,466
Come on!

187
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,346
- (Man) Contact.
- Contact.

188
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,560
Don't worry about the parachute
not opening. It has to. It's regulations.

189
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,951
See that thing in front of you?
That's a control stick.

190
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,650
Take a hold of it.

191
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,955
Not so hard.
Don't choke it.

192
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,433
It's not gonna give milk. Now, move it
to the left and see what happens.

193
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,663
Now, your left aileron has come up,
and your right is depressed.

194
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,969
As a result, your left wing is down
and you're in a bank.

195
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,439
That's enough.
Back to center.

196
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,983
Now, your ailerons
are feathered out, streamlined.

197
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,114
Back to level flight.
Pull back on your stick.

198
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,595
Easy!

199
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,190
Now you're climbing.

200
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,499
You wanna put her nose down,
all you have to do is push forward.

201
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,384
Level off.

202
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,568
Don't let this throw you.
Some of the best fliers in the business...

203
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,728
get sick from time to time.

204
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,363
That's part of the game.

205
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,307
Hang on.
We're going down.

206
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,523
- Wouldn't you like to get out here?
- I'm all right, sir.

207
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,465
Sure, but the exercise'll
do you good.

208
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,036
- Sorry I messed it up, sir.
- Forget it.

209
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,083
Your stomach's just a little upset.
It's the change of water.

210
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,381
You'll feel a lot different tomorrow
when we're up there kicking her around.

211
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,786
Take a few deep breaths.

212
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,295
- Thank you, sir.
- By the way, what's your name?

213
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,199
- Peter Stackhouse, sir.
- I knew a Peter Stackhouse in the last war.

214
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,965
- That must've been my father, sir.
- Your father was a great flier.

215
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,633
Thank you, sir.
Did you know him very well?

216
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,200
Well enough to know that if I had
to go up against the Luftwaffe today...

217
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,906
I'd like to have a man
with his guts alongside of me.

218
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,416
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

219
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,544
Now, watch yourself.

220
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,772
- What's the matter with him? Sick?
- A little wobbly.

221
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,349
- A walk'll do him good.
- Don't start coddling 'em, Steve.

222
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,442
We haven't got time
for that around here.

223

If they don't come through,
wash 'em out and wash 'em out fast.

00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,823
Sure, General Maytag.

225
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,586
You put 'em in and turn the crank,
and I'll wring 'em out.

226
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,184
Okay. I'll put 'em in.

It is, rather, isn't it? Say, are you sure
you never saw me on the music halls?

Used to write all
me own words and music.

Oh, very. You sure you won't come
with me to the recreation center?

- Not tonight, thank you.
- Not even for the jumbo malt...

chocolate sundaes with clotted cream and nuts?

Oh. I could let you
have a Mother Sills.

"April 8, 1918."

It was just two days
before he was shot down.

Yeah, we had
quite a talk that day.

You English don't usually
loosen up very much, but-

I don't know. He was just a kid,
and maybe he had a hunch.

I remember we got to talking
about his place down at, um- at, um-

- Compton-on-the-Wye?
- And about his mother.

- She must've been quite a gal.
- She still is, sir.

265

I started to get in touch with her
once or twice, but you know how it is.

266

I wish you had.
She would've liked that.

267

Talked a lot about you boys too.
There are two of you, aren't there?

There were.

My brother Tom was shot down
over Wilhelmshaven about 10 weeks ago.

270
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,082
I'm sorry.
Have a smoke.

271

- Won't you have one of mine, sir?
- No, go ahead. Try these.

Thank you.

273
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,665
By the way, Stackhouse,
you're not afraid of flying, are you?

274
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,111
I don't think so. I'm not afraid
of getting hurt, if that's what you mean.

275
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,810
Sorry. Maybe I shouldn't
have asked that.

276
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,886
I'm glad you did, sir,
if you believe me.

277
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,251
Sit down.

278
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,228
Listen, Pete,
this is a big war.

279
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,490
There's lots of jobs
in it beside flying.

280
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,998
Take the tank corps.

281
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,797
Those guys have really got it.
Or those stone crushers in the infantry.

282
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,872
Nobody's ever won a war
without them yet.

283
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,464
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,203
There's lots of people can't fly...

285
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,371
but that's no reflection on 'em.

286
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,849
A guy just finds he can't get his head
and feet all to move at the same time.

287
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,079
He lacks that little mystical something
called coordination.

288
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:08,148
You know, it takes guts to fly,
and it takes guts not to fly.

289
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,353
Does this mean you're going
to wash me out, sir?

290
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,556
Well, you've been up there three times now.
The same thing's happened every time.

291
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,327
Don't wash me out, sir.
I'll get over it, I'm sure I will.

292
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,666
- Yeah, but there's a war on, you know.
- Give me a few more days.

293
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,365
- I'll be all right.
- I'd like to, Pete.

294
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,840
But we've got to think
about what's best for your country.

295
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,911
They need fliers,
and they need 'em quick.

296
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,677
Suppose I let you go up there alone,
you get killed?

297
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,015
I'm asking you
to take that chance, sir.

298
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,181
I studied medicine. I know what's wrong
with me. It's just a conditional reflex.

299
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,851
- A what?
- Subconscious fear of falling.

300
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,227
I seem to freeze up. I can cure myself
of it if you only give me time.

- Yes, sir.

302

- Then why'd you come?
- Afraid it's rather a long story, sir.

Go ahead, shoot.
I got all night.

with my grandmother in England.

- Yes, she's quite a remarkable woman.

00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,748
I traveled around the world once.

599
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,226
Everywhere I went, I saw churches and
schools and hospitals- even in the jungle-

600
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,263
all built with American money
for somebody else to use.

601
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,231
I never saw any German
or Japanese philanthropies.

602
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,359
I could almost kiss you for that.

603
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,562
What a stunning idea.

604
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,731
Figuratively, milord.

605
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,968
Oh.

606
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,927
- Good night. It's been fun.
- It's been great fun.

607
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,053
By the way, do you ride?

608
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,563
- I was born on a horse.
- Will you come ride with me?

609
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,861
- Anytime.
- Good night.

610
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,959
Good night, sir.

611
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,095
Good night, sir.

612
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,197
Good night.

613
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,288
- Hello, honey.
- Hello. Is this a new listening post?

614
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,759
- That's right.
- Hear anything interesting?

615
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,729
Quite a lot.
What's it all mean, Kay?

616
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,267
It means that I had a lovely time
and that I like him.

617
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,802
- That all?
- I don't know yet.

618
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,338
Wouldn't be trying
to make me jealous, would you?

619
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,104
Really, Steve.
You're marvelous. What an idea!

620
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,669
I just wanted to remind you
he's a very nice guy.

621
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,149
- He might think you meant it.
- And he might be right.

622
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,440
Go ahead. Sink your teeth
into these hot dogs.

623
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,781
- Hot dogs?
- Yes.

624
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,877
The great American delicacy.

625
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,221
Hope you don't like women who
pretend to be delicate eaters.

626
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,352
You should see
my grandmother eat.

627
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,795
Most women are such
awful liars about food...

628
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,390
especially in front of men,
before they're married.

629
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,699
As if the man didn't know
women had stomachs.

630
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:06,037
Steve Britt used to swear
that I had an alarm clock inside of me...

631
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,168
which went off
every five hours on the dot.

632
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,906
Have you known Steve Britt
very long?

633
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,883
I met him three years ago. The regular
planes from New York were grounded...

634
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,976
so I hired him to fly me out here.

635
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,248
It was Gramps's birthday.
First thing I knew...

636
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,347
he'd set me right down
in the middle of a desert...

637
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,426
and was threatening
to leave me there...

638
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,496
unless I promised to turn right around,
fly back to New York with him.

639
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,556
- Why should he do a thing like that?
- He said he was in love with me.

640
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,502
- Did you go with him?
- Course.

641
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,835
Were you in love with him?

642
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,334
Head over heels.

643
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,572
It was wonderful,
long as it lasted.

644
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,047
Are you still in love with him?

645
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,118
You like Steve,
and you're wondering...

646
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,584
whether it's all right for you
to be out with me, aren't you?

647
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,213
How'd you know?

648
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,292
Well, Englishmen usually
aren't so inquisitive.

649
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,384
But all right. I'll tell you.

650
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,192
I do like Steve, tremendously.

651
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,097
Sometimes I think
I'm in love with him.

652
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,901
I've got enough sense to know he'd make
a horrible husband. He'd never stay put.

653
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,441
You sure you'd like a husband
to stay put?

654
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,738
I wondered about that myself.

655
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,609
The men at the field
think he's great- all of them.

656
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,878
Yes, I know. That's awfully
important to a woman.

657
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,215
I mean, to know
that other men like him.

658
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,813
And too, he's just enough older
than I am to be very fascinating.

659
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,826
I wonder if you realize
what an amazing person you are.

660
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,624
Should we leave it there
for now? I'm hungry.

661
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,006
Fella that gets Kay
sure got to step, son.

662
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,341
He can't let any grass
grow under his feet.

663
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,641
If I was courtin' a girl,
you bet I'd get up early.

664
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,310
- I wouldn't let the other fella beat me out.
- I got here at 11:00.

665
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,410
- I would have made it 10:00.
- Hello, Steve.

666
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:01,116
- Shh, now. We're busy.
- Hello, Kay. Stackhouse. Have a nice ride?

667
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,683
- Yes, sir. It was wonderful.
- Hope he hasn't caught you
cheating again, Gramps.

668
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,662
I don't get caught.

669
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,792
Doggone it! Every card I play-
Say, you didn't shuffle these cards.

670
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,995
[ Laughs ]

671
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,596
Sorry we weren't here, Steve. Why didn't
you let me know you were coming?

672
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:21,701
That's okay. I was out this way, thought
I'd drop in for a little game with Gramps.

673
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,111
- And have I been taking him.
- Sixty-four cents in me.

674
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,183
[ Chuckling ]

675
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,754
Not counting this hand.

676
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,048
I'll try two.

677
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,356
Oh!
There he goes again.

678
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,296
- Luckiest man I ever saw in my life.
- At cards?

679
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,563
- Course you'll be staying
for dinner, won't you, Steve?
- I'm sorry. I have work to do.

680
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,333
- On Sunday?
- Go on, Gramps. Give me my dough. I have to go.

681
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,001
What's all this tomfoolishness
about leaving when Kay gets here?

682
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,137
Maybe if you're free some night this week,
I'll have that dinner with you.

683
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,341
I'd love to, Steve. Some night
when you don't have to work.

684
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,509
Are you going straight
back to the field, sir?

685
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,678
- Yeah, sure.
- Mind if I come along with you?

686
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,147
You mean you're not
staying for dinner?

687
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,419
No, sir.
My leave ends at 7:00 p.m.

688
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,659
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

689
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,494
Okay. Let's go.

690
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,592
- Good-bye, Kay. I've had a marvelous time.
- It was fun, wasn't it?

691
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,672
- Good-bye, Mr. Saunders.
- Good-bye, sir.

692
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,900
- Good-bye, Steve!
- Good-bye.

693
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,447
Can't make up your mind which one
to let bite the apple, can you?

- [ Knocking ]
- (Steve) Who is it?

697
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,428
- Stackhouse.
- Come in.

698
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,361
- Did I wake you, sir?
- No, I just turned in. Close the door.

699
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,431
I had to speak to you.

700
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,510
Okay. Sit down.

701
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:04,103
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

702
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,054
What is it, Stackhouse?

703
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,224
I'm in love with Kay.

704
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,904
Mm-hmm. What about it?

705
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,135
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

706
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,612
What are you coming to me for?
I'm not her grandfather.

707
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:42,481
- No, but... I know how you feel about her.
- Do you?

708
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,952
I know you were in love with her.

709
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,081
I'm still in love with her.

710
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,991
I know if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't still be here.

711
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,791
You're afraid
I'll wash you out. Is that it?

712
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,866
No.

713
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,162
How do you know I won't?

714
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,665
What would you do in my spot?

715
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,470
I don't know.

716
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,980
Okay, Stackhouse.

717
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,786
I told you I'd give you every chance
to make the grade as a pilot...

718
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,327
because I figured you had it in you.

719
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,556
That still goes.

720
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,565
Thank you, sir.

721
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,864
Personally,
I might hate your guts.

722
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,633
But that has nothing
to do with flying.

723
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,372
As far as you and I and... Kay are
concerned, that's a different matter.

724
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:51,349
I don't believe you can take her away
from me. What do you think of that?

725
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,641
If I don't, it won't be
for lack of trying, sir.

726
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,912
Well, good night, sir.

letting me talk to you.

- Well, get your parachute
and come along, will you?

- I'd like to give you a check flight.
- Now, sir?

It's about time you had your solo,
don't you think?

01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:22,858
Listen, you were kicking that bronco
all over the corral yesterday.

895
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,866
You didn't freeze up
every time he bucked, did you?

896
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,699
The time he came down stiff-legged,
you eased down with him.

897
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,707
When he twisted and spun around,
you rolled your body right with him.

898
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,604
Trouble with you is
you been trying too hard.

899
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,680
You been stiffening up
in the saddle.

900
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,545
When this ship noses down,
don't yank the stick back suddenly.

901
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,916
You tried that yesterday, you'd have
pulled that horse over backwards, right?

902
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,455
The next time this baby
starts to act up or gets nervous...

903
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,787
just remember
he's got a tender mouth.

904
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,383
Don't try to yank him suddenly,
unbalance him.

905
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,225
Give him a chance to recover.
Straighten him out gradually.

906
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,299
Ease up! Relax.

907
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,666
Okay, cowboy.
Now you got the idea.

908
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,763
It's your horse.
Go on and ride him.

909
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,901
I been telling Barratt and MacDonald
you could fly this crate.

910
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,411
They don't believe it.
They say you haven't got it in you.

911
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:48,176
Well, I'm gonna give you a chance to prove
either that they're liars or I'm a sucker.

912
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,479
Whichever way it comes out,
it's okay with me.

913
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,365
You can talk to yourself
for a while.

914

916
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,024
How many ships are out?

917
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:16,070
- They're all in but one, sir. Britt and a student.
- Right.

918
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,306
Yes, one of your training ships.

919
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,647
I saw him circling around
over Camelback Ravine.

920
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,721
It looks like
he's in trouble to me.

Those tactics might be all right
in a barnstorming circus, but not here.

924
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:34,074
I can't imagine what you were thinking of,
bailing out of a ship in a sandstorm.

925
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,838
I didn't see any sandstorm
when I jumped. I'm not that big a fool.

926
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,109
Leaving that boy up there alone
when you knew he couldn't handle a plane?

927
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,275
He made the greatest landing
I ever saw.

928
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,648
He cracked up, didn't he?
He wrecked a ship.

929
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,586
The wind turned her over
after he set her down.

930
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,783
We had a perfect record
until you came here.

931
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,656
I might've known something
like this would happen.

932
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,628
Is that another way
of saying I'm canned, Mac?

933
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,926
I'm sorry, Steve,
but I warned you.

934
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,501
Colonel MacDonald,
he was only trying to give me a chance.

935
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,265
I understand that, Stackhouse,
and I blame myself.

936
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,340
I should've washed you
out of here weeks ago.

937
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,103
When you're through, report
to your squadron leader, Barratt.

938
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,178
He'll have your
transfer papers ready.

At least I know I can fly.

941
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,625
Thanks to you.

942
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,990
You shouldn't have
done it for me.

943

What gives you the idea
I did it for you?

944
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,365
Your father was
a friend of mine, wasn't he?

945
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:34,061
Besides, they say there's a great future
in parachute jumping.

[ Swing ]

949
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:26,419
You know, there's one thing I just love
about you English: your sense of fair play.

950
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,514
No matter what a man does, you always
give him another chance, don't you?

951
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:33,425
Yes. That is, uh, if he deserves it.

952
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,191
You see that man over there,
the one with the white hair?

953
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:43,067
- Yes?
- A few years ago, he stole an
awful lot of money from a bank.

954
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,163
Literally ruined hundreds of people.

955
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,242
Then he got to thinking
about it and came back...

956
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,868
and said he wanted to make
whatever restitution he could.

957
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,709
- Hmm. And, uh, did he?
- Uh-huh. He was so sincere, a lot of people-

958
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,783
even those who
should have hated him most-

959
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,113
- decided to give him another chance.
- Huh.

960
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:00,746
And now, he's one of the finest
and most respected men in the state.

961
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:04,758
- Splendid.
- I told Colonel MacDonald I knew
you'd feel that way about it.

962
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,260
Oh, naturally.
Anyone can make a mistake.

963
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,422
Then you will do it, won't you?

964
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,522
- Do what?
- Give Peter Stackhouse another chance.

965
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,102
- Stackhouse?
- Colonel MacDonald's wanted to do it all along...

966
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,262
but since Peter's in the R.A.F.,
he felt it was up to you.

967
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,431
Colonel MacDonald hasn't
even mentioned it to me.

968
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,531
Well, it's rather
a personal favor, you know.

969
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,611
He's such an old friend
of Steve Britt's...

970
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,702
and he knows how badly
Steve feels about it.

971
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:28,977
But now that you're willing,
I can't wait to tell him.

972
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:32,520
- Mildred, may I cut in?
- Of course, Kay.

973
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,056
I just love Mr. Barratt.

974
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:44,155
Seems to me you love
a lot of people around here.

975
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,427
He has such a wonderful
sense of fair play...

976
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,936
only of course he feels it's your job
and he hates to bring it up.

977
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:55,067
- Bring what up?
- You see that man over there,
the one with the white hair?

978
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,114
- Yes?
- I was telling him...

979
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:02,115
about a horrible mistake
that man made a few years ago.

980
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,185
Really? What did he do?

981
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,948
Left his wife and three babies
for another woman.

982
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,354
But then he got to thinking
about it and came back...

983
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,019
and pleaded so hard for a second chance
that his wife took him back.

984
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:16,461
Now he's one of the finest
and most respected men in the state.

985
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:20,865
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- I told Mr. Barratt I knew
you'd feel that way about it.

986
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,494
Just a moment.
What are you trying to say?

987
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,768
That Mr. Barratt would love
to give Peter Stackhouse another chance...

988
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,311
but of course you're head of the school
and he doesn't like to interfere.

989
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,937
- But you don't mind interfering.
- Well, I'm an American...

990
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:36,449
and I'd hate to think that
we aren't as fair-minded as the British.

991
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:42,218
Yes. Well, I suppose if Barratt feels
as strongly about it as you say-

992
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,191
- Then you will?
- If you promise to be
at the field tomorrow morning...

01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:33,348
Steve, he did it.
[ Whimpers ]

1041
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:37,653
[ Shouting, Cheering ]

1042
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,266
Oh!

1043
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,735
(Man Narrating)
There they go, the Thunderbird pilots.

1044
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:54,298
No longer novices, no longer boys
being trained, no longer fledglings.

1045
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,640
They're out of the cradle now.
They're experts. They're veterans.

1046
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:01,409
Thunderbird Field has done its job.
Now the boys do theirs.

1047
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:05,816
Watch them fly, these young pilots who
send their messages in the form of bombs.

1048
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,321
These young Englishmen
are going to bomb Berlin...

1049
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,823
just as they bombed Essen,
Cologne and Düsseldorf.

1050
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,326
These young Chinese will
harry the Japanese invaders...

1051
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,419
from the Yangtze to the Yellow River.

1052
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,830
They have a score to settle with Tokyo.
They'll settle it. Watch them.

1053
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,926
And these young
American Thunderbirds...

1054
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,232
have some bombs and bullets
up their sleeves too.

1055
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:28,366
These are the young men who are fighting
for the rights of free people everywhere.

1056
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:32,106
These are the pilots.
These are the Thunderbirds.

1057
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:35,411
They know their job.
They'll do it.

1058
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:39,476
But they might never have become pilots if the
men on the ground hadn't served them so well.

1059
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:42,022
Let us pay homage
to the instructors too.

1060
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:46,925
To the Steve Britts everywhere, who teach
men how to fly and fight and win.

1061
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,362
Hey, boy. My name's Britt.

1062
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,797
- What's your name?
- Atkinson, sir.

1063
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,869
Atkinson, huh?

1064
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:03,377
You with the freckles.
What's your name?

1065
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,639
Percival Archibald
Couverneur Smythe, sir.

1066
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,113
Okay, Red.
