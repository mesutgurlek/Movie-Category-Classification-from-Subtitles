Oi, Smudger.

You couldn't check my
prick for me, mucker?

473

still there, still tiny.

474
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,409
Give us a fag, would you.

475
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,763
Watch your step, mate. There's mines.

476
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,526
I've got a med kit.

Oi, follow our line in, mush.

482

It's still bleeding.
I got another tourniquet.

483

- Well, he's stable when he's flat.

590
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,609
At an angle there's a chance
he could bleed out or bleed in.

Have you seen how
fucking steep it is?

You can shut up, Mark.
Before I change my fucking mind.

I need you to put a tube in me.

It's like watching him
mount his missus.
