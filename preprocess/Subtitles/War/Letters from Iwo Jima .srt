1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,135
The subtitle is based on a spanish translation of this film

2
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:18,136
I have machine translated it first, and then added some sense to the result by my best knowledge.

3
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:22,137
As I speak neither japanese nor spanish (nor am I a native english speaker), this translation might be a bit off sometimes, so please excuse the errors you might notice.

4
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:17,252
How did our soldiers dig those tunnels?

5
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,852
Must have been working shifts all the time...

6
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:25,624
I found something!

7
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,713
Hanako.

8
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:41,720
We soldiers dig, we dig all day.

9
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,980
this it is - the hole in which we will fight and in which we will die!

10
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:54,855
Hanako, I am digging my own tomb.

11
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,573
Now I'm doing as I'm expected

12
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,960
I am determined to serve my country and to die for it.

13
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:44,563
I'm going through all the things I have left in my house

14
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:49,766
Sadly, I did not fix the floor of the kitchen before going

15
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,416
I had the intention, but I had to go before being able to do it, and it has worried me

16
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:59,540
Make sure that Taro fixes it soon.

17
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:07,237
Damn Island! Shall the yankees have it!

18
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:12,791
Nothing grows here, it's too warm, too many insects and no water to drink

19
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:21,142
This island is sacred japanese soil!

20
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:23,167
There isn't any soil on this island!

21
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,569
Saigo!

22
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,177
We should give a part of it to the Americans

23
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:39,362
In exchange for something else

24
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:43,254
Saigo!

25
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:48,566
What did you say, soldier?

26
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:52,334
That if we overcome the Americans we will be able to go home soon!

27
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:56,025
That is what he said?

28
00:04:56,164 --> 00:05:01,357
Yes Sir!

29
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,887
I am Kuribayashi

30
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,550
Welcome General!
I am Admiral Ohsugi!

31
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:26,591
What time is it?
Three o'clock, sir!

32
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,838
Unfortunately

33
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:34,521
They left me kissed the work reason why him passage to Yakamoto

34
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,127
I understand.
My assistant lieutenant Fujita

35
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:42,456
Are you feeling alright? You look sort of pale-

36
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:49,764
Sir, it is not nothing. I can't cope with the water here very well.

37
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:54,884
We will take care of that. But first I want to inspect the island.

38
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:57,777
You want a vehicle, Sir? We will be walking. it is good for the health.

39
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:03,859
Perhaps that is what you need, Ohsugi!

40
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,234
That is Mount Suribachi.

41
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:31,272
Unpatriotic, useless farmers!

42
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,973
Stop!

43
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:41,781
Get up!
What have they done?

44
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,263
These soldiers

45
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:50,272
They have made unpatriotic comments!
I already see.

46
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:54,333
And You have such excess of soldiers, that you can afford the luxury to incapacitate those two?

47
00:07:55,041 --> 00:08:02,196
No, Sir!

48
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:03,452
So now stop beating them, better reduce their food ration!

49
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,494
A good Captain uses the brain, not only the whip

50
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:18,798
What is all that?
Those are Trenches Sir.
Why do you dig them here?

51
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,345
We expect the Americans to disembark here, Sir!

52
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:32,449
Stop that immediately!
But General...
And Captain,

53
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:39,456
Make sure that the men are rested. They seem to come from another planet.

54
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:52,264
Stop digging!

55
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:15,705
My stomach hurt from this!

56
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,224
A toast to General Kuribayashi!

57
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:23,446
A good commander.

58
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:32,827
This is almost better than Sake... 
I heard that he lived in the USA.

59
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:39,737
Perhaps for that reason he does not want trenches. Perhaps he likes the Americans!

60
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,589
It's useless to study the Americans!

61
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:49,503
Now he knows their weaknesses and how to overcome them

62
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:54,797
Somebody of the 204th told me

63
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:59,217
That another General was going to assume the commando of this island .....

64
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:04,956
But he didn't want the job.

65
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:09,938
So Prime minister Tojo granted it to Kuribayashi

66
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:15,403
Bullshit. You can hear many things.

67
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:17,925
But you shouldn't listen to the rumors.

68
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:20,872
In short, nobody from the 204th can confirm nothing. The 204th is part of the Imperial Navy.

69
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:26,975
This Kuribayashi, he is an excellent General!

70
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:31,471
As you can see, we aren't digging any damned trenches in the sand any more!
Are you sure?

71
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:51,537
I didn't expect it to be so hot

72
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,778
This island is bigger than I thought

73
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:04,654
Well... I'm a bit tired.

74
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:12,817
Ito reporting itself!
Thanks for coming immediately

75
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:17,852
What's with our air force?
We have 41 Zeros and 13 Bombers.
That is everything? Nothing else? Are you sure?

76
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:22,930
We lost 66 airplanes during the hard days when supporting Saipan.

77
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:27,086
So we will have to depend on the support of the fleet. Is that the plan of defense?

78
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,424
Yes Sir

79
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:41,581
And the army troops. Where are their positions?

80
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:46,752
We don't know it exactly, Sir. They are under the command of Colonel Adachi.

81
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:51,368
We don't have command over the army troops?

82
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,697
According to the military rules:not until the enemy disembarkation.

83
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:58,084
This is a war in the Sea, do you know that?

84
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,853
This is not going to work! They concentrated everything in beaches

85
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:11,952
Move the trucks!
But they just arrived at the beaches!

86
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:16,061
So, get them moving again! Coordinate immediately with the army troops!

87
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:22,774
The construction of Bunkers begins in the Zuribache. This has top priority.

88
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:26,498
We are going to fight them when they stop!

89
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:33,650
It's very dark outside already, Sir

90
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:41,755
He is going to make everybody crazy.

91
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:46,515
Commanders always do it

92
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:22,942
Another letter?

93
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:31,405
You do not know that the mail only leaves when there is a boat?

94
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:34,493
I have much family

95
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,361
So why do you send those letters only to your wife? Put!

96
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:45,537
I'll do you the favor, the other one didn't arrive!

97
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:51,018
What are you doing?
I worked in the Department of Censorship before my transfer.

98
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:55,782
Let's see what you are doing wrong...

99
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:59,014
"Dear Hanako, we soldiers dig, we dig all day.."

100
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,302
No, nothing like this is ever happening here, you can't write that.

101
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:08,585
Give it back immediately!

102
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,652
Calm down already!

103
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,238
You are going to be thankful to me later.

104
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:24,576
Next one!

105
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:33,962
Shoot!

106
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:58,258
Are you blind, soldier?

107
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:04,028
The target is over ther!

108
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:08,565
My son of 6 years shoots better than you

109
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:15,805
Return to shooting!

110
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:18,435
You are a shame!

111
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:22,358
You want to be an imperial soldier? You think that this is a game?

112
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,604
I have work for you, go clean the boots of the entire regiment!

113
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:30,012
Step back!

114
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:33,684
They need to learn to clean their rifles, not their boots

115
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:14,089
What are those tanks doing here?
They are out of service, Sir!

116
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:19,559
Most of them need spare parts.
For how long?
A month Sir.

117
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:41,982
Father, here in America there is a flood of automobiles.

118
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,682
I have to take care to cross the street.

119
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:50,259
There are cars everywhere.

120
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:55,781
Father, are they caring well for you and does mother obey?

121
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,143
I miss you very much.

122
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,334
We will move the tanks into position as artillery cannons.

123
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:14,164
Yes Sir, will be made immediately.

124
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,798
Hanako, we have a celebrity here, baron Nishi, olympic gold in horse jump.

125
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,048
He will be in charge of the 2nd tank regiment.

126
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
That he came here from Tokyo, is quite pleasant.

127
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:31,350
He is said to be a real favorite with the ladies

128
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,068
But on this island there are no women left that he can seduce

129
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:23,351
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi, you brought your horse with you by the sight of it.

130
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:27,232
Yes, from Shichi Jima.

131
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:37,436
I was in the cavalry.
I heard so, Sir!

132
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:40,638
It is an honor for me to be under your command, as you understand as much of horses as I do.

133
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:45,849
When we rode with our horses in the battlefield

134
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:49,497
Those were true times! Not like with these machines.

135
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,408
I can request another horse for you! Let's ride together, Sir.

136
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:02,605
Thanks no, not anymore.

137
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,360
Please, tell me about the famous horse, with which you won the Olympic Games

138
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,744
My stallion Uranus.

139
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:20,542
Very beautiful, an excellent horse!

140
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:32,111
I acquired it in Italy

141
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:37,931
They were happy to get rid of it, as it was a very wild horse.

142
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:40,540
Nobody could mount that beast

143
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:48,402
I said then that I and a horse so obstinate, we would make a good pair.

144
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:52,940
Have supper with me tonight, let's drink something

145
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:58,424
It will be an honor for me

146
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:09,983
How did you get that Johnny Walker here?
That is a secret of war!

147
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:13,667
Excuse me, this is everything we have available

148
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:20,971
It's alright, as long as we have this!

149
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:29,366
And this empty plate?

150
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:33,002
I passed the order that all the officers had to eat the same rations as the troops.

151
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:37,332
I know Sir, but the rule is to serve 3 plates

152
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:41,833
So we have to empty those three plates?

153
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:48,796
Thank you.

154
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:55,969
It is lamentable that most of the fleet have been destroyed

155
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:01,896
We even have some battleships.

156
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:09,078
But we have very few possibilities left for attack from the air or the sea

157
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:13,052
What are you talking about, Nishi?

158
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:19,560
Didn't you hear about the battle in the Marianas?

159
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:23,211
The Aircraft carrier and the planes of the Admiral Ozawa were annihilated

160
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:31,355
The Headquarters

161
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:33,652
They are deceiving the japanese public, and lie to us as well!

162
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:38,915
General, you want to hear my sincere opinion?

163
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:41,970
The best thing than we could do

164
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,323
is to send this island to the bottom of the sea, with all of us on it.

165
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:51,191
And you even came here knowing all this?

166
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:56,038
Well, I thought that we would have to occupy all the tanks that we have.

167
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:49,830
It must be here

168
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:53,966
The enemy is going to disembark right here!

169
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:57,335
Run, soldier!

170
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:02,769
As if the enemy was disembarking! Run!

171
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:10,889
Run ..... towards there, what decision would you take?

172
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:18,782
Continue running ..... in both directions

173
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:25,455
keep running! don't stop!

174
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,943
Listen

175
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:39,907
I believe that the commander became crazy.

176
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,214
His pistol

177
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:48,464
He must have taken it from a dead American

178
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,946
Perhaps!

179
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,637
They rest is over!

180
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,059
To work!

181
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,682
Are you feeling alright, Kashiwara?

182
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,954
You look very pale...

183
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:19,237
I'm alright, it's just the damn water.

184
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:23,823
I need to go to the bathroom

185
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,245
We will change our strategy.

186
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:46,449
We will make caves and tunnels in the zones of Matayama and Igashigushi.

187
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:52,061
We will create underground fortifications and we will fight until the end.

188
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:57,713
And the defenses of the beach Sir?
They are totally unnecessary.

189
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:00,203
But those trenches are our first line of defense!

190
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:06,458
Without trenches in the beach, how do you hope that we can resist the invasion?

191
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:12,708
Do you know the amount of cars produced in the USA in only a year?

192
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:17,353
We cannot underestimate their technological advances.

193
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:21,434
Sooner or later, they will cross those beaches. If we waste our soldiers there, we are going to lose.

194
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:29,307
It is inevitable that men will die, I've never before heard of fortifying the inner Island!

195
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:32,161
This is a waste of time, time we don't use to prepare us!

196
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:37,340
We will have to lure the enemy and crush them in a combined attack by air and sea

197
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:41,116
I agree, that makes sense! But do you know about the navy?

198
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:49,580
The aircraft carrier fleet was destroyed.

199
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:54,040
This island is isolated now

200
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:59,352
I received your new order from the Headquarters this morning

201
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:05,483
Our fighter planes will have to return to the motherland in order to defend the greater islands.

202
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:10,478
It is a barbarism! how are we going to fight?

203
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,565
We do not have time to discuss. We needed to return now.

204
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:54,127
Dear mother. Today they assigned me to a new troops

205
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:59,483
I can't say anything about the new place yet.

206
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:06,406
I miss you, take care.

207
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:22,191
Look at this photo.

208
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:24,977
It is a beautiful castle.

209
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,927
You know for who they constructed this castle?

210
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:34,132
For this dead guy.

211
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:36,613
They must have too much money to build a castle to a dead.

212
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:44,297
So you are reading that book? I've never seen you reading before.

213
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:52,183
If we have luck, we'll dig our own grave to die in.

214
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:58,478
Don't say that, it brings bad luck. Are you number 3-12?

215
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:04,757
Yes.
I am Nosaki, this is Saigo

216
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:08,652
I'm Shimitzu
You can put your things there

217
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,693
Back there is some place.

218
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:22,831
Don't take it personal

219
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:27,020
His friend Kachiwara died.

220
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:32,260
That was his place

221
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:37,601
But won't we all die? Isn't that the plan?

222
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:44,306
To die for your country is an honor.
Kashiwara died from disenter¡a.

223
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:56,414
Shimitzu, where are you from?
Kanayato.

224
00:29:55,417 --> 00:30:01,632
Saigo, you're from there, too, right?

225
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:05,726
That's right.

226
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,977
Where did they train you?

227
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:12,465
Perhaps we went to the same school!

228
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:18,368
They trained me in Tokyo.

229
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:20,906
Like me, but where?

230
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:29,811
In the Tojo

231
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:40,875
Hey... where was he trained?

232
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,830
I don't know that school

233
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:55,004
Surely you know about the Kempeitei (secret police)

234
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,131
It was the academy of the Kempeitei

235
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:05,855
To complete his training, they sent him here...

236
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,401
He behaves like a Kempeitei

237
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:15,615
He is not like the regular guys, I believe that they put him here to spy on us.

238
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,004
You do not know what you are saying..

239
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:29,618
Perhaps he'll write down everything we say in his letters

240
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:38,383
We have to watch out for that guy!

241
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:02,779
Grass again!

242
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:10,201
The commander is conserving the food for the battle

243
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:16,841
We are going to die of hunger before the Americans even arrive.

244
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,109
With my contributions to the war

245
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:25,055
We should be eating pies and sandwiches

246
00:32:24,998 --> 00:32:29,372
I used to run a pastry shop with my wife in the city of Omilla

247
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,181
When still there was sugar.

248
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,518
We sold pies, bread and casutera

249
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:41,026
But then...

250
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:50,678
Those guys like him came and they took everything they wanted.

251
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:55,182
for the war

252
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:58,693
for the country!

253
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:03,179
Why the pies?

254
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:14,588
They also came to our store when they looked for clothes

255
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:19,889
When we began to make sandwiches.

256
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:26,719
they also took it

257
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:30,962
when the meat finished, and there was only bread, they also took it

258
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:39,617
in the end, they took everything we had

259
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:42,826
We had to close the business. I don't have anything left

260
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:51,356
I had to be a fisherman!

261
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:54,962
It had to be difficult for your wife

262
00:33:56,794 --> 00:34:04,195
Without the business and her husband.

263
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:37,893
Don't open, we do not have anything to sell.

264
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:46,415
Congratulations, your husband will go away to the war

265
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:04,482
Thank you very much, it will be an honor to serve the country

266
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:14,118
Luckily there are no boys in the war

267
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:21,116
Please. we only have ourselves left...

268
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:24,523
This is not the time for this!

269
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:29,668
We have all sent our spouses and children to the war

270
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,495
All we have paid our part!

271
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:39,579
At least you will have a son who can bear his name!

272
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,232
Hanako

273
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,902
I cannot eat with you

274
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:05,745
What shall I do after you die?

275
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:15,977
I am not in the coffin yet!

276
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,090
Nobody returns home, not a single soul!

277
00:36:24,555 --> 00:36:31,547
They won't let you return here!

278
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:37,266
Don't worry yourself.
What about the baby?

279
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:59,568
I am your papa

280
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,638
Listen

281
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:09,379
Don't tell anybody what I'm about to tell you!

282
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:22,863
it is a secret between you and me

283
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:36,914
Your papa is going to return home to you

284
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:41,055
nobody will be able to prevent that

285
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:43,888
Listen.the enemy approaches!

286
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:56,340
This is ridiculous. Why waste our time making tunnels?

287
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,263
With or without them we are going to die

288
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:03,609
But we could have set up our barrikades at the beaches

289
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:17,951
What can I do for you, Sir?

290
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:22,640
You want something to drink?

291
00:39:23,558 --> 00:39:27,319
You have been looking pale these days.

292
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,659
The water here isn't good for me.

293
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:38,162
that is not good

294
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:40,084
Here, I've signed your plead.

295
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:46,162
I'm asking for orders to transfer you away from this island and to have you replaced by Admiral Ichimaru.

296
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,764
You are wasting time digging..

297
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:53,488
The island can not last without the support of our fleet.

298
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,724
we will all die here!

299
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:02,464
Perhaps to dig the tunnels is useless

300
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:08,950
Perhaps the defense of Iwo Jima is useless

301
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:14,977
Perhaps all this war is useless

302
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:19,458
But we are not going away to surrender.

303
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,983
We will fight them until we die, I and all the other soldiers!

304
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:29,537
If our children can live without danger

305
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:33,674
it will be worth the trouble to face the enemy on this island.

306
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:38,885
So I'm asking you, please! If you have even a trace of the officer's pride left in you

307
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:43,774
You go and tell the headquarters that we need all the support that we can get!

308
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:07,640
Then the rumor is true. I could not believe it!

309
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:12,827
I'm thankful to be able to leave this island

310
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:20,449
We had our differences

311
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:26,030
but I'm sad that you are going away.

312
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:29,962
General Adachi, now everything depends on You

313
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:36,167
Kuribayashi should be behind some writing-desk

314
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,145
But not a commander of troops. I know what you are feeling....

315
00:41:51,147 --> 00:41:56,790
As it is generally agreed...

316
00:41:56,363 --> 00:42:02,129
It is most probable that the Americans will disembark in this zone

317
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:07,140
The crossed firing positions will be located here and here.

318
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:13,415
It is well known that we will be numerically inferior in all regards.

319
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:20,223
but we have an enormous advantage

320
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:26,156
Can anybody tell me what that is?

321
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:33,137
The will of the American is inferior to the will of the Japanese.

322
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:37,472
Very well Shimizu! but why is that so?

323
00:42:37,564 --> 00:42:43,657
Because they are not disciplined, and their feelings interfere with their reason.

324
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,713
This is the American uniform!

325
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:54,344
this must be your target!

326
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:57,327
The Americans will lose many men in this attempt. Understood? Yes Sir

327
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:12,522
General, can I speak to you?
Sure.

328
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:16,818
You have to keep an eye on Major General Adachi

329
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,277
Thanks for the warning

330
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:23,817
but we do not have time for that now

331
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:30,169
We must focus on what we will do in the precise moment of the attack

332
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:35,271
Admiral Ichimaru!

333
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:40,113
Ichimaru reports to his duties, Sir. With your permission, Sir.

334
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,845
Thanks for coming here so quickly!

335
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:48,559
Air raid!

336
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:43,761
Jupiter!

337
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:51,118
Jupiter!

338
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:30,552
Hey, what are you doing standing around there? Come and help me!

339
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:35,795
Can I put something into your report mail? It's just one small letter...

340
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,627
We have been here for months, right?

341
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:31,189
They had already scared us into feeling unsafe.

342
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:33,799
They are not going to stop until they've killed us!

343
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:39,776
Damn day and night day and night!

344
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:48,492
This drives me crazy!

345
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:52,188
If the damn Americans want to invade here so badly...

346
00:47:56,162 --> 00:48:00,783
then why can't they do it now?

347
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:21,579
The 4 chickens that they gave us a few months ago have grown much

348
00:48:21,963 --> 00:48:26,664
the mother hen takes them to collect food every day

349
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:32,953
but they are also eating all the flower that grow in my orchard

350
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:38,868
The American boats are about to to weigh anchor!

351
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:42,169
They are on their way...

352
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:51,845
prepare the troops

353
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:59,589
Yes Sir!

354
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:31,900
The moment has arrived for us to show our character

355
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:38,632
.. as members of the Imperial Honorable Army

356
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:40,759
I trust that you will fight with honor

357
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,275
This island has a vital importance for Japan

358
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:51,541
if this island falls

359
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,578
the enemy will use it as it a base to attack our country with its airplanes

360
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:59,016
For Japan!

361
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:02,620
For our Mother country!

362
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:06,696
Until the last man

363
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,527
The enemy is due to stop, here!

364
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,196
Many will die

365
00:50:14,362 --> 00:50:20,086
but not before killing 10 enemy soldiers each!

366
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:27,302
They do not hope to return to house alive

367
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,109
I always will be to the front, accompanying them!

368
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:43,265
Hirohito Emperor lives!

369
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,893
Banzai.Banzai Banzai!

370
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,054
Dear wife, I think of you much, I wish you that you are well

371
00:51:31,164 --> 00:51:35,824
that you have value until the end.

372
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:37,898
and the spirit of Yamato with you

373
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:44,294
my heart always will be with you. Takeishi.

374
00:51:59,018 --> 00:52:03,556
We have to fill gunpowder bags here

375
00:52:05,104 --> 00:52:10,665
It's always hard for us to imagine they get to use in battle

376
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:15,433
Tardi and Iyoko, are joking about it all the time

377
00:52:15,473 --> 00:52:20,133
My parents, were evacuated to Nagano and they are well

378
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,713
I pray for your security

379
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:26,572
sincerely, Yoshi.

380
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:41,125
Nobody can kill me now!

381
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,396
A lucky belt!

382
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:51,053
my wife also sent one to me

383
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:58,898
It seems to me that the rest does not have belts like us

384
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,262
Perhaps they think that they wouldn't fit under their uniforms

385
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:07,998
Or perhaps they don't believe in lucky charms.

386
00:53:08,463 --> 00:53:12,224
His mother sent him one, too...

387
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:37,314
Watch out, if you stick out your head too much a wing from a plane could hit it.

388
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:41,978
How many ships you think that they have?

389
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,922
At least 30, perhaps 50!

390
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:46,826
They must be closely together.
I have to take a leak.

391
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,518
Don't go to the water-drainage, it's too dangerous.

392
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:54,063
then where?
There is a latrine at the end of the cave

393
00:54:09,753 --> 00:54:15,847
The latrine is full!

394
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:21,930
Somebody must drain it

395
00:54:28,046 --> 00:54:33,279
Saigo!

396
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:45,040
You do something about that latrine

397
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,301
Carry the excrements out!

398
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,052
Yes!

399
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:56,329
It must be a damn joke...

400
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,986
I always end up in such a mess!

401
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:40,941
Thanks God, I'm not dead!

402
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,124
Shall we open fire, Sir?

403
00:56:59,857 --> 00:57:02,800
Not yet!

404
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:08,389
The men wish to begin to shoot.

405
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:17,783
Not yet!

406
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:24,234
Do not shoot, do not shoot

407
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:36,060
If we do not defend ourselves, soon they will take the beach!

408
00:57:35,229 --> 00:57:43,734
Let's wait until the beach is full!

409
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:06,973
This is the moment! Open fire!

410
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:11,232
Open fire

411
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:17,230
They destroyed the tubes, and also the fortifications of the beach

412
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:22,523
the other forces are intact!

413
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,145
We killed at least thousand enemy troops! We knew that they would destroy the forts.

414
00:59:26,257 --> 00:59:27,892
those are good news

415
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:34,092
How are the men of Sibashi?
Their forces are intact.

416
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:40,836
How is the situation of the enemy?
They have 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

417
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:47,492
There must be more than that, they even have men waiting in the flanks

418
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:50,007
The enemy front extends from the Zuribachi and the wharf

419
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:59,772
And the landing field Shidonio to the south.
Yes, I thought so.

420
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:06,617
The Suribachi and the field of Motoyama. They are mounting an attack in two ends.

421
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:23,672
I can't give supply, I need the ammunition!

422
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:47,432
Saigo! Man this position!
The machine gun is broken!
Then use your rifle!

423
01:00:49,184 --> 01:00:52,537
What are you doing? stupid idiot!

424
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:56,181
I cannot trust you, tell Colonel Adachi that we need another machine gun!

425
01:00:57,964 --> 01:01:04,711
Hurry!

426
01:01:25,403 --> 01:01:33,989
Colonel Adachi asks for reinforcements.
I cannot give that luxury, tell him to hold out.

427
01:01:44,852 --> 01:01:49,513
There they are, kill them!

428
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:57,467
What happened? There is no ammunition!

429
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:02,891
Cover me!

430
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,815
We are losing the Suribachi

431
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:22,382
everything is lost

432
01:02:22,098 --> 01:02:24,632
I ask for permission to command our troops to commit suicide.

433
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:29,331
No, you must try to stop them!

434
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:34,116
Try to survive, and unite with the forces of the North

435
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:37,257
But Sir. everything depends on holding the Suribachi.

436
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:43,519
I will end my life with honor, next to my men

437
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:51,208
No, Colonel. It is an order! Adachi!

438
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:55,652
Adachi!

439
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:07,418
Sir! Captain Tanida asks for machine guns

440
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:16,738
We are defeated!

441
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,508
Suicide is the only option that we have left

442
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:30,632
But Sir...
Tell that to your commander!

443
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:23,004
Listen, General Kuribayashi gave the Colonel orders not to...
Shut up!

444
01:04:24,536 --> 01:04:28,010
It is cowardly to think so.

445
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:31,548
Sit down!

446
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:44,266
Men

447
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:48,969
we are

448
01:04:50,222 --> 01:04:52,717
honorable soldiers of the emperor

449
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,178
never forget that!

450
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:10,139
the only way we have left. is to die with honor!

451
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,039
this is our destiny

452
01:05:15,902 --> 01:05:21,013
to end our lifes in the traditional way

453
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:25,148
I will see you there!

454
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:36,509
For the emperor! Banzai ..... Banzai ..... Banzai

455
01:05:44,434 --> 01:05:50,649
Soldiers good bye!

456
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,158
Hold!

457
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:55,495
You must die like a honorable soldier!

458
01:07:55,885 --> 01:08:00,669
Shimizu, listen! We have to unite with the troops in the north

459
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:06,218
We must remain here until the death!
I heard General Kuribayashi.

460
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:12,558
that is what he said

461
01:08:12,658 --> 01:08:16,174
by the radio

462
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:18,521
it is the truth

463
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:25,717
we can die right here or we can continue fighting

464
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:33,072
Which serves the emperor best?

465
01:08:34,746 --> 01:08:37,976
Both is acceptable!

466
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:01,346
Where will the east corridor lead us to? Near Motoyama.

467
01:09:08,328 --> 01:09:13,766
You have order to retreat?

468
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:19,387
And the rest of your men?
They are all dead.
just like our groop..

469
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:32,063
They must be out there very closely. Silence!

470
01:10:17,357 --> 01:10:20,505
That is for killing us, and even burning us alive

471
01:10:23,505 --> 01:10:29,760
No, please!

472
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,437
Have you heard anything from the Suribachi?

473
01:10:41,797 --> 01:10:46,867
No Sir!
Send a messenger!

474
01:10:50,989 --> 01:10:55,201
Lieutenant Oiso, he ordered us to meet up with the troops in the western cavern.

475
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,530
We will try to arrive at Motoyama.

476
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:10,951
The next two kilometers will be unprotected terrain

477
01:11:09,903 --> 01:11:14,482
Each one will be responsible for himself. we will see ourselves again on the other side.

478
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:25,645
If not on this earth, it will be in the other world.

479
01:11:26,094 --> 01:11:29,078
Prepare yourself

480
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:44,957
Better don't run with the pack, they are going to shoot at them, stay back

481
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,771
that's how the cowardly do!

482
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:56,669
a dead soldier isn't worth anything.

483
01:11:56,962 --> 01:12:04,199
Follow me

484
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:25,908
Waits until the flare is out

485
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:30,992
Get going!

486
01:13:10,343 --> 01:13:14,229
Did the messengers make it? 
They didn't return Sir.

487
01:13:17,566 --> 01:13:20,592
Adachi...

488
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:24,317
The transmitter at Motoyama still works.

489
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:27,863
Why not try that, Sir?

490
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,232
The remaining troops of the Suribachi

491
01:13:55,548 --> 01:14:00,005
What is your name? 
Saigo, Sir. 
Shimizu, Sir.

492
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:11,095
You escaped from the Suribachi?

493
01:14:13,097 --> 01:14:18,904
How could you dare?

494
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:22,155
You had to remain in you position, until death.

495
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,578
You should have died with the others soldiers of your group.

496
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,524
You are a shame!

497
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:39,292
Get on your knees!

498
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,982
Listen..
Get on your knees!

499
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:08,031
I don't kill my soldiers with no need.

500
01:15:07,411 --> 01:15:10,885
Lower that sword now. Lower it already!

501
01:15:16,864 --> 01:15:18,703
What is happening here?

502
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:27,000
These men fled from the Suribachi.

503
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:32,009
Lieutenant Ito, I issued them the order to retreat.

504
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,994
That is sad, General.

505
01:15:38,821 --> 01:15:43,850
That was our only chance. 

506
01:15:44,528 --> 01:15:46,285
Now that they have taken the Suribachi, the enemy will take over the hills.

507
01:16:07,783 --> 01:16:13,139
We must take control back over the North.

508
01:16:20,395 --> 01:16:26,733
Ito.

509
01:16:25,765 --> 01:16:29,689
Fight by your fallen comrades.

510
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:35,779
until the end

511
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:55,470
Rise

512
01:16:57,841 --> 01:17:02,381
General Adachi orders to go to us right now.

513
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:06,815
No, Kuribayashi ordered us to hold this position...

514
01:17:10,077 --> 01:17:15,148
The Lieutenant Ito says that Kuribayashi is weak, and he compares him with the enemy.

515
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:29,188
We will recover mount Suribachi!

516
01:17:50,267 --> 01:17:52,843
Where is General Adachi?

517
01:17:53,995 --> 01:17:57,268
Tell me, who is in control here?

518
01:17:57,211 --> 01:18:00,359
That's not so certain, Sir.

519
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:04,522
Remain here until the plan is decided!

520
01:18:04,733 --> 01:18:10,580
Charge!

521
01:18:09,994 --> 01:18:14,983
we will hold this position, take care of the ammunition

522
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,027
Why didn't this regiment take part in the attack?

523
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:30,137
Don't stay here like rats. Leave your caves and fight!

524
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:35,929
where is your commander?

525
01:19:36,288 --> 01:19:39,968
We do not know anything, nothing is said to us here

526
01:19:40,602 --> 01:19:48,576
You did not receive the order of Adachi? Kuribayashi revoced that order.

527
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:52,705
There will be no attack

528
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:57,382
We will take the Suribachi again! With or without Kuribayashi!

529
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,089
There are enemies attacking already.

530
01:20:01,315 --> 01:20:03,932
Remember your rank Lieutenant!

531
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:07,827
Your lack of respect is unacceptable.

532
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:13,426
I suggest you better return to your men now.

533
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:17,325
We don't need you here.

534
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:29,603
You are a coward!

535
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:49,938
That guy who violated the rules, that is the Officer who almost killed to us.

536
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:28,362
I will not return. I have enough of fighting in caves. It does not make sense to me.

537
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:35,142
You are under the command of Colonel Nishi now.

538
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:48,734
This will destroy an enemy tank.

539
01:21:48,557 --> 01:21:56,981
Take out one of their machines!

540
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:25,205
There you go. What is the Situation?

541
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:32,164
We lost thousand men in a suicidal attack.

542
01:22:30,604 --> 01:22:35,921
I passed the strict order not to. 
It seems that your orders are not followed in the sectors.

543
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:42,693
Adachi, be damned!

544
01:22:42,732 --> 01:22:47,353
What about the Americans? 
One Battalion is moving to the North, another one towards the western hill.

545
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:53,539
If they entered the western hill, we will be surrounded by three fronts

546
01:22:54,155 --> 01:23:00,289
This order just arrived, Sir!
Read it.

547
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:04,793
From the Headquarters

548
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:09,060
We lament the fallen reinforcements in the combat for victory.

549
01:23:11,147 --> 01:23:14,173
we hope sincerely, that you fight with honor

550
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:20,519
and that you die for your country

551
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:12,476
Fire

552
01:24:56,189 --> 01:24:59,623
That one is still alive! bring him inside

553
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:34,971
Shall I kill him? 
No, take care of him.

554
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:42,322
But Sir... 
You would hope for the same. Endo, treat him.

555
01:25:41,173 --> 01:25:43,709
we have very little morphine

556
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:49,762
the Americans would not take care of the Japanese like that

557
01:25:48,957 --> 01:25:51,451
Son, how many Americans do you know?

558
01:25:52,722 --> 01:25:56,402
Take care of him.

559
01:25:57,683 --> 01:26:02,223
Endo

560
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:37,698
American tanks, come here!

561
01:26:49,327 --> 01:26:52,639
Endo, how is the prisoner?

562
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:58,230
he is awake, Sir

563
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:02,332
I will try to interrogate him.

564
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:51,553
It's all shit.

565
01:28:51,881 --> 01:28:55,644
Are you talking to me?

566
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:58,902
I will run away and surrender.

567
01:29:00,313 --> 01:29:04,891
So why have you been sent to us? To spy on us, right=

568
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:09,086
to suppress unpatriotic thinking?

569
01:29:15,525 --> 01:29:19,327
They put to me here because

570
01:29:19,661 --> 01:29:24,322
They threw me out of the Kempeitai

571
01:29:24,187 --> 01:29:31,137
Why?

572
01:29:30,983 --> 01:29:35,439
I have only been their for five days...

573
01:29:36,484 --> 01:29:38,979
Shimizu, you always must be firm.

574
01:29:41,536 --> 01:29:46,688
If you have compassion, people will take advantage of your weakness

575
01:29:51,577 --> 01:29:58,078
that is unpatriotic behavior. Do something about it, Shimizu

576
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:12,610
You haven't raised the imperial flag!

577
01:30:12,414 --> 01:30:19,406
I'm sorry, my husband went to the war and I cannot reach up there

578
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:22,580
It is unpatriotic not to raise it. 
With your help I will do it right now.

579
01:30:41,321 --> 01:30:45,533
Bring that dog away from the streets-

580
01:30:45,242 --> 01:30:49,575
What did you say, Sir?

581
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:55,248
That is an annoyance, it interrupts the communications

582
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:58,755
I'm very sorry, Sir!
Hush the dog already!

583
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:05,433
Shinizu, silence that dog.

584
01:31:04,886 --> 01:31:10,202
We cannot allow that it interferes with military orders.

585
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:15,983
Take the dog away

586
01:31:15,377 --> 01:31:19,180
please, it will not happen again

587
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:24,163
take it to the back and bring the children inside.

588
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:28,412
hurry

589
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:17,367
Put it inside and try that it does not bark.

590
01:32:17,363 --> 01:32:20,962
Yes, thank you so much!

591
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:36,556
Done already.
Good.

592
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:12,901
Are you trying to make fun of me? You can't even kill a dog?

593
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:19,279
You will never be one of us! you are not patriotic!

594
01:33:20,592 --> 01:33:22,759
Get up

595
01:33:28,206 --> 01:33:30,740
they threw me out for the insubordination

596
01:33:31,598 --> 01:33:34,132
and they commanded me here

597
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:40,573
That is sad

598
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:45,260
only the enemy hates you...

599
01:33:45,591 --> 01:33:48,821
it is not the dog's fault

600
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:24,958
Taro Today I attended my celebration of goodbye.

601
01:34:25,728 --> 01:34:30,266
Everybody wine, and had enough uproar

602
01:34:30,267 --> 01:34:31,267
Having to greet all the ladies almost spoiled all the good food for me.

603
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,236
Hey Sam!

604
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:23,919
It is information on the attack?

605
01:37:23,768 --> 01:37:29,123
Not, it is only a letter

606
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:32,037
It is from his mother

607
01:37:32,383 --> 01:37:36,758
Sam I sent a pair of books for you to read

608
01:37:37,487 --> 01:37:43,088
I hope you like them

609
01:37:42,819 --> 01:37:46,091
the dogs made a hole yesterday under the grate of the garden

610
01:37:49,534 --> 01:37:57,180
they escaped and they ran all over the neighbourhood.

611
01:37:56,714 --> 01:38:00,925
when we found them, the hens of the Harrison was terrified.

612
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:07,577
Don't worry about us

613
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:09,674
we are well .....

614
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:16,728
and always remembers what I said to you, always do the right thing

615
01:38:16,317 --> 01:38:22,491
because that is the right thing to do

616
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:29,456
I pray that the war will finish soon

617
01:38:27,256 --> 01:38:33,799
and that you return home without harm. with affection it sucks.

618
01:39:01,592 --> 01:39:05,844
Endo Endo

619
01:39:06,165 --> 01:39:13,852
What a mess, we don't have any more medicine.

620
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:17,666
Stop it, it makes no sense. Help the others!

621
01:40:43,434 --> 01:40:46,051
Okubo, come here!

622
01:40:51,978 --> 01:40:56,925
Have we run out of ammunition?

623
01:40:55,999 --> 01:41:02,378
No, we haven't, Sir.

624
01:41:00,692 --> 01:41:08,135
They eliminated our mortars

625
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:12,038
there is no more ammunition for the machine guns

626
01:41:12,016 --> 01:41:14,960
we only have rifles left.

627
01:41:17,197 --> 01:41:22,798
Okubo, You are in charge of the men now

628
01:41:22,126 --> 01:41:27,360
we can No longer defend this zone

629
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,360
Take the men, the food and the ammunition and try to make your way to the north!

630
01:41:34,806 --> 01:41:38,609
And You Sir?

631
01:41:40,357 --> 01:41:44,241
I've already had enough of sharing this cave with you...

632
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:48,582
I will stay here and try to face the enemy.

633
01:41:48,758 --> 01:41:53,379
What are you saying, Sir?

634
01:41:53,346 --> 01:41:59,440
First thing you have to do is find water for the men!

635
01:42:23,518 --> 01:42:27,319
Men!

636
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:33,751
you take the pain.

637
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:38,193
you do the right thing, because it is the right thing to do.

638
01:42:38,157 --> 01:42:44,781
you understand?

639
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:51,562
Yes Sir!

640
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:54,916
I promise that we will send you food and medicine!

641
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:59,978
it has been an honor to serve next to you!
 To your order!

642
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:25,090
Let's move out.

643
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:40,960
Okubo..
Yes Sir?

644
01:43:42,296 --> 01:43:45,853
My rifle.

645
01:44:07,794 --> 01:44:14,214
Thanks, Okubo.

646
01:45:29,411 --> 01:45:32,928
And the reports? Any additional News? 
No, Sir.

647
01:45:34,417 --> 01:45:36,829
Adachi is in Donichi.

648
01:45:38,185 --> 01:45:43,460
I sent messengers They have sent to many

649
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:49,397
No of them has returned.

650
01:45:49,749 --> 01:45:52,244
It shouldn't have gone this way.

651
01:45:52,953 --> 01:45:55,651
Saigo

652
01:45:56,402 --> 01:46:03,884
I have been thinking about what Colonel Nishi said

653
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:11,010
Yes it's right.

654
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:17,050
I don't know nothing about the enemy

655
01:46:18,184 --> 01:46:20,678
I thought that the Americans were cowardly

656
01:46:27,476 --> 01:46:31,810
I was wrong, they aren't.

657
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:38,227
they taught this to me, said it to me so many times...

658
01:46:36,908 --> 01:46:40,914
But that American soldier...

659
01:46:44,325 --> 01:46:49,191
the words of his mother...

660
01:46:50,507 --> 01:46:52,347
they were the same words that my mother said to me..

661
01:46:54,147 --> 01:46:57,295
I want to fulfill my duty for my General and my country

662
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,434
but I do not want to die without reason

663
01:47:06,393 --> 01:47:09,296
Saigo

664
01:47:10,882 --> 01:47:14,356
What do you think?

665
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:20,882
I don't think anything anymore.

666
01:47:24,103 --> 01:47:27,620
I think we went through enough of it all

667
01:47:34,332 --> 01:47:40,424
because we are sacrificing ourselves!

668
01:47:40,011 --> 01:47:41,646
You will surrender with me?

669
01:47:45,351 --> 01:47:48,622
Well-taken care of Ten

670
01:48:13,797 --> 01:48:20,587
I think you should go first..

671
01:48:20,389 --> 01:48:28,854
I am going to make up some excuse, so I can leave. we will meet somewhere outside

672
01:48:31,794 --> 01:48:34,328
and we disappear before they notice it. You have to leave because you have dysentery

673
01:48:36,105 --> 01:48:38,805
Put on your dysentery face!

674
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:44,267
That should do it...

675
01:48:54,276 --> 01:48:58,898
Stop! Where are you going?

676
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:05,167
I have dysentery! 
You are going away to surrender, right?

677
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:07,039
If you are going to do it, take me with you!

678
01:49:13,257 --> 01:49:17,345
We will have to move silently now...

679
01:49:17,412 --> 01:49:19,947
Soldiers, where are you going?

680
01:49:19,325 --> 01:49:23,170
One of them does not feel well, he has dysentery
Both of you, stop there!

681
01:49:25,718 --> 01:49:27,354
Stop!

682
01:49:45,099 --> 01:49:48,697
You idiot, it was your guard!

683
01:49:48,869 --> 01:49:51,362
Watch out for those deserters!

684
01:51:17,923 --> 01:51:21,235
In which unit have you been?

685
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:26,521
in the 3-14 of Ygashiyama

686
01:51:39,431 --> 01:51:45,686
I heard that they give you real food here...

687
01:51:44,467 --> 01:51:50,314
food?  it sounds well.

688
01:51:55,921 --> 01:51:57,884
I also am from Yokohama

689
01:51:58,836 --> 01:52:01,944
When all this is over, you can come visit me.

690
01:53:20,906 --> 01:53:23,767
Lieutenant, look at this!

691
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:06,906
That should serve to you as a lesson

692
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:12,592
to everyone who wants to surrender!

693
01:55:21,408 --> 01:55:26,478
We must pass through the crossfire in order to arrive at the North

694
01:55:26,154 --> 01:55:31,919
and thus to unite with our forces

695
01:55:34,204 --> 01:55:40,542
Listen

696
01:55:39,659 --> 01:55:44,442
We will move until those caves, we will leave there

697
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:50,321
do not waste the ammunition, not a single bullet

698
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:57,733
Do not shoot at random

699
01:55:57,107 --> 01:55:59,151
Prepare to cross!

700
01:56:00,054 --> 01:56:07,947
Try to use the rocks as cover

701
01:56:59,728 --> 01:57:01,403
These are the troops of Nishi, and survivors of the Zuribache

702
01:57:05,665 --> 01:57:14,987
No officers with you?

703
01:57:15,088 --> 01:57:17,583
I congratulate you on arriving here

704
01:57:18,437 --> 01:57:21,054
Fujita, some water for them!

705
01:57:22,385 --> 01:57:26,557
Fujita

706
01:57:25,922 --> 01:57:32,670
I'm sorry, Sir, there is no more water.

707
01:57:33,395 --> 01:57:39,037
I'm very sorry. But at least you will be able to rest for some time.

708
01:57:49,504 --> 01:57:54,819
You seem well-known to me...

709
01:57:59,466 --> 01:58:02,206
Yes Sir! You saved my life on two ocassions!

710
01:58:04,576 --> 01:58:07,151
The first time, it was the day in which you arrived at the Island.

711
01:58:15,801 --> 01:58:20,218
Yes, I remember that clearly. Take some rest now.

712
01:58:38,994 --> 01:58:44,065
Hanako, I am not sure that this letter arrives at destiny.

713
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:48,401
but it calms me to write to you

714
01:58:49,712 --> 01:58:54,334
We have spent the last five days without water or food.

715
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:57,775
in order to survive, we are doing things that I won't describe to you.

716
01:59:00,762 --> 01:59:05,955
There is no escape for me any more, so that the only thing that worries me is you and the baby.

717
01:59:13,993 --> 01:59:17,632
Here, drink some alcohol

718
01:59:36,653 --> 01:59:43,850
the battle approaches its end without ammunition nor water to drink.

719
01:59:44,257 --> 01:59:50,677
All the survivors will make a general attack

720
01:59:49,834 --> 01:59:54,534
pray for the victory and security of the Empire, I am saying goodbye to you!

721
01:59:56,066 --> 01:59:59,624
Unfortunately, I couldn't fulfill all my duties for the mother country.

722
02:00:00,829 --> 02:00:08,107
Without decent fighting, we had to lose in these conditions.

723
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:14,877
You survived the Zuribachi?

724
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:22,465
it had to be an incredible trip?

725
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:30,942
You are everything a soldier...
no, sir, I only am a humble baker.

726
02:00:32,143 --> 02:00:38,236
you are a baker? You have family?

727
02:00:38,545 --> 02:00:42,511
I have wife, and a baby who was born during the last summer in Umilla.

728
02:00:47,408 --> 02:00:51,414
And I didn't get to know it yet.

729
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,847
That strange

730
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:05,045
I promised myself to fight until the death for my family

731
02:01:05,318 --> 02:01:06,545
But to think about my family, makes it difficult to me to fulfill the promise

732
02:01:29,205 --> 02:01:30,432
We have received a message Sir! It is urgent

733
02:01:48,997 --> 02:01:50,222
For General Kuribayashi and his troops

734
02:01:53,148 --> 02:01:54,374
who have fought bravely for our country

735
02:01:56,937 --> 02:01:58,163
The children of Nagano, City of the General

736
02:02:00,077 --> 02:02:01,303
they sang a song in their honor

737
02:02:02,905 --> 02:02:04,131
on the waves of the Pacific Ocean

738
02:02:07,028 --> 02:02:08,254
to the south of the Imperial city.

739
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:13,067
A small solitary island floats

740
02:02:16,117 --> 02:02:17,342
the destiny of our Imperial country

741
02:02:19,441 --> 02:02:20,666
it lies in the hands of this island

742
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,746
Iwo Jima

743
02:02:25,058 --> 02:02:26,285
While we resist

744
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:29,365
we feel assured, that the imperial soil

745
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,025
will be always peacefully

746
02:02:35,236 --> 02:02:36,462
we will fight with pride, love, to any cost

747
02:02:39,664 --> 02:02:40,891
our island of the pride

748
02:02:43,754 --> 02:02:44,980
Iwo Jima

749
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:24,907
Do me a favor

750
02:03:27,031 --> 02:03:28,257
Stay and burn all the military documents, together with my personal belongings.

751
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:32,997
everything is happening three times.

752
02:04:02,599 --> 02:04:03,824
We will mount a general attack.

753
02:04:05,913 --> 02:04:07,140
although Sakama is lost

754
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:10,570
today our country praised our dedication

755
02:04:13,868 --> 02:04:15,095
it bequeathed the day in which they cried and they said by its souls

756
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:22,235
but today, we must give everything by our country, until the death

757
02:04:26,075 --> 02:04:27,300
I will always be to the front of you

758
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:31,777
my saber will be the legacy, and my bones the trophy

759
02:05:12,931 --> 02:05:14,157
Begin to shoot Banzai!

760
02:07:13,923 --> 02:07:15,149
No more..

761
02:07:17,394 --> 02:07:18,620
no more...

762
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:27,914
Fujita

763
02:08:08,331 --> 02:08:09,558
It is an order

764
02:09:09,205 --> 02:09:10,431
You again...

765
02:09:13,313 --> 02:09:14,539
I want to ask you a favor

766
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:22,564
Bury me, so that nobody can find me

767
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:38,836
Taro. Soon I will arrive at home

768
02:09:41,891 --> 02:09:43,116
I am glad of being able to do it

769
02:09:45,452 --> 02:09:46,679
but I feel sad to leave my friends here 

770
02:09:51,506 --> 02:09:52,732
I was driving my vehicle

771
02:09:54,655 --> 02:09:55,880
but I felt quite lonely

772
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:12,584
Is this Japanese soil?

773
02:10:17,701 --> 02:10:18,927
Yes!

774
02:10:21,973 --> 02:10:22,973
this continues being Japan

775
02:13:42,832 --> 02:13:44,057
We found something

776
02:14:01,306 --> 02:14:02,306
We have Something

777
02:14:14,549 --> 02:14:15,775
Those are letters...
