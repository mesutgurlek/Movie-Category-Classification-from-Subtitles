02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,570
I'll do it when I get back, boy.

1873
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:11,883
See you're on Level 8, and that
doesn't work. I gotta be on Level 4.

1874
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,684
I wanna win.
You gotta let me win.

Poke the bear!

Ooh. All right, bubba.

- Y'all look after our women, okay?
- Yeah.

1886
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,243
Okay. It's a big responsibility.
You up for it?

- Good.

We're gonna go about a two-hour drive...

1891
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:59,169
...shoot some guns, maybe have
a little conversation along the way.

1892
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:00,807
All right. Let's go.
