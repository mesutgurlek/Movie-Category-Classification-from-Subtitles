00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:28,688
They say Japan was made by a sword

3
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:35,056
They say the old gods dipped
the coral blade into the ocean

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,212
When they pulled it out

5
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:40,213
four perfect drops fell back into the sea

6
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:43,455
those drops became the islands of Japan

7
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:50,177
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men

8
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:53,956
Warriors willing to give their lives

9
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:56,619
for what seems to have become a forgotten word...

10
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:59,023
Honor

11
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:49,822
" The Last Samurai "

12
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,828
Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester

13
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:02,507
an American leader in all forms of armament
used by the United States Army

14
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,135
celebrates our nation's centenial

15
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,882
by bringing you a true
American hero.

16
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:12,978
One of our most decorated warriors
this country has ever known...

17
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:19,801
winner of the medal of honor for
his gallantry on the arena of battle each time.

18
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:24,136
He's late of the seventh
cavalary and a triumph campaign...

19
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:27,199
against the most savage of Indian nations.

20
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,129
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

21
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:35,315
Captain Nathan Algren.

22
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,578
Captain Nathan Algren!

23
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,047
Yes !

24
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:49,497
Yes!

25
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,160
Please, one moment, thank you.

26
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,800
God damn you, Algren!
Get out of there!

27
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,967
This is your last performance,
you are fired.

28
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,502
Now get out!

29
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,667
Come on!

30
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,448
I'm sick of this, come on!

31
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,443
Yes!

32
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,457
My thanks, Mr. McCabe.
You are too kind.

33
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:30,233
This, ladies and gents,
is the gun that's winning the west.

34
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:34,105
I... many's the time,
I found myself...

35
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,768
surrounded by a squad of wrath...

36
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,962
... angry hostiles.

37
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:50,875
with nothing but this rifle, between me
and their certain and gruesome death.

38
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,075
But let me tell you folks...

39
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:57,479
the "redman" doesn't fear his enemy.

40
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:02,546
If He'd had his way,
this scalp of mine will be long gone...

41
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:07,007
and then there will be a bald man
standing before you today.

42
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:17,386
Would those poor bastards attack there...
and a little bit more.

43
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:24,820
Bodies slit about... literally.

44
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:29,021
after rotted in the sun.

45
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:36,493
This, ladies and ladies,
73 lever-action...

46
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,794
chamber...

47
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:44,552
7-shot capacity, accurate at
400 yards, one round per second...

48
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,489
Son, you've seen what this
could do with a man?

49
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:50,881
It's blown a hole in your daddy 16 inches wide.

50
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:52,399
It's tragic

51
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:57,678
This beauty, it kills some
five, six, seven braves...

52
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,904
without ever having to reload.
Note the patented loading port...

53
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:03,936
and the smooth cocking action.

54
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:22,811
My thanks,
on behalf of those who died

55
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:26,341
in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

56
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,443
and commercial opportunities.

57
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,729
Mr. McCabe,
come here to take the orders

58
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:34,933
God bless you all.

59
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,725
I was seeking out to heat the
flame for the old melodrama.

60
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,153
- You are alive.
- I'm indeed.

61
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:54,154
You mind, Custer said to me,
"we're going to the Little BigHorn

62
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:57,861
since I want those weird stuff to
walk into take-up for me."

63
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,644
Now many things happened,
I will tell you what else happened.

64
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,116
I have a good job for the both of us.

65
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,171
God knows specially you're
gonna need one for yourself.

66
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,843
What kind of a job?

67
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:12,623
The only job you will
think you are loyal. A man's job!

68
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:17,482
Unless of course you give your heart
in the career in the theater.

69
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:23,244
Nathan!

70
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:26,245
You just listen to 'em.
Don't you bother to say.

71
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,476
For a while, it's good to see you.

72
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,825
Nathan Algren, I would like you
to meet Mr. Omura, from Japan.

73
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:34,937
and his associate, his name
I've given up try to pronounce.

74
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,151
Sit down, please.

75
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:43,957
Whiskey.

76
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:49,101
Now Japan's got that in mind
to become a civilized country.

77
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,124
And Mr. Omura here is...

78
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,111
...willing to spend whatever it takes
to hire a wise expert to train their army.

79
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:59,112
And he prepared a contract
the Emperor grants the U.S...

80
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,910
exclusive rights to supply arms.

81
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,036
I have an agreement with
the Winchester company,

82
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,047
and I am certain that Mr. Omura here
has some concept of what an agreement is.

83
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:20,091
Your performances for the
Winchester company bring you $25 a week.

84
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:24,094
We will pay you $400 a month.

85
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,237
$5 for each.

86
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:35,665
and another $500 when we get the job done.

87
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:40,796
How many other genuine whitean here
you got them lined up?

88
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:43,497
He's rude

89
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,097
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.

90
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,191
Whiskey.

91
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,515
So , who will be it - training
your boys to fight against?

92
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,636
His name is Kasumoto Moritsu.

93
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,762
He was last Emperor's teacher.

94
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:58,862
He is a samurai.

95
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,397
Samurai?

96
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,898
The word you might use it as "warrior"

97
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,844
Mr. Omura is familiar...

98
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,497
with our experience in dealing with renegade.

99
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:07,805
What is it?

100
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,638
It's going to read your book.

101
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,039
Captain Algren studied of a trial, which was a
crucial fact on the defeat of the Cheyennes.

102
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,132
Please excuse

103
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,296
What is funny?

104
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:38,003
Because...
back together again is so...

105
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,704
...inspiring

106
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:47,903
Excuse me

107
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,104
Excuse me.
Sorry for this.

108
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,102
This isn't a problem

109
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,661
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

110
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:01,728
Colonel Bagley.

111
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,889
We contacted you because
you are Captain Algren's superior officer...

112
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,302
and you've assured us of his participation.

113
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:09,614
I'll do it.

114
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:11,073
I just need a minute.

115
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:15,310
Nathan.

116
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:20,634
I did what I was ordered to do up there.

117
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,500
And I have no remorse.

118
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:26,763
What did you see through the past behind us?

119
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,938
You want me to kill Jappos?
I will kill Jappos.

120
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,350
I am not asking you to kill anybody, but the enemy...

121
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:37,179
Kill the enemy if it is Jappo.

122
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:38,638
Kill the enemy if it is Jappo.

123
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,896
Reb, Sioux, Cheyenne...

124
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:45,550
For 500 bucks a month,
I will kill whoever you want.

125
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,385
But keep one thing in mind...

126
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,393
I'd be happy to kill you for free.

127
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,878
June 12th, 1876.

128
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,299
There is some comfort in the emptiness in the sea.

129
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,982
No past, no future.

130
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,578
And I once am confronted by the
hard truth of the present circumstances.

131
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,303
I have been hired to help supress
the rebellion of another tribal leader.

132
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,860
Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.

133
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,867
I am upset by the ironies of my life.

134
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,317
Yokohama Harbor, 1876

135
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:55,158
Captain Algren, I presume?

136
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,159
Yes

137
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:58,262
I presume that good.
How do you do? Simon Graham.

138
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:01,620
20 years ago, it's sleepy little time.

139
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:03,359
Now, look at this.

140
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:07,160
You see, the emperor is mad
for all thing western.

141
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:09,911
and the Samurais believe
that it's changing too fast.

142
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:13,441
They find the ancient to the modern
will warp this old Japan.

143
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,272
So your new employer, Mr. Omura...

144
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,354
is bringing in every western
expert he can get his hands on.

145
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,243
Lawyers of France,
engineers of Germany...

146
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:26,032
architects of Holland and
now of course, warriors of America.

147
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:31,007
I came when I was with the British
legation, know, years ago...

148
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:36,169
I was soon relieved of my position
where I have a long long forest of
tendencies to tell the truth...

149
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:39,097
in a country where they never say what they need.

150
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:43,571
So now, I very accurately
translate the other people's lives.

151
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:52,229
For 2000 years, no Emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

152
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:55,114
You have to realise
this accidental chance is an honor.

153
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,134
This is all highly ritualism, of course.

154
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:58,847
You may look at him,
but do not speak.

155
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:00,238
Unless you are spoken to, obviously.

156
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:01,827
If he stands, you must bow.

157
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:03,516
If he bows, you must bow lower.

158
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:08,212
Do I look presentable?
I've wantoned a decade...

159
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,023
...on the smart round miggets.

160
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,624
and bow

161
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,259
The Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.

162
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,760
He's grateful for the assistance your country offers.

163
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,781
We hope to accomplish the same
national harmony you enjoy in your homeland.

164
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,825
The Emperor is most interested
in the American indians.

165
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,715
If you have fought against them in battle?

166
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:58,091
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is brutal ass.

167
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:10,035
The Emperor wishes to ask Captain
Algren if it is truth that...

168
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:14,910
they wear eagle feathers and paint their
faces before going into battle.

169
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,051
and then they have no fear.

170
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,898
They are very brave.

171
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:31,881
Bow

172
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:42,855
Thank you very much.

173
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,386
Step back

174
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,258
step back..step back and turn.

175
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:10,833
All right, you little bastards,
you should stand up straight in a line...

176
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:15,834
or I will passionately shit-kick
every one of you sad parade,
let it be before my eyes.

177
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,325
Well done, Sergeant.

178
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,630
When you understand the language,
everything is as fast as it takes place.

179
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,077
The first right you'll know:
rifles at the ready.

180
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,157
The second right...

181
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:34,804
July 27th, 1876. For six months of
work, I'm to receive...

182
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:39,325
...3 years of a Captain's pay,
teaching oriental soldiers.

183
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,533
They are army of conscription...

184
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,156
most of them present have never seen a gun.

185
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:48,711
Fire!

186
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,420
They are led by General Hasegawa...

187
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,520
a man of small stature and nonetheless
commanding enormous respect.

188
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,016
What can General tell me
about this man, this samurai...

189
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,758
-Katsumoto.

190
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:09,083
He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto, his rebellion.

191
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:12,734
I'll count on his help
when facing this samurai.

192
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,186
Who supply them with weapons?

193
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:26,034
Katsumoto no longer dishonours
himself by using firearms.

194
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,353
He uses no firearms?

195
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,504
Those honor the old way,
Katsumoto is a hero.

196
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,335
How well does he know this man?

197
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,660
Well, the General and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

198
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,907
He fought with the samurai?

199
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:42,645
He is a samurai.

200
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:53,071
You have to understand Katsumoto
pledged the sword to defend the Emperor.

201
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,953
They say the samurai's sword is his soul.

202
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,810
They are paradoxical people, samurai.

203
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,611
I've tried to write a book about them for years...

204
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,393
I seeked in vain to approach them close.

205
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,331
The bastards still wear armor.

206
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:07,161
Yes, when the Irishes' still
comporting themselves in rolling course.

207
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,139
He's characterized them as the most
sophisticated warriors on earth.

208
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:13,044
I need more detailed
information of their battle tactics.

209
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,319
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

210
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,545
Our captain will be speaking the
language of theirs.

211
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,956
You should've heard him
babbling on the Blackfoot.

212
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:25,255
Really? A fellow linguist?
Oh, Capital!

213
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,922
Oh come on Sir,
a word or two is very fun.

214
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:32,198
Just "hello" or "Goodbye''.

215
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,299
No,No..Cut its tongue and boil in the oil.

216
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:41,020
Early this morning we have a dull work.
so it is bed time, isn't it?

217
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:45,874
I once had a dread fascination for scalp.
I never understood its technique.

218
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,428
Imagine someone who hates you
with the uppermost intensity.

219
00:17:56,694 --> 00:18:00,549
Grasping in hand full of your hair
while you are lying prostrate and helpless.

220
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:10,912
And scraping a dull blade of
a rusted knife on your scalp...

221
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:12,281
with the soulless emotion.

222
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,602
and let your imagination grasp

223
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:21,606
you can, Mr. Graham,
the effect of a strong, quick
 jerk-out on the turf of your hair.

224
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,178
to release clinging part,
of course you have, of your nervous system.

225
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,979
You will have some idea of
what the hell it is to be scalped.

226
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Mr. Graham.

227
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,823
How soon can you translate those books?

228
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,270
Right away.

229
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:54,491
Just delighted to do it,
with your such an interest in Samurai.

230
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:58,018
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

231
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,506
I shalll not sleep until it is done.

232
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,539
Ah... foggy

233
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:07,738
Have a good night.

234
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,424
Can I get your answer?

235
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,599
This is a pureness expedition, Captain.

236
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,639
Colonel Bagley, these people have
nothing to do with the race.

237
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,207
Good night, Sir.

238
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:18,808
Running now, boys.

239
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,302
Fire!

240
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:18,496
I suppose we should be grateful
for our fire army to be shooting in the same direction.

241
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:20,329
could not put it better itself, Sir.

242
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,189
Rifle bottom against your shoulder.

243
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:34,043
Eye down the side, now slowly...

244
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:35,344
Fire!

245
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,739
Well done.
You've got that done.

246
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,819
Nathan...

247
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,274
Katsumoto attacked the railroad
in the border of his province.

248
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:53,941
we cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

249
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,506
He must be stopped now.

250
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,282
My railroad is a priority for this country.

251
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:00,739
They are not ready.

252
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,339
The rebels don't have a signle rifle.

253
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,500
They're savages with bows and arrows.

254
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,180
whose sole occupation for the
last 1000 years has been at war.

255
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:11,601
You have superior fire power and a larger force.

256
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,011
I am ordering the regiment to
move against the rebel Katsumoto.

257
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,453
You will track him down and engage him.

258
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:25,561
Mr. Graham...

259
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:27,918
tell these men to fire at me.

260
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,913
I beg your pardon?

261
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:33,522
Tell these men if he does not shoot me...

262
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,335
I will kill him.

263
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,245
Captain, could I make them awarded?

264
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,194
Kill him.

265
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,395
Kill him

266
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,996
Time to give it up.

267
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,196
Stop!

268
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,597
Load.

269
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:52,598
Stop!

270
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,099
Load

271
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,089
Faster!

272
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,417
Faster!

273
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,604
Shoot me or the time you died.

274
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:15,321
Fire!

275
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:18,534
Fire!

276
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,835
Fire! Fire! [Japanese]

277
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:47,107
They are not ready.

278
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,508
The regiment leaves at 6:00 A.M.

279
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,106
1,000 miles of rail track laid in
less than 2 years.

280
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:28,756
It's astonished.

281
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,200
No more owns all these.

282
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:33,881
As soon as we exempt
with the Samurai. Oh yes.

283
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,614
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?

284
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,793
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you...

285
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,164
he will find us.

286
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:52,291
Move!

287
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:54,138
Hold your position!

288
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:56,445
Yoshino Province, 1876.

289
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,375
First Company, follow up the backline around me!

290
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:02,865
Second Company, follow up
First Company.

291
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,934
Third and Fourth Company follow up!

292
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,345
To be at my command!

293
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,564
- Where is the Hasegawa?
- Unclear, he refused to fight against Katsumoto.

294
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:16,436
- Come on now!
- Captain Algren...

295
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,153
we are not here for combatness.

296
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:20,961
Then who's gonna lead these men?

297
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:23,904
Their own officers, for Chris sake,
let's move to the rear.

298
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,401
I'll be present there.

299
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,402
Change for the rear.

300
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:28,303
Change for the rear.

301
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,936
- Mr. Graham, you'll accompany me to the rear, okay?
- Of course.

302
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,596
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear.

303
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,738
See the disposition of the supply train.

304
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,861
Sergeant Gant, did you hear my order?

305
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,193
I did hear it, Sir.

306
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,073
Good, then you obey it.

307
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:50,774
Now!

308
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,838
No disrespecting intended, Sir,
we should look up our ass.

309
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,613
- Load!
- Load!

310
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,533
So many come.

311
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:34,678
You will be fine, Sir.

312
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,954
- Assume firing position!
- Assume firing position!

313
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,871
Fire on my order only!

314
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:33,820
Hold your fire!

315
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:36,221
Hold your fire!

316
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:44,281
Reload!

317
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,482
Hold the line!

318
00:26:52,483 --> 00:26:53,483
Fire! Fire!

319
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:12,384
Translate it: Fall back!

320
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,145
Gant!

321
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:37,946
He's mine.

322
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:06,650
Stop!

323
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:16,058
Take him away.

324
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,642
What is your name?

325
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,085
Insolent swine! Answer!

326
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:43,308
Leave him be.

327
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,158
This is my son in the village.

328
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:56,698
We are deep in the mountains
and the winter is coming.

329
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,544
You cannot escape.

330
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:02,457
It's surely good.

331
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:09,132
My Lord, why do you spare the arbarian?

332
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,793
He is ashamed in defeat.

333
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,681
He should kill himself.

334
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:16,413
This is not their custom.

335
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:22,423
Then...

336
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:24,793
...I will kill him.

337
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,615
Father...

338
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,618
I don't think...

339
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:32,342
Ujio...

340
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,353
...there will be plenty of killing to come.

341
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:37,260
For now...

342
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,970
...we will learn about our new enemy.

343
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,761
Keep him alive.

344
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,096
He's in bad shape.

345
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,018
Sake...

346
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,363
Sake?

347
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:00,448
Sake...

348
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:09,937
Sake...

349
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:12,383
Taka will take care of you.

350
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:13,562
Sake...

351
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,321
Sake...

352
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,236
Sake...

353
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,719
Let him drink, aunt.

354
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,955
No. That will not do.

355
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,515
This is my village.

356
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,859
This is my house.

357
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:35,086
Please...sake..

358
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:46,987
Sugay!

359
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,389
No!

360
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,390
No!

361
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:06,591
I told you!

362
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:01,122
Morning.

363
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:52,953
Over there.

364
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,673
Over there!

365
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,297
What's your name?

366
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:02,098
You have a name, don't you?

367
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:03,298
Naomei?

368
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,299
Naomai?

369
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:08,687
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

370
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:12,389
I know why you don't talk.

371
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:17,463
You're angry. You're angry
because I made you wear a dress.

372
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:21,379
Son of a bitch.

373
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:04,265
This temple was built by my
family 1,000 years ago.

374
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,563
My name is Katsumoto.

375
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:12,161
What is your name?

376
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:20,239
Are my words not correct?

377
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,519
I will practise my English with you...

378
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:31,474
if you would honor me...

379
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:36,027
You keep me alive just to speak English?

380
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:38,417
What do you want?

381
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,297
To know my enemy.

382
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:45,341
I've seen what you did with your enemies.

383
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:49,025
The warriors in its country do not kill?

384
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:51,114
They don't cut their heads off
to free the kneeling men.

385
00:42:53,428 --> 00:42:56,780
General Hasegawa asked me to help him and his life.

386
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,990
A samurai cannot stand the shame of the defeat.

387
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:05,042
I was honored to cut off his head.

388
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:10,525
Many of our customs seem strange to you...

389
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:13,477
and the same is true of yours. 

390
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:14,578
For example...

391
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:20,277
Not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

392
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:27,867
Nathan Algren.

393
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:32,194
I am honored to meet you.

394
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,121
I have enjoyed this conversation in English.

395
00:43:36,757 --> 00:43:37,882
I have questions.

396
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:43,684
I have introduced myself,
you have introduced yourself.
This is a very good conversation.

397
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:45,510
I have questions!

398
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,223
- Questions come later.
- Who was the warrior in the red armor?

399
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,112
My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.

400
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,753
and woman who cares for me?

401
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:57,806
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.
Her name is Taka.

402
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:00,443
I killed her husband?

403
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:03,326
It was a good death!

404
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:22,824
You! Come... please...

405
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,911
Thank you.

406
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:55,712
Douzo! [Japanese] (please!)

407
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:05,733
He smells like the pigs. Tell my
brother I cannot stand this.

408
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,214
Why don't you tell him?

409
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,923
At least make him take a bath.

410
00:46:15,614 --> 00:46:17,224
Nicely done!

411
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,661
They may be children,
but they are strong.

412
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,556
You try.

413
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:26,057
Fight!

414
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:46,905
Muyamini [Japanese]
(How absurd you are!)

415
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:08,142
Put down the sword.

416
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,143
Drop it!

417
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:37,339
I just realised...

418
00:49:37,593 --> 00:49:39,323
I've been remiss. Forgive me I...

419
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:43,624
forget to thank you for
looking out for me yesterday.

420
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,345
It's your job, correct?

421
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:47,755
Protecting me.

422
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:53,462
Well done, "Bob".
You don't mind if I call you "Bobby"?

423
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:56,126
I knew a Bob once.

424
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,181
God, he's a grist mill.

425
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:01,228
You hear this man, Bob?

426
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:08,810
Ujio was teaching you
the way of Japanese sword.

427
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:12,134
Yes, indeed.

428
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:17,758
You fought against the red indians?

429
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:24,495
Yes.

430
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,306
Tell me the real part in this war.

431
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:28,086
- Why?
- I wish to learn.

432
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:29,575
Read the book.

433
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,602
I'd rather to have a good conversation.

434
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:33,312
- Why?
- Because...

435
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:35,993
to read a book constitutes a work.

436
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,215
So...

437
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,827
you were the General of your army?

438
00:50:51,158 --> 00:50:56,142
No... I was a Captain.

439
00:50:56,588 --> 00:50:58,635
This is a lower rank?

440
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:02,336
a middle rank

441
00:51:04,213 --> 00:51:05,497
Then who was the General?

442
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,864
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

443
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,586
People in your country do not like conversation?

444
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:18,400
He was a Lieutenant-Colonel.

445
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:21,353
His name is Custer.

446
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:23,150
I know this name.

447
00:51:23,796 --> 00:51:25,041
He killed many warriors.

448
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,347
Aye. Many warriors.

449
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:29,174
So he was a good General.

450
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:33,278
No, he wasn't a good General,
he was arrogant, foolhardy.

451
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:36,302
and he got massacred because
he took a single battallion...

452
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,033
...against 2,000 angry indians.

453
00:51:38,884 --> 00:51:42,578
2,000 indians?
How many men for Custer?

454
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:48,064
- 200.
- I like this General Custer.

455
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,860
He was a murderer,
who fell in love with his own legend.

456
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:54,638
and his troops died for it.

457
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:56,672
I think this is a very good death.

458
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,084
Oh, maybe you can
have one just like it someday.

459
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,431
If it is my destiny.

460
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,244
What you want from me?

461
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,122
What do you want for yourself?

462
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:08,589
What are you doing?

463
00:52:09,386 --> 00:52:11,217
Why we have these conversations?

464
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,615
What the hell am I doing here?

465
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:24,531
In spring, the snow will melt
and passage will open.

466
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:30,056
Until that time, you are here.

467
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:34,167
Good day, Captain.

468
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,634
1876... day unknown, month unknown.

469
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,264
I continue to live among these unusual people.

470
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:08,844
I'm a captive and I cannot escape.

471
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:13,933
Mostly I'm treated with a kind of a mind of regret

472
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:18,349
as if I was a street dog, an unwelcome guest.

473
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:34,131
Everyone is polite,
everyone smiles and bows.

474
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:40,346
But beneath this courtesy,
I detect their deep breath of moral feeling.

475
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:10,887
Higen

476
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:22,795
They are intriguing people.
