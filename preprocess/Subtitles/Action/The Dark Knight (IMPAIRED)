...Like I lied.

-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

Yes, I do.

2019
02:15:12,913 --> 02:15:14,187
The Joker won.

2020
02:15:16,513 --> 02:15:19,266
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

2021
02:15:19,793 --> 02:15:21,465
...undone.

2022
02:15:21,953 --> 02:15:26,663
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

2023

We bet it all on him.

2024
02:15:29,233 --> 02:15:31,986
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

2025

People will lose hope.

Two of them cops.

-You can't sweep that--
-No.

But the Joker cannot win.

Gotham needs its true hero.

-No.
-You either die a hero...

...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

I can do those things...

2036
02:16:17,153 --> 02:16:20,065
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

2037
02:16:22,953 --> 02:16:25,706
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

No, no, you can't. You're not.

Not the hero we deserved,

Because sometimes...
