00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,771
Think of this as a pilot light.

792
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:59,858
When our ideal launch window opens
in just over an hour...

793
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,652
this magnificent creation
will fly into the sun...

794
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:04,571
trailing magnetic resonance.

795
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,240
- And when it hits?
- It will trigger a solar flare...

796
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:11,578
that will propagate at light speed
along the magnetic trail we've left.

797
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,288
Eight and a half minutes later...

798
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:16,541
it will utterly destroy
the sunward-facing side of the Earth.

799
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,794
Nearly half the world's population
will die instantly.

800
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:22,672
And thanks to the accompanying
electromagnetic pulse...

any technology more advanced
than, say, the steam engine...

about unchecked power...

950
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,005
you're still so arrogant you didn't bother
to come up with a plan to stop yourself?

951
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,674
I do have a plan.

952
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:49,843
It's called the Justice League.

953
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:53,472
Just wanted to be sure.

954
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:57,684
What is it?

955
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:00,228
If the league ever did go over
to the wrong side...

956
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:03,690
I want there to be somebody I can trust
to keep the planet safe.

957
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:06,234
Even from me.

958
01:16:44,893 --> 01:16:46,895
