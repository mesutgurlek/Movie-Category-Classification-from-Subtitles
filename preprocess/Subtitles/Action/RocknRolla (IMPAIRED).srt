00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:31,940
ARCHY:
<i>People ask a question.</i>

2
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,814
<i>What's a RocknRolla?</i>

3
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,682
<i>And I tell them it's not about drums,
drugs and hospital drips</i>.

4
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,348
<i>Oh, no.</i>

5
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,188
<i>There's more there than that, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,031
<i>We all like a bit of the good life.</i>

7
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,666
<i>Some, the money.</i>

8
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,665
<i>Some, the drugs.</i>

9
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:57,569
<i>Others the sex game,
the glamour or the fame</i>.

10
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:02,144
<i>But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different.</i>

11
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,711
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,318
<i>Because a real RocknRolla
wants the fucking lot.</i>

13
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,789
<i>My name's Archy,
formerly known as Archibald.</i>

14
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,222
<i>I work for a man called Lenny Cole.</i>

15
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:55,455
<i>And Lenny Cole has the keys
to the back door of this booming city.</i>

16
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,192
<i>Let me give you an example
of how Lenny works his magic.</i>

17
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,631
<i>Two years ago,
this property cost 1 million pounds.</i>

18
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,036
Today, it costs 5 million.

19
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,300
How did this happen?

20
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,377
Attractive tax opportunities
for foreign investment...

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,709
...restrictive building consent
and massive hedge-fund bonuses.

22
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,906
London, my good man...

23
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,211
...is fast becoming the financial
and cultural capital of the world.

24
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,184
ARCHY:
<i>London is on the rise.</i>

25
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:22,791
<i>Property value has gone one way: up.</i>

26
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,827
<i>And this has left the natives struggling
to keep a foothold in the property ladder.</i>

27
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,759
I can't teach you how to skin a cat...

28
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,924
...but I can tell you a lot
about the money in bricks and mortar.

29
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,467
Like he said, it's going one way.

30
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,127
You need to see a lawyer.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,973
We do need to see a lawyer.

32
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,633
Well, it looks like a great deal.

33
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,404
These are the plans.

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,606
It'll cost 10,
and it'll be worth 20 with planning.

35
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:49,047
But, first, you gotta give
the Councillor a drink.

36
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,017
LAWYER [ON PHONE] : <i>Same deal as before.
I'll tell them they've got the planning.</i>

37
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,985
<i>Thank you, Councillor.</i>

38
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,120
You'll get the planning.

39
00:02:56,292 --> 00:03:00,092
Take care of the Councillor,
and it'll move like shit through a goose.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,288
We need help.

41
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,523
Lenny Cole.

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,065
Dog number one.

43
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,601
Bet he moves fast
and likes bricks and mortar.

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,603
LENNY: I do move fast,
and I love bricks and mortar.

45
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,240
Property's always a safe bet...

46
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:15,536
...but you gotta know what you're doing,
this ain't soft money.

47
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,112
ARCHY: <i>Because of these boys'
criminal records...</i>

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,476
<i>...the bank won't lend them
the money they need.</i>

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,174
<i>Enter Mr. Lenny Cole...</i>

50
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,651
<i>...London's money-loaning
and fast-moving property magician.</i>

51
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,619
Don't let me down, boys.

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,280
Come on, give me your hand.

53
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,019
<i>And this is where he waves
his black magic wand.</i>

54
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,720
Can't talk now,
but there's been a problem.

55
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,331
I can't get you the planning.

56
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,698
Sorry, boys, can't get the planning.

57
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,429
ARCHY:
<i>Oh, isn't that an unpleasant surprise.</i>

58
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,402
<i>Because they don't wanna owe Lenny.</i>

59
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,973
He can't get the planning.

60
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,632
<i>That's right, sweetheart.</i>

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,868
Can't get the planning?

62
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,512
<i>You've been fucked.</i>

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
What do you mean
you can't get the fucking planning?

64
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,773
You owe me.

65
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,682
Right, I get the building,
you lose your share...

66
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,323
...and I'm still out of pocket
two large ones.

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,220
Find it.

68
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,528
ARCHY: <i>They know they'll have to pay Lenny
before the month is out.</i>

69
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:11,326
<i>Because Mr. Cole has ways of making life
very, very uncomfortable.</i>

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,729
We better find it.

71
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,700
<i>What they don't know
is that Lenny controls the councilors...</i>

72
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,271
<i>...the judges and the lawyers.</i>

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,568
<i>No planning permission will be given
until Lenny wants it.</i>

74
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,473
<i>And now that he owns the building,
he wants the permission.</i>

75
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,511
Hello, Councillor?

76
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,573
Yeah.

77
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,918
Yeah, I hear you got that car
you wanted.

78
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,582
You're very generous, Len.

79
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,190
Right, now, sort that planning out,
will you?

80
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,218
-Sorted, Lenny.
-Good.

81
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,964
What's wrong with you, Archy?

82
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,603
Was that not a bit strong, Len?

83
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:52,198
They come from the same place as you.
You're gonna clean them out.

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,865
The same place as me?

85
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,375
Do I look like a fucking immigrant?

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,207
No one gave me a leg up.

87
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,340
They need a little bit of fear,
otherwise, they'll come up against me.

88
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,249
They need a little lesson, don't they?

89
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,879
<i>And that is an example
of how Lenny works.</i>

90
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,363
<i>Now, today is Lenny's big day.</i>

91
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:20,627
<i>He's hit the big time...</i>

92
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:24,671
<i>...because a new Russian billionaire
desires Lenny's property contacts.</i>

93
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,708
<i>He wants planning permission
where the law won't allow.</i>

94
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,276
Lenny Cole is here.

95
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,140
<i>Lenny will come through...</i>

96
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,442
<i>...but he will rape that Russian
for every ruble he can get.</i>

97
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,879
Nice to see you, Uri.

98
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,748
Good. Come and take a seat.

99
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:42,883
Excuse me if I am hasty,
but I have a busy day.

100
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,027
-Oh, that's all right.
-Sit.

101
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:50,831
I can see we are very much alike,
you and I, Lenny.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,434
We like to get things done.

103
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,837
What's it going to cost me?

104
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,969
First, let me make it clear exactly
how we can help you benefit from this deal.

105
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,339
Without me,
you'd be waiting five to 10 years...

106
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:06,414
...before you got permission
to erect your arena.

107
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,846
Secondly, with British law
as it so stands--

108
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,213
Lenny, how much?

109
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,390
Seven million euros.

110
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:26,195
I expect the guarantee that I have consent
within six months and no red tape.

111
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,666
Oh, you got it.

112
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:28,997
Consider it done.

113
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,502
-Drink?
-Yeah.

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,344
That's a nice painting, Uri.

115
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,813
It's got depth, you know.

116
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,452
That picture has brought me nothing
but luck, Lenny.

117
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,644
It's my lucky picture.

118
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,449
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

119
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:48,983
You like?

120
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,750
Yeah.

121
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:53,195
Take it for a while.

122
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,659
Maybe it will give you luck.

123
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,664
Oh, no, Uri, I-- You know, I couldn't.

124
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,268
We are partners now, I insist.

125
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,836
I will get it sent around to your house.

126
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,372
You can give it back to me
when our deal's finalized.

127
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,668
Hm?

128
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,411
Well, I thought you lot drank vodka.

129
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,879
Whiskey is the new vodka.

130
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,608
You're not joining me?

131
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,582
I don't drink.

132
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,351

Right away, Len.

He tried to poison me, the dirty Cossack.

Look, stop messing about,
just give me the bottle.

Sorry, Len.

How is the billionaires club?

00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:56,481
Well, I tell you what, this Communism
didn't slow him down, did it?

144
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,752
I'll tell you what, Arch.

-They ain't no respecters of the old school.
-Oh, bollocks.

There's no school like the old school,

Don't spoil it,

Why?

1545
01:39:31,415 --> 01:39:34,782
Because you're poison, John, that's why.

Hey, Archy.

1574
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:11,212
The address is in my jacket.

1575
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:13,815
I wouldn't mess you around, Archy,
it's in my jacket.

1576
01:41:22,492 --> 01:41:24,255
What does it say?

1577
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:36,035
You want to know what it says, Len?

1578
01:41:38,642 --> 01:41:43,909
Funny thing about the law,
it can be quite flexible.

1579
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,911
Because every time an informer...

1580
01:41:47,084 --> 01:41:50,884
...finds himself in front of a judge,
a secret letter--

1581
01:41:51,054 --> 01:41:55,047
--stands witness
as to the cooperation and efficiency--

1582

ARCHY:
<i>--of that informer.</i>

1583
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,196
And if that informer
provides adequate information...

1584
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:05,063
...then that dog of dogs
is magically released.

1585
01:42:05,235 --> 01:42:07,863
A sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.

1586
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:09,767
And it comes with a very good alibi.

1587

Now, you give us the names
of the people you want put down...

...and we'll get them the long sentences.

You can appear to reduce those terms
through your contacts.

1590

We'll make you look like a fucking

The only evidence
that will ever remain of this deal...

1593
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:30,093
...comes in the form
of a very exclusive...

01:42:33,263 --> 01:42:37,131
As in deposition or handlers sheet.

1596
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:40,499
Of course, the informer
always uses a false name.

1597
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:42,103
What name do you like?

You can have
Elvis fucking Presley if you fancy.

Nothing's gonna happen
while we're standing in the lift.

They'd have to carry
