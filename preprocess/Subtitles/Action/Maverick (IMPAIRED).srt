We'll leave you now.

Don't want anyone to see me here...

that I was connected with your...

why not?

does not count. Take it all.

I think so. For as long
as I can remember, at any rate.

122

BRET: My old pappy used to say,
"He who fights and runs away...

123
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,756
...can run away another day."

124

What?

what's so great about...

Look, son...

I'm just trying to expound.

130

I was saying, I don't see
what's so great about being brave.

131
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,601
BRET: I'm a card player.
Call me a gambler.

132
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,832
BRET: I want to become an old gambler.

133
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,992
You are a gunfighter.

134
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,275
BRET: An exceptional one at that,
from what I hear.

135
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:18,196
If I went up against you, what
chance would I have had? Answer?

Zero.

No.
Let's play poker.

I thought that was fast.

Stud?

152

ANGEL: You said you never bluffed.
I had a pair of aces!

165

BRET: I said I never cheated
and I hardly ever bluff.

166
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,994
This is one of the "hardlys."

167
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,390
You've been cheating
the whole game.

What do you think I was doing
during that first hour?

169

I was learning your "tells."

[Chuckling] Your weakness comes
when you get your hand.

171
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:22,555
You shuffle the cards back and forth
and act a little fidgety.

172
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,269
I just called you a cheat!
[Patrons murmur]

173
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,552
You also called me gutless...

174
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,792
...but I figured
you were just teasing.

through the window...

...I believed in the Almighty.

179

BRET: You fellows were drinking.
A lot.

180
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,800
And you played bad.
Whose fault is that?

181
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,670
THUG 2: Yours, you bastard!
It's all your fault.

BRET: Hold onto this for me.

188
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,758
BRET: Now, if these fellows
get to whupping me...

189
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,474
...you can shoot me.

Thanks to my lucky shirt.

That'll learn them assholes!

What the hell else bad can happen?
You!

209

What did you say before?
You called me something.

210

Nothing important.

Oh! [Laughs]

217

I don't like being teased.

I shouldn't be doing this.

235

You're standing in the hall,
Mrs. Bransford. That's still legal.

I know we may never
see each other again...

no Mr. Bransford, is there?

No, and there never will be,
thank you very much.

and there's no harm done.

you must know how to.

...pointed at your heads.

BRET: Just whistle,
so they can hear you.

775
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:44,556
BRET: You're surrounded.

776

[Neither Coop nor Annabelle can whistle]

777
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:54,398

Clap if you can't whistle!

BRET: See? They're out there.

780
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:03,358
Zane Cooper will blow your brains
out. Probably heard of him.

781
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:07,196
I know you're thinking he's old, decrepit,
gums his food and his women.

782
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:09,033
But he can still shoot straight.

After you is Ugly Annie Bransford.

784
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:14,238
She came out backwards when
she was born, and nobody noticed.

785
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:18,960
Her parents had to tie a pork chop
to her so the dog would play with her.

786
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:22,711
When making love, she has to pretend
she's somebody else.

787
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:24,872
[Thieves laugh]

That was funny.

790
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:31,432
ANNA: I didn't think so.

791
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,872
BRET: Some Indians
attacked a wagon train.

792
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:37,670
They said it might be whites acting
like Indians, but I don't believe it.

793
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:41,391
If you come along with me,
we'll settle this matter.

794
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:44,595
BRET: So if you could just follow me.

BRET: Get up.
Get in a line and let's go.

to remember!

797
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:01,240
ANNA: Aren't you helping him?
COOP: A man could get killed like that.

798
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:12,318
ANNA: Did you just help him?

799

They're all gone.
Isn't it wonderful?

806

ANNA: I'll be rich!
BRET: It was nothing, really.

807
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:54,715
COOP: I'll tell you what you did wrong.
ANNA: Now where's the money?

808
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,077
ANNA: You tell me where it is.

809
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:58,549
ANNA: There it is!

810
00:54:58,801 --> 00:54:59,756
[Thief screams]

such beautiful money!

00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:06,150
COOP: Take off that dress!
ANNA: How dare you!

813
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:08,392
COOP: Not you. Him.
ANNA: Put that cash down!

814
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,109
ANNA: I found it!
BRET: I nearly got blown away!

815
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:13,829
COOP: I'll take the money.
ANNA: I'll count it for you.

816
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,480
BRET: Don't let her touch it!

817
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,793
COOP: Where are you going?
Stay and clean up your mess.

818
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:21,350
COOP: Be mature.
Clean up this mess.

819
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,399
BRET: Get back!
Put those guns down and line up.

[Thieves grunt and groan]

M. MARY: I have found you.
For He said, "Seek and ye shall find."

823
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:39,593
M. MARY: And I have found you.
Oh, rejoice!

to bear children. The Lord says...

Here you go, the 10 percent we promised.

M. MARGARET: That leaves us
with $27,000, Margaret Mary.

837
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:23,157
M. MARY: That's not enough
to start a mission.

838
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:26,438
M. MARGARET: Don't worry.
We promised Mr. Maverick...

...$3,000 and we delivered.
The Lord will provide for us.

[Gong]

1388
01:34:10,281 --> 01:34:11,111
BRET: Wait!

1389
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,633
[Crowd murmurs]

1390
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:15,109
BRET: Excuse me.

[Bret sighs]

1393
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:30,240
COOP: Dealer,
you can start the game.

1394
01:34:30,601 --> 01:34:31,716
DEALER: Ante up, everyone.
$50.

1395
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:47,481
BRET: A thousand and two more.

1396
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:51,550
ANNA: I'll see your $2,000 and...

1397
01:34:52,961 --> 01:34:54,917
Can I bid everything I have?

1398
01:34:55,161 --> 01:34:55,991
DEALER: Yes, ma'am.

1399
01:34:58,121 --> 01:35:00,351
ANNA: That'll be $ 12,000.

1400
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:06,913

ANGEL: I'm out.

1401
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:09,440
[Bret exhales]

1402
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:13,753
BRET: What the hell!
I feel like being silly. I'll call.

1403
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:18,520
[Bret clears throat]

1404
01:35:18,761 --> 01:35:20,752
It's just a pair of sixes.

1405
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:24,074
If you can beat that,
then I'm licked.

1406
01:35:24,681 --> 01:35:26,990
Not a totally unpleasant prospect.

1407
01:35:27,241 --> 01:35:28,799
[Crowd laughs]

1408
01:35:31,481 --> 01:35:33,199
ANNA: I'm out of the game.

1409
01:35:34,321 --> 01:35:35,959
I'm out.

1410
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:37,554
You put me out.

1411
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:39,276
BRET: I did.

1412
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:41,273
ANNA: I didn't do any of my tells.

1413
01:35:41,521 --> 01:35:43,557
I didn't twirl my hair
or flick my teeth.

1414
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:46,520
BRET: [Inhales]
You held your breath.

1415
01:35:47,801 --> 01:35:48,836
No, I wasn't.

1416
01:35:50,721 --> 01:35:52,359
ANNA: Did I hold it?
COMM: Yes.

1417
01:35:52,601 --> 01:35:54,034
ANNA: Did I?

1418
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:55,710
ANNA: Did I?

1419
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,229
BRET: See?

1420
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:00,110
BRET: Sorry.
See, usually...

1421
01:36:00,361 --> 01:36:03,034
...when you get excited,
you breathe heavily.

1422
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:04,794
How do you...

1423
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:14,155
I'll just pretend I was playing
with somebody else's money.

1424
01:36:14,841 --> 01:36:17,674
BRET: Shouldn't be hard.
ANNA: Gentlemen.

1425
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:20,116
[Applause]

1426
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:22,795

01:36:25,201 --> 01:36:26,190
[Whistle]

1429
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:31,236
DEALER: You open, Commodore.

1430
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:34,475
I'll open for $5,000.

1431
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:36,712
HIGHTOWER: 5,000?

1432
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:40,593
ANGEL: I'll see your 5...

1433
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:43,235
...and raise you 5.

1434
01:37:43,481 --> 01:37:44,755
DEALER: 10,000 to you.

1435
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:46,400

1436
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,918
COMM: And 5 more to me.

1437
01:37:51,201 --> 01:37:52,634
DEALER: Cards?

1438
01:37:53,241 --> 01:37:54,594
2 cards, please.

1439
01:37:58,481 --> 01:38:00,836
DEALER: Sir?
ANGEL: 2.

1440
01:38:34,641 --> 01:38:36,074
DEALER: Mr. Maverick.

1441
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,398
BRET: One card, but not from you.
Put the deck down.

1442
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:46,232
BRET: I'd like a new deck,
new cut and a new shuffle.

1443
01:38:46,481 --> 01:38:48,517
I'm sorry, that isn't permitted.

1444
01:38:48,761 --> 01:38:50,956
COOP:
But you can have a new dealer.

1445
01:38:53,801 --> 01:38:56,520
In that case,
I'd like you to deal.

1446
01:38:58,121 --> 01:38:59,793
Just one from the top.

1447
01:39:02,001 --> 01:39:03,275
I like that.

1448
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:05,999
Shows trust.

1449
01:39:19,601 --> 01:39:23,435
The Commodore has 4 of a kind,
Angel has a small straight flush...

1450
01:39:23,681 --> 01:39:25,956
...and I don't know
what Maverick has.

1451
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:29,720
DEALER:
It's up to you, Commodore.

1452
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:36,152
COMM: It looks like I'm sucking
hind tit, so I'll bet everything.

1453
01:39:37,401 --> 01:39:39,596
DEALER:
The Commodore wagers $25,000.

1454
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:40,990
[Crowd gasps]

1455
01:39:48,161 --> 01:39:50,436
ANGEL: I'll see your 25.

1456
01:39:52,961 --> 01:39:54,633
ANGEL:
I guess we're even.

1457
01:39:56,841 --> 01:39:59,594
I'll raise you everything I've got.

1458

[Crowd murmurs]

1459
01:40:03,321 --> 01:40:05,232
That's half a million to the winner.

1460
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,513
BRET:
That should cover the Commodore.

1461
01:40:17,321 --> 01:40:19,232
Aren't you going to look at your card?

1462
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:21,029
No need.

1463
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,841
ANGEL: What are you playing at?
Look at it.

1464
01:40:24,521 --> 01:40:27,035
I'd look at my card
if I were you. [Laughs]

1465
01:40:27,601 --> 01:40:29,193
DEALER:
This is your portion of the pot.

1466
01:40:30,761 --> 01:40:33,753
What kind of poker you playing?
Look at that card!

1467
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:41,478
DEALER: Cards have been called,
Commodore. Show your cards.

1468
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:47,391
I have 2 small pair.

1469
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,315
COMM: Eights...

1470
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:53,314

Thank you.

1473
01:41:08,801 --> 01:41:10,393
Not going to look?

1474
01:41:16,881 --> 01:41:18,155
Well...

1475
01:41:20,921 --> 01:41:24,231
...how you going to know
if you can beat my straight flush?

BRET: [Whimpering] Ha!
ANNA: You all right?

1492
01:43:26,321 --> 01:43:28,039
BRET: I can't believe
I pulled that card. I...

1493
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:30,636
Did I ever tell you
about the snakes...

1494
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:32,314
ANNA: You're babbling.

Shh!
You're babbling.

Your security isn't worth a damn!

Everybody's got a gun!

1498

1503
01:44:12,481 --> 01:44:14,631
I wish your moment
could last longer...

Hell, I just...

What?

1507
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:24,833
I'll have regrets, I'm sure,
but I'm going to take it nevertheless.

1508
01:44:25,081 --> 01:44:26,833
Move down the steps.

Down the stairs, now.

You son of a bitch!

I worked my ass off for that.
I'll be coming for it.

That's my money.

I can always win more money.

but it's my half million.

1696
01:56:34,001 --> 01:56:36,595
BRET: And the other one's
twice as heavy.

1697
01:56:36,841 --> 01:56:38,433
[Coop chuckles]

1698
01:56:38,681 --> 01:56:41,400
COOP:
Ah, Bret, that's my boy!

1699
01:56:41,721 --> 01:56:43,757
BRET: What are kids for?
Give back the boot.

1700
01:56:44,001 --> 01:56:44,831
Be my guest.

1701
01:56:45,081 --> 01:56:46,230
BRET: Thank you.

1702
01:56:47,441 --> 01:56:50,478
I don't know why I left
the other half in the satchel.

1703
01:56:50,721 --> 01:56:53,281
COOP: I do.
BRET: [Laughing] So do I.

1704
01:56:53,521 --> 01:56:56,240
BRET: Lt'll be lots of fun
getting it back.

1705
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:59,750
COOP: Bret.
BRET: Yes, sir?

1706
01:57:00,321 --> 01:57:02,551
COOP:
Something I got to know, son.

1707
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:08,793
How did you come up
with that ace of spades?

1708
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:11,629
You won't believe me.

1709
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:13,912
I'm your father,
I'll believe you.

1710
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:22,800
Magic.

1711
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:25,155
Magic?

1712
01:57:26,921 --> 01:57:28,274
Magic.

1713
01:57:35,721 --> 01:57:37,234
I believe you.

1714
01:57:38,881 --> 01:57:40,200
Thanks.

1715
02:01:13,081 --> 02:01:15,072
