00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,351
We'll handle this.

00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,103
Brother, stop fighting.

20
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,605
I beg you.

21
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,909
My Hun brothers, I come in peace!

22
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,120
What does this have to do with
the Silk Road Protection Squad?

23
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,248
Our mission has always been

24
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,751
to turn foes into friends

25
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,294
and to attain peace for all races.

26
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,671
Whatever our friends
on the Silk Road need,

27
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,924
it's our responsibility to help.

28
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,093
Survival of the fittest
is the only truth on the Silk Road.

29
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:25,932
You want to control all 36 nations here
with your pathetic little band?

00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,350
Anyway, he already lost.

(soldiers shouting)

33
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,444
Success doesn't depend
on how many you are,

34
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,779
but on how determined you are.

35
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,781
Woman: Let go.

36
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,075
Let go!

37
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,579

I'm sorry, that wasn't intentional.

42
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,903
Woman: Get your sword out.

43
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,407
We'll follow the code.

44
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,036
The Protection Squad
follows the laws of our country.

45
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,663
We don't fight.

46

52
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,635
Huo An:
Lady Cold Moon!

53
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,096
I didn't mean to remove your veil.

54
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,722
You dropped it yourself.

55
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,682
I know.

56
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,184
It was fate.

57
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,145
Actually, I'm here because...

58
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
Drink.

59
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,902
I'm ready.

60
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,995
I just wanted to return your veil.

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,705
I didn't see anything.

62
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,541
Nothing happened between us.

63
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,548
(soldiers laughing)

64
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,092
Stop laughing!

65
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,386
We haven't been home
in a long time. Let's go!

69
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,993
Wind and sand,
please send him back

70
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:21,041
Tell him I really miss him

71
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,379
Wind and sand, please promise me

72
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,464
He will come home

73
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,557
For the past few months,
I've been giving my wages

74
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
to my injured brothers.

75
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,070
I know.

76
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,697
You take such good care of your men.

77
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,199
We'll manage.

78
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,620
I know people laugh at you
for marrying a Huns man.

79
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,580
There you go again.

80
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,957
I love you because we're the same.

81
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,293
We believe in equality for all races.

82
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,837
You preach peace among
the different races on the Silk Road,

83
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,298
and I teach peace to children
from different tribes at school.

84
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,467
We're bound to succeed.

85
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
(knocks on door)

86
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,687
- Captain!
- Yin Po.

87
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,397
The Protection Squad is in trouble.

88
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,275
The Prefecture Chief's army

89
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,112
found four boxes of gold coins
outside the border.

90
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,454
There's a customs clearance
document inside.

91
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,580
Signed by who?

92
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,335
The Protection Squad.

93
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,016
Men: Captain.

94
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,064
Lieutenant.
What crime have we committed?

95
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,440
Why have you locked up my men?

96
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,444
The Protection Squad is under
the Prefecture Chief's jurisdiction.

97
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,655
(men grunting)

98
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,156
Don't move!

99
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,375
This has nothing to do with them.

100
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,668
Take me.

101
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,213
By order of the Prefecture Chief,

102
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,301
Huo An and his Protection Squad
are under arrest for gold smuggling.

103
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,848
They will be sent to Wild Geese Gate
tomorrow morning to rebuild the city.

104
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,451
Man: What a crook.

105
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,412
Sending us to the border

106
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,456
so they can blame
the smuggled gold on us.

107
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,249
We've been exiled!

108
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,752
Wild Geese Gate is for prisoners
serving life sentences.

109
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,713
Once you go in, there's no way out.
This is so unfair.

110
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,090
What are you going to do about it?

111
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,800
Look, brothers.

112
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,554
We were once rescued by General Huo
from the Wild Geese Gate.

113
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,391
We should take this opportunity
to pay our respects to him.

114
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,977
Right.

115
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,005
- (shouts in Mandarin) Move!
- (chattering)

116
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,126
- Keep moving!
- Move! Next!

Quick. Help the injured!

122
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,564
What an idiot!

123
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,608
Captain, are you all right?

124
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,734
I'm fine.

125
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,278
Help them!

126
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,196
Help them.

127
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,990
It's all their fault! Get them!

128
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,074
Stop!

129
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,868
Come on! Fight!

130
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,996
What are you doing?

131
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,215
Stop!

132
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,177
(both grunting)

133
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,430
Stop fighting!

134
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,895
Stop fighting!

135
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,445
(grunting)

136
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,240
Stop!

137
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,164
Guards: Stop!

138
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,458
Everyone stop fighting!

139
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,834
Get back to work!

140
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,794
Stop now!

141
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,671
Protection Squad, come here.

142
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,227
I don't care
about the Protection Squad.

143
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,146
This is the Wild Geese Gate.

144
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,569
Huo An,
under the Prefecture Chief's orders,

145
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,696
we have to finish rebuilding the city,

146
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,824
so you bunch of losers need to hurry up.

147
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,162
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

148
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,892
(dramatic music playing)

149
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,747
(in English) Legion!

150
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,332
We stop!

151
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,503
What do you think, General?

152
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,716
What is our current condition?

153
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,509
Close to 800 soldiers.

154
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,846
Three thousands bows
and crossbows altogether.

155
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,348
- Horses are thirsty and near exhaustion.
- Yes.

156
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,233
If we're gonna have a chance, we need
to take them as soon as possible.

157
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,997
Lucius. Lucius.

158
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,709
- Lucius.
- Yes, I'm here.

159
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,882
Falco says that
you are going to take the city.

160
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,970
Yes, but their captain is very weak,
and he doesn't look too bright,

161
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,139
so it won't take long.

162
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,557
Let's have a drink.

163
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll wait for your good news
when you return.

164
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,151
We're at a new city, place to rest.

165
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,333
(in Mandarin) Intruders.

166
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,222
Listen to me if you want to live.

167
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,936
This way.

168
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,360
(shouting)

169
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,821
Sound the drums!

170
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262

In Rome,

we are trained to obey, to serve,
since we are very young.

When you finally get the opportunity

What?

00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,610
Someone hurts you or your family,

Otherwise we're all going

Even if everyone works at full speed,

Lucius: I served under
Consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives.

389
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,667
He moved his troops
to the Parthian Empire,

390
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,669
formed an alliance with the Queen,

391
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,880
who is the sister of our Lady Crassus.

392
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:15,884
Consul Marcus's elder son, Tiberius,
is a vicious and treacherous man.

393
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:20,264
The Consul was planning on naming
his youngest son Publius

394
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,307
to be his heir and successor.

395
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,685
He entrusted me to keep the child alive.

396
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,975
The young lord started having
problems with his eyes.

397
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:32,276
The Parthian queen kindly sent medicine
to heal his vision.

398
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,363
Tiberius laced it with poison,

399
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,657
blinding his brother
so he could never become Consul.

400
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,076
He then killed his father.

401
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,536
I had no choice

402
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,789
but to take my soldiers and the child,

403
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,332
become a fugitive.

404
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,335
Until I reached the Wild Geese Gate...

405
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,798
I've been a man without a country,

406
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,092
marked for death.

407
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,432
The deputy I sent to the Parthian Empire

408
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,976
is meant to restore the peace treaty

409
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,395
and to prove Tiberius's
vicious intentions.

410
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,449
I'm orphan.

411
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,159
Hun raids.

412
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,703
My parents killed by enemy.

413
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,041
Me and my sister run away.

- And she cried.

415
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,961

00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,505
cover her mouth.

417
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,641
She die.

General Huo save my life.

419
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,738
He said, "War destroy family.

420
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,033
"Only peace can save Silk Road."

421

426
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,227
- We will meet him.
- Black Eagles: Yes, General!

00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,605
- Lucius, no.
- Huo An.

If you stand with us,
you will be butchered.

429
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,988
The city we built is a dream.

430
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,739
It only lasts 15 days.

431
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,161
I cannot be further in your debt.

432
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:33,206
Think, if Tiberius want to catch you,

433
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,459
why he need 100,000 men?

434
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,378
He can take over the entire Silk Road,
even China.

435
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:42,174
I think Tiberius working with the Chief.

436
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,342
It's our duty to protect Silk Road.

437
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,137
I can borrow a soldier
from my friend Yin Po.

438
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,055
Hopefully, we can stop them.

Go! Please go!

522

523
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,472
(groaning)

524
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,977
Welcome home.

525
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,647
So nice to have you
hanging around again.

526
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,364
Everyone in Rome,

527
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,241
including my father,

528
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,287
thought you were the finest warrior
in the Empire.

529
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,998
(chuckles)

530
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,416
No, no.

531
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,628
I think of you more as a chess piece.

532
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,172
Think about it, Lucius.

533
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,926
If I hadn't purposely let you escape...

534
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,302
Purposely.

535
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,431
Do you really think you and Publius
would get this far?

536
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,976
Who could blame me for pursuing you?

537
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,896
I mean,

538
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:27,276
thank you for the perfect excuse
to bring my troops here.

539
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:33,116
I had already plotted this
with Huo's subordinate, Yin Po.

540
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,748
Yin Po gave me
the customs clearance document

541
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,667
and the Commander's seal.

542
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,588
As soon as my army settles in
at the borders,

543
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,133
the entire Silk Road region

544
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,262
belongs to the Roman Empire.

545
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:56,973
Spare the child.

546
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,852
He's no further threat
to your ambitions.

547
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,146
Show mercy.

548
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,112
Let me tell you.

549
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:14,907
No one felt the pain

550
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,702
more than I did

551
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,913
when I had to blind my own brother.

552
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,624
I beg of you.

553
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,834
Spare him.

554
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,294
He's committed no crime.

555
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,045
Of course he's committed a crime!

556
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,758
His crime...
His crime...

557
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,305
is that he took the place in your heart
that belonged to me.

558
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,975
(Publius cries)

559
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,200
You will never

560
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,369
hurt my young master ever again!

561
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,788
Falco will take you home.

562
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,665
(Publius continues crying)

563
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,042
Don't be afraid.

564
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,168
It's all right.

565
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,614
With my brother dead,

566
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,078
there really is no more cause
for conflict between you and I.

567
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,009
I will tell you a secret.

568
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,094
Lately...

569
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,766
When I look at my reflection...

570
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,271
I see you.

571
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,814

Huo An,

597
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,230
this was never our business to start
with. Why should we get involved?

598
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,441
Captain Huo!
We are not as heroic as you are.

599
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,402
How do you expect us
to protect this place

600
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,028
when we can't even protect ourselves?

601
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,572
The Romans are right.
We all have families.

602
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,741
This way we can just take the gold
and go home.

603
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,745
Huo An, if you don't give yourself up,
we'll all die because of you.

604
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,205
We've been slaves all our lives.

605
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,792
This time we should have the right
to make our own decision.

607

Give yourself up!

608

Huo An,
are these people

609
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,071
worth it?

610
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,948
We should leave.

611

They need me now more than ever.

612
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,793
General Huo once said,

613
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,588
"A person who only laments the past
is a coward,

614
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,674
"whereas a person who can
change the future is a true hero."

615
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,677
Nonetheless, I have to admit

616
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,847
that the fate of the Silk Road can't be
changed by the Protection Squad alone.

617
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,517
Still, I'm truly thankful.

618
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,771
I thank you all

that harmony between the races
can be achieved.

622
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,243
During that precious time,
it felt as though

623
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,787
we were giving birth
to a newborn child of hope.

624
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,209
But his life

625
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,752
has been cut so short

626
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,424
that I won't have the chance
to see him grow up.

627

My brothers on the Silk Road,

628
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,941
I have already given my all.

Please raise the flags

stands here before you.

846
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,073
This is an outrage!

847
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,909
A conspiracy!

848
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,916
Consul Crassus and I
signed this peace treaty

849
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,835
so as to guarantee
the safety of your brother.

850
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:24,340
Because your father knew
of your evil plan.

851
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:30,012
So let me ask you
on behalf of your father and brother,

852
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,514
what was on your mind

853
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,934
when you ended their lives?

854
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:53,119
Man:
It's never too late to turn back.

855
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:56,872
Give me your sword.

856
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:14,724
(groans)

857
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:15,891
What?

858
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:23,482
A real hero remains accountable
until the end.

859
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:32,950
Right.

860
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:35,786
I did it.

861
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,124
Let's resolve this.

862
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,195
If I made a mistake
in this game of chess,

863
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,906
it'd be that I looked down upon you.

864
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:14,784
No.

865
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,536
You looked down on human.

866
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,249
Why are you so eager to end your story?

867
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,252
Not for me. For my friend.

868
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,172
Lucius.

869
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,926
(chuckles)

870
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,011
What a good friend you are!

871
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:38,265
But this is a Roman matter!

872
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,768
You have no right
to challenge me to a duel.

873
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:45,564
Master Publius made Huo An
as a Roman warrior!

874
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:48,400
General Lucius placed us
under his command!

875
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,319
Soldier:
He's one of us now!

876
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,363
(all shouting)

877
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:58,702

You and I.

879
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:03,666
Well, then,

880
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,919
we shall give you a proper burial.

881
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,425
(both grunting and groaning)

882
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:42,246

You're wearing
the headband of a dead man.

892
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:37,903
I'd say that's a bad omen.
