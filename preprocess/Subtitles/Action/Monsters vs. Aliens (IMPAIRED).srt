1
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,500
Hey, Jerry.

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,800
You might want to check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

3
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,300
Look like some type of UFO
and it's heading this way.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,900
How many times do i
have to tell you this.

5
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
UFOs don't exist and we
are never gonna see...

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,200
Wow. It's energy
signature is massive.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Holy Jesus, what do we do?
No one ever told us what to do.

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
The only reason I took this job is
cause you don't have to do anything.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Jerry, Stop it! We
calculate its impact point.

10
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,900
Looks like.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
Modesto, California.

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,900
Supenova: this is Red
Dwarf. We actually have one.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,900
Code Nimoy.
I repeat Code Nimoy.

14
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,200
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

15
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,600
Hurry, turn on the TV.
Turn it on now.

16
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,300
...and some early morning
fog giving way to sunny skies.

17
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
75' F.

18
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,400
A perfect day to stop by the old folk
garden craft show down at the fair grounds,

19
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,800
or a perfect day to
marry Susan Murphy.

20
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
I love you baby.

21
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,700
I love you too.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,500
And good morning Modesto...

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>Channel 172</i>

24
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,800
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Thanks, mom.

26
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah, my little girl.

27
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
¡Daddyi!

28
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,900
Now i want you to know that even
though i'm about to give you away...

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,100
I'll always be here
to take care of you.

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Don't cry cause then you're gonna
make me cry and this leaves me a mess.

31
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,500
I can't help me oh.
I can't.

32
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,800
Hello, everyone. Attention attention.
Wedding starts in 30 minutes.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,800
My beautiful daughter in law.

34
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,700
- Hi, mama Dietl.
- It's like a fairy tale.

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,900
The weatherman and
the weatherman's wife.

36
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,900
- Oh, romantic.
- Ah, I know.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Just think... This time
tomorrow I'm gonna be in Paris,

38
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,500
and some day, we won't just be honeymo-
oning there. Derek will become an anchor,

39
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,100
or a foreign correspondant and
we'll travel all over the world.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,100
Oh, honey, my
fingers are crossed.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,300
One thumb is shorter than the
other. It runs in the family.

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
- Derek doesn't have that.
- It skips a generation.

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Your kids are gonna have it.

44
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,400
Wow. You look beautiful!

45
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,400
So do you... I mean,
handsome. I mean...

46
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Sorry, I'm just
a little frazzled.

47
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,600
I just spent way too
much time with our parents.

48
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,900
Don't worry, ok?

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
We'll be alone soon.
Just us.

50
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Hmmm... eating cheese
and baguettes at the Sun.

51
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Feeding each other
chocolate crepes.

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,100
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just that...

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,500
There's been a
slight change of plans.

54
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
We are not going to Paris.

55
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,100
What?

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Why not?

57
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,100
Because we are going
somewhere better.

58
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,500
Better than Paris?

59
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
- Oh, yeah.
- Where?

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,700
- Tahiti?
- Nope!

61
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Fresno.

62
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Fresno!

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,100
Fresno?

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,500
In what universe is... Fresno,
better than Paris, Derek?

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
In the...

66
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,500
I got an audition to become channel
23's new evening anchor universe.

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,300
I got the call from
the general manager.

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,900
He wants me to come
inmediately. Isn't that great?

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Derek.

70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,600
That's...

71
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,500
amazing!

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,400
It's amazing. Fresno is like
the top 50 markets, isn't it?

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Actually it's 55th. But
we are on our way, babe.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
Now look about Paris...

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,700
Oh, it's ok... It's fine.
As long as we are together,

76
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Fresno is the most romantic
city in the whole world.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm so proud of you.

78
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Of us...
Not just of me.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,700
I mean, of course, but we are a
team now. You are so proud of us.

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,900
Now get out of here. It's bad
luck to see me in my dress.

81
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh, come on! You know I
don't believe in that stuff.

82
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
I'll be waiting
for you at the altar.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
The handsome news ancho
in the tux, alright?

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,900
<i>I love you.
There, I said it.</i>

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,300
I love you too.

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Susan!

87
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Where could she be?

88
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,200
Susan!

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Where are you?

90
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Susan. Where've you been?

91
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,400
I think I just go
hit by a meteroid.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Oh, Susan... Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

93
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
My goodness, look at
you. You're all filthy.

94
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Thank God I have wet wipes.

95
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,700
You are... glowing.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Thank you.

97
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,200
No, no Susan, you're like,
really glowing. You're green.

98
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
Oh, no!

99
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,000
Derek.

100
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
No.

101
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,100
What's going on?
What's happening here?

102
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,000
You are all shrinking!

103
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
- Na-ha, you are growing.
- Well, make it stop.

104
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Get me the goverment!

105
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
This is impossible.

106
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
No. This can't be happening.

107
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Wait, wait, everybody.
It's OK.

108
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Have some champagne while
we're figuring this out.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,700
Thumbs! Thumbs!

110
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,000
Derek help me!

111
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Here comes the bride.

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, Carl. It's
her wedding day.

113
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,900
Derek!
Derek!

114
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Hurts. Damm it.

115
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
<i>Hold your fire</i>

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
What's been happening to me?

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Don't panic, don't worry.
Whatever you don, don't drop...

118
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
Derek!

119
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,600
<i>Sorry sir</i>

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Who are you people?

121
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
What are you doing?

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,700
Stop it.

123
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Be careful!

124
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Get your hands off me.
Don't you know who I am?

125
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,000
Please. Just leave me alone!

126
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,700
Move it, move it!
Let's go, move it!

127
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Derek!

128
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,000
<i>Let's get this
baby on the bus.</i>

129
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Honey, can you hit the snooze?

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,300
Baby why you set the alarm?

131
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
We are on honeymoon.

132
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,100
Hello?

133
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,300
What's going on?

134
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,900
Hello?

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,100
Quiet. She can hear us.

136
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,300
Hello?

137
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,800
Is there someone in there?

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,100
Could you please
tell me where I am?

139
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,600
What was that?

140
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,900
Hello.

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Eeeewwww!

142
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,900
Would you stop.

143
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,300
Be careful.

144
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Please.
Madam stop...

145
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,400
doing...

146
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,900
that...

147
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,500
Whatever mad
scientist made you,

148
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,800
he really went all out.

149
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,300
You can... talk.

150
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Hi there!

151
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
Argg, my back!

152
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Just kidding.
I don't have a back.

153
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Forgive him, but as you
can see he has no brain.

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
Turns out you don't need one.

155
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Totally overated.
As a matter of fact...

156
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,500
I don't even...

157
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100
I forgot how to breath.
I forgot how to breath.

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Help me Dr Cockroach. Help!

159
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
Suck in Bob.

160
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Thanks Doc.
You are a lifesaver.

161
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,500
Wow, look at you. I know
what you are thinking.

162
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,800
First day in prison, you wanna take
out the toughest guy in the yard.

163
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,700
Well, I'd like
to see you try...

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Gosh. What?!
She is speechless.

165
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
She?

166
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,100
Yes Bob. We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

167
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,000
No way.
It's a boy.

168
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
Look at his boobies.

169
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,700
- We need to have a talk.
- Gentlemen,

170
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm afraid we are not making
a very good first impression.

171
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,700
At least I'm talking. First new monster
in years we are gonna get like a wolfman,

172
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,100
or mummy, just, you know
somebody to play cards with.

173
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,600
Might we ask
your name, Madam?

174
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,800
Susan.

175
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,200
No, no, no. We mean
like your monster name.

176
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Like what do people scream
when they see you coming?

177
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,100
You know... like:
" Look out. Here comes... "

178
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Susan.

179
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Really?

180
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Suuuusan.

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
I just scared myself.
That is scary.

182
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes! Eat time.

183
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,100
That is repulsive.

184
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Oh, I love slipper!

185
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,300
Oh please God, please
tell me this isn't real.

186
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Please tell me I just had a
nervous breakdown at the wedding,

187
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,400
and now I'm at a mental
hospital and I'm on medication,

188
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,700
and it's giving
me hallucinations.

189
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,900
Don't scare InsectoSaur. He is gonna
pee himself and then we all be in trouble.

190
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,300
Everyone run at the door? There's got
to be a door here. Where is the door?

191
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,800
It's ok, buddy.
Don't worry about it.

192
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Who is a handsome bug?
You like it when I rub your tummy?

193
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Please, somebody.
I don't belong here. Let me out.

194
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Hey, hey. That
is not a good idea.

195
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Let me out!

196
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,200
Monsters. Get
back in your cells.

197
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Oh, thank goodness.
A real person.

198
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,100
You are a real person, right?

199
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Not one of those half-person
half-machine... you know?

200
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
Whatever you
call those things?

201
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,200
- A Cyborg?
- Oh, no!

202
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,500
You are a cyborg?

203
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,300
Madam, I assure you,
I am not a cyborg.

204
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
My name is General
W.R.Monguer.

205
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,100
I'm in charge of this facility. Now
follow me. It's time for your orientation.

206
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
In 1950 it was decided
that Jane and Joe

207
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,400
public can not handle
the truth about monsters,

208
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,900
and should focus in more
important things like paying taxes.

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,900
So the goverment convinced the world
Monsters were stuff of myth and legend,

210
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,000
and the locked them away
in this here facility.

211
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,100
But I'm not a monster.

212
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm just a regular person.

213
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm not a danger to
anyone or anything.

214
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Don't let her get me!

215
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,600
Sorry.

216
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
- How long will I be here?
- Indefinitely.

217
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,500
- Can I contact my parents?
- No.

218
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,500
- Derek?
- Negative

219
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,700
- Do they know where I am?
- No, and they never will.

220
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,700
This place is X file.

221
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,500
Wrapped in a cover-up and
deepfried in a paranoid conspiracy.

222
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,700
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

223
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,200
7, 8...

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,400
899, 1000...

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
I did ten sets.

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Ah, Susan.

227
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,600
You wouldn't happen to
have any uranium on you?

228
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Just need a smidge.

229
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Rescend Dr. Cockrach toybox
privileges inmediately,

230
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,900
We just had the prison's
phycologist redecorate your cell.

231
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
Try to keep you all calm.

232
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,200
But I don't want a poster.

233
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
I want a real kitty,
hanging from a real tree.

234
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,600
I wanna go home.

235
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, come on, please don't cry.
Makes my knees hurt.

236
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Don't think of
this as a prison.

237
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,200
Think of it as hotel you'll never leave
because it's locked from the otherside.

238
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Oh, and one other thing.

239
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,700
The goverment has changed
your name to Ginormica.

240
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,300
<i>Begin re-animation sequence.</i>

241
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Who dares to wake me?

242
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,100
<i>Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the omega quadrant.</i>

243
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
The Omega quadrant?

244
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
Lame.

245
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,600
<i>The trajectory of the Quantonium
meteor has been traced to sector 72-4.</i>

246
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,900
<i>A planet locally
known as Earth.</i>

247
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,100
What a miserable
looking mudball.

248
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Send a robot probe.

249
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme predujice.

250
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,200
I want it all!

251
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Every last drop.

252
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>Yes, Gallahxar.</i>

253
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Nothing can stand
in my way now.

254
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't rush me, Katie.
I'm just... not ready.

255
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, relax, Cuthbert.
it's just like dancing.

256
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Al Lee.

257
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Katie,

258
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,300
I have a gymnastic's meet
tomorrow, so maybe I...

259
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,500
Did you open the haf?

260
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
Thank goodness.
It's the police.

261
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,000
We weren't doing
anything officer.

262
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah. Nothing at all.

263
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Why did I even let
you talk me into this.

264
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,200
Maybe we should
get out of here.

265
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,500
Or maybe we should
go check it out.

266
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Katie are you nuts?

267
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Wait. Don't
leave me alone.

268
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,900
My ankle.

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
I think it's broken.

270
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Katie.

271
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,100
This is the worst date ever.

272
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Katie I'm freaking.

273
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,500
It was first spotted
at midnight last night,

274
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,100
by a couple in
romantic embrace.

275
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,500
No one knows what it
is or where it came from.

276
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,100
All branches of the military
were inmediately move on.

277
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,300
- What is that?
- OK

278
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,500
I have just received word that
the president of the US has arrived,

279
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
and will attempt to
make first contact.

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I must approach it alone.

281
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
This is all about
peaceful communication.

282
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes, Sir Mr. President.

283
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,800
Perimeter stable. Got a
vis on Papa Bear, all clear.

284
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,500
Commander.
Do something violent.

285
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,400
You heard the president.
Light them up.

286
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,200
Problem down here. Call in air
support. Call in air support.

287
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,600
Call in... hmmm.
Call in a full retreat.

288
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Full retreat, full
retreat. All troops.

289
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,500
Papa Bear is on the move.

290
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,500
No, wait

291
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,900
So that's how
you wanna play it?

292
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Eat lead alien.

293
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
- Evidently they eat lead.
- Get him on the chopper.

294
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm brave. I'm a
brave president.

295
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
...own approved goverment.

296
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,400
This right here has only
have about two weeks left.

297
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,200
If that think walks into a populated
area there will be a major catastrophe.

298
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,400
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone.

299
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
If we transport the
US to a safer planet...

300
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,000
I say we give this alien a green card
and make him proud to be an American.

301
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,700
Sir thy times like this when I stop
and ask myself: What would Oprah do?

302
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,500
Hang it all.
What's the point?

303
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,700
It's a disaster.

304
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,600
- Stop sir.
- Don't do it Stop, no!

305
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
That button lauches all
of our nuclear missiles.

306
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Well then, which
button gets me a latte?

307
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,400
Ahh... That would
be the other one, Sir.

308
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,500
What idiot
designed this thing?

309
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,400
<i>You did, Sir.</i>

310
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,900
Fair enough.
Wilson, fire somebody.

311
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,400
Listen up!

312
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not going to go down in history
as the president who was in his office

313
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,300
when the world came to an end. So somebody
think of something and think of it fast.

314
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,100
That's a good Capu-ccio.

315
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,600
<i>Mr. President.</i>

316
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,800
Not only do I have an
idea but I have a plan

317
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
Now conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

318
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,500
and we all know
nukes ain't an option.

319
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,600
- Sure they are. Press..
- No, no, no the button, wait!

320
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President.
These are dark times.

321
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,500
The odds are against us.

322
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
We need a Hail Mary pass.
We need raw power. We need...

323
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,200
<b>Monsters.</b>

324
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Monsters!
Of course...

325
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
It's so simple.

326
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,700
I... I'm not following you.

327
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,300
Over the last 50 years I
have captured monsters on the

328
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,300
rampage and locked them up
in a secret prison facility.

329
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,300
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

330
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,900
Is he referring
to area fifty...

331
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,800
Mr. President, say
hello to Insecta-Saur.

332
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,400
Miss Ronson please.

333
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,700
Nuclear radiation, turned
him from a small grub,

334
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,500
into a 350 foot tall monster,
that attacked Tokyo.

335
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,400
Here we have " The Missing Link ".

336
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,200
A 20.000 years
old frozen fishman,

337
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,700
who was spot out
by scientists.

338
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,900
He escaped... Went on a rampage
in his old watering hall.

339
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,400
This handsome fellow
is Dr. Cockroach Ph. D.

340
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,800
The most brilliant
man in the world.

341
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,600
He invented a scientific
machine that would give humans,

342
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,800
the cockroache's
ability to survive.

343
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,600
Unfortunately there
was a side effect.

344
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,000
Now, we call this thing BOB.

345
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Could someone get
her out of here?

346
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,200
Thank you.

347
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,600
A genetically altered tomato
was combined with a chemically,

348
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,500
altered ranch-flavor dessert
topping at a snack food plant.

349
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,700
The resulting goo gained consciousness and
became an indistructible gelatinous mass.

350
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,200
And our latest
addition, Ginormica.

351
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,900
General, continue.

352
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Her entire body radiates with pure energy
giving her enormous strength and size.

353
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Sir, these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot.

354
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Don't we already have
an Alien problem, General.

355
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,200
I don't think we need
a monster problem too.

356
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,300
You got a better idea nerd?

357
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,300
Ok. Stay where you are.

358
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,400
General, I propose we go forward with
your monsters vs aliens idea. Thank you.

359
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
<i>Go fish.</i>

360
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Do... you... have... any...

361
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
three's?

362
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Yes, I do. How are you doing this?
You are the luckiest guy I know.

363
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,300
Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

364
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
What the...?
Hey.

365
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,200
They called me crazy,

366
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,100
but I'll show them.
I'll show them all.

367
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,300
Dr, I'd prefer you didn't
do your mad scientist,

368
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
laugh while I'm hooked
up to this machine.

369
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,700
You're right Insecto.

370
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,100
You've been letting that crack
experiment on you for over a month.

371
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm not a crack.
I'm a mad scientist.

372
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,600
There's a difference.

373
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,000
Guys. What choice do I have?

374
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,900
If he can make me normal or
even 6'8", I can get out of here.

375
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,000
Get back to the life,
I'm supposed to have.

376
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,400
- I mean, I should be...
- Let me guess: Fresno?

377
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,900
Well, Fresno is
just a steppin stone.

378
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,000
Next stop: Milwaukee, and then
New York and then someday hopefully...

379
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Yeah, we know: Paris.

380
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Throw the switch, Dr.
But don't do the laugh.

381
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,300
Now, you'll feel a
slight pinch in the brain.

382
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Sorry.

383
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Susan!
Yuuhuu!

384
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Am I small again?

385
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm afraid not my dear.

386
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,200
In fact,

387
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,100
You may actually have
grown a couple of feet.

388
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,600
It's ok, Doc. We'll
try again tomorrow.

389
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
You really don't
get it. Do you?

390
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,600
No monster has ever
gotten out of here.

391
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,500
That's not true.
The invisible man did.

392
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,200
No he didn't. We just told you
that so you wouldn't get upset.

393
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,300
He died of a heart
attack 25 years ago.

394
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,800
Nooo!

395
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,100
Yeah.

396
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,600
In that very chair.

397
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,700
He still there?

398
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
You see what I'm saying? Nobody is
leaving, nobody is ever getting out.

399
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>Good news, monsters.
You are getting out.</i>

400
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,000
Until today.

401
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,500
So let me get this
straigh Monguer.

402
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,200
You want us to
fight an alien robot,

403
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,800
And in exchange, the president of the US
has authorized me to grant you your freedom.

404
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Ah! I can't believe it!

405
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Soon I'll be back in
Derek's arms or him in mine.

406
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,900
I can't wait for Spring Break
back at Cocoa Beach just...

407
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,100
freaking everybody out.

408
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,600
And I'll go back to my lab and
finally finish my experiments.

409
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,700
No, no.
That's me, Bob.

410
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Then I'll be a...
really giant lady.

411
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,200
That's Susan, Bob.

412
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Fine, then I'll go back to
Modesto and be with Derek.

413
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
Yeay... that is
still Susan, Bob.

414
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,000
I think I at least deserve
a chance to be with Derek.

415
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
All right. Let's go.

416
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Everybody move in an orderly
fashion. This is an emergency.

417
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,400
We are evacuating the city. Exact
change is appreciated, but not necessary.

418
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Let's move out!

419
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
This is San Francisco!
This ins't far from my home.

420
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,900
Feel the wind on your
antennas. Isn't this wonderful?

421
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,100
I haven't been outside in 50
years. It's amazing out here.

422
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,200
It's a little hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

423
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
That'd be great to know that,
it'd be a very convinient truth.

424
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Now, that'a a robot!

425
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,300
It's huge.

426
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,500
Try not to damage it too much, Monsters.
I may want to bring it back to the farm.

427
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,000
No, no, wait. You didn't say
anything about it being huge.

428
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Wait.
No, don't leave.

429
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,200
I think he sees us.

430
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,500
Hello, hey!
How are you doing?

431
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,200
Welcome. We are
here to destroy you.

432
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
I can't fight that
thing. I can't even...

433
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I... I'm hyperventilating.

434
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Does anybody have
a giant paper bag?

435
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
Relax.

436
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Old Link got this
under control.

437
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,500
Hide in the city Susan,
you'll be safe there.

438
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,600
But stay away from the
Tenderloin. Gets a little daze.

439
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,600
Finally, some action. I'm gonna
turn that oversized tin can into a...

440
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,000
...really dented oversize tin can.

441
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,500
OK. Does anybody have
a 20 on Insect-a-Saur's?

442
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,000
Wow, would you look
at the size of that?

443
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,400
I got it, you guys I got...

444
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,700
Don't worry, I won't let go.
I'm wearing it down...

445
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
He's slowing down.

446
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Get to the city, Link. I'll catch
up with you as soon as I can.

447
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Or maybe... You'll
have to catch up with me.

448
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,200
No! No!

449
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,100
OK, ok I got this.

450
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
Yeap. That hurt.

451
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,100
Get in.
I have a plan.

452
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,800
Hot dogs!

453
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,600
All right, Link. I'm going to
pull up alongside it. You get

454
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,200
up in there, get into its
central processing unit and...

455
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Hey, guys.
Catch me!

456
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,300
Let's go, let's
go, keep it moving.

457
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Hey, no honking.

458
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,600
Excuse me, moving out.

459
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
on your right...
no control.

460
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,200
Oh, no.

461
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,600
OK. It's gonna be OK.

462
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,000
Look, I'm gonna get you out
of there. Hold on a second.

463
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,600
You have to get off
the bridge before...

464
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
Help!

465
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
No, no, no!

466
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,600
Get away from me!

467
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,200
Coming through.
Watch it.

468
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,200
Hey, furrball.
Where've you been?

469
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah, I know. Papa is
a little out of shape.

470
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Excuse me, he is trying to kill me.
Why is he doing that, why...?

471
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,500
Wow.

472
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,000
Wow!
You are doing great!

473
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
I'm doing everything!

474
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down.

475
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,300
A deflector shield.
Typical.

476
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,000
You can't crush a cockroach.

477
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Right, right, right.
Here we go.

478
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,900
Insect-a-Saurus.

479
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,900
Insect-a-Saurus.

480
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,000
- BOB!
- What?

481
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Help me!

482
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,500
Sorry, I was just staring
at this bird over there.

483
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,800
We have to get these
people off the bridge.

484
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,500
Got it.

485
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,400
No, Bob.
Move the conveyors.

486
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, yes, you're right.
My bad

487
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,800
Go, go go, go.

488
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,800
Link!

489
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh, I don't feel good.

490
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,700
Ok. Susan, you can do this.

491
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,300
All right. Let's
take this thing down.

492
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,500
Retreival has failed.

493
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,500
Don't get upset.
It happens to everyone.

494
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:03,000
That lower life form. Thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?

495
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,700
Send another probe at once!

496
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,100
Quantonium can not
be retrieved via robot.

497
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,100
Carbon-based life form, locally
known as Susan is now too strong.

498
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,100
Oh, you think because you
are all big and strong...

499
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,500
...and you can destroy my robot probe that
you're gonna send me running and hiding?

500
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,900
My days of running
and hiding are over.

501
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Computer, set the course to Earth.
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself.

502
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,900
Even if I need to rip it out
of her body one cell at a time.

503
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,400
Be careful.
It's hot.

504
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,600
3 weeks ago, if you
would've asked me to defeat

505
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,400
a giant alien robot, I
would've said: No, can't do.

506
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,600
But I did it! Me! I'm so buzzing.
I mean, did you see how strong I was?

507
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,200
There probably isn't a jar
in this world I can't open.

508
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
You were possitively
heroic my Dear.

509
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,500
I specially loved how you saved
all those people on the bridge.

510
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,700
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

511
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

512
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Poor Link. After all that tough
talk you were out a monster by a girl.

513
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,700
No wonder why
you are drepressed.

514
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,500
Hey, I'm not
depressed. I'm tired.

515
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Why are you tired?
You didn't do anything.

516
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,600
Well, I haven't been sleeping
well, alright? I get sleepne-apness.

517
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,700
Apne... apnea...
Whatever. It's not fun.

518
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,400
So Link is a little rusty.
I mean, sleep deprived.

519
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,600
You'll be back to your old
self in no time. And so will I.

520
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,800
What happened to the "There isn't a
jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

521
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,600
Wait. Did you find a jar you
can't open? What was in it?

522
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,100
Was it pickles in it? Where's
the gigant jar of pickles?

523
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,800
What my associate is
trying to say is that

524
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:06,300
we all think the new
Susan is the cat's me-wow.

525
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,300
I'm sorry.

526
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,600
Thanks you guys.
That is so sweet.

527
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,000
But I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

528
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,700
So tell me exactly how this normal life
thing works with you being giant and all.

529
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm not gonna be
a giant forever.

530
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Derek won't rest, until
we find a cure for my...

531
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,900
...condition.
We're a team.

532
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,000
We can all do with a Derek. Perhaps
some day we can make his acquaintance.

533
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,700
Really?

534
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
You guys want meet Derek?

535
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
First stop: Modesto.

536
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,200
Ginormica. I called your family
to let them know you coming home.

537
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,100
Now I also called the Modesto
PD, told them not to shoot at you.

538
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,300
Thanks, General.

539
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Ok, remember. These people aren't
used to seeing anything like...

540
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,400
You, or you... or you...

541
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:27,200
So just be... you know, cool.
Just be, you know? Follow my lead.

542
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:39,000
Stop. That was an accident!
Don't destroy anything.

543
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,100
Susan?

544
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,400
Susie?

545
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,200
Mom? Daddy?

546
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,900
Did they experiment on you?

547
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
No, mom.
I'm fine.

548
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,600
It's ok.
They are with me.

549
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,300
These are my new friends.

550
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,100
Oh, Derek.
I missed you so much.

551
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,900
Think of that. We'd
be together again.

552
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,900
Just let hope i will not go again
to prison. I love you. I love this man.

553
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
No, BOB.
That's my mother.

554
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,700
You're sofocating her!

555
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,200
Honey.
Are you allright?

556
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,700
I taste ham.

557
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,600
Sorry, mom.
He is just a hugger.

558
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,500
Where's Derek?

559
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,900
He is at work, swetie.

560
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,100
You know, how he
is about his career.

561
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,600
Well, we are not gonna
celebrate without him.

562
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Susan. What do I do with
all your little friends?

563
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,300
Just put out some snacks.
They'll eat anything.

564
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,100
Oh, ambrosia!

565
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,800
How is it going?

566
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,900
Impressive girlfriend.

567
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,700
Way to cut up XXX Insecto.

568
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,900
Who wants to go for
a swimm with The Link?

569
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,200
Hi, I'm Benzoate
Ostylezene Bicarbonate.

570
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,100
Or you can call me BOB.
Whichever is easier.

571
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Do I come on too strong?
I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty.

572
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,800
I've been in prison my whole life.
Why I mentioned prison?

573
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,400
Oh, I didn't mean to
scare you. I'm just gonna go.

574
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,400
Ah, I feel so stupid.

575
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Everyone just stay calm. Whatever
you do, do not provoke them.

576
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,200
Anyone cares for atomic gin fizz?
It's got quite a...

577
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,600
Kick.

578
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,200
Clorine, clorine.
Clorine in my eyes.

579
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,200
Everyone, run for your lives!

580
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,800
What are they
running away from?

581
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,200
...that's hilarious, Jim.

582
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,800
That's exactly the kind down home country
humor I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

583
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,000
This is Derek Dietl. Signing
off for the very last time.

584
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Good night... Modesto!

585
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,300
<i>Channel 172</i>

586
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
<i>And... Cut!</i>

587
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,300
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

588
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,100
Oh, my goodness!

589
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,300
Wait, wait, wa... it!

590
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,900
Oh, Derek!

591
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,600
You wouldn't believe my last 3
weeks. Just wouldn't believe it.

592
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,400
Thinking about you was the
only thing that kept me sane.

593
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,300
Can't breath!

594
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,800
Oh, my gosh.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry

595
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,300
Oh my god.
Is that better?

596
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
OK. OK.

597
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm just still can of getting
used to my new strength.

598
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,600
Wow, you really are big.

599
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still
the same girl you fell in love with.

600
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,200
Except you... Did just destroyed
the Golden Gate bridge.

601
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,100
Well, that was the only way I
was gonna stop that giant robot.

602
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,500
Did you ever think I could
do something like that?

603
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,800
No, I didn't.

604
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,500
I can honestly say that it never ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever ever occurred to me.

605
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
I know this is
a little weird...

606
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,700
Ok, it's a lot weird.
But we'll figure it out.

607
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,600
I know that together we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

608
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,300
Susan, try to look at
this from my perspective.

609
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,800
I have an audience that
depends on me for news,

610
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,000
weather, sports and
heartwarming fluff pieces.

611
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,500
So you expect me to put
all that on hold while

612
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,900
you try to undo this
thing that happened to you?

613
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,500
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

614
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,700
Yes.

615
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,500
That's exactly what I expect.

616
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,500
What about the life that we always
talked about? Don't you still want that?

617
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,500
Of course.
I just...

618
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,100
Don't see how I can
have that with your.

619
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,200
Derek please...

620
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Don't do this.

621
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,400
You have to face facts Susan.

622
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,700
And don't crush me for saying
this, but I'm not looking to get

623
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,300
married and spend the rest of
my life in someone else's shadow.

624
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,500
And you're casting
a pretty big shadow.

625
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm sorry.

626
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,100
It's over.

627
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,800
Good luck Susan.

628
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,800
<i>Leaving Modesto
Come Again</i>

629
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,000
Wow, what a shindig!

630
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,400
Your parents really
know how to throw it down.

631
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,300
That was a... great party. One of the best
I've been to, since I got out of prison.

632
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,100
I must have been at
a different party,

633
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,800
cause that's not how I
interpreted it at all.

634
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,500
I don't think your
parents liked me,

635
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,300
and I think that Jello
gave me a fake phone number.

636
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, at least the
garbage was free and...

637
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,400
Who are we kidding?

638
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,400
We could save every city
on the planet and they'd

639
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,500
still treat us the same way
they've always treated us.

640
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,300
Like monsters.

641
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,600
Right, monsters.

642
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Anyway.
How... How is Derek?

643
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,000
Derek... is a selfish jerk.

644
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,900
- No!
- Yes!

645
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,400
All that talk about "us",

646
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,000
I'm so proud of "us".
"Us just got a job in Fresno.

647
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,000
It was no "us".
It was only Derek.

648
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,100
Why did I have to get hit
by a meteor to see that?

649
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,700
Idiot!

650
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,100
Why did I ever think life with
Derek would be so great anyway.

651
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,900
I mean, look at all the
stuff I've done without him.

652
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,200
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

653
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,100
And that was amazing.

654
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,600
Meeting you guys.
Amazing.

655
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,800
Dr. Cockroach. You can
crawl up walls and...

656
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,800
build a supercomputer out of a pizza box,
two cans of hair spray and..

657
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,300
And a paper clip.

658
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,300
Amazing!

659
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,400
And you, you hardly need an
introduction. You are the Missing Link!

660
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
You personally carried 250
coeds off Cocoa Beach and

661
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
still have the strength
to fight the national guard.

662
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,900
And the Coast Guard,
and also the Life Guard.

663
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,800
Amazing.

664
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,300
Bob, who else could fall from unimaginable
heights and end up without a single scratch?

665
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Link?

666
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,400
You!

667
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,800
Amazing!

668
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,400
Point Insecto. Susan,
don't shortchange yourself.

669
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, I'm not gonna shortchange
myself... ever again.

670
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,600
Susan!

671
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,000
Way to go Insecto!

672
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,600
Insecto look out!

673
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,800
Insect-a-Saurus.
Nooo!

674
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,800
It's gonna be alright.
Look at me.

675
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,400
Don't you close those eyes.

676
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,700
Don't you dare
close those eyes.

677
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,900
You can't...

678
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,200
Mom?

679
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,300
You must be terrified.

680
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,900
You wake up in a strange
place, wearing strange clothes.

681
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:28,200
Imprisioned by a strange being,
floating on a strange hovering device.

682
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,400
Strange. Isn't it?

683
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,400
Hardly,

684
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
it's not the first time.

685
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,000
Wow. You really get around.

686
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,100
To the extraction chamber.

687
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Look, what is that
you want from me?

688
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,300
You have stolen what
is rightfully mine.

689
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,300
I didn't steal
anything from you.

690
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,300
Your enormous grotesque
body, contains Quantonium.

691
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,300
The most powerful
substance in the universe.

692
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,200
Did you really think you
could keep it from me?

693
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,400
That's, what this is
all about? You destroyed

694
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,500
San Francisco. You terrified
millions of people...

695
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,700
You killed my friend,
just to get to me?

696
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,900
Silence.

697
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,700
Your voice is
grinding on my ear nobs.

698
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,600
It's a shame you won't be around to
see what the power of Quantonium can do,

699
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,800
in the tentacles of someone
who knows how to use it.

700
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,500
I know how to use it.
Just...

701
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Don't bother. That force
field is impenetrable...

702
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,000
What the flagnog!

703
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,700
Ha! That should
stop your puny...

704
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,000
Computer. Close door hangar 2.

705
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Close door hangar 3.

706
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,400
Close the 4.

707
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,100
Close them all!

708
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,800
Computer.
Begin extraction.

709
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:38,000
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

710
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,700
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

711
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,300
Your planet, perhaps?

712
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,200
You keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet.

713
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,900
If you wanted to stop me, you should've
done it when you possessed the Quantonium.

714
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,500
Now you are nothing.

715
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,300
There innocent people down
there, who didn't do anything.

716
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,600
There were innocent people on my
home planet, before it was destroyed.

717
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,300
Look, I'm sorry your
planet was destroyed.

718
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,800
Oh, don't be. I'm the
one who destroyed it.

719
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,900
Confused?

720
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:16,100
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

721
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,700
Computer... initialize
cloning machine.

722
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,800
<i>Yes Gallahxar</i>

723
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,300
Many zentons ago,
when I was but a squid

724
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,600
I found out my parents were...

725
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,400
No child should ever
have to endure that.

726
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,300
So I went on the
road, with a giant...

727
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,500
And soon thereafter
was married.

728
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,900
Things were going well,
until she wanted to...

729
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,500
and then I was all: "no way" and she
was all: "yes way" and I was like...

730
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,000
But I've told you
too much already.

731
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,300
Let the birth of my
new planet now called,

732
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,800
<b>Gallahxar's Planet begin!</b>

733
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,800
<i>Once again, an UFO
has landed in America.</i>

734
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,200
<i>The only country UFOs
ever seem to land in.</i>

735
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:45,600
<i>Excuse me... What's
that handsome? Okey-dokey.</i>

736
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:52,700
<i>We now take you live to a transmission
from the alien's spacecraft.</i>

737
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
<i>Humans of Earth</i>

738
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,500
<i>I have come in peace.
You need not fear me.</i>

739
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,200
<i>I mean you no harm.</i>

740
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,300
<i>However, it's important to note most of
you will not survive the next 24 hours.</i>

741
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,700
<i>Though those of you who do survive,
will be in slave and experimented.</i>

742
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,200
<i>You shouldn't take any of this
personally, it's just business.</i>

743
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,400
<i>So, just to recap:</i>

744
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,100
<i>I come in peace. I mean you
no harm and you all will die.</i>

745
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,700
<i>Gallahxar's out.</i>

746
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,100
Ok. Boys, set the terror level at code
brown cause I need to change my pants.

747
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,900
What are we gonna do now Doc?

748
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,300
I don't know.

749
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,400
I'll tell you what
we are gonna do.

750
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,400
We are not gonna let
Insecto die in vain.

751
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:07,100
We are gonna get up there, find Susan
and we're gonna take that alien down.

752
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,800
Alright gentlemen. You
got enough juice in those

753
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,100
jetpacks to get up there, but
not enough to make it home.

754
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,200
I'll come get ya if I can.
If I don't, it means I'm death.

755
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,700
Or late.

756
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,100
I've been your guardian
for close to 50 years.

757
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,900
That's no longer the case.

758
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,700
For what it's worth.

759
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,100
That's rude.
What do we do?

760
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:39,400
No, Bob, that's not rude.
That's a sign of respect.

761
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,600
General, it's targeting us.

762
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,600
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

763
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,200
Steady, steady.

764
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,900
Hard right, hard right.
Hard right!

765
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,100
Can't shake it.
I can't shake it.

766
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,900
Hang on to your socks.
We are going for a ride.

767
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,700
That's why I always wear
a parachute, Lieutenant.

768
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,500
You can let go of
me now Lieutenant.

769
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:10,600
- Who are you signaling? Here.
- Hey, zip it.

770
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,900
Hail, Gallahxar.

771
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,100
No, no, not all
of you. You, there.

772
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,100
How do I do this?

773
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,100
Three back. No, no, no.
That guy, next to you.

774
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,700
The one I'm pointing at.

775
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,700
You the one...
You clon. Yes, good.

776
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,600
Take the prisoner
to the incinerator.

777
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,100
She is useless to us now.

778
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,200
- Hail, Gallahxar.

Ginormic any more.

781
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,300
How are we supposed to get to her?
There's too many of them.

782
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,900
It's impossible.

783
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,600
I may not have a brain,
gentlemen. But I have an idea.

784
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,900
This is not gonna work.

I...

787
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:49,000
Gallahxar, command you to hand
over the prisoner this instant.

788
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,800
Clearly you are
defective beyond repair.

789
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,100
Guards, take this defective
clon to the incinerator.

790
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Well, what are you
waiting for? You and you!

791
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,500
What, seriously?

792
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:09,000
Yes. Take the prisoner and the
defective clon to the incinerator.

793
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Ah, of course, Sir.

794
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,500
And here's the security pass,
just in case.

795
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,500
- Would you like a gun?
- Yes I would.

796
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,100
Hey, guys, look.

797
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,000
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

798

Don't mention it. We monsters
got to stick together.

799
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,500
But I'm not a monster
anymore. I'm just... me.

800
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:41,000
My dear, no matter what
your size, you'll always be...

801
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,700
Nothing, but a filthy

- Hail Gallahxar.

807
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,500
The only way to save the earth, is to
blow up this ship before the invasion.

808
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,400
Hail Gallaxhar.

809

Hail Gallahxar. Before
the invasion starts.

810
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,400
- So, how are we gonna do this?
- We need to find the main power core.

811
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Excuse me, could you direct
usr to the main power core?

812
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,400
Gladly, it's right there.
Above the extraction chamber.

813

Thank you very much.
Hail Gallaxhar

- Wow, look out brainless.

815

Give me that thing.

816

the hands of somebody responsable.

No, don't say that.

Yes you are. Wonder if with Monguer.
He is outside the ship, waiting for you.

01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,900
I don't want my old life back.

Well, I've always
wanted to go to Paris.

933
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,800
Now, who's with me?

934
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,100
What do you say
Butter-Fly-Sauros?

935
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
We're in.

936
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,800
- I'm in!
- Count me in, too.

937
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,600
Aurvoir, sweetie.
Have a safe flight.

938
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,700
Yeah.
And hang on.

939
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,700
Goodbye, Derek.
Good luck getting over me.

940
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,500
Ahh, Bob. It's me,
he's never gonna get over.

941
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,600
Wait, wait, wait.
You were dating Derek too?

942
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,900
That two-timing jerk!
