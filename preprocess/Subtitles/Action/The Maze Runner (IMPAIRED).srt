Second, never
harm another Glader.

unless we have trust.

never go beyond those walls.

675
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,808
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

No.

seemed to recognize you.

We'll worry

worry about it now.

You're gonna go out and dissect
that thing all by yourself?

trying to do, right?

us to abandon them totally.

thought you were still mapping it.

There's nothing left to map.

had a chance of getting out.

But maybe now...

Take a look at this.

792
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,411
About a year ago, we started
exploring these outer sections.

793
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,610
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

794
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,331
Sections 1 through 8.

795
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,766
See, the way it works,

796
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,281
is every night,
when the maze changes...

797
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,329
it opens up a new section.

798
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,926
So today, Section 6 was open.

799
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,766
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

800
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,241
The pattern
always stays the same.

801
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,483
What's so special about 7?

802
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,085
I don't know.

803
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,043
But last night, when you
killed that Griever...

804
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,683
Section 7 was open.

805
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,366

where it comes from.

when we were kids.

They would give us
these challenges.

1241

started disappearing.

other, like clockwork.

them up into the maze.

The entire time
you have been here...

1250

I was on the other side of it.

01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,805
So were you.

1252

No.

1255

1257

up if we were with them?

It doesn't matter.

01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,650
It doesn't matter.

1261
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,164
Any of it.

1262
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,325
Because the people we were before
the maze don't even exist anymore.

1263
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,562
These Creators
took care of that.

1264
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,401
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

1265
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,210
right now.

1266
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,891
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

1267
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,363
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

1268
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,250
Maybe.

1269
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,415
But I know that if he were here,

1270
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,728
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

1271
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,123
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

1272
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,566
Because if we do nothing...

1273
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,889
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.

1274
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,925
Okay.

1275
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,008
Okay, but we gotta
get through Gally first.

1276
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,003
This is such a waste.

1277

1278
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,768

JEFF: Yeah, what if
Thomas is right?

1280
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,282
Maybe he can lead us home.

1281
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,482
We are home.

1282
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,770
Okay?

1283
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,010
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

1284
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,535
You really think banishing us

1285
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,847
is gonna solve anything?

1286
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,971
No.

1287
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,122
But this isn't a banishing.

1288
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,127

1290
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,248
Gally, what are you doing?

1291
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,255
You really think
I'm gonna let Thomas

1292
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,089
back into the maze
after what he has done?

1293
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,524

This is the only way.

1296
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,928
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1297
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,648
everything goes back
to the way it was.

going to come back.

1302

They're gonna come back, and
they're gonna keep coming back...

until you're all dead!

1304
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,483
Shut up! Tie him up!

1305
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,162
Do you hear me?
I said tie him up!

01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,123
Oh, shit. Shit.

1485
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,531
Look at me, look at me!

THOMAS: Chuck,
look at me, all right?

1488
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,205
I got you, buddy.
Just hang on.

1489
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,211
It's okay.

1490
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,045
Thomas, Thomas...

1491
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,522
No, Chuck. You're gonna
give it to them yourself.

1492
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,720
Remember, I told you that.

1493
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
Take it.

1494
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,846
THOMAS: No.

1495
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,401
Thank you.

Chuck.

1501
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,084
Chuck? Hey.

1502
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,729
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1503
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,284
Come on, wake up!

1505
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,081
THOMAS: Damn it!

1506
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,963
(SOBBING) We made it.
Come on.

1507
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,684
I'm sorry!

1508
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,251
God damn it!
(DOORS OPENING)

1509
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,603
Damn it!

1510
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,285
(THOMAS CONTINUES SOBBING)

1511
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,761
Thomas.
THOMAS: Chuck!

1512
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,687
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

(HOODED MEN SHOUTING)

1514
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,921
THOMAS: Chuck!

1515
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,443
You can't just leave him there!

1516
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,520
You guys all right?

1517
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,401
Don't worry.

1518
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,925
You're safe now.

1519
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,090
Relax, kid.

1520
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,801
Everything is gonna change.

1521
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,928
I think it's safe to say the Maze
Trials were a complete success.

1522
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,967
<i>I wasn't expecting
so many survivors, but...</i>

1523
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,240
<i>the more the merrier.</i>

1524
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,406
<i>Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.</i>

1525
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,526
<i>And for now, they seem
to have taken the bait.</i>

1526
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,563
<i>It's too soon to say...</i>

1527
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,402
<i>but they could be
the key to everything.</i>

1528
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,605
<i>So let's move forward.</i>

1529
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,443
It's time now
to begin Phase Two.
