and you will owe it

518
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,461

Ohh.

00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,335
This is a rutabaga?

523
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,556
You mean it isn't ginseng?

- No.
- Silly ofme.

525
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,750
Ofcourse it isn't ginseng.
What I meant to tell you

529
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,390
It causes gas and
neutralizes the effect

530

536

the use ofrutabaga,

there must be a hundred
jade seals in our museum.

Is this one so special?

to strip us ofour culture?

Ifwe were to have a boy,
he could be Wong Tei-Pau.

Ifit's a girl, Wong Pei.

1841
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:55,432
Nice. Both names are fine.

But do we really
need to pick one now?

On behalfofthe governor,
I want to thank Fei-Hong

1980
01:39:00,798 --> 01:39:02,698
for his role in returning
the stolen antiquities

1981
01:39:02,767 --> 01:39:04,826
and on the arrest
ofthe ambassador.

1982
01:39:04,902 --> 01:39:05,834
Thankyou, sir.

1983
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:06,892
None ofthis could
have happened

1984
01:39:06,971 --> 01:39:08,370
without the support
ofhis loving father.

1985
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:10,873
Ah, well, we need more fathers

1986
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:12,910
who treat their sons like that.

1987
01:39:12,977 --> 01:39:16,344
You should be
very proud ofhim.

1988
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:17,574
So, where is he?

1989
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:20,776
Fei-Hong is still feeling
some ofthe aftereffects

1990
01:39:20,852 --> 01:39:22,513
ofall that
he's been through.

1991
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:23,986
We hope he'll soon be
on his feet.

1992
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:28,048
I'm sure that he will come
seeyou as soon as he can.

1993
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:30,093
Oh, and he better.
