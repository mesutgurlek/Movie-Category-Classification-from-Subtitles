1
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,059
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,263
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:08,000
- [Machinery Beeping]
- With all due respect,

4
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,545
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,546
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,741
As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal,

7
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:20,912
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:46,043
I'm TC-14
at your service.

9
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:48,084
This way, please.

10
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:57,288
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,297
Make yourselves
comfortable.

12
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,562
My master will be
with you shortly.

13
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,871
I have a bad feeling
about this.

14
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:11,001
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:15,049
It's something...
elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,550
Don't center on
your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:20,817
Keep your concentration
here and now, where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:23,790
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,884
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,999
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:36,868
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,068
These Federation types
are cowards.

24
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,044
The negotiations
will be short.

25
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:45,447
What?
What did you say?

26
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,520
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,521
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:52,854
They're here
to force a settlement.

29
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:57,020
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:59,065
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:03,069
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:05,071
Send a droid.

33
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,378
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:17,044
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

35
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:29,933
What is it?

36
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,663
This scheme of yours
has failed, Lord Sidious.

37
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,366
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

38
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:41,311
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

39
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,174
This turn of events
is unfortunate.

40
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,382
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

41
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,222
My lord,
is that legal?

42
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,626
I will make it legal.

43
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,062
And the Jedi?

44
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,604
The chancellor should never have brought
them into this. Kill them immediately.

45
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:07,005
Yes. Yes, my lord.
Uh, as you wish.

46
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,677
Captain, look!

47
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,147
Shields up!

48
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,519
Sorry.

49
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:22,158
Dioxis.

50
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,627
They must be dead by now.

51
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:33,672
Destroy what's left of them.

52
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,982
Oh! Excuse me.

53
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:46,053
- Check it out, Corporal.
We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

54
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:48,645
Uh-oh. Blast them.

55
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:55,962
What is going on
down there?

56
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,033
We lost the transmission,
sir.

57
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,532
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

58
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:08,635
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

59
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,443
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

60
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,551
I want droidekas
up here at once!

61
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:16,176
We will not
survive this.

62
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:26,629
[Whining]

63
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,168
Close the blast doors!

64
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:37,976
That will hold them.

65
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:49,218
They are still
coming through.

66
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,226
This is impossible!

67
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:58,531
Where are
those droidekas?

68
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,866
Master! Destroyers!

69
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:11,043
They have shield
generators!

70
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,846
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

71
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:20,548
They're no match
for droidekas.

72
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:25,131
Sir! They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

73
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,537
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

74
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:40,976
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

75
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,211
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

76
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,258
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.

77
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,261
You were right
about one thing, Master.

78
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:55,855
The negotiations
were short.

79
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,434
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

80
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,631
It's Queen Amidala herself.

81
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,437
At last we are
getting results.

82
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:08,504
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

83
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,743
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

84
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:15,582
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

85
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,249
I was not aware
of such failure.

86
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,089
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

87
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:23,891
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

88
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:26,330
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

89
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,835
You must be mistaken.

90
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:30,962
Beware, Viceroy.

91
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:33,770
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

92
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:37,937
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

93
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,539
You assume too much.

94
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:43,552
We will see.

95
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:47,682
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

96
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,761
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:55,266
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

98
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,543
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

99
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,805
How could that be true?

100
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:11,283
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

101
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,116
[Distorted Voice] It must...
handiwork... negotiate... ambassadors...

102
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,885
- Nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.

103
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,893
What's happening?

104
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,895
Check the transmission
generator.

105
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:26,901
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

106
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:29,300
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

107
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:33,273
The senate would revoke their
trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

108
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:36,244
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

109
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:39,578
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

110
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:42,016
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

111
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,789
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

112
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:50,261
Our security volunteers
will be no match against
a battle-hardened Federation army.

113
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:56,495
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

114
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:35,104
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

115
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,340
and there is no trace
of the Jedi.

116
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:40,246
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

117
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:42,820
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

118
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:47,791
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

Our only hope is for

Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

great danger... to us all.

If you are to leave,

to the senate.

00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:09,890
We're losing droids fast.

312
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:13,333
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

313
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:19,603
- The shields are gone.
- [Whistling, Beeping]

314
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,179
The power's back!

315
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,880
[Beeping]

316
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,480
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

317
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,153
Deflector shields up
at maximum.

318
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:48,504
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

319
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,512
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

320
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,809
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

321
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,478
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade
Federation have no presence there.

322
00:26:57,587 --> 00:26:59,452
How can you
be sure?

323
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,490
It's controlled
by the Hutts.

324
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,424
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

325
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,827
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different
than if we landed...

326
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,831
on a system controlled
by the Federation,

327
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:13,268
except that the Hutts aren't looking
for her, which gives us the advantage.

328
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:20,769
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

329
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:24,543
She has disappeared,
my lord.

330
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:28,850
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

331
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,891
[Snarls]
I want that treaty signed.

332
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:34,017
My lord,

333
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,723
it's impossible
to locate the ship.

334
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,027
It's out of our range.

335
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,898
Not for a Sith.

336
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:43,904
This is my apprentice,

337
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:45,906
Darth Maul.

338
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:50,542
He will find
your lost ship.

339
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,216
This is getting
out of hand.

340
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:59,381
Now there are two of them.

341
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:02,517
We should not
have made this bargain.

342
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,328
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

343
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:14,338
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

344
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,774
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

345
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:20,346
[Chirping, Beeping]

346
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,575
R2-D2, Your Highness.

347
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:27,814
- Thank you, R2-D2.
- [Happy Chirping]

348
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:30,789
Padme.

349
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:33,054
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

350
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:35,130
It deserves our gratitude.

351
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,788
[Whistling]

352
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:39,425
Continue, Captain.

353
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:42,937
Your Highness,
with your permission,

354
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,100
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

355
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,577
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

356
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,308
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

357
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:55,318
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

358
00:28:56,755 --> 00:28:58,655
[Beeping]

359

Hello.

Sorry.

You're a Gungan,

00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:13,563
Uh-huh.

365
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:17,270
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

[Beeping]

371
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,698
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

372
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:44,901
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

373
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:04,960
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

374
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,567
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

375
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:10,829
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

376
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:13,772
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

[Captain]
Wait!

379
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:26,086
Wait.

380
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:31,893
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

381
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:35,830
No more commands from
Her Highness today, Captain.

382
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,026
The spaceport is not
going to be pleasant.

383
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,262
The queen wishes it.

384
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,339
She's curious
about the planet.

385
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,967
[Sighs]
This is not a good idea.

386
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,978
Stay close to me.

387
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,316
[Chirps, Beeping]

388
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,595
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

389
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,598
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

390
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:14,073
The few spaceports like this one
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

391
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:16,077
Like us.

392
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:20,007

[Creature Snorts]

We'll try one
of the smaller dealers.

[Bell Dinging]

398
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,844
[Speaking Huttese]
Good day to you.

399
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,711
What do you want?

400
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,546
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

401
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:56,715
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

402
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:59,292
Boy, get in here now!

403
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:03,627
- My droid has a readout of what I need.
- [Grunting]

404
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,632
[Speaking Huttese]
What took you so long?

405
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,998
I was cleaning the fan switches.

406
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:10,334
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

407
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,103
So... let me take thee
out back, huh?

408
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:18,113
Ni you'll find what you need.
[Chuckling]

409
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,581
- Hmm?
- Don't touch anything.

410
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,585
Hmph!

411
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,759
Hmm.

412
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:33,559
- Are you an angel?
- What?

413
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:37,397
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

414
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:40,405
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

415
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:43,067
They live on the moons
of lego, I think.

416
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,543
You're a funny little boy.

417
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:47,547
How do you know so much?

418
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,551
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

419
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:55,988
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

420
00:32:56,092 --> 00:33:00,051
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

421
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,494
How long have you
been here?

422
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:06,558
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

423
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,400
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt,

424
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:12,237
but she lost us betting
on the Podraces.

425
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:14,174
You're a slave?

426
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,443
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

427
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,281
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

428
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,117
Hmm. Hmm.

429
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:28,694
Where... Wheres
yousa goin?

[JarJar Grunting]

00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,166
- What?
- Hit the nose.

434
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,763
Oh! Uh.

435
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:46,372
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

436
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:49,109
I'm the only one
hereabouts who has one.

437
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:52,745
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

438
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:55,790
[Chuckles]
Saying of which,

439
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:58,326
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

440
00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:00,487
I have 20,000
Republic dataries.

441
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,462
Republic credits?

442
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,536
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

443
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:08,765
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

444
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:12,502
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

445
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,442
No, they won't!

446
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:18,745
What, you think you're some kind of
Jedi, waving your hand around like that?

447
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:23,118
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

448
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:27,353
- No money, no parts, no deal.
- [Beeping]

449
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,989
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,

[Grunts]

I wasn't so good at building things.

Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

[Groaning]

[Speaking In Huttese]
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

460
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,909
They seemed nice to me.

461
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,944
Clean the racks.

462
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:14,273
Then you can go home.

there's nothing left on board?

00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:26,759
A few containers of supplies.

467
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:29,921
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

468
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,364
not in the amount
you're talking about.

469
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:34,902
All right. I'm sure another solution
will present itself.

470
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,937
I'll check back later.

471
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,406
Noah gain!
Noah gain.

472
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:42,376
Da beings hereabouts,
cawazy!

473
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,947
Wesa be wobbed
un crunched!

474
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:48,245
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

475
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,480
[Whistling]

476
00:35:56,628 --> 00:36:00,064
Hmm?
Ah, mooie-mooie.

477
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:04,903
Hey, hey! [Speaking Huttese]
Are you going to pay for that?

478
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,801
Huh? Wanga?

479
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:08,771
It costs seven wupiupi.

480
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,971
Ah! Chubaa...

481
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:16,446
Oops.
[Whistling]

482
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,018
[Growling]

483
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:21,912
[Speaking Huttese]
Is this yours?

484
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:23,684
Who, mesa? [Gags]

485
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,658
[Alien Speaking In Huttese]

486
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,719
Ouch! Ouch!

487
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,957
[Speaking Huttese]
Careful, Sebulba.

488
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,227
He's a big-time outlander.

489
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:35,772
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

490
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:39,035
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

491
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:42,943
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

492
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,073
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

493
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:50,782
- Hi.
- Hi there.

494
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:53,722
Your buddy here was about
to be turned into orange goo.

495
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:57,319
He picked a fight with a Dug, an
especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

496
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,025
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

497
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:05,128
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

498
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,139
Thanks, my young friend.

499
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,300
But... But...

500
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,744
- But mesa doen nutten!
- [Growls]

501
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:17,514
[Wind Whistling]

502
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:22,416
This storm
will slow them down.

503
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:25,288
- Looks pretty bad.
- [Beeps]

504
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:27,956
- Panaka.
- [Man] Receiving a message from home.

505
00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:30,260
- We'll be right there.
- [Beeps]

506
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,368
[Anakin]
Here, you'll like these pallies.

507
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:41,070
- Here.
- Thank you.

508
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:44,546
Oh, my bones are aching.

509
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,212
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

510
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:52,223
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

511
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:54,919
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

512
00:37:55,062 --> 00:37:57,462
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

513
00:37:57,564 --> 00:38:01,433
Sandstorms are very,
very dangerous.

514
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:04,027
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

515
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:06,471
[Whistling, Beeping]

516
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
[Exhaling]
Mom!

517
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:23,755
- Mom, I'm home!
-[JarJar] Ahh, dissen cozy.

518
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,294
- These are my friends, Mom.
- [JarJar] Hello.

519
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:29,925
- I'm Qui-Gon J inn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

520
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:32,468
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

521
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:36,029
- Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
- Oh, mooie-mooie.

522
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:39,077
[Beeping, Chirping]

523
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:46,982
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

524
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:48,987
He's wonderful.

525
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,956
- [Beeping]
-[Anakin] You really like him?

526
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:54,995
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

527
00:38:56,498 --> 00:39:00,764
Oh. Oh. Uh...
Where is everybody?

528
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,169
Whoops. Yeah.

529
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,434
Oh, hello.

530
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,876
I am C-3 PO,
human-cyborg relations.

531
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,880
How might I serve you?

532
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,746
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

533
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:18,413
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

534
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,357
- [Whistling]
- I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

535
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,658
Oh, hello. I don't believe we
have been introduced.

536
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,459
[Excited Beeping]

537
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,830
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

538
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,995
I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

539
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,573
[Chirping, Bleeping]

540
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,872
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked"?

541
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:43,813
My parts are showing?
My goodness! Oh!

542
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,858
The death toll
is catastrophic.

543
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,359
We must bow
to their wishes.

544
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,521
You must contact me.

545
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:58,327
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

546
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:01,961
Send no transmissions
of any kind.

547
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:05,632
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

548
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:09,712
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

549
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:12,315
Either way,
we're running out of time.

550
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:28,093
Tatooine is
sparsely populated.

551
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:30,999
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

552
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:33,004
Move against
the Jedi first.

553
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,837
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

554
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:37,877
to sign the treaty.

555
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:40,140
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

556
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:42,716
At last we will
have revenge.

557
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,719
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

558
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,221
They will be
no match for you.

559
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:58,023
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

560
00:40:58,135 --> 00:41:01,161
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

561
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,764
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

562
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,310
- Boom!
- How wude!

563
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:09,846
I can't believe there's
still slavery in the galaxy.

564
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,881
The Republic's
antislavery laws...

565
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:14,316
The Republic
doesn't exist out here.

566
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,446
We must survive
on our own.

567
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,218
[Gulps]
Xcuse me.

568
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,763
Has anybody ever seen
a Podrace?

569
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:28,460
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

570
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:31,129
I'm the only human
who can do it.

571
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,402
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

572
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:36,774
- [Gasps]
- Don't do that again.

573
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:40,645
[Yelping, Blubbering]

574
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,812
You're a Jedi knight,
aren't you?

575
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,358
What makes you think that?

576
00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:53,726
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

577
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:56,732
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

578
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:58,734
I don't think so.

579
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:00,965
No one can kill a Jedi.

580
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:03,871
I wish that were so.

581
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:06,034
I had a dream
I was a Jedi.

582
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:09,308
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

583
00:42:09,415 --> 00:42:12,782
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

584
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:17,220
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

585
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:24,894
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

586
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:28,025
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

587
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,161
on a very important mission.

588
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,298
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

589
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:37,038
Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded
here until we can repair it.

590
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,274
I can help.

591
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:43,149
- I can fix anything.
-[Qui-Gon] I believe you can.

592
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:46,086
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

593
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,920
Wit no-nutten mula
to trade.

594
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,552
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

595
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:57,135
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

596
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:01,467
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.

597
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:04,441
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

598
00:43:04,544 --> 00:43:07,035
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

599
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:09,741
- You could enter my pod.
-[Mother] Anakin!

600
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:12,910
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

601
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,920
You could make him think
it was yours...

602
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:17,286
and get him to let me
pilot it for you.

603
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:21,590
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

604
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,857
But, Mom, I love it.

605
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:27,527
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

606
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,968
Anakin.

607
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:32,870
Your mother's right.

608
00:43:32,975 --> 00:43:36,070
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

609
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,246
No.

610
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,919
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

611
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:56,663
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

612
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,703
We'll find some other way.

613
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,069
No.

614
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,642
There is no other way.

615
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:08,113
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

616
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:10,776
He was meant
to help you.

617
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,362
[Growling]

618
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,267
Are you sure about this?

Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

The queen
will not approve.

The queen
doesn't need to know.

Well, I don't approve.

623
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:39,744
-[Bell Dings]
- The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

624
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:44,880
How can you do this? Not on
the Republic credits, I think, huh?

625
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,152
My ship will be
the entry fee.

626
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,353
Oh, not bad!

627
00:44:49,462 --> 00:44:52,455
Not bad, huh?
A Nubian, huh?

628
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,865
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

629
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:58,494
What would the boy ride?

630
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:02,167
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

631
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,406
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

632
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:09,916
I actually saved the pod,
mostly.

633
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:13,477
Mmm. That you did, huh.
[Chuckling]

634

The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

635
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,860
I have acquired a pod in a game
of chance, the fastest ever built.

636
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:26,096
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

[Laughing]

638
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:31,133
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee,

639
00:45:31,243 --> 00:45:33,143
and I supply the boy.

640
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:37,147
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

641
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:41,879
If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest
you front the cash for the entry.

642
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,046
If we win,

643
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,991
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

644
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:51,326
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

645

Either way, you win.

What if this plan fails,
Master?

651

We could be stuck here
a very long time.

652
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:28,129
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

653
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,676
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

And...

655
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:36,680
there's something
about this boy.

You should be very proud
of your son.

657

He gives without
any thought of reward.

658
00:46:48,163 --> 00:46:51,030
Well, he knows
nothing of greed.

Yes.

He can see things
before they happen.

662
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,777
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

663
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:05,781
It's a Jedi trait.

664

-He deserves better than a slave's life.
- Why, certainly.

665

Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

666
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:17,193
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

667
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:20,264
Who was his father?

668
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:24,902
There was no father.

669
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:29,706
I carried him, I gave birth,
I raised him.

I can't explain
what happened.

Can you help him?

Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

However, I should prefer it if
I were a little more completed.

sell you or anything.

01:23:00,144 --> 01:23:05,412
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

1092
01:23:05,517 --> 01:23:07,382
There is no interest...

1093
01:23:07,486 --> 01:23:09,580
in the common good.

1094
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:11,919
I must be frank,
Your Majesty.

1095
01:23:12,058 --> 01:23:14,959
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

1096
01:23:15,061 --> 01:23:17,963
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

1097
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:22,161
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

1098
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:26,172
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

1099
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:30,005
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

1100
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:33,673
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

1101
01:23:33,782 --> 01:23:35,682
of a stronger
supreme chancellor,

1102
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:38,275
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

1103
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:40,219
and give us justice.

1104
01:23:40,323 --> 01:23:44,589
You could call for
a vote of no confidence...

1105
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,628
in Chancellor Valorum.

1106
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:49,222
He has been
our strongest supporter.

1107
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:54,600
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

1108
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:58,039
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

1109
01:23:58,143 --> 01:24:01,044
Our people are dying,
Senator.

1110
01:24:01,146 --> 01:24:04,878
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1111
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:07,612
To be realistic,
Your Majesty,

1112
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,681
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1113
01:24:14,461 --> 01:24:16,520
That is something
I cannot do.

1114
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:26,500
He was trained
in the Jedi arts.

1115
01:24:26,609 --> 01:24:30,545
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

1116
01:24:30,646 --> 01:24:34,845
I mpossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

1117
01:24:34,952 --> 01:24:39,150
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1118
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:42,351
Ah, hard to see,
the dark side is.

1119
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,361
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1120
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:48,455
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1121
01:24:48,566 --> 01:24:50,467
May the Force
be with you.

1122
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:56,007
[Yoda]
Master Qui-Gon.

1123
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:58,509
More to say have you?

1124
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,680
With your permission,
my master,

1125
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:07,211
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

1126
01:25:08,322 --> 01:25:10,347
A vergence, you say?

1127
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:12,585
Located around a person?

1128
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:14,594
A boy.

1129
01:25:14,696 --> 01:25:18,530
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians
I have seen in a life-form.

1130
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:21,502
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1131
01:25:23,172 --> 01:25:25,538
You refer
to the prophecy...

1132
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:28,075
of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.

1133
01:25:28,177 --> 01:25:30,043
You believe
it's this boy?

1134
01:25:30,147 --> 01:25:32,741
- I don't presume to...
-[Yoda] But you do.

1135
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:35,478
Revealed your opinion is.

1136
01:25:35,586 --> 01:25:37,612
I request the boy
be tested, Master.

1137
01:25:37,722 --> 01:25:42,955
Oh? Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

1138
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:45,826
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

1139
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:47,831
I have no doubt of that.

1140
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,904
[Sighs]

1141
01:25:54,007 --> 01:25:56,532
Bring him before us, then.

1142
01:26:06,654 --> 01:26:09,556
- [Beeps]
- The boy's here to see Padme.

1143
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:11,558
[Woman]
Let him in.

1144
01:26:14,463 --> 01:26:18,366
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padme's not here right now.

1145
01:26:18,468 --> 01:26:20,800
Who is it?

1146
01:26:20,904 --> 01:26:23,931
Anakin Skywalker to see Padme,
Your Highness.

1147
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,941
I've sent Padme
on an errand.

1148
01:26:26,043 --> 01:26:30,913
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1149
01:26:31,049 --> 01:26:34,883
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1150
01:26:34,986 --> 01:26:36,886
We will tell her for you.

1151
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:39,617
We are sure
her heart goes with you.

1152
01:26:39,726 --> 01:26:41,785
Thank you, Your Highness.

1153
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:59,838
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1154
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:03,009
[Senators Murmuring]

1155
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:11,059
[Palpatine] Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1156
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:13,561
a tragedy has occurred...

1157
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:17,190
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1158
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,327
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1159
01:27:20,438 --> 01:27:22,429
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1160
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,770
This is outrageous!

1161
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:27,437
I object to
the senator's statements.

1162
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:31,607
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1163
01:27:31,717 --> 01:27:35,586
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1164
01:27:35,688 --> 01:27:37,679
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo,

1165
01:27:37,824 --> 01:27:39,724
who speaks
on our behalf.

1166
01:27:39,826 --> 01:27:41,727
[Murmuring Continues]

1167
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:48,463
Honorable representatives
of the Republic,

1168
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:51,698
I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances.

1169
01:27:51,807 --> 01:27:54,799
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1170
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:58,369
I object!
There is no proof!

1171
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:00,381
This is incredible.

1172
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:04,545
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1173
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:06,850
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1174
01:28:06,957 --> 01:28:09,755
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1175
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,261
- A commission must be appointed.
- The point...

1176
01:28:12,397 --> 01:28:15,525
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
-[Palpatine] Enter the bureaucrat.

1177
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:18,329
The true rulers
of the Republic.

1178
01:28:18,436 --> 01:28:22,601
And on the payroll of
the Trade Federation, I might add.

1179
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:26,940
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1180
01:28:28,515 --> 01:28:30,847
[Valorum]
The point is conceded.

1181
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:33,852
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1182
01:28:33,954 --> 01:28:36,480
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1183
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,491
I will not defer.

1184
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:42,085
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1185
01:28:42,196 --> 01:28:45,223
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1186
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,995
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1187
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:53,366
If this body
is not capable of action,

1188
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:56,502
I suggest new leadership
is needed.

1189
01:28:58,248 --> 01:29:01,150
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1190
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,243
in Chancellor Valorum's
leadership.

1191
01:29:03,354 --> 01:29:06,722
[Senators Murmuring,
Shouting]

1192
01:29:10,328 --> 01:29:12,489
Vote now!
Vote now!

1193
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,362
Vote now!
Vote now!

1194
01:29:15,468 --> 01:29:18,198
- [Chanting Continues]
Vote now! Vote now!
- Order!

1195
01:29:18,337 --> 01:29:21,238
Now they will elect
a new chancellor,

1196
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,241
a strong chancellor,

1197
01:29:23,343 --> 01:29:26,244
one who will not let
our tragedy continue.

1198
01:29:27,948 --> 01:29:32,249
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1199
01:29:32,353 --> 01:29:35,322
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1200
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:38,325
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1201
01:29:38,427 --> 01:29:41,157
I shall do what I must,
Obi-Wan.

1202
01:29:43,065 --> 01:29:46,797
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1203
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:50,031
They will not go along
with you this time.

1204
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:53,075
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1205
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:59,281
A ship.

1206
01:29:59,383 --> 01:30:01,352
A cup.

1207
01:30:01,453 --> 01:30:03,250
A ship.

1208
01:30:04,356 --> 01:30:06,847
A speeder.

1209
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:10,761
Hmm.

1210
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:15,299
How feel you?

1211
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:17,302
Cold, sir.

1212
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,404
Afraid are you?

1213
01:30:20,507 --> 01:30:22,441
No, sir.

1214
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,172
See through you we can.

1215
01:30:25,313 --> 01:30:27,213
Be mindful
of your feelings.

1216
01:30:27,315 --> 01:30:30,079
Your thoughts dwell
on your mother.

1217
01:30:31,753 --> 01:30:34,245
- I miss her.
-[Yoda] Mmm.

1218
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:36,881
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1219
01:30:36,993 --> 01:30:39,154
What has that got to do
with anything?

1220
01:30:39,261 --> 01:30:41,594
Everything.

1221
01:30:41,698 --> 01:30:44,758
Fear is the path
to the dark side.

1222
01:30:44,868 --> 01:30:47,770
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1223
01:30:47,872 --> 01:30:51,239
Hate leads to suffering.

1224
01:30:57,783 --> 01:31:00,684
I sense much fear in you.

1225
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:17,002
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1226
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:19,005
I don't know.

1227
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,667
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1228
01:31:23,445 --> 01:31:26,141
I hope not.

1229
01:31:26,248 --> 01:31:28,877
Gungans no dyin'
without a fight.

1230
01:31:28,985 --> 01:31:30,885
Wesa warriors.

1231
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,422
Wesa got a grand army.

1232
01:31:34,525 --> 01:31:37,926
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1233
01:31:38,028 --> 01:31:40,861
Your Highness?

1234
01:31:42,032 --> 01:31:44,160
Your Highness.

1235
01:31:44,269 --> 01:31:47,397
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1236
01:31:47,505 --> 01:31:49,564
as supreme chancellor.

1237
01:31:49,674 --> 01:31:52,576
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1238
01:31:52,678 --> 01:31:57,377
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1239
01:31:57,483 --> 01:31:59,145
Who else
has been nominated?

1240
01:31:59,252 --> 01:32:03,586
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1241
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:08,628
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1242
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,332
I will be chancellor.

1243
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:15,096
I fear by the time you have
control of the bureaucrats,

1244
01:32:15,204 --> 01:32:18,435
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1245
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,440
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1246
01:32:20,542 --> 01:32:24,070
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1247
01:32:25,849 --> 01:32:29,946
Senator,
this is your arena.

1248
01:32:30,054 --> 01:32:31,954
I feel I must
return to mine.

1249
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:37,494
I've decided
to go back to Naboo.

1250
01:32:37,629 --> 01:32:39,597
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1251
01:32:39,698 --> 01:32:41,598
They'll force you
to sign the treaty.

1252
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,100
I will sign no treaty,
Senator.

1253
01:32:44,202 --> 01:32:46,694
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1254
01:32:46,839 --> 01:32:48,739
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1255
01:32:48,841 --> 01:32:50,741
Ready my ship.

1256
01:32:50,843 --> 01:32:54,541
Please, Your Majesty,
stay here where it's safe.

1257
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:57,811
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1258
01:32:57,918 --> 01:33:02,253
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1259
01:33:12,434 --> 01:33:14,994
The Force
is strong with him.

1260
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:17,038
He is to be trained,
then?

1261
01:33:18,508 --> 01:33:21,568
No, he will not
be trained.

1262
01:33:21,678 --> 01:33:23,339
No?

1263
01:33:25,383 --> 01:33:27,442
He is too old.

1264
01:33:27,552 --> 01:33:31,353
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1265
01:33:31,456 --> 01:33:36,086
Mmm. Clouded
this boy's future is.

1266
01:33:38,297 --> 01:33:40,095
I will train him, then.

1267
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:47,304
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1268
01:33:47,408 --> 01:33:50,377
An apprentice you have,
Qui-Gon.

1269
01:33:50,477 --> 01:33:52,843
I mpossible
to take on a second.

1270
01:33:52,947 --> 01:33:54,643
The code forbids it.

1271
01:33:54,749 --> 01:33:58,150
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1272
01:33:58,253 --> 01:34:01,882
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1273
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:03,891
He is headstrong,

1274
01:34:03,993 --> 01:34:07,360
and he has much to learn of
the living Force, but he is capable.

1275
01:34:07,463 --> 01:34:10,729
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1276
01:34:12,069 --> 01:34:13,934
Young Skywalker's fate...

1277
01:34:14,037 --> 01:34:15,868
will be decided later.

1278
01:34:15,973 --> 01:34:18,534
Now is not the time
for this.

1279
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:21,304
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor,

1280
01:34:21,446 --> 01:34:24,108
and Queen Amidala
is returning home,

1281
01:34:24,249 --> 01:34:27,481
which will put pressure
on the Federation and could
widen the confrontation.

1282
01:34:27,586 --> 01:34:29,884
And draw out
the queen's attacker.

1283
01:34:29,989 --> 01:34:34,393
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1284
01:34:35,662 --> 01:34:37,562
This is the clue we need...

1285
01:34:37,664 --> 01:34:39,928
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1286
01:34:40,033 --> 01:34:42,867
May the Force
be with you.

1287
01:34:56,051 --> 01:34:58,953
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1288
01:34:59,055 --> 01:35:00,955
From your point of view.

1289
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:04,458
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1290
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,462
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1291
01:35:07,564 --> 01:35:09,964
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1292
01:35:10,067 --> 01:35:12,969
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1293
01:35:16,841 --> 01:35:18,741
[Whimpers]

1294
01:35:18,843 --> 01:35:22,371
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1295
01:35:22,481 --> 01:35:24,711
You won't be, Ani.

1296
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:28,912
I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful.

1297
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,957
Always remember:

1298
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,721
Your focus
determines your reality.

1299
01:35:34,828 --> 01:35:37,992
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1300
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:39,930
Master, sir,

1301
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:43,630
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1302
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:47,266
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1303
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:50,944
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1304
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:53,277
that resides
within all living cells.

1305
01:35:54,718 --> 01:35:57,619
- They live inside me?
- I nside your cells, yes.

1306
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:01,214
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1307
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:05,261
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1308
01:36:05,363 --> 01:36:08,265
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1309
01:36:08,367 --> 01:36:11,165
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1310
01:36:11,269 --> 01:36:13,169
They continually
speak to us,

1311
01:36:13,271 --> 01:36:15,968
telling us
the will of the Force.

1312
01:36:16,075 --> 01:36:18,202
When you learn
to quiet your mind,

1313
01:36:18,311 --> 01:36:20,211
you'll hear them
speaking to you.

1314
01:36:20,313 --> 01:36:22,213
I don't understand.

1315
01:36:22,315 --> 01:36:25,808
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1316
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:33,890
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1317
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:35,929
I welcome your help.

1318
01:36:36,031 --> 01:36:39,433
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1319
01:36:39,535 --> 01:36:42,698
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1320
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:45,706
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1321
01:36:45,808 --> 01:36:48,710
- Come on, R2.
- [Whistles]

1322
01:36:57,288 --> 01:37:00,314
Is the planet secure?

1323
01:37:00,425 --> 01:37:04,328
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1324
01:37:04,463 --> 01:37:07,523
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1325
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:13,537
Good. I will see to it that in
the senate things stay as they are.

1326
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,543
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1327
01:37:17,645 --> 01:37:19,545
Yes, my lord.

1328
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:21,547
A Sith here?

1329
01:37:26,955 --> 01:37:29,423
Those are
the forward stabilizers.

1330
01:37:29,524 --> 01:37:31,924
And those two
control the pitch?

1331
01:37:33,463 --> 01:37:35,363
You catch on
pretty quick.

1332
01:37:35,465 --> 01:37:37,365
[Panaka]
As soon as we land,

1333
01:37:37,467 --> 01:37:40,197
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1334
01:37:40,336 --> 01:37:44,068
I agree. I'm not sure what
you wish to accomplish by this.

1335
01:37:44,174 --> 01:37:47,075
I will take back
what's ours.

1336
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:49,612
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1337
01:37:49,714 --> 01:37:51,614
We have no army.

1338
01:37:51,716 --> 01:37:55,277
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1339
01:37:55,386 --> 01:37:57,378
JarJar Binks.

1340
01:37:57,490 --> 01:38:00,482
Mesa, Your Highness?

1341
01:38:00,593 --> 01:38:03,494
Yes.
I need your help.

1342
01:38:08,702 --> 01:38:10,932
I have one battleship
on my scope.

1343
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:13,131
[Obi-Wan]
It's a droid control ship.

1344
01:38:13,274 --> 01:38:15,174
They've probably
spotted us.

1345
01:38:15,276 --> 01:38:17,267
We haven't much time.

1346
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:32,727
- JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
- Good.

1347
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,731
Do you think the queen's idea
will work?

1348
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:38,734
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1349
01:38:38,836 --> 01:38:41,634
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1350
01:38:43,408 --> 01:38:46,536
I'm... I'm sorry for
my behavior, Master.

1351
01:38:46,678 --> 01:38:50,341
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1352
01:38:52,318 --> 01:38:55,617
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1353
01:38:56,756 --> 01:38:58,657
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1354
01:39:00,093 --> 01:39:02,994
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1355
01:39:03,096 --> 01:39:06,863
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

Some kinda fight,
mesa tinks.

1361
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:30,385
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1362
01:39:30,494 --> 01:39:32,860
More likely
they were wiped out.

1363
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:36,024
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, JarJar?

1364
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:39,570
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

Come on. Mesa show you!

[All Cheering, Shouting]

Yippee!
Ya-hoo!

1405
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:14,209
We've sent
our patrols.

1406
01:42:14,312 --> 01:42:17,804
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1407
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:20,077
It won't be long,
my lord.

1408
01:42:20,185 --> 01:42:23,349
This is an unexpected move
for her.

1409
01:42:23,456 --> 01:42:25,481
It's too aggressive.

1410
01:42:25,591 --> 01:42:28,025
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1411
01:42:28,127 --> 01:42:30,688
Let them
make the first move.

1412
01:42:30,798 --> 01:42:32,698
Yes, my master.

1413
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,866

1414
01:42:37,972 --> 01:42:40,338

They're here!

[Moaning]

1424
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,408
- [Qui-Gon] Captain.
- [Laughing]

1425
01:43:10,509 --> 01:43:13,137
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1426
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:15,179
Almost everyone's
in camps.

1427
01:43:15,281 --> 01:43:18,512
A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground
resistance movement.

1428
01:43:18,618 --> 01:43:21,178
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1429
01:43:21,287 --> 01:43:25,952
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1430
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:30,360
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1431
01:43:30,464 --> 01:43:32,365
The battle
is a diversion.

1432
01:43:32,467 --> 01:43:35,664
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1433
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,330
- R2.
- [Beeps]

1434
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,036
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1435
01:43:42,144 --> 01:43:44,044
Once we get to
the main entrance,

1436
01:43:44,146 --> 01:43:46,945
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1437
01:43:47,084 --> 01:43:50,019
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1438
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:53,385
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1439
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:55,391
What do you think,
MasterJedi?

1440
01:43:55,493 --> 01:43:57,654
The viceroy will be
well-guarded.

1441
01:43:57,762 --> 01:44:00,162
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1442
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:02,700
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1443
01:44:02,801 --> 01:44:07,534
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1444
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,974
Wesa ready to do
our-san part.

1445
01:44:11,077 --> 01:44:14,205
[Amidala] We have a plan which
should immobilize the droid army.

1446
01:44:14,314 --> 01:44:16,214
We will send
what pilots we have...

1447
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:19,343
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1448
01:44:19,487 --> 01:44:22,547
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1449
01:44:22,690 --> 01:44:25,592
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1450
01:44:25,694 --> 01:44:27,594
[Obi-Wan]
There's an even bigger danger.

1451
01:44:27,696 --> 01:44:29,596
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness,

1452
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:31,928
he will return
with another droid army.

1453
01:44:32,034 --> 01:44:35,266
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1454
01:44:35,371 --> 01:44:37,498
Everything depends on it.

[Beeps, Whistles]

1456
01:44:42,613 --> 01:44:45,207
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1457
01:44:45,316 --> 01:44:50,254
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1458
01:44:50,355 --> 01:44:53,017
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1459
01:44:53,158 --> 01:44:55,683
This will work
to our advantage.

1460
01:44:55,827 --> 01:44:58,626
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1461
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:01,131
Wipe them out.

Open fire.

1469

Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

- Sure.

to take place far from here.

you're going to have to go back
