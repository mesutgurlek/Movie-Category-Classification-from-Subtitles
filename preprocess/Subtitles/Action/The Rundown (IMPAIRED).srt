That's right.

Yeah.

Someplace

You know, back in the States,
Brazil nuts like these
go for $15 a pound.

313
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,391
Well, those fell
off the tree out back.

314
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:04,265
And around here
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

315
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:07,464
What do you call 'em?
Well, we're in Brazil,

316
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,700
so we just call them nuts.

317
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:16,011
Fair enough.
So what brings you to the Amazon?
Other than the food and drink, of course.

00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,702
I need you to make
a choice for me.
A choice.

325
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,366
Option "A" or option "B"?
What's option "A"?

326
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,376
Well, option 'A"is you and I
walk outta here nice and easy,

to the airstrip.

What's option "B"?
Pretty much
the opposite of"A."

00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,169
But I wouldn't recommend
that one.

334
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,770
I'll take option "C."

335

Mr. Beck.

345
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,783
There's been a slight change
in the narrative.

346
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:04,617
An unexpected twist
you might say.

347
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,988
Can I have a beer, please?

348
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,495
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this...

349
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:14,259
- The kid stays.
- I paid you.

350
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,166
Well, fortunately,
I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.

may have stumbled
onto a trinket of some value,

to lead me to it.

Consider it tax deductible.

the concept of the tooth fairy?

Explain it to them.
[Portuguese]

453
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:30,686
You find a tooth.
You put it under your pillow.

Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter.

They got my tooth.
I want it back.

I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man.
That was crazy.

No guns.
Strip, toss. Toss, strip.

Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
I know. I know.

But what is that?
Some kind of nouveau
Samurai code or something?

You got a problem with guns?
Let's just say they take me
to a place I don't wanna go.

Where do they take you?

To a place you don't wanna
see me go. Walk.

How often

Never?
Never.

If your best friend
was gonna die?
You wouldn't pick up a gun?

468
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:41,918
No guns.
Santa Claus would pick up
a gun to save his best friend.

Do I look like Santa Claus?
Do I look like Santa Claus to you?

What kind of things?
Very bad things, Travis.

He's your father.
He's not gonna kill you.

The only thing Billy Walker

Now, the question is,
Mr. Beck, what's good
for your business?

Huh? You don't like money?

You're just like
every other jackass

483

First they try to run,
then they try to fight,
then they try to negotiate.

484
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,935
When that doesn't work, they do
exactly what you're about to do
when you realize it's over.

485
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:30,133
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

486

You're gonna get down
on your hands and knees
and you're gonna beg me for a break.

[Snickers]
You don't understand
the situation.

489

You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.
You shot the wrong guy.

You slept with
the wrong guy's wife.
I don't care.

Your mistake.

What about you, Mr. Beck?

Haven't you ever
made a mistake?

I didn't ask for your help.

What are you doing?
I have to pee.

Pee in your pants. Move.
No.

this jungle for like five hours.
You've been very aggressive.

until you let me pee.

No, I'm not gonna unzip you.

You have 30 seconds.

bringing shade for thousands

so its people may rest
their weary backs.

You think bringing this gato
to your people will do all that?

824
01:06:04,874 --> 01:06:08,810
No, Mr. Beck, but I expect
the money selling it brings
will do just that.

Especially after you were going
to do the same thing yourself.

830

And 10% of that black market
is going to pay for your freedom,

How about you saddle up
to one of those bulls over there,

you ride into town like

- What I don't get is
why you people are so hostile?

01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:17,155
I've been good to you.
I built you a town. Why are we fighting?

Mr. Hatcher, are you out there?

What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?

I have no desire to fight
with you or your men.

01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,637
For that reason,
you have two options.

952
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:44,685
Option 'A' You leave the gato
and the girl and you walk
out of town, no questions asked.

I'm impressed myself, Travis.

[Shaking Hands]

1067
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:57,989
Declan, start the plane.

1068
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:01,859
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean,
"Declan start the plane"?

1069
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,193
I'm taking you home, Travis.
Oh, I figured that.

1070
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:06,097
No breaks. Good luck.

1071
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:10,069
You too.
I will send you your cut.

1072
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:13,698
Move.
Uh-huh.

1073
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:18,538
Not a penny less than 15.6 million.
Move, Travis.

1074
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:23,448
You really ought to stay away from guns.
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist, seriously.

1075
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:30,357
[All Cheering]

1076
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:19,206
Move.

1077
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:25,969
[Chuckling]
Well, look at him.

1078
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:30,347
Look at you with your beard.
You're like a real man.
But you're so thin.

1079
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:33,318
Running is good exercise.
[Laughing]
It's good exercise.

1080
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:35,856
- That's funny. Did you hear him?
Running for your life?
- Yeah.

1081
01:33:35,924 --> 01:33:38,154
[Laughing]
I love it, I really do.!

1082
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:45,362
You know, there is not enough aspirin
in the world for a headache like you.

1083
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:48,630
Well, there probably is,
but I understand what you mean.

1084
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:51,365
Well, that's good, 'cause
that means you'll understand...

1085
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:54,465
why you're gonna take that little
trip back to Chicago, huh?

1086
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,772
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

1087
01:33:56,844 --> 01:33:58,971
Ah, still the smart-ass.

1088
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:03,746
I'm not that smart, Dad.
I didn't know she was married.
Well, she was...

1089
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:05,785
very married.

1090
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:09,216
And you, what took you so long?

1091
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:13,727
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.
[Chuckles] Him?

1092
01:34:13,795 --> 01:34:15,558
No.
Yeah, yeah.

1093
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,155
But I did walk him right through
that door, right, just like we agreed?

1094
01:34:18,232 --> 01:34:21,065
You did.
We good?

1095
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:23,330
We're good.

1096
01:34:23,404 --> 01:34:27,340

You got your restaurant, kid.

1097
01:34:27,408 --> 01:34:29,342
Now get out of here.

1098
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:35,507
Billy, before I leave,
when I was down in Brazil,
they showed me this ritual...

1099
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:39,017
that they practice when they have
these big celebrations.

1100
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:41,647
And what they do
is they eat this fruit...

1101
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:44,691
and it's called konlobos,
with a "K."

1102
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,720
So, I figured before I leave,
we can celebrate one last time.

1103
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:54,063
Guys, try some of this.
We'll get it over with. lfhe says
it's good, it's gotta be good.

1104
01:34:54,135 --> 01:34:57,764
He's the best chef I know.
[Beck]
Billy, here. You try the first piece.

1105
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:01,371
It's not bad.

1106
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:04,468
Big seeds, though.
I don't like seeds.

1107
01:35:07,448 --> 01:35:09,643
Hey, what are you...

1108

[Moaning Continues]

1110
01:35:28,336 --> 01:35:30,964
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

1111
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:35,574
Mm-hmm.

1112
01:35:36,611 --> 01:35:38,545
Boy,

1113
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,715
you got a funny-lookin' face.

1114
01:35:41,816 --> 01:35:45,411
Hey, Dad. Whoo!

1115
01:35:47,822 --> 01:35:51,588
I love you, you know that?
Because you showed me something
back there. You did.

1116
01:35:51,659 --> 01:35:55,356
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

1117
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:58,365
You got it, man! You really got it!
Get in the truck.

1118
01:35:58,433 --> 01:36:01,402
You pretty much violated
every agricultural law back there.
That's the least of our problems.

1119
01:36:01,502 --> 01:36:05,165
I know. You should go back in there
and finish him off.

1120
01:36:05,206 --> 01:36:08,437
You wanna go back in there?
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
I'll wait for you right here.

1121
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:10,739
I'm not going back in there.
Right.

1122
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:13,713
So, shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

1123
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:15,749
Don't push me.

1124
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:18,479
What?
Don't push me.

1125
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:20,645
I appreciate everything
you did back there.

1126
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:25,021
But if you wanna get technical about it,
all you really did is even up the score
since I saved your life first.

1127
01:36:25,093 --> 01:36:27,118
Get in the truck.
You don't have to thank me.

1128
01:36:27,195 --> 01:36:30,426
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,489
Uh-uh.

- Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.
- Go for it.

Hey, remember your friend...
Mr. Thunder?

1133
01:36:48,749 --> 01:36:50,717
How 'bout his buddy...
Mr. Lightning?

1134
01:36:50,785 --> 01:36:54,653
Ooh, I know you know him.

1135
01:36:54,722 --> 01:36:57,418

don't ya?

1137
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:11,363
I'm just playing, man.
I'll be in the truck.

1138
01:37:15,309 --> 01:37:17,277

'cause I'm a peaceful dude
