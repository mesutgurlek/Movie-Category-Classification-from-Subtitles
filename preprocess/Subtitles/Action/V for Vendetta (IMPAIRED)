00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,700
...I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...

310
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,411
...a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...

311
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,915
...by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.

312
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,043
There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.

313
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,503
Let me think, let me think.

314
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,047
Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...

315
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,550
...and men with guns
will soon be on their way.

316
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,552
-It's Chancellor Sutler.
-Damn it!

317
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,056
Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...

318
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,059
...words will always
retain their power.

319
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,687
Words offer the means to meaning...

320
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,065
...and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.

321
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,609
And the truth is...

322
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,196
...there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?

323
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,741
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

324
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,536
Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.

325
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,039
And where once
you had the freedom to object...

326
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,999
...to think and speak as you saw fit...

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,461
...you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...

328
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,464
-...and soliciting submission.
-Cameras. We need cameras.

329
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,592
How did this happen?
Who's to blame?

330
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,678
Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.

331
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,764
And they will be held accountable.

332
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,226
But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...

333
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,270
...you need only look into a mirror.

334
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,105
I know why you did it.

335
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,982
I know you were afraid.

336
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,486
Who wouldn't be?
War, terror, disease.

337
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,530
There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...

338
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,076
...to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.

339
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,827
Fear got the best of you.

340
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,249
And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.

341
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,001
He promised you order,
he promised you peace...

342
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,880
...and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.

343
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,801
-Inspector, they're almost through.
-Last night, I sought to end that silence.

344
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,303
Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...

345
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,516
...to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.

346
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,312
More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...

347
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,022
...forever in our memory.

348
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,818
His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...

349
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,820
...are more than words.

350
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,738
They are perspectives.

351
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,782
So if you've seen nothing...

352
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,703
...if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...

353
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,165
...then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.

354

But if you see what I see...

...if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...

...then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...

614
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,066
It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...

615
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,026
...that his body was at his office...

616
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,863
...where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.

617
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,694
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.

618
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,084
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

619
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,545
You didn't take it, did you?

620
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,726
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

621
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,260
Did you have anything
to do with that?

622
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,179
-Yes, I killed him.
-You....

623
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,056
-Oh, God.
-You're upset.

624
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,642
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

625
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,187
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

626
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,065
-What?
-Violence can be used for good.

627
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,316
-What are you talking about?
-Justice.

628
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,074
Oh, I see.

629
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,495
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

630
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,816
And are you going to kill more people?

631
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,334
Yes.

632
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,810
Take a look at this.

633
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,422
Prothero's military record.

634
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,841
What do you see?

635
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:11,890
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

636
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,850
-Busy boy.
-But after all that...

637
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,687
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

638
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,658
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

639
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,778
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

640
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,032
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

641
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:33,328
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

642
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,833
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

643
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,379
-You're welcome to review our records.
-We've been through your records.

644
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,132
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

645
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,760
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

646
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,891
Well, there you have it.

647
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,641
This is a matter
of some urgency, major.

648
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,144
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

649
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,438
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

650
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,733
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

651
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,653
-Usual undesirables, I should think.
-But do you know?

652
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,697
-Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
-Do you know who was?

653
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,076
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records--

654
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,622
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

655
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,874
As head of the Detention Program
at that--

656
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:24,379
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

657
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,798
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

658
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,489
We all did what we had to do.

659
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,971
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

660
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,222
That's all I have to say about that.

661
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,897
You can do this.

662
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,492
Hi.

663
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,704
I've been thinking....

664
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,207
There's something
I want to ask you...

665
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:07,338
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

666
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,639
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

667
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,262
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

668
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,848
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

669
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,119
A man after my own heart.

670
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,986
He always told the best stories.

671
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,356
Until my brother died.

672
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,528
That was when everything changed.

673
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:34,157
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.

674
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,994
After he died,
my parents became political.

675
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,584
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.

676
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,169
When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...

677
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,546
...they were at the riot in Leeds.

678
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,757
I watched on the television...

679
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,760
...thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.

680
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,346
I remember them arguing at night.

681
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,849
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.

682
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,061
He said if we ran away,
they would win.

683
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,854
Win, like...

684
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,356
...it was a game.

685
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,437

00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,554
Evey, quick, hide!

-Mummy!
EVEY'S MOTHER: Evey!

688
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,379
EVEY:
I never saw them again.

689
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,550
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

690
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,093
I'm sorry, Evey.

691
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,992
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

692
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,515
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

693
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,676
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

694
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,396
...but I'm not.

695
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,496
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

696
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,403
...but I am.

697
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,323
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

698
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:03,371
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

699
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,292
...please let me know.

700
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,083
If you wish.

701
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,468
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

702
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,970
Worth a shot.

703
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,098
One thing is true of all governments:

704
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,893
The most reliable records
are tax records.

705
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,862
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

706
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,949
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

707
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,120
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

708
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,539
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

709
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,090
Thanks. This is a great help.

-Personal motto?
-From Faust.

713
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,021
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

714
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,398
It is. And speaking of the devil...

715
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,318
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

716
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,820
-Of course.
-It appears unforeseen circumstances...

717
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,782
...have accelerated my original plan.

718
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,702
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,273
I'll do my best.

00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,206
I believe you will.

721
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:36,923
Another doctor. Why does a
detention facility need so many doctors?

722
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,925
I don't know, but this is interesting.

723
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,553
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

-Really?
-Yeah, Father Lilliman.

725
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,799
-Lilliman.
-Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

726
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,651
Now, that is interesting.

727
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,655
Looks like he was promoted.

-Has everything been arranged?
-Yes.

I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.

731

You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

You're most diligent, Denis...

-Your Grace?
-It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,634
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

some confusion at the agency.

00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,396
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

740
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,772
Older?

00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,275
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

This isn't a game, Your Grace.

Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

-I'm sorry?
-I'm telling you this...

...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

1419
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:01,324
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1420
01:33:01,325 --> 01:33:04,619
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1421
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,832
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1422
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:13,336
He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.

1423
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,631
The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...

1424
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:20,135
...and the more aggressive
his supporters become.

1425
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:25,473
Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.

1426
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:28,977
At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...

1427
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,938
...and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.

1428
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,859
However, the true goal
of this project is power.

Complete and total
hegemonic domination.

1430
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,819
The project, however, ends violently.

1431
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,493
But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...

1432
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:50,665
...for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.

Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,672
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1435
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:02,761
But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?

1436
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:07,140
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,184

without a conscience...

...for whom the ends
always justify the means.

should not be an enemy of the country...

...but rather, the country itself.

1441
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,904
Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:

1442
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,032
A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.

...no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1452
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:54,354
And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.

1453
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:57,065
Some believed it was the work
of God himself.

1454
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,985
But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...

1455
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:04,239
...that made them all obscenely rich.

1456

A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1458
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:18,002
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.
