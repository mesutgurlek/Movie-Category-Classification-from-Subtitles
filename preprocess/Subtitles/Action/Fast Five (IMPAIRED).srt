You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

This is all the aftermath of
a daring, daylight breakout.

7

There were 26 high-risk
inmates being transferred...

8
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,881

on board has been accounted for,

Dominic Toretto.

just released the identity

of the man they believe to have
orchestrated the shocking escape

12
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:21,056
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

13
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,017
He is former federal agent,
Brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,062
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.

15
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,981
Multiple federal and local
agencies have joined forces

16
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,650
in the search
for Dominic Toretto

17
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,986
and his accomplices Brian
O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

18
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,739
But despite every eye in the
country looking for them

19
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:41,451
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

20
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,571

you heard from him?

Up in Ecuador somewhere.

00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,867
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

167
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,494
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

168
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,080
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

169
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,998
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.

170
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,168
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

171
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,796
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

172
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,715
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

173
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,842
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

174
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,427
We have plenty in the public
relations department.

175
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,304
Elena Neves.

176
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,265
A patrol officer?
You heard me.

177
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,227
But why? We have many
more experienced people.

178
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,312
I like her smile.

179
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,314
What's the second thing?

180
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:00,276
Stay the fuck out of my way.

181
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,163
Brian.
Hm?

182
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,041
I have something
I have to tell you.

183
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,793
VINCE: God damn.

184
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:18,670
What a mess!

185
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,132
Where you been, man?

186
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,761
You better check that tone.

187
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

188
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:30,265
Stop it!
Both of you.

189
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,728
Where were you, Vince?

190
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,940
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.

191
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,651
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

192
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,819
Had to wait them out.

193
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:44,612
That is such horseshit

194
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,781
That was your job,
and those were your guys! Hey!

195
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,450
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

196
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,326
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

197
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,494
Go walk it off.

198
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:10,180
REYES: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

199
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:14,267
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

200
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,604
Let me tell you a true story.

201
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:22,108
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

202
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,653
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

203
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,368
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

204
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,999
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.

205
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,838
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

206
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,092
They came bearing gifts.

207
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,469
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

208
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:54,015
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

209
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,352
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

210
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,898
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

211
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,444
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

212
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,782
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

213
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,493
And that's the key.

214
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:17,372
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.

215
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,208
Electricity, running water,

216
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,418
school rooms for their kids.

217
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,881
And for that taste
of a better life,

218
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,385
I own them.

219
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,595
Gentlemen.

220
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,183
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

221
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,434
I apologize for
the interruption.

222
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,521
Senior Reyes,
may I speak with you?

223
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,107
We've found them.

224
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,777
Pardon me, gentlemen.

225
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,919
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.

226
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,175
Almost.

227
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,302
Wait, Dom.

228
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,554
Mia was on that train.

229
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,264
My sister!

230
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,517
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

231
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,936
You set up the deal!

232
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,647
I thought the job
was for the cars.

233
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,858
I didn't know.

234
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,401
All they want is the chip.

235
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,113
Damn!

236
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,407
You should've come clean.

237
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,075
What's going on out here?

238
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:38,161
Nothing.

239
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,706
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

240
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,958
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

241
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,044
Get out.

242
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,924
What?

243
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,050
Get out!

244
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,227
You never listen to me.

245
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,980
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

246
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:10,777
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

247
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,154
Look at our family now.

248
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:18,284
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!

249
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,328
Where's Letty, Dom?

250
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,831
Where's Letty?

251
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:49,774
Plasma cutter.

252
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,111
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

253
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,946
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.

254
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,156
Pass me that manifest.

255
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,832
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

256
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,293
You asked for me?
I did.

257
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,044
May I ask why?

258
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,547
My smile
is not that great.

259
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,678
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

260
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:20,638
Six months later, you upped
and joined the force.

261
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,973
You're motivated.

262
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,810
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can’t be bought.

263
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:27,312
Am I right?

264
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,732
Yes.
Of course I am.

265
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,983
Good news, bad news.

266
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,735
You know I like
my dessert first.

267
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,778
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

268
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,864
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

269
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:39,657
One set of tracks
headed west

270
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,410
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

271
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,786
But another set
of tracks headed east.

272
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,247
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

273
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,916
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

274
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,585
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.

275
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,878
Pretty easy in this scrub.

276
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,713
Can't move without
leaving a sign.

277
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:55,256
Give me the damn veggies.

278
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,634
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

279
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,471
Not necessarily.

280
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,974
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.

281
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,393
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

282
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,854
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.

283
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:13,107
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.

284
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,443
You come prepared.

285
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,986
I'm motivated.

286
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,738
HOBBS: All right, then.

287
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,532
Let's find ourselves a car.

288
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,189
What do you think?

289
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:55,691
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.

290
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:59,404
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

291
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,322
Let's check this one.

292
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,453
Look at that.

293
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,956
Same building,
same order every week.

294
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,874
It's a delivery schedule.

295
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,021
What's this?

296
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,441
Drugs?

297
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,444
No. That's a dealer pack.

298
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,446
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

299
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,406
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

300
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,824
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.

301
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,868
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.

302
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,037
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

303
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,164
Yeah.

304
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,063
I thought so.

305
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,109
So what is that?

306
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,820
A 100-million plus
in cash houses?

307
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,780
That's how he keeps it
off the grid.

308
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,911
I think it's safe to say that
Reyes is smart to want this back.

309
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,747
It's his whole network right
there, just laid out on a chip.

310
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,605
Wilkes, Fusco,
up the middle.

311
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,357

flank north.

312
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,108

313
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,193
Stay here.

321
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:12,837

00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:24,565
Clear.

327
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:39,725
You okay here?

328
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,479
Yeah. I'm good.
Thank you.

329
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:21,017
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

330
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,811
We need to split up.

331
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,731
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.

332
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:27,815
No.

333
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,193
Dom is right.

334
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:31,986
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

335
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:33,112
We have no choice
but to split up.

336
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:34,447
I'm pregnant.

337
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:40,786
I already lost
my family once.

338
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:45,416
I'm not going through
that again.

339
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,085
Are you kidding me?
No.

340
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,968
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?

341
00:35:58,346 --> 00:35:59,430
Dom?

342
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:02,475
Promise me
we stick together.

343
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,109
I promise.

344
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:19,158
Our family
just got bigger.

345
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,011
Something
doesn't add up.

346
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,972
Toretto and O'Conner.

347
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:46,060
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

348
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:47,770
Now they're killing
federal agents?

349
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,565
It doesn't make any sense.

350
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:52,441
Here's what makes sense.

351
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:58,698
All these guys are
is names on a list.

352
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,199
They come up,
we take them down.

353
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:02,785
Not a phone call more,
not a bullet less.

354
00:37:02,868 --> 00:37:04,579
Wilkes, we get anything?

355
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,330
Standard forensics.

356
00:37:06,414 --> 00:37:08,207
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.

357
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,417
Prints are all over the car.

358
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,585
Anything else?

359
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,962
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.

360
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,505
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,

361
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:17,049
but we finally traced it
back to a corporation

362
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:19,802
owned by an investor down
here named Hernan Reyes.

363
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,078
Investor?

364
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:25,550
If there’s anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.

365
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,260
Okay, then so are we.

366
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:29,554
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

367
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:30,972
Chato, you're
on the roof.

368
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,350
I want you on overwatch in case
somebody comes back for something.

369
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:35,811
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.

370
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:38,104
If he goes to the john, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.

371
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:40,565
You got it, boss.
Wilkes, Fusco!

372
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,151
Let's put all this
mess back together.

373
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,197
That's going to take a while.

374
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,532
Then you better get started.

375
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,534
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.

376
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:52,410
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

377
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:23,441
Hey, Dom, what do you
remember about your father?

378
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,612
My father.

379
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:34,035
He used to...

380
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:38,081
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

381
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,126
For anybody
in the neighborhood.

382
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:44,421
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

383
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:50,051
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

384
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:55,140
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

385
00:38:56,558 --> 00:38:59,185
Even after she went to sleep,

386
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,314
he'd stay up
for a few more hours

387
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:06,359
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

388
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,321
I remember everything
about my father.

389
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,198
Everything.

390
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,659
That's just it.

391
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:16,536
I don't remember shit
about my dad.

392
00:39:20,248 --> 00:39:21,708
I don't remember
him yelling.

393
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,251
I don't remember
him smiling.

394
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:27,839
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

395
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:32,135
I don't remember.
He just...

396
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,347
He was just never there.

397
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:39,684
You ain't going
to be like that, Brian.

398
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,453
We can't keep
running, Dom.

399
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,748
We got to get out.

400
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,750
We got to get out now.

401
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,294
You're right.

402
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:19,557
Here's how we're
going to do it.

403
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,980
We're going to use this.

404
00:40:26,147 --> 00:40:27,983
We're going do one last job.

405
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:30,777
We're going to take
all of Reyes' money.

406
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:32,654
Every dime of it,

407
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:35,240
and disappear.

408
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:39,869
Forever.

409
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:42,580
New passports.

410
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:45,083
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

411
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,835
And we're just going
to buy our freedom.

412
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:47,961
That's right.

413
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:49,629
You realize we're talking
about going up against

414
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,047
the most powerful guy
in all of Rio?

415
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:52,799
Yes, we are.

416
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:56,136
Then we're going
to need a team.

417
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,103
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

418
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:06,563
First we're going
to need a chameleon.

419
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:11,943
Someone who can
blend in anywhere.

420
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:13,987
What else?

421
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,113
A fast talker.

422
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:18,533
Someone who can bullshit
their way out of anything.

423
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,951
I got that.

424
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,371
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

425
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:25,165
We're going to need someone
who’s good with circuits.

426
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,961
DOM: And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have wells.

427
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:32,338
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

428
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:35,341
MIA: What else?

429
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:37,635
Utilities and weapons.

430
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:40,472
Someone who ain't
afraid to throw down.

431
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,391
Someone to back up
every position.

432
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:45,018
BRIAN: Yeah, what else
do we need?

433
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:46,728
DOM: Most importantly,

434
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:50,023
we're going to need
two precision drivers.

435
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:52,734
Guys that don't crack
under pressure.

436
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:54,277
Guys that never lose.

437
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,863
You know we got that.

438
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:26,768
Aw, hell, no!

439
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:30,438
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?

440
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:32,816
I guess they did,
since your ass is here.

441
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,612
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?

442
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,448
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.

443
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:45,447
What's up, man?
What's up?

444
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,091
Hmm.

445
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,010
Sexy legs,
baby girl.

446
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:02,303
What time do they open?

447
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,975
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

448
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:08,977
Want me to open them?

449
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:12,272
(TEGO SPEAKING SPANISH)

450
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:15,233
I told you the skinny
chick had balls.

451
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:17,861
Looks like she started
the party without us.

452
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:21,072
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.

453
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:23,992
What's this guy saying?

454
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,619
Ugly is still ugly in
Spanish or in English.

455
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,789
(BOTH TAUNTING IN SPANISH)

456
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:32,000
Who are these clowns, man?
Circus clowns.

457
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:37,130
I thought cockfights
were illegal in Brazil.

458
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:39,299
I see you all have met.

459
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,094
You know when you called me
to come to Rio

460
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:46,014
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

461
00:43:46,097 --> 00:43:47,098
Look at this guy.

462
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:49,309
Long time.
I missed you, man.

463
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:50,476
Good to see you.

464
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,478
Brother.
What's up?

465
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:54,647
Yo, check this out.
This is Tej.

466
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:56,649
Best circuit man
on the East Coast.

467
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,234
And this is my boy,
Roman Pearce.

468
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:00,820
We go way back,
I met this guy in juvie.

469
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,530
I pulled that job
with him in Miami.

470
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:04,032
I've heard about you.

471
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,701
Nice digs.

472
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,578
Yeah, well,
the Ritz was sold out.

473
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,872
So what's this
all about, Dom?

474
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:14,292
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?

475
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,169
Because we got a job.

476
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,797
All right, so our target's
name is Hernan Reyes.

477
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:21,591
And he runs
the drug scene down here.

478
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:24,219
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

479
00:44:24,302 --> 00:44:26,346
No paper trail
means no banks.

480
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,514
And no banks means
cash houses.

481
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:31,017
That's right.
Ten of them, to be exact.

482
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,269
Spread throughout the city.

483
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:35,188
And we're going
to hit them all.

484
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:37,649
All of them?

485
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,150
All of them.

486
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:41,152
That sounds crazy.

487
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,196
You bring us
to a whole other country

488
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:45,323
so we can rob
the dude who runs it?

489
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,076
I thought this was business.

490
00:44:48,368 --> 00:44:49,661
Sounds personal to me.

491
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,205
Is that what this is?

492
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:56,084
I got love for y'all, but
personal ain't good business.

493
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,963
I can't do this, homie.

494
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:05,343
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.

495
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,470
You say what?

496
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:11,182
Hundred... See, sometimes
I be over thinking, man,

497
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:14,310
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

498
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:18,147
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

499
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:19,649
we split even.

500
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,526
TEJ: That's a little over
$11 million apiece.

501
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:23,903
I am down.

502
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:25,405
I'm in.

503
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:28,449
Eleven million.

504
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:31,577
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

505

You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:35,498
You just can't.

507
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,125
As soon as we hit
the first one,

508
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,961
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

Are you crazy?

519

Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

520
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:05,129
We ain't stealing it.

521
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:17,141
You tell your boss
exactly who did this.

522

Tell him there's more coming.

Keep looking.

Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.

528

It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

You may as well slap
neon lights on it.

Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

All right,
if that's our guys

535
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:44,312
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

It's them, for sure.

Who invaded?

The men from the train.

How much did they take?

They didn't
take anything.

They burned it!

Yes. And said

to get eyes in there.

and model of that vault.

your storage facility first.

Nope.

Look, I'm just trying
to do my job, man.

653

My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:31,964
It will be safe.

Come on, man.
Hook a brother up, please?

658
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:39,555
Nope. And you're
not my brother.

659
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:40,889
Brother from
another mother?

660

Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.

661
00:57:44,268 --> 00:57:45,477
Now stop wasting my time.

special agent than you ever did.

670

Well, that depends

All right, come on.

674

Dawg,
you still can't drive.

675
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,711
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

676
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,005
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.

677

I'm going to need you

678

steel reinforced walls

protect against thermal lance.

She is a beauty,
though, man.

696

A "beauty"
as in "good"?

697
00:59:41,718 --> 00:59:44,471
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

698
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:48,809
Then, no matter how much I caress
her, no matter how much I love her,

699
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:52,275
in the end, she still ain't
going to give up that ass.

700
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:56,235
This is one of the toughest vaults
to crack in the business.

701

We ain't gonna get anywhere with it
unless we got the duplicate to practice with.

how do we get in?

705
01:00:09,294 --> 01:00:10,880
Yeah, I've been thinking
about the way in.

706
01:00:11,302 --> 01:00:13,575
The wall in the evidence room,
not so harmed.

707
01:00:13,724 --> 01:00:15,169
So that's not happening.

708
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:18,177
Then we got this one here,
but there's a guard shack outside.

709
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:19,488
So that's no good.

But this one, this one shares a wall
with the basement bathroom.

So, what about the money?

712

That's gonna be some
heavy shit to move.

713

You're talking about
five-ton cash weight.

714
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:32,316
Yeah, but that's the thing
about the bathroom.

715
01:00:32,351 --> 01:00:34,609
It's got a vent that leads
to the parking garage.

716
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:36,808
All we got to do
is pop that vent

717
01:00:36,863 --> 01:00:40,453

to some waiting cars.

01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,193
Terrible!

803
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:42,302
I think I'm in love.

804
01:07:46,097 --> 01:07:47,599
That was real solid work.

805
01:07:47,682 --> 01:07:51,144
I think Camera 3
still caught you, though.

806
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:52,437
Let's do it again.

807
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:01,905
TEGO: That's the piggy bank
you ordered.

808
01:08:01,988 --> 01:08:03,907
You're kidding me.
Yep.

809
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:08,578
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?

810
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:11,080
Well, we had a life
before you met us.

811
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:15,197
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler

812
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:17,425
but there's still
another problem.

813
01:08:18,671 --> 01:08:20,006
Palm scanner.

814
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:21,883
And without Reyes' handprint,

815
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:24,344
Houdini himself
couldn't open this bitch.

816
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:26,429
How do you know
it's Reyes' handprint?

817
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:28,264
You got $100 million
in a safe.

818
01:08:28,348 --> 01:08:30,058
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

819
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:33,068
There you go with
that negativity, man.

820
01:08:33,228 --> 01:08:34,562
That shit is eating
you alive.

821
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:35,897
You check that.

822
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,024
Yo, check that.
Shut up!

823
01:08:38,107 --> 01:08:40,193
How are we supposed to get
Reyes' handprint?

824
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:43,029
DOM: Han.

825
01:08:43,112 --> 01:08:44,113
You're up.

826
01:08:46,115 --> 01:08:48,952
Sure. Nothing like
the easy stuff.

827
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:51,538
Let's go. I'll drive.

828
01:09:09,973 --> 01:09:11,975
I make six bodyguards.
Seven.

829
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:15,937
You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?

830
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:23,444
So, how long were
you in the army?

831
01:09:23,528 --> 01:09:26,322
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.

832
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:29,409
Thumb-racking the slide?

833
01:09:29,492 --> 01:09:31,327
That was
straight-up Mossad.

834
01:09:32,318 --> 01:09:34,361
I got out of the military

835
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:38,286
probably the same time
you quit smoking.

836
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,489
The amount
of chips you eat,

837
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:44,215
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,

838
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:46,884
you were a two-pack-a-day
man for sure.

839
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,597
Unfiltered.

840
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:55,685
Well, this is a bust.

841
01:09:56,853 --> 01:10:00,231
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

842
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:03,359
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

843
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:04,694
Or...

844
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:07,322
you don't send a man
to do a woman's job.

845
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:07,673
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.

846
01:11:11,502 --> 01:11:12,795
What's up?

847
01:11:13,413 --> 01:11:15,603
I thought you were
more of a thong man.

848
01:11:16,182 --> 01:11:17,517
We got the print.

849
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:20,222
Where?

850
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,919
Okay, that's crazy.

851
01:11:25,644 --> 01:11:30,415
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

852
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,824
Ehhhhh.
Hahahahaha!

853
01:11:33,116 --> 01:11:34,802
Hey, this will work.

854
01:11:35,827 --> 01:11:37,078
TEJ: I'm impressed.

855
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:39,163
Got it?
TEJ: Got it.

856
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:40,957
But you still didn't
answer the question.

857
01:11:46,963 --> 01:11:49,382
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.

858
01:11:49,465 --> 01:11:51,718
The whole team just got burnt.

859
01:11:53,136 --> 01:11:54,971
Now we're all wanted.

860
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,141
GISELE: How did this happen?

861
01:11:58,307 --> 01:12:01,894
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

862
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:03,813
Agent L. Hobbs.

863
01:12:04,188 --> 01:12:05,189
Hold on one second.

864
01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:07,358
Hey, Dom.

865
01:12:09,026 --> 01:12:10,820
Is that the guy you saw
in the favela?

866
01:12:13,656 --> 01:12:14,782
Yeah.

867
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:18,400
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.

868
01:12:18,703 --> 01:12:19,829
So he's good.

869
01:12:19,912 --> 01:12:22,999
When the FBI wants to find
somebody, that's who they call.

870
01:12:23,082 --> 01:12:24,834
Because he never
misses his mark.

871
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:27,795
This guy is Old Testament.

872
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:31,001
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

873
01:12:31,337 --> 01:12:33,052
And right now
he's hunting us?

874
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:33,732
Hm huh.

875
01:12:33,902 --> 01:12:35,613
Dom, we got to move up
our timeline.

876
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:36,971
ROME Yeah, but how?

877
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:40,453
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

878
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,852
If anything, we need
more room to breathe.

879
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:46,564
Roman's right.

880
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,759
Think we need to get
some fresh air.

881
01:12:55,766 --> 01:12:57,798
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.

882
01:12:57,845 --> 01:12:59,509
Let's get a move on!

883
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,472
Eastbound on
Avenida Atlantica.

884
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:07,460
Move, move, move, move!

885
01:13:13,716 --> 01:13:15,384
It stopped about
a block ahead.

886
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:17,470
Park it.
We're going on foot.

887
01:13:40,785 --> 01:13:41,911
Hey, Toretto.

888
01:13:49,853 --> 01:13:51,480
You're under arrest.

889
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:53,089
Arrest?

890
01:13:54,257 --> 01:13:56,175
I don't feel like
I'm under arrest.

891
01:13:56,926 --> 01:13:58,177
How about you,
Brian?

892
01:13:58,261 --> 01:13:59,428
No, not a bit.

893
01:14:01,389 --> 01:14:02,640
Not even a little bit.

894
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:04,976
Just give it a minute.
it'll sink in.

895
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,857
BRIAN: We didn't kill
those feds. That was Reyes.

896
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,233
HOBBS: I don't give a shit.

897
01:14:12,316 --> 01:14:15,111
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.

898
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:18,614
Yeah, that sounds
like a real hero.

899
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,866
That's funny.

900
01:14:23,028 --> 01:14:26,372
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

901
01:14:26,455 --> 01:14:28,207
Or some wannabe
tough guy prick

902
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,668
who beat a man half to death
with a socket wrench.

903
01:14:31,419 --> 01:14:32,628
Yeah, real tough.

904
01:14:33,629 --> 01:14:36,799
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

905
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:39,385
I don't think so.

906
01:14:39,468 --> 01:14:42,096
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

907
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:47,852
And your mistake?

908
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:49,830
Thinking you're in America.

909
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:55,945
You're a long way from home.
