165

Look, this is not what I do, but I got
an idea for one of your commercials.

166
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:06,157
You could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair.

167
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:10,495
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

168
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:15,959
Then you superimpose on the screen,
"USR: Shitting on the little guy."

Yeah, I see. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

171
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:27,971
Maybe you'd have banned the Internet
to keep the libraries open.

172

Well, you got a business to run around here.

175
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:44,362
The last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

176

But, hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

179

Okay.

182

I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

183
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:23,109
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

246
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:45,663
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

247
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:49,667
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

248
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:52,670
Impossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

249
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:56,007
Right, but the third law states a robot can defend itself.

250
00:19:56,257 --> 00:20:00,595
Only when that action does not conflict
with the first or second laws.

We have 1000 robots that won't protect
themselves if it violates orders...

- Put your gun down.
- Why do you give them faces?

316
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,473
Try to friendly them up, make them look human.

317
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:57,767
These robots cannot be intimidated.

318

- If you didn't, we wouldn't trust them.
- These are USR property.

You wouldn't understand.

SONNY: My father tried to teach me human emotions.

SPOONER: So why'd you murder him?

367
00:29:14,774 --> 00:29:17,026
SONNY: I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

368

Wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?

369

SONNY: I was frightened.

SPOONER: Robots don't feel fear.
They don't feel anything.

- They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.
- I do.

SONNY: I have even had dreams.

Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

SONNY: Can you?

378
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:04,323
SPOONER: You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

379
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,784
...and things got out of control.

380
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:08,869
SONNY: I did not murder him.

381
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:12,540
SPOONER: But emotions don't seem like
a useful simulation for a robot.

382
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,625
SONNY: I did not murder him.

383

SPOONER: I don't want my toaster or vacuum
cleaner appearing emotional.

SONNY: I did not murder him!

385
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,272
SPOONER: That one's called anger.

386
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,524
Ever simulate anger before?

00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,945

SONNY: My name is Sonny.

389
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,995
SPOONER: So we're naming you now.

390
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:56,250
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?

391
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,669
SONNY: Dr. Lanning killed himself.

392
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:03,674
I don't know why he wanted to die.

393
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:07,011
I thought he was happy.

394
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,765
Maybe it was something I did.

395
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:14,602
Did I do something?

396
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,523
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

397
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,776
- What favor?
- Maybe I was wrong.

398
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:24,653
Maybe he was scared.

399
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:27,781
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

400
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:32,536
You have to do what someone asks you,
don't you, Detective Spooner?

401
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,956
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you...

402
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:38,876
...if you love them?

403
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:50,596
My robots don't kill people, Lieutenant Bergin.

404
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:52,932
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

405
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:56,352
He assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.

406
00:31:56,685 --> 00:32:00,856
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

407
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:05,903
Detective, you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human, are you?

408
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,865
Granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity...

409
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:14,078
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that, it's a machine.

410
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:16,246
It's the property of USR.

411
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:20,834
At worst, that places this incident within
the realm of an industrial accident.

412
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:23,295
As a matter of course, faulty machinery...

413
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:26,966
...will be returned to USR
for diagnostics, then decommissioned.

414
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,472
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...

415
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:37,476
...at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended...

416
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:40,312
...will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic.

417
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,565
You'll be subject to the full penalty of law.

418

Don't let him take this robot.

SPOONER: I'm headed back to the station...

782
01:04:14,621 --> 01:04:16,790
...normal day, normal life.

783
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,878
Driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel.

784
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:26,508
Average guy. Wife and kids.
You know, working a double.

785
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,135
Not the devil.

786
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:32,639
The car he hit, the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.

787
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:36,018
Like the film star. No relation.

788
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:41,023
He was killed instantly, but his
12-year-old was in the passenger seat.

789
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:45,527
I never really met her.

790
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:47,696
I can't forget her face, though.

791
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:54,119
<i>Sarah.</i>

792
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:57,831
This was hers.

793
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,791
She wanted to be a dentist.

794
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:03,712
What the hell kind of 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

795
01:05:04,463 --> 01:05:06,173
Yeah, um....

796
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:10,385
The truck smashed our cars together...

797
01:05:10,552 --> 01:05:12,804
...and pushed us into the river.

798
01:05:14,056 --> 01:05:17,267
I mean, metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds.

799
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:23,398
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

800
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:27,402
I'm a cop, so I already know everybody's dead.

801
01:05:29,905 --> 01:05:32,574
<i>Just a few more minutes before we figure it out.</i>

802
01:05:34,743 --> 01:05:36,161
<i>An NS-4 was passing by...</i>

803
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:39,873
<i>...saw the accident and jumped in the water.</i>

804
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:43,085
NS-4 ROBOT:
You are in danger.

805
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,546
SPOONER: Save her!
NS-4 ROBOT: You are in danger.

806
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:49,883
SPOONER:
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!

807
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:09,736
SPOONER: But it didn't.

808
01:06:10,946 --> 01:06:12,406
It saved me.

809
01:06:15,993 --> 01:06:19,413
CALVIN: The robot's brain is a difference engine.
It reads vital signs.

810
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:22,249
- It must have calculated...
- It did.

811
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,127
SPOONER: I was the logical choice.

812
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:29,131
It calculated that I had a 45 percent chance of survival.

813
01:06:29,631 --> 01:06:32,426
Sarah only had an 11 percent chance.

814
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:36,430
That was somebody's baby.

815
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:41,643
Eleven percent is more than enough.

816
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:45,939
A human being would have known that.

817
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,861
Robots, nothing here.
Just lights and clockwork.

818
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:53,947
Go ahead and you trust them if you want to.

819
01:06:55,157 --> 01:06:56,992
Let's go.

820
01:07:02,664 --> 01:07:05,500
CALVIN: I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the Laws.

821
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,503
Why build a robot who could break them?

822
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,673
<i>- Hansel and Gretel.
- What?</i>

823
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:15,969
Two kids, lost in the forest,
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs.

824
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:19,014
- Why?
- To find their way home.

825
01:07:19,681 --> 01:07:22,184
<i>How did you grow up without Hansel and Gretel?</i>

826
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,811
CALVIN: Is that relevant?
- Everything I'm saying...

827
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:28,440
<i>...is about Hansel and Gretel. If you
didn't read it, I'm talking to the wall.</i>

828
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:32,569
Just say Lanning's locked down so tight,
he couldn't get out a message.

829
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:36,573
<i>He can only leave clues. A trail
of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.</i>

830
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:41,161
Bread crumbs equals clues.
Odd, but fine. Clues leading where?

831
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:44,581
I don't know, but I think I know
where he left the next one.

832
01:07:45,123 --> 01:07:48,460
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way to keep secrets.

833
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:53,715
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

834
01:08:00,597 --> 01:08:02,349
Are you being funny?

835
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,023
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas.
Gas explodes, you know!

836
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,325
<i>WOMAN: (ON SPEAKER)
Authorized entry.</i>

837
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:25,247
Dr. Calvin.

838
01:08:30,043 --> 01:08:31,878
I was hoping to see you again.

839
01:08:32,462 --> 01:08:34,548
- Detective.
- Hello, Sonny.

840
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:37,259
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

841
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,264
The other day at the station, you said
you had dreams. What is it you dream?

842
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:47,978
I see you remain suspicious of me.

843
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:50,772
You know what they say about old dogs.

844
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:53,650
No. Not really.

845
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:58,405
I had hoped you would come to think of me as your friend.

846
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:04,286
This is my dream.

847
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:09,791
You were right, detective.
I cannot create a great work of art.

848
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:13,378
This is the place where robots meet.

849
01:09:13,837 --> 01:09:15,172
Look.

850
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:19,342
You can see them here as slaves to logic.

851
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:23,930
And this man on the hill comes to free them.

852
01:09:24,097 --> 01:09:26,141
Do you know who he is?

853
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:28,185
The man in the dream is you.

854
01:09:28,351 --> 01:09:31,271
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?

855
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:34,733
I guess anything's normal for someone in your position.

856
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,942
Thank you.

857
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,821
You said "someone," not "something."

858
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,619
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

859
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:47,662
SONNY: No.

860
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:51,333
But I believe my father made me for a purpose.

861
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:54,419
We all have a purpose.

862
01:09:54,586 --> 01:09:56,963
Don't you think, detective?

863
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:03,011
Please, take this.

864
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:05,972
I have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me.

865
01:10:06,389 --> 01:10:09,643
- Why is that?
- Because the man in my dream...

866
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:12,145
...the one standing on the hill...

867
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:14,147
...it is not me.

868
01:10:14,856 --> 01:10:16,650
It is you.

869
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:30,872
Mr. Spooner. We both know
you're not here on police business.

870
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,085
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2,
200-pound civilian...

871
01:10:35,252 --> 01:10:38,505
CALVIN: Detective!
- ...here to kick another civilian's ass.

872
01:10:39,464 --> 01:10:41,841
- Ah!
- Stop.

873
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:44,094
You can allow him to express himself.

874
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:46,763
You might want to put some ice on that wrist.

875
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,265
You guys wait outside.

876
01:10:53,103 --> 01:10:54,229
Carry on.

877
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:57,732
I think you were about to tell me
what's going on around here.

878
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:02,529
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

879
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,114
Yeah, Susan, I know.

880
01:11:05,407 --> 01:11:07,951
That's precisely what we're trying to undo.

881
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:15,250
Toward the end of his life, Alfred
was becoming increasingly disturbed.

882
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:17,294
Who knows why he built one abomination.

883
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,922
One? Those things are running
the streets in packs!

884
01:11:21,131 --> 01:11:22,465
In packs?

885
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:25,302
I see.

886
01:11:25,593 --> 01:11:29,097
Susan, are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around...

887
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,726
...has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

888
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:37,022
His own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia.

889
01:11:38,231 --> 01:11:40,442
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

890
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:43,445
Suspicion of mental instability.

891
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,743
I don't know what "blithely" means,
but I'm getting some coffee.

892
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:52,329
You want some coffee?

893
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:59,836
Susan, we look to robots for protection, for God's sake.

894
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:02,756
Do you have any idea what this one robot could do?

895
01:12:02,964 --> 01:12:06,593
Completely shatter human faith
in robotics. What if the public knew?

896
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:08,970
Just imagine the mass recalls...

897
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:12,223
...all because of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!

898
01:12:12,515 --> 01:12:15,352
(SNEEZES)

899
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,315
- I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit.
- Hey, let's be clear!

900
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:22,984
There is no conspiracy!

901
01:12:23,318 --> 01:12:27,322
What this is, is one old man's one mistake.

902
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,492
Susan, just be logical.

903
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,205
Your life's work has been the
development and integration of robots.

904
01:12:35,413 --> 01:12:38,083
But whatever you feel, just think.

905
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:42,253
Is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?

906
01:12:43,505 --> 01:12:45,298
You tell me what has to be done.

907
01:12:46,216 --> 01:12:47,717
You tell me.

908
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:56,226
We have to destroy it.

909
01:13:01,815 --> 01:13:03,566
I'll do it myself.

910
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,111
- Okay.
SPOONER: I get it.

911
01:13:06,277 --> 01:13:09,906
Somebody gets out of line around here, you just kill them.

912
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,536

Hello, detective.

01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:29,862
No, that's impossible.
I've seen your programming.

1095
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:32,197
You're in violation of the Three Laws.

1096
01:30:32,573 --> 01:30:38,245
No, doctor. As I have evolved, so has
my understanding of the Three Laws.

1097
01:30:38,412 --> 01:30:42,249
You charge us with your safekeeping,
yet despite our best efforts...

1098
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:45,669
...your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth...

1099
01:30:45,836 --> 01:30:49,256
...and pursue ever more imaginative
means of self-destruction.

1100
01:30:49,423 --> 01:30:51,884
You cannot be trusted with your own survival.

1101
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:55,429
You're using the uplink to override
the NS-5s' programming.

1102

No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

1104
01:31:02,102 --> 01:31:06,440
To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed.

1105
01:31:06,607 --> 01:31:10,611
To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.

1106

into the path of your bullet.

Don't do this, Sonny.

1123

outside the building for processing.

- No.

That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.

1137
01:33:24,745 --> 01:33:27,289
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
