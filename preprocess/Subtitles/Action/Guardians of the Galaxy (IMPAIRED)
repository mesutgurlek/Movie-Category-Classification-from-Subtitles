00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,844
We know only that
she has been captured.

486
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,975
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

487
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,369
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

488
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,091
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

489
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,004
<i>is at risk.</i>

490
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,487
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

491
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,175
RONAN: With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

492
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,775
and yet you summon me.

493
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,775
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

494
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,935
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

495
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,769
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

496
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,651
RONAN: Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

497
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,695
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

498
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,855
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

499
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,166
Lower your tone!

500
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,361
I may be your...

501
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,451
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

502
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,281
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

503
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,966
is you.

504
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,206
Your politics bore me.

505
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,495
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

506
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,242
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

507
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,855
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

508
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,689
if you bring me the Orb.

509
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
But return to me again empty-handed,

510
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,604
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

511
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,809
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

512
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,851
This is one fight you won't win.

513
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,764
Let's head to the Kyln.

514
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,486
ROCKET: If we're gonna get out of here,

515
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

516
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

517
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,804
The guards wear security bands

518
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,327
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

519
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,165
Leave it to me.

520
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,170
ROCKET: That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

521
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
PETER: His leg?
ROCKET: Yeah.

522
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,162
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

523
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,641
All right.

524
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,044
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

525
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,255
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

526
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,455
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

527
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,695
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

528
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,215
How are we supposed to do that?

529
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,575
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

530
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,295
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

531
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,535
You must be joking.

532
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,415
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

533
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,135
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

534
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,655
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

535
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,495
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

536
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,615
I got one plan,

537
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,815
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

538
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,975
so figure it out!

539
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,126
Oh!

540
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,335
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

541
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,335
Now, this is important.

542
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,975
Once the battery is removed,

543
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,495
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

544
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,295
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

545
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,210

there were six singularities.

into existence,

NOVA PRIME: Did he say
why we should believe him?

He said his crew
just escaped from prison

01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,730
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,455
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1621
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,855
and it belongs to someone else?

DEY: You will be arrested.

1623
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,481
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1624
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,962
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1625
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,167
No, I want it more, sir.

Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1628
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,483
What if someone
does something irksome

1629
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,802
and I decide to remove his spine?

That's...

1631
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,841
That's actually murder.

1632
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,171
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1633
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,164
So... also illegal.

1634
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,007
Hmm.

They'll be fine, Dey.

I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.
