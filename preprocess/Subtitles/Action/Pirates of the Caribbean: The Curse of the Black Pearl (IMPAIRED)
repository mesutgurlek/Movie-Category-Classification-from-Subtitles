00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:50,542
You must be a pirate for
the Pirate's Code to apply,

495
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,542
and you're not.

496
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,274
Thirdly, the Code is more
what you'd call guidelines

497
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,009
than actual rules.

498
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:00,849
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

499
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:23,874
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

500
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:27,071
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

501
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:29,671
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

502
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:32,274
And where do you propose
we start?

503
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:34,979
If you have information
concerning my daughter,

504
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:36,988
please share it.

505
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:42,655
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

506
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:45,322
Mentioned it
is more what he did.

507
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:49,257
Ask him where it is.
He could lead us to it.

508
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:52,793
No. The pirates
who invaded this fort

509
00:41:52,872 --> 00:41:57,332
Ieft Sparrow locked in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

510
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,311
We will establish
their most likely course.

511
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:02,279
That's not good enough!

512
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:06,182
Mr. Turner, you are not
a military man.

513
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:07,913
You are not a sailor.

514
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:10,286
You are a blacksmith.

515
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:14,019
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

516
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,187
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

517
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:20,824
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

518
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:29,138
[ Door opens ]

519
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,543
You. Sparrow.

520
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:37,640
You are familiar with that ship.
The Black Pearl.

521
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:38,649
I've heard of it.

522
00:42:38,718 --> 00:42:40,083
Where does it make berth?

523
00:42:40,152 --> 00:42:42,245
Where does it make berth?

524
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,812
Have you not heard the stories?

525
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:50,195
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

526
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:52,891
sail from the dreaded
lsla de Muerta.

527
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:54,557
It's an island
that cannot be found,

528
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:58,502
except by those
who already know where it is.

529
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:01,005
The ship's real enough.

530
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:03,007
Its anchorage
must be a real place.

531
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:04,474
Where is it?

532
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,602
Why ask me?

533
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,146
Because you're a pirate.

534
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:11,047
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

535
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:13,140
Never.

536
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:18,050
They took Miss Swann.

537
00:43:18,124 --> 00:43:20,490
Oh, so it is
that you found a girl.

538
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,687
I see. Well, if you're intending
to brave all,

539
00:43:23,763 --> 00:43:27,995
hasten to her rescue,
and so win fair lady's heart,

540
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:30,331
you'll have to
do it alone, mate.

541
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:32,837
I see no profit in it for me.

542
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,372
I can get you out of here.

543
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,635
How's that?
They key's run off.

544
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,301
I helped build these cells.

545
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,607
These are
half-pin barrel hinges.

546
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:45,916
With the right leverage and the
proper application of strength.

547
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:48,445
The door will lift free.

548
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,147
What's your name?

549
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,454
Will Turner.

550
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,927
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

551
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,089
Good, strong name.

552
00:43:59,165 --> 00:44:01,929
No doubt named for your father.

553
00:44:02,802 --> 00:44:03,894
Yes.

554
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:06,563
Uh-huh.

555
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,938
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

556
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:13,274
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death

557
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,314
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl

558
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:17,474
and your bonny lass.

559
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,916
Do we have an accord?

560
00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:23,381
Agreed.

561
00:44:23,456 --> 00:44:24,388
Agreed.

562
00:44:24,457 --> 00:44:26,084
Get me out.

563
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:30,685
Hurry.
Someone will have heard that.

564
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:32,993
Not without my effects.

565
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:41,268
We're going to steal the ship?

566
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,871
That ship?

567
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:45,740
Commandeer.

568
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:48,075
We're going to commandeer
that ship.

569
00:44:48,147 --> 00:44:50,081
Nautical term.

570
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,049
One question
about your business.

571
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:53,483
Or there's no use going.

572
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,179
This girl.

573
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:57,916
How far are you willing
to go to save her?

574
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,423
I'd die for her.

575
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:00,754
Oh, good.

576
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,623
No worries, then.

577
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,047
This is either madness
or brilliance.

578
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:29,781
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

579
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:02,119
Everyone stay calm!
We are taking over the ship.

580
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:04,179
Aye! Avast!

581
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:10,186
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

582
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,924
You'll never make it
out of the bay.

583
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:17,662
Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

584
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,294
Savvy?

585
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:23,866
Commodore.

586
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:26,844
LT. GlLLETTE: Sir,
they've taken the Dauntless!

587
00:46:28,314 --> 00:46:30,043
Commodore!

588
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:32,606
They've taken the ship!

589
00:46:32,685 --> 00:46:34,915
Sparrow and Turner
have taken the Dauntless!

590
00:46:34,987 --> 00:46:38,855
CDRE. NORRlNGTON:
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

591
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:44,493
That is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

592
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:48,490
Here they come.

593
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:56,505
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

594
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:05,982
Search every cabin, every hull,
down to the bilges.

595
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,031
Sailors,
back to the Interceptor.

596
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:24,160
Now!

597
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:34,110
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

598
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:37,478
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

599
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,351
Set topsails
and clear up this mess.

600
00:47:42,421 --> 00:47:44,355
With the wind,
we won't catch them.

601
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:47,221
I don't need to. Get them
in range of the long nines.

602
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:49,056
Hands, come about!

603
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:51,289
Run out the guns!

604
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:53,957
We are to fire
on our own ship, sir?

605
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:56,024
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the ocean

606
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:58,092
than in the hands of a pirate.

607
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:03,199
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

608
00:48:06,211 --> 00:48:08,236
Abandon ship!

609
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:18,148
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

610
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:20,817
So it would seem.

611
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,391
WlLL: When I was a lad
living in England,

612
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:33,402
my mother raised me by herself.

613
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:38,100
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

614
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:40,677
Is that so?

615
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,614
My father, Will Turner.

616
00:48:44,682 --> 00:48:47,674
It was only after you learnt
my name you agreed to help.

617
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:50,117
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

618
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,178
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

619
00:48:52,256 --> 00:48:54,281
You knew my father.

620
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:01,559
I knew him.

621
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:04,795
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

622
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:07,962
Everyone else called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

623
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:09,869
Bootstrap?

624
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,500
Good man.
Good pirate.

625
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,669
I swear, you look just like him.

626
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:15,769
It's not true.

627
00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:17,746
He was a merchant sailor.

628
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:19,976
A respectable man
who obeyed the law.

629
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,486
He was a bloody pirate.
A scallywag.

630
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:27,422
My father was not a pirate.

631
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:31,484
Put it away, son. It's not worth
you getting beat again.

632
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:34,497
You ignored the rules
of engagement.

633
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,055
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

634
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:39,159
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair.

635
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:49,609
Now, as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

636
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,547
The only rules
that really matter are these.

637
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:56,074
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

638
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:57,518
For instance,

639
00:49:57,588 --> 00:50:01,080
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man

640
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,318
or you can't.

641
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:03,826
Pirate is in your blood,

642
00:50:03,894 --> 00:50:06,488
so you'll have to square
with that someday.

643
00:50:06,563 --> 00:50:07,723
Now, me, for example.

644
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:09,698
I can let you drown.

645
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:11,997
But I can't bring this ship
into Tortuga

646
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:13,502
all by me onesy, savvy?

647
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,867
So.

648
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:23,201
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

649
00:50:24,348 --> 00:50:26,248
Or can you not?

650
00:50:28,385 --> 00:50:30,285
Tortuga?

651
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:31,753
Tortuga.

652
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:56,402
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

653
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,449
that has never breathed deep
this sweet bouquet

654
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:01,677

From what I hear of Barbossa,

he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

to Corts himself.

with his armies.

But the greed of Corts
was insatiable.

00:56:25,275 --> 00:56:32,943
So the heathen gods placed
upon the gold a terrible curse.

01:02:25,902 --> 01:02:27,927
But with every intention
of bringing it back.

818
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:29,494
But you didn't!

819
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:32,439
You'll get another one.

820
01:02:32,509 --> 01:02:33,339
I will.

821
01:02:33,409 --> 01:02:34,899
A better one.

822
01:02:34,978 --> 01:02:36,639
A better one!

823
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:37,509
That one.

824
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,207
What one?

825
01:02:41,184 --> 01:02:42,947
That one?

826
01:02:45,755 --> 01:02:47,518
Aye, that one.

827
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,182
-What say you?
-Aye!

828
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:50,658
TOGETHER:
Aye!

829
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,524
PARROT:
Anchors aweigh!

830
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:56,895
No, no, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

831
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:59,196
It'll be far worse
not to have her.

832
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:36,464
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

833
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:38,473
with a compass
that doesn't work?

834
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,634
Aye, the compass
doesn't point North,

835
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,271
but we're not trying
to find North, are we?

836
01:03:54,157 --> 01:03:56,591
We should drop canvas, sir.

837
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:59,492
She can hold a bit longer.

838
01:04:00,897 --> 01:04:04,526
What's in your head that's
put you in such a fine mood?

839
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:06,569
We're catching up.

840
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:23,583
Time to go, poppet.

841
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:27,020
RAGETTl:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

842
01:05:18,937 --> 01:05:24,239
Dead men tell no tales.

843
01:05:25,978 --> 01:05:27,377
Puts a chill in the bones

844
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:31,382
how many honest sailors have
been claimed by this passage.

845
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:48,398
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

846
01:05:48,467 --> 01:05:51,561
Not a lot's known about Jack
fore he showed up in Tortuga

847
01:05:51,637 --> 01:05:54,504
with a mind to go after the
treasure of the lsla de Muerta.

848
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:55,835
That was before I'd met him.

849
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:58,900
Back when he was Captain
of the Black Pearl.

850
01:05:58,977 --> 01:05:59,966
What?

851
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:05,110
He failed to mention that.

852
01:06:05,184 --> 01:06:07,414
He plays things
closer to the vest now.

853
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:09,545
And a hard-learned lesson
it was.

854
01:06:09,621 --> 01:06:12,089
Three days out,
the first mate comes to him

855
01:06:12,157 --> 01:06:14,216
and says everything's
an equal share.

856
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:16,761
That should mean the location
of the treasure.

857
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:19,127
Jack gives up the bearings.

858
01:06:19,198 --> 01:06:22,361
That night, there was a mutiny.

859
01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:25,562
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die,

860
01:06:25,637 --> 01:06:28,731
but not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

861
01:06:32,077 --> 01:06:34,511
So that's the reason
for all the...

862
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:39,049
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

863
01:06:39,117 --> 01:06:41,381
Now, Will,
when a pirate's marooned,

864
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:44,513
he's a given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot.

865
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:47,718
Well, that won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

866
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:51,229
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

867
01:06:51,296 --> 01:06:54,390
that pistol will start
to look real friendly.

868
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:58,061
But Jack escaped the island, and
he still has that single shot.

869
01:06:58,136 --> 01:07:01,572
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

870
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,767
His mutinous first mate.

871
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:06,174
-Barbossa.
-Aye.

872
01:07:07,012 --> 01:07:08,741
How did Jack get off the island?

873
01:07:08,814 --> 01:07:10,338
Well, I'll tell ye.

874
01:07:10,415 --> 01:07:12,212
He waded out into the shallows.

875
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:14,752
He waited there
three days and three nights

876
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,651
till all manner of sea creatures

877
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:19,486
'came acclimated
to his presence.

878
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:21,287
And on the fourth morning,

879
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,487
he roped
a couple of sea turtles,

880
01:07:23,562 --> 01:07:26,793
Iashed them together,
and made a raft.

881
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:29,562
He roped a couple
of sea turtles?

882
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:32,297
Aye, sea turtles.

883
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,773
What did he use for rope?

884
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:43,241
Human hair.

885
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:45,112
From my back.

886
01:07:46,118 --> 01:07:47,278
Let go the anchor!

887
01:07:47,352 --> 01:07:49,786
TOGETHER:
Aye, Captain, aye!

888
01:07:49,855 --> 01:07:52,424
Young Mr. Turner and l
are to go ashore.

889
01:07:52,424 --> 01:07:52,822
Young Mr. Turner and l
are to go ashore.

890
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:56,520
Captain, what if the worst
should happen?

891
01:07:56,595 --> 01:07:57,721
Keep to the Code.

892
01:07:57,796 --> 01:07:59,889
Aye, the Code.

893
01:08:25,023 --> 01:08:26,217
Move.

894
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,589
10 years of hoarding swag.

895
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,151
And now we finally
get to spend it.

896
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:41,571
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

897
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,337
You can buy an eye what actually
fits and is made of glass.

898
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:48,379
This one does splinter
something terrible.

899
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:51,375
Stop rubbing it.

900
01:09:10,335 --> 01:09:13,327
What Code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

901
01:09:13,405 --> 01:09:15,532
Pirate's Code.

902
01:09:15,607 --> 01:09:20,237
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

903
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:23,847
No heroes amongst thieves?

904
01:09:24,516 --> 01:09:26,984
For having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

905
01:09:27,052 --> 01:09:29,919
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

commandeered a ship
of the fleet,

908
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:38,760
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

909
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:43,832
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

910
01:09:46,571 --> 01:09:50,940
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

911
01:09:57,416 --> 01:10:00,180
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

Here it is!

The cursed treasure
of Corts himself.

925

Every last piece that went
astray, we have returned.

of ever finding the last.

When's that?

of greatest profit to you?

not to trust me?
