00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,159
- I can have him here in ten minutes.
- How did you know that?

153
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,258
Liquid paraffin.

154
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,633
Came up positive.

155
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,036
And bullet holes
are usually a big clue.

156
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,370
Nobody reported any gunshots.

157
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,912
This is an Irish neighborhood.
I'm surprised you even got a phone call.

158
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,743
<i>You know, I can't find</i>
<i>the second one, sir.</i>

159
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,749
Look under the body.

160
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,353
Oh, yeah, there it is.

161
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,686
You guys ready for this?

162
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,025
This was no
gangland assassination.

163
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,725
Though creative,
it was way too sloppy.

164
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,133
Something went wrong here.
This has "personal" written all over it.

165
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,536
<i>Agent Smecker.</i>
<i>Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.</i>

166
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,405
There's no manager on the premises,
but they found a lady on the fourth floor...

167
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,671
who said she had water dripping
down on her whole place.

168
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,940
- It started just this morning.
- Fourth floor, huh?

169
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,948
Mm-hmm.

170
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,151
Then we're headin'
to the fifth.

171

<i>You're reachin', man.</i>

172
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,824
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.

173
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,793
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

174
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:34,127
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

175
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,807
I ain't gettin' him
no fuckin' bagel.

176

We'll start the ass kissing with <i>you.</i>

<i>Agent Smecker. Agent-</i>

178
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,924
Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.

179
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,928
There's a bar down the block
named McGinty's.

180
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,658
- It stands a good chance
they were there last night.
- Good work, Mitchell.

181
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,291
I'll check it out myself.

182

Ooh.

184
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,002
So quick you couldn't
even feel it go, could you?

185
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,102
<i>Let's try it again.</i>
<i>Try it again. Look at the ceiling.</i>

It's Doc.

187
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,113
- Thanks for comin', Doc.
- [Whispering] Jesus Christ!

188
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,554
What the fuck happened?
Are-Are you b-b-boys all right?

189
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,025
- We're alive.
- An F.B.I. agent came by the bar...

190
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,028
and he left me
his c-c-ca-

191

He left me his c-c-
Oh, he fuckin' gave me this. Fuck!

<i>- Ass! What are you gonna do?</i>
- [All Gasping]

193

We oughta turn ourselves in,
tell him it was self-defense.

194
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what he said.

195
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,804
- How the fuck's he know that?
We haven't spoken to anyone.
- D-D-Don't know.

196
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,503
He d-d-didn't say.

197
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,137
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.

198
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,842
- A-A-Anything.
- Just hold on to this for us.

199
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,044
- We're gonna come back for it when we get out.
- Right.

200
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,984
Fuck! Ass!

201
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,920
None of that cursing was directed at you.
He's- He's a bit-

202
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,865
First of all...

203
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,027
I'd like to thank
whichever one of you...

204

doughnut-munching,
barrel-assed...

leaked this to the press.

206
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,279
That's just
what we need now-

207
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,371
some sensational story
in the papers...

208
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:35,419
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.

209
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,354
Let me squash
the rumors now.

210
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,051
These two are not heroes.

211
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,126
They're just
two ordinary men...

212
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,927
who were put in
an extraordinary situation...

213
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,366
and they just happened
to come out on top.

214
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,406
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...

215
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,407
has turned up diddly
on these two.

216
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,875
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

217
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,878
And the general consensus is...

218
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,550
they're angels.

219
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,084
But angels don't kill.

220
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,819
And we got
two bodies in the morgue...

221
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,259
that look like they've been
serial-crushed...

Well, not armed.

225

If they had guns, they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

472
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,925

Now that Duffy has relinquished
his King Bonehead crown...

"symbolism." What is the <i>symbolism</i> there.

476
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,807
Let me explain it to you.

477
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,142
In Greek and Roman mythology...

478
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,979
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon...

479

the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.

480
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,216
This made sure the dead came to
atone for what they did during their lives...

481
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,225
Detective Alapopskalius.

Jesus. You're the first one
that ever got that.

483
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:55,655
Yeah, well, I'm an expert in nameology.

484
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,231
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.

485
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,574
Look at these
entry and exit wounds.

486
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,577
They're almost identical.

487
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,477
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull...

488
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,417
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

489
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,353
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.

490
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,654
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.

491
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,993
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

492
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,330
They shot him
at a downward angle?

493
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,603
It tells us
he was the last to die.

494
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,444
And number three. Dolly.

495
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,445
There was two shooters.

496
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,175
- Fan-freakin'-tastic.
- Hey, wait a minute.

497
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,774
Stay with me, boys.
What did they do...

498
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,786
to make two such
identical wounds?

499
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,880
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.

500
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,360
Each puts some iron to his head
and boom! That's all she frickin' wrote.

501
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,454
- What about one guy, two guns?
- Ah, possible.

502
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,159
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

503
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,635
A guy holding two guns to the back of
your noodle is going to shoot straight ahead.

504
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,638
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

505
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,006
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...

506
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:18,047
and killed eight men with eight extremely
well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

507
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,709
No way.
It had to be at least two.

[Reporter]
Did you see what happened?

1348
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:06,710
- [Crying] Yes, I was there.

How far are we going
to take this, Da?

1350
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,762
The question is not how far.

1351
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:32,500
The question is,
do you possess the constitution...

1352
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:35,200
the depth of faith...

1353
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:37,402
to go as far as is needed?

1354
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:44,083
After the astonishing display
of vigilantism...

1355
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:46,277
during the Yakavetta trial yesterday...

1356
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:49,184
the largest manhunt in recent
memory is being undertaken...

1357
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:52,690
to capture three men the media
have dubbed "the Saints."

1358
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:56,786
This reporter went out to the street to
find out what you thought about these three.

1359
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,058
Somebody can just go out,
get a gun and shoot somebody...

1360
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:01,532
because they feel they're
doing some good in the world?

1361
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:05,071
- No comment.
- Making the world a safer place.
- Are you kidding?

1362
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:08,664
- They're killing for good
and only the people who kill.
- Listen to yourself.

1363
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:10,675
This is gonna create
something so much worse.

1364
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:14,178
- I don't think so at all.
- Well, I think you're just naive then.

1365
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:16,249
I love the Saints, man.
They doin' a great job.

1366
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:18,784
Keep it goin', man.
Get these murderers off the streets.

1367
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:21,319
They're not out there
just killing for fame.

1368
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:24,151
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.

1369
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,158
- Every major city.
- These guys are playing God.

1370
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,820
This whole religious twist.
Who do they think they are?

1371
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:31,898
I believe in capital punishment.
If they let me, I'd pull the switch.

1372
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:33,523
Get 'em all! Kill 'em all!

1373
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:35,568
I'm all for it.
[Beep] them [Beep].

1374
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:39,628
The more people they kill, the better
it is for everybody. That's what they get-

1375
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:42,140
No, do not do that, Laquelle,
because you don't even know!

1376
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:45,109
- Sign me up, man.
- Sign me up. All right?

1377
01:44:45,212 --> 01:44:47,840
- Where can I sign up?
- Who are they to be judge and jury?

1378
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:51,406
- No. What if your mom sees?
- No comment.

1379
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:53,349
- No comment.
- I'm afraid for myself.

1380
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:55,353
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.

1381
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,548
I can't even believe you're
saying that. That's crazy.

1382
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,558
When did you turn
into such a sissy?

1383
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,595
- I think they just get off on killing people.
- Well, I have no comment.

1384
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:05,756
- No comment on that, dear.
- I have nothing to say. Thanks.

1385
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:08,801
All this hoopla with the media.
You guys are making it worse right now.

1386
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:10,802
You're giving them the power.

1387
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,065
By sticking that in my face,
you're giving the Saints power.

1388
01:45:13,173 --> 01:45:17,132
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I really don't wanna talk about that.

1389
01:45:17,244 --> 01:45:19,735
You walk into some kid's bedroom,
and it's gonna be there.

1390
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,474
You have Batman, Superman
and these Saints.

1391
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:24,482
Are you losing any sleep, honey?

1392
01:45:24,584 --> 01:45:27,781
- 'Cause you know what? I'm certainly not.
- No comment.

1393
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:31,289
- Don't talk to them.
- They're damn good. They're right!

1394
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:33,291
I'm ready to [Beep]
my [Beep] on.

1395
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:35,361
Okay? I'm ready to get busy too.

1396
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,362
You know,
I'm ready to get <i>busy.</i>
