NARRATOR: The war
between sorcerers

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,390
was fought in the shadows of history

3
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:02,854
and the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful Merlin.

4
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,025
He taught his secrets
to three trusted apprentices,

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,488
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,324
He should have trusted only two.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,543
Veronica and Balthazar
witnessed the savagery

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,628
of a sorcerer beyond evil,

9
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,096
Morgana le Fay,
Merlin's most deadly enemy.

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,282
We are but servants.

11
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,911
- Merlin.
- Horvath!

12
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,955
You betray me?

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
(GASPS)

14
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,710
I am no one's servant.

15
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,548
Well done. Now get the spell.

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,553
NARRATOR: And so it was. Morgana
gained sorcery's most dangerous spell

17
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,097
known as "The Rising,"

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,309
giving Morgana the power
to raise an army of the dead

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,685
and enslave mankind.

20
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,454
Veronica sacrificed herself
for Balthazar

21
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,791
by drawing Morgana's soul
into her own body.

22
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,294
But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.

23
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:56,050
To save Veronica's life
and to capture Morgana,

24
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,512
Balthazar trapped them both
in the Grimhold,

25
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,681
an inescapable prison.

26
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,853
Over time,
Balthazar fought many sorcerers

27
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,521
who tried to free Morgana,

28
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,649
trapping them in layer upon layer
of the doll.

29
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,903
Eventually, he captured
Horvath as well.

30
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,742
As Merlin lay dying,
he gave Balthazar his dragon ring,

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,287
saying it would guide him to the child

32
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,415
who would one day grow
to be Merlin's successor,

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,292
the Prime Merlinean.

34
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,919
The Prime Merlinean is the only one

35
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,214
who can kill Morgana.

36
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,509
NARRATOR:
Balthazar would search for centuries.

37
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,112
And never, it is said,
will Balthazar waver from his quest,

38
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,073
for mankind will never be safe

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,370
until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinean.

40

Hey, Tank.
How did you even get up here?

42
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,510
DAVE'S MOM: David? Field trip today.

43
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,804
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,890

You're not supposed to be
doing that, Dave.

47
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,921
Now!

48
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,716
BECKY: David.

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,636
That's cool.

50
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,029
...which means that before Ellis Island
and the Statue of Liberty were built...

51
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,115
DAVE: (WHISPERING)
Pass it to Becky.

52
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,117
OSCAR: Pass it on.
BOY: Pass it on.

53
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,202
GIRL 1: Pass it to Becky.
GIRL 2: Here.

00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,888
MS. ALGAR: Let's go.

55
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,058
Get on the ferry. Get your bags.
Stay close. Here we go.

56
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,112
Hey, stop!

57
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,797
Excuse me, excuse me.

58
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,549
No!

59
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,426
No, lady, don't!

60
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
No way.

(EXCLAIMING)

62
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,009
The second emperor
of the Han dynasty

63
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:54,390
locked his least-favorite wife
in this urn for 10 years to the day.

64
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,894
They say you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

65
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,273
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.

66
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,234
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.

67
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,153
A note?

68
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,779
It blew into your store.

69
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,781
(STAMMERING) It was just a...

70
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,575
Coincidence.

71
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,243
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

72
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,543
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.

73
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,421
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!

74
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,592
It's on your backpack.

75
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,138
Come over here.

76
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,571
This is very special

77
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,616
and if it likes you, you can keep it.

78
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,204
I better not. My teacher said
I couldn't be gone for long.

79
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,455
She knows I'm here.

80
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,040
You're a bad liar, Dave.

That's good.

No way.

I have been searching a very long time.

Magically, here you are.

86
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,175
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

87
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,594
It means

88
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,515
you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day.

89

And your first lesson begins right now
with your very own Encantus.

Do not move, do not touch anything.

Not where. The year.

You are wasting my time.

What happened
to "don't touch anything"?

That's not very sporting of you,

for 1,000 years. I'll explain later.

Oh, no, please, Bennet. Not this again
with the gray wolf. I can't...

138
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,633
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.

He must participate.

You're going to get

Yeah. You're that kid.

Yeah.

- So, did you transfer?
- Yeah, I did.

161

And got some help. Treatment.

00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
Your rubber soles block the current.

489
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,565
Plus it helps to look classy.

490
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,734
These are old man shoes.

491
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,030
Excuse me?

492
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,199
I love them.

493
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,119
A lot.

494
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,932
I haven't seen that cane since I saw
a picture of it when I was a boy.

495
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,810
You've been locked up a long time.

496
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
And now I'm out.

497
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,397
And I need soldiers.

498
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,690
I got one kid.

499
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,985
He ain't old school.

500
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,820
One will do.

501
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,157
Your ingenuity and your heart

502
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,285
will give you an advantage
over Morganians.

503
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,246
They rely only
on the power of their magic.

504
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,418
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice,

505
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,211
the plasma bolt.

506
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,471
Nothing. There's nothing.

507
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,434
I got it! I got one! I got one!

508
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,104
That's underwhelming.

509
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,857
God.

510
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,443
Again.

511
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,028
Ow! Ow! Ow!

512
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,536
(READING)... and invite my soul...

513
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,746
And again.

514
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,000
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!

515
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,053
DRAKE: So, out of a bath full of jewels,
I'm going to emerge, right?

516
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,721
And everyone's going to think I'm me.

517
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,433
I reach into the big top hat
and I pull myself out,

518
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,310
but I'm a woman.

519
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,023
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting
in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.

520
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,276
If I could get, like,
a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

521
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,238
But not out of its mouth,
that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.

522
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,117
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.

523
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,287
Yeah. Yeah, now,
keep it straight up sinister.

524
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,332
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

525
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,710
Sorry, are you lost?

526
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,839
So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

527
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,803
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...

528
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,471
Will you excuse us, ladies?

529
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,556
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

530
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,978
Bob.

531
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,063
Sorry.

532
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,026
So, they tell me
you're some kind of entertainer.

533
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,281
Five sold-out shows at the Garden,
plus back end on the pay-per-view.

534
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,244
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

535
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,831
Look, my master disappeared
when I was 15, vanished!

536
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,582
Left me with nothing but an Encantus

537
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,294
and some prescription-grade
abandonment issues.

538
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,170
So I improvised.

539
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,756
Well, the time for improvisation is over.

540
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,220
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinean.

541
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,596
He wears the ring?

542
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Mmm.

543
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,437
The best way to defend against fire,

544
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,024
vacuum sphere.

545
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:14,985
Your turn.

546
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,990
(GASPING)

547
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,575
I did it! I did it!

548
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,036
Excellent. Excellent.

549
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,496
- Excellent.
- I just did that.

550
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.

551
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,925
Really, really funny.

552
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,719
- This will be hilarious, then.
- (CRACKLING)

553
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,179
Oh, my God!

554
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,477
Dude!

555
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,272
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten in 10 years.

556
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,608
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

557
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,152
You mind if I ask
what's so special about this bench?

558
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,658
- No, no, no.
- What?

559
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,577
There's no time for that,
and too much at stake.

560
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,412
That girl,

561
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,248
she's the one, man.

562
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,210
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

563
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,172
Aren't you supposed to help me
to achieve my personal goals?

564
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,550
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.

565
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,344
I'm your master.

566
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,472
And your master says
if Horvath catches you out on the street,

567
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,932
you'll die.

568
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,059
Is she worth that?

569
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,269
Think about it, Dave.

570
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,319
And don't eat my sandwich.

571
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,989
Becky! What a coincidence.

572
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,783
BECKY: Oh, hey, Dave.

573
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,536
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?

574
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,121
Not in a threatening way.

575
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,415
Why was I even concerned?

576
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,501
So I listened to your show last night.

577
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,711
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.

578
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,547
I've never actually heard
of any of those bands,

579
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,966
which I think is a good indicator
that they're cool.

580
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,426
(BECKY LAUGHING)

581
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,761
I'm glad someone was listening.

582
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,889
This may come as a surprise to you,
I don't get up to much.

583
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,892
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.

584
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,144
- Give me the bracelet.
- Okay, okay.

585
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,728
- Give me.
- DAVE: Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,105
(BECKY SCREAMING)

587
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,692
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

588
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,447
No! Dave, don't!

589
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,169
You just give me
that bracelet back, please.

590
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,171
You better run back to your girlfriend.

591
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,424
Believe me, I wish she was...

592
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,217
You thought she was my girlfriend?

593
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,512
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?

594
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,723
You talk too much. Shut up.

595
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,436
What are you doing?

596
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,272
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...

597
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,067
Whoa!

598
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,903
- You seeing this?
- Heads up.

599
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,242
COP: Up the stairs!

600
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,412
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Here you go.

601
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,456
Your grandmother's bracelet.

602
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,667
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.

603
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,713
I've been doing a lot
of cardio boxing lately.

604
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,425
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

605
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,264
Something about you seems different.

606
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,226
I'm wearing new shoes.

607
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,980
- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?

608
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,275
Yes. Thank you.

609
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,694
I just want to tell you that

610
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,030
if you want me to help you
with your midterms,

611
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,323
come by my lab.

612
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
- I'll text you the address.
- Yes, yes, that would be great.

613
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,953
- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?

614
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,204
It's a date.

615
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,793
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.

616
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,046
No. A date like an appointment!

617
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,391
Love is a distraction.

618
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,811
Sorcery requires complete focus.

619
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,898
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

620
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,321
This is perfect.

621
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,032
The Rising will happen here.

622
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,911
We'll use their satellite dishes
on the rooftops.

623
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:40,000
There, and there, and there.

624
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:45,130
- Get it done.
- My "Best of" DVD drops next month.

Here we go. All right. Move.

626
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,015
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them
to see a genuine icon like me.

627
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,435
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.

628
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,022
And before that,
we need to find the boy.

629
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,481
Well, how do we do that?

630
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,194
We'll wait until he's alone.

631
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:15,577
Now, focus on control.
Set me down slow and steady.

634
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,045
I'll be back shortly.

We have important work to do.

- Yeah.

- Hi.
- Hi.

640
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,141
We should go. A library, anyplace...

BALTHAZAR: Dave?

642
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,729
Is that company I hear?

643
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:47,901
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Becky, this is my...

644
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,278
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.

645
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,155
Hey, Dave, I'm confused.

646
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,532
I thought you and I
were staying in together.

647
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,201
If this is a bad time,

648

- Tesla coils.

I was using them
to generate something called plasma.

on the technical aspects of it

who would inherit his power.

01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,802
The Prime Merlinean
will become so powerful within

to cast magic.

- Yes, we drove through a mirror.

969
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,823
- We're trapped in a reverse world.
- So...

970
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,492
It is, it is. Horvath's payback
for the bathroom mirror.

971
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,869
No, no. We won't die as long as

972
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,412
- we get out of here soon.
- Okay.

973
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,956
- By driving through our own reflection.
- Fantastic.

974
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,000
- DAVE: There. In the window.
- This is it.

975
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,843
(DAVE EXCLAIMING)

976
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,428
No, no, no, no, no. You're not...

977
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,680
- Here we go.
- We're not going to make that!

978
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,516
We're not... (SCREAMING)

01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,451
(SCREAMING)

980
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,121
Hello, Balthazar.

981
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,540
Oh, man. Oh, man.

982
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,209
No, no, no.
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

983
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,252
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

984
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,464
Oh, man.

985
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,133
I've got an idea. I've got an idea.

986
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,177
- Dave, don't.
- Please just let me do it.

987
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,766
- What?
- '73 Pinto? This is your idea?

988
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,561
No! No. My idea was to turn their car
into a beater.

989
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,979
(MOANING)

990
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,612
- Finish it.
- Right!

01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,449
(EXCLAIMING)

992
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,706
I think he stopped.

993
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,721
DAVE: Hold on, Tank.
Hold on, Tank. I got you, buddy.

994
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,348
MAN: Walked away.

995
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,242
Hey!

996
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,496
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

997
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,710
Where's Horvath?

998
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,586
Did he get away?

999
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,256
Where's the Grimhold? Who was that?

1000
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,176
That was her, wasn't it?

1001
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,679
The third apprentice.

1002
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,894
For centuries, Veronica, Horvath and I
were the only thing standing

1003
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,564
between Morgana
and man's destruction.

1004
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,235
Our friendship and our magic were
what Veronica and I depended on.

1005
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,488
You fell for her, didn't you?

1006
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,576
I fell for her.

1007
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,498
Like you,
all Veronica wanted was to be normal.

1008
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,502
Normal things, normal life.

1009
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:57,922
I fell.

1010
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,260
And so did Horvath.

1011
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:06,848
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

1012
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,184
For 1,000 years,

1013
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,561
you've been carrying her
around with you.

1014
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,563
In the Grimhold.

1015
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,776
I was going to give this to her
that night.

1016
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,744
I'm sorry.

1017
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,457
Okay, Balthazar.

1018
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:37,170
We are going to get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana.

1019
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,715
What's happened to you?

1020
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,217
Nothing.

1021
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,968
You're still a bad liar.

1022
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,014
- Why does everyone...
- You know, I am glad she likes you.

1023
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:51,142
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.

1024
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,521
There's nothing like it, is there?

1025
01:18:56,774 --> 01:19:00,527
Put your old man shoes back on.

1026
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,612
We have some work to do.

1027
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,410
HORVATH: Are all the satellite dishes
in position?

1028
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,619
All lined up.

1029
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,997
I chipped my mani, which is not cool.

1030
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,999
No, I imagine it's not.

1031
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:19,170
Inside there lies our next coworker.

1032
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:23,550
Abigail Williams,
a little witch who put Salem on the map.

1033
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,803
Once she's out,
we're at the Morgana shell.

1034
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,557
Now that's going to take a lot of time
and energy to crack.

1035
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,100
So what are we going to do?

1036
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,394
Have you heard of the Parasite Spell?

1037
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,104
(CHUCKLING)

1038
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,899
Sorry, I forgot
your education's somewhat lacking.

1039
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,402
Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct.

1040
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,362
You know, what feels right.

1041
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:48,867
Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell
is a rather nasty piece of business.

1042
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,745
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.

1043
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,375
It enables one sorcerer
to steal the energy from another.

1044
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,879
(GROANING)

1045
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,508
Well, you weren't really using it,
were you?

1046
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,559
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

1047
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,896
Excuse me?

1048
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,606
I'd like to make a request.

1049
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,526
I just finished my show.
But maybe next time, okay?

1050
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,662
I said I'd like to make a request.

1051
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,710
BALTHAZAR: All right.

1052
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:46,007
When Morgana is released,
no matter what happens,

1053
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:50,303
promise me you'll do whatever it takes
to destroy her.

1054
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,056
I promise.

1055
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,560
And for the record,
you wear the old guy shoes very well.

1056
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,480
My feet disagree with you,
but thank you.

1057
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,441
Knuckle bump.

1058
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,112
Might as well.

1059
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:14,160
Now that I have kidnapped the girl
for you, is it time to release Morgana?

1060
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:16,329
I'll give her your regards.

1061
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,999
Mr. Horvath,
have I done something wrong?

1062
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,751
(CRACKLING)

1063
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:22,877
HORVATH: Not at all.

1064
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:28,883
I need your power to free Morgana.
I just don't need you.

1065
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,970
Well, that's two.

1066
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:33,805
One more to go.

1067
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,901
That's horrifying.

1068
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:50,154
Let's just find the Grimhold
and be done with it.

Persian Quickrug.

And he thinks I'm old-fashioned.

1072

Ostentatious.

Ooh... Uh-huh.

Nothing, nothing.

1075
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,591
So that's Morgana.

1076

1078

That was easy.
Come on, Dave. You know the drill.

1079
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,823
Give me what I want, and I'll let her go.

1080
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,533
Dave, what is going on?

1081
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:18,951
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1082

HORVATH: No, she's not!

1083
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,165
She's going to be ground up
into chunks and fed to the cat

1084
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,335
unless you give me Merlin's ring
and the Grimhold.

Balthazar?
He's busy admiring the decor.

1086
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,298
So what's it going to be?

1087
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:53,277
(EXHALING)

1088
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:02,870
Here.

1089
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,832
Take it.

1090
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,964
- You're okay?
- Merlin's ring.

1091
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,467
It's been a while
since I've been this close to it.

1092
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,720
I wonder if it still works.

1093
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,270
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

1094
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:34,902
The Grimhold?

1095
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,074
I see.

1096
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,369
He took my ring.

1097
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,289
He was gonna kill Becky.

1098
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,250
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

1099
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,670
I would have done
the same thing, Dave.

1100
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:57,925
Where are you going?

1101
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,845
Battery Park.
Horvath's going to release Morgana.

1102
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,766
Well, you can't take him on
and Morgana at the same time. That's...

1103
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,477
- You literally can't.
- I have to try.

1104
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,103
Well, then I'm going with you.

1105
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,147
Without any magic?

1106
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,191
He has your ring.

1107
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,442
I'm going alone.

how much time they have

about this.

I'm just happy you're okay.

Look, Dave.
If you can just tell me the truth,

then I promise I will do my best
to understand.
