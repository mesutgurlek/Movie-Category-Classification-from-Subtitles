This is a Zando-Zan.

She has a greater range,
more power,

and a slight
weapons modification.

751
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,991
And, of course,
she's got deflective plating,

752
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,493

several direct hits.

You mean they're dead?

787
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,064
Death is a primitive concept.

788
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:15,861
I prefer to think of them as
battling evil in another dimension.

On behalf of the Star League

1129
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,209
I congratulate you on
your dazzling victory.

Thank you.
Thanks.

1131

the Frontier is down,

wouldn't be willing to stay on,

1134
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,597
and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.

Yes.

of an old friend.

you with details.

Keep your distance, now.

Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.
