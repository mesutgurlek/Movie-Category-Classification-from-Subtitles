telling us it is not a terror attack.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,456
It is most likely an accident.

you're a stain on our profession.

to be your host
for this legendary event,

being held for the first time
here in Great Britain.

123

With more CCTV
than anywhere else on Earth,

124
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,416

the stakes in this room are high,

128
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,193
but the stakes
for our competitors out there

129
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,496
are the highest possible.

130
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,730
At this very moment,

131
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,832
30 of the world's
greatest assassins...

132
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,224
are preparing for
the ultimate sporting event.

133
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,806
International killers
of every imaginable discipline

will compete for
a 10 million dollar cash prize

135
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,435
and the honorable title
of the "World's Best".

136
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,684

138
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,022
And here are a few
of my personal favorites

139
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,258
you may wish to keep your eye on.

140
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,193
- Visuals online.
- Go to seven.

141
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,295
- Go to seven, Rob.
- And cue.

142
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,701
Lai Lai Zhen, abandoned at birth
and left for dead.

143
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,669
At 17, she was killing
for the Triads

144
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,871
and has grown up to become
the number one hitter

145
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,974
in the Eastern market
for the past three years...

[applause]

148
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,717
Anton Bogart.

149
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,884
An outstanding athlete,

150
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,187
he lives for the thrill of the hunt.

151
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,022
Silent, stealthy, smart...

152
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,720
a lethal option.

153
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,922
9 to 1.

154
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,431
Yuri Petrov,
Russian special forces.

155
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,568
An incredible all-rounder
armed to the teeth.

156
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,903
Fists, feet, bullets, bombs...

157
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,829
utterly merciless,
he has it all.

158
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,913
Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid.

159
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,415
An outside bet,

160
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,717
but he's mad enough
to rise the ranks.

161
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,919
Reckless, ruthless, wild,

162
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,088
but guaranteed
great entertainment.

163
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,083
This is one guy
who truly loves his job.

164
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,429
And if you thought
it couldn't get any better,

165
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,593
we have a dramatic late entrant...

166
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,867
a returning champion
who I'm sure...

167
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,037
will add something very
personal to the proceedings.

168
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,139
Seven years ago,

169
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,441
Joshua Harlow took
the Tournament by storm

170
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,876
and retired as a champion.

171
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,644
But this year he's back.

172
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,536
For one reason,
and one reason only...

173
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,576
revenge.

174
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,785
Joshua's wife
was brutally murdered...

175
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,983
in their Miami home
four months ago,

176
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,222
and the person who killed her

177
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,614
is one of this year's players!

178
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,962
Joshua Harlow is our
favorite at 2 to 1.

179
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,632
[applause]

180
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,733
Activate tracking devices.

181
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,835
Overlaying and synching positions.

182
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,938
- Tracking bugs online.
- Prepare to go hot.

183
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,567
Hotter than me in a swimsuit.

184
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,342
Cue.

185
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,845
As ever, each assassin...

186
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,246
is implanted
with a tracking device,

187
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,581
so we can find them,

188
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,383
and they can find each other.

189
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,287
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice.

190
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,989
If we don't have a winner
within 24 hours,

191
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,158
our contestants will discover

192
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,526
that their tracking device

193
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,327
isn't just a tracking device.

194
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,555
Well, I know
you're all very busy men.

195
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,900
30 contestants...

196
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,506
24 hours...

197
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,640
one rule...

198
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,742
kill or die.

199
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

200
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,415
The Tournament has begun.

201
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,217

[Rob]:
Suck me sideways.

207
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,402
I would kill
for a piece of that pie.

208
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,703
Yeah, right.

209
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,406
You'd be fucking dead
before you could lick your lips.

210
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,110
Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her.

211
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,578
oh, yeah?
Is that so?

212
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,213
Uh-huh.
Yeah, kinda.

213
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,348
They go way back.
He nurtured her or something.

214
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,050
[beeping]

215
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,218
[Tech]: oh, oh, oh.

216
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,553
All right, it is showtime.

217
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,289
[Rob]: Holy shit.
Can you do that?

218
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,924
- Wow:
- He just killed an innocent guy!

219
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,158
[Tech]: Fuck! I love this shit.

220
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,160
- Fuck!
- Keep on him.

221
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,762
I'm locked on him.
Nowhere to hide.

222
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,430
Miss Hunter, it is showtime.

223
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,732
We have Tomko versus Zhen.

224
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,768
That is England v. China!

225
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,336
Good.
Patch it through.

226
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,104
Sir, we're off.

227
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,065
It's Steve Tomko
and Lai Lai Zhen.

228
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,009
What the fuck are you up to?

229
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,147
[knock on door]

[beeping]

00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,515
Who is it?

232
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,123
Room service.

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,684
Breakfast, madam.

234
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,983
[grunting]

235
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,886
You like that, bitch?
Huh?

236
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,762
[clicks]

237
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,576
I just want you to know,
after I kill you,

238
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,911
I'm going to fuck you.

239

Hey, welcome
to the tournament, Rob.

242
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,305
You fucking bitch!

243

[Host]:
First blood to Lai Lai Zhen.

244
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,862
[cheers and applause]

245
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,840
Her odds move to 7 to 1.

246
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,874
[Man]: Yeah!

247

[Man]:
Cleanup crew Delta

248

to the Ivy House Hotel room 107.

249
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,289
Delta:
We're on our way.

250
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,391
[Rob]:
I still would.

251
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,659
- [alarm beeping]
- Confirm one body.

252
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,628
Oh, okay, party time.

253
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,930
We have the Frenchman
Anton Bogart...

254
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,899
heading into a cluster...

255
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,467
- developing on the high street.
- Shit.

256
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,970
Activating all street security cams.

257
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,241
Picking it up on one,
two, three police cameras.

258
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,977
- The cameras live?
- Cameras are live.

259
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,141
We are in on the Gypsy.

[beeping]

263
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,173
Fuck.
The Frenchman's gone cold.

264
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,309
I didn't see a fight.
You see him get killed?

265
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,610
No, I didn't see a fucking fight.

266
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,878
Doing a signal sweep.

267
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,112
Check his body heat sensor now.

268
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,502
I'm on it.

269
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,824
[Tech]: He's back.
What did you do?

270
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,125
Must've been a blip.

271
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,654
Run a complete diagnostic.
I don't like blips.

272
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,161
Top you off?

273
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,005
- Coffee?
- No.

274
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,300
Top you off?

275
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,278
There you go.

No.

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,287
Okay.

You planning to pay for that?

282
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,993
Yeah. Yes.

283
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,668
Credit card?

284
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,737
Here, Father.
Allow me.

285
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,378
Enjoy your coffee.

286
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,939
Au revoir.

Sorry I haven't been around.

00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,691
I've been busy.
How's your mom doing?

294
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,894
She died, Father.

295
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,897
I... I'm sorry.

296
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,732
[Todd]:
She was asking after you:

297
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,335
Is there anything I can do,
like help with the funeral?

298
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,431
That's okay.
I've got it all sorted.

- Rob: oh, fuck.
- What?

302
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,322
I think we have another blip.

303
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,957
Shooter on the rooftop
just went cold.

304
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,382
No one near her.

305
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,876
We've got a moving signal
but no Frenchman.

306
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,878
What the hell is going on?

307
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,580
- Come on.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

308
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,006
I fucking hate blips!

[engine idling]

310
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,021
Hail Mary, full of grace.

311
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,189
The Lord is with thee.

312
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,357
Blessed art thou amongst women,

and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

314
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,195
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

315
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,064
now and in the hour
of our death, amen.

316
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,639
Oh, please,
Blessed Virgin, hear me.

317
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,746
I want to be a good man.

318
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,921
I want to be a strong man.

319
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,418
But I look inside my heart
and there is nothing there.

320
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,424
There's nothing there.

321
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,461
Oh, Blessed Virgin,
please give me hope.

322
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,279
I know.

323
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,992
What?

324
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,627
Whatever this is,
please, please...

325
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,393
What's wrong with you?

326
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,497
What's wrong with me?

327
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,466
Please, hear me...

328
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,368
Why aren't you
defending yourself?

329
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,502
I don't have any money,
please.

330
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,538
- I don't have any money.
- Shut up.

331
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,273
I'm just a...
I'm just a priest.

Stop!

Please, don't struggle.

343

You really are a priest.

What is it?

376
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,731
It's our Frenchman.

377
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,866
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed

378

to cut out his tracking device,

379
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,536
and it's ended up inside that priest.

I see.

381
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,740

I'm sorry:
What shall I tell them to do?

384
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,914
I suggest you shorten his odds

385
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,582
and follow him.

00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,950
Yes, sir.

visual contact with Bogart.

Yes, we have to get
the tracker out of you,

otherwise you're a target.

Why don't we go to the police?

501

Eh? You and I.

502
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,694
You acted in self-defense.
I'll speak for you.

Is it my accent?
Do I stutter? Is that it?

The people who run this,

than the police.

- But the bodies.

There will be an explanation.

It won't be the truth,
but it will be what people will buy.

You're lost?

Try to be me.

664
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,823
It must be tough playing God
with people's lives.

665
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,897
I don't play God.

666
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,835
If I don't do it,
somebody else will.

667
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,605
It's just a job,
nothing more.

668
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,098
I don't believe you.

669
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,104
Otherwise,
why didn't you just kill me?

670
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,476
I don't kill the innocent.

671

I'm so happy.

Joshua Harlow,

681
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,621
greatest assassin there ever was.

682
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,229
Well, I shit ya,

683
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,932
you're well past your best, ain't ya?

684
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,768
But, hey, look at the bright side...

685
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,305
at least you fell at the hands
of this year's champion.

686

[Miles laughing]

687

Look at what I did to that guy.

688

What the fuck was I thinking?

689
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,851
Jesus, Miles,
you're a fucking maniac.

690
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,549
Thanks.

691
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,194
Have a drink, legend.

[groans]

Just to be clear, old-timer,

695
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,235
these are the last few
moments of your life

696

you're experiencing right now.

697
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,373
You might as well
have a drink with me.

698
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,605
Maybe later.

699
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,470
Suit yourself, superstar.

700
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,344
Go on, now, tell me...

701
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,275
how many kills?

702
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,556
See, I love killing.

703
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,924
Just the smell of it.

Yeah.

707
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,067
Mary who?
I killed a fucking million Marys.

708

You know who.

709
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,737
Miami, four months ago:

710
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,938
I wasn't home.

711
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,474

Why did you kill her?

That's some nasty shit.

721
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,110
Now where were we?

722
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,212
My wife.

723
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,410
Yeah. Why weren't you there?

724
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,250
You left her all alone.

725
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,642
If I were you...

726
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,048
I'd blame myself.

This is really going to fuck you off.

It wasn't me.

Don't lie to me, kid.

Shit, I really do.

00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,604
But I wouldn't go take credit
for other people's work.

That'd just be wrong.

Don't you pass out on me, legend.

746
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,285
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife.

It gives me great pleasur...

00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,798
to know...

749
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,600
that you know who did it

750
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,232
and that you can't do
a fucking thing about it.

Heh.
She killed your wife.

Hello?
Mill's service station.

844
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,673
It's, um...

845
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,541
it's for you.

846
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,181
Hello?

847
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,585
Father Macavoy,

848
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,853
we haven't met,

849
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,856
but I feel I know you intimately.

850
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,859
So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?

851
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,195
Such profanity
from a man of the cloth.

852
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,530
[crowd chuckles]

853
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,698
now I suggest you listen to me

854
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,401
very, very carefully.

855
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,537
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt

856
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,139
what could have been
a spectacular kill,

857
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,043
I feel I should clarify
the rules a little.

858
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,880
There's a time limit
you really should take note of.

859
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,549
Time limit?
What are you talking about?

860
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,050
It's very simple.

861
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,387
You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.

862
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,822
I'm not going to kill anyone.

863
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,891
We shall wait and see.

864
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,959
It will be your faith

865
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,495
against your desire to live.

866
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,064
That device inside you
is so much more than a tracker,

867
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,633
as you've just witnessed.

868
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,402
There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.

869
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,738
If there's more than
one player still alive

870
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,740
when the clock hits zero,

871
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,575
everyone will meet
the same fate

872
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,244
as your American friend.

873
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,773
So let's see
if you have any real guts.

874
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,617
It's kill or be killed.

875
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,086
Four hours, Father,

876
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,822
and the clock is ticking.

877
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,357

01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,859
Thank you.

[laughs]

881
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,703
Well, that's perfect:

882
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,574
Hamilton: Let's bring a replay
of that up on one.

883
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,610
[Rob]: Jesus.

884
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,211
We have to do that to all of them

885
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,279
if the time runs out?

886
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,615
no, it takes them out automatically.

887
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,283
What's the priest doing?

888
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,453
If the sat imagery is correct,

889
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,690
he is trying to sort his shit out.

890
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,792
Lai Lai:
Anything yet?

891
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,628
[Macavoy]:
Nothing's happening. I'm too tense.

892
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,297
It's got to come out
one end or the other.

893
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,498
[sighs]

894
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,634
Can you not wait outside?

895
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,137
I'm staying put,
now concentrate.

896
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,698
You're putting me off.

897
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,142
Can you whistle or something?

898
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,880
Okay, who's Joshua's wife?

899
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,420
It doesn't matter.

900
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,456
Okay.

901
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,391
I thought the way you reacted
when you heard...

902
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:39,022
Will you just leave it alone?

903
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,364
Bit of a confession
in here, really, eh?

904
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,176
Confession can be incredibly hard.

905
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,680
It's painful to admit our sins

906
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,414
and trust ourselves in God's care.

907
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,388
But it helps.

908
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,194
It helps...

909
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,062
sometimes.

910
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,768
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

911
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,727
Hmm?

912
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,566
What's it got to do
with Joshua's wife?

913
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,888
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes...

914
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,416
is understanding.

915
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,996
Somewhere,
deep inside of them,

916
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,625
they've been expecting it.

917
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,327
Mary Harlow didn't have that look.

918
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,608
She just stared at me,

919
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,601
Like you did this morning...

920
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,848

922
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,727
I saw in her eyes...

923
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,823
that something was wrong.

924
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,200
Please!

925
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,061

Please!

927
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,539
But I pulled the trigger anyway.

[Lai Lai crying]

929
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,285
I didn't know it until afterwards,

930
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,849
but she was pregnant.

931
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,485
It's haunted me ever since.

932
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,925
That's why I have
to win this tournament...

933
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,865
so I can get enough
money to vanish.

934
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,003
And if I don't win...

935
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:14,004
then I get what's coming.

936
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,995
Okay, Miss Hunter,
the final few players...

seem to be converging
on the motorway.

we're tracking Bogart nearby,

and the long shot, Topuzov,
is closing in fast.
