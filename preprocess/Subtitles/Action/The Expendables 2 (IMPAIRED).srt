Uh... Long story.

329
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,674
- I would like to hear it.
- All right.

330
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,637
I was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,

331
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:23,391
but I actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.

332
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,520
Uh, this one time, we're stuck out
in this hell-hole valley.

333
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,275
About 30 Taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.

334
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,444
And they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.

335
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,406
So I called in for artillery support.
But, "No way," says the captain.

336
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,783
Didn't wanna endanger the locals.

337
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:46,456
So we scattered. Some crawled to a ditch,
some to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed.

338
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,374
But we were still stuck in the kill zone.

339
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,379
And we battled for,
I don't know, three hours.

340
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,010
And finally, an Apache gunship chopper
showed up to provide air cover.

341
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,928
Scattered the Hadjis, but...

342
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,352
Smoke clears and four of my squad are dead
in the ditch and two in the riverbed.

343
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,947
Yeah, I was mad and sick,
all dead for nothin'.

You know the most screwed up thing of all

345
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,749
is when I got back to base that night,

346
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:34,253
I found out that they had shot
this stray dog that I adopted.

347
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,424
Commander's orders to get rid
of all animals on the base.

348
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,096
I mean, you'd think we had enough damn
shooting for one day, you know?

349
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,478
And, anyway,
I figured it was time to move on.

350
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,108
I heard these guys were looking
for someone, and here I am.

A mine. What mine?

The Russians stored nearly 5 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium.

The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.
No one knows it's there.

The blueprint shows
where the plutonium is stored.

01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:29,673
Good.

1142
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,677
So, Maggie, you'll be coming with us then?

1143
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,222
When you're ready.

1144
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,272
So I just want...

1145
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,031
Wow.

1146
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,619
They're okay, just a little immature.

1147
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:05,125
I don't have to go.
If you want me to stay, I'll stay.

1148
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,089
And I did save the babysitter's life.

1149
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,424
That you did do.

1150
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,468
Maybe I'm good luck for you.

1151
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:18,514
But I could be bad luck for you,
and I can't allow that.

1152
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:26,480
If you ever want help, call me,

1153
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,815
or you're dead.

1154
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,025
I'll do that.

1155
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,869
What are you doing here?

1156
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,915
Moving on. You killed all my business.

1157
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:46,458
I thought you were the Lone Wolf.

1158
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,335
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

1159
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,671
Sometimes it's fun to run with the pack.

1160
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,214
Sure, you got a point.

1161
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:53,632
You take care, Maggie.

1162
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,517
Oh, I almost forgot.

1163
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:06,103
As a token of my gratitude,
my violent friend,

1164
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,148
I got you and the Little Rascals a ride home.

1165
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:12,901
- Behold.
- What?

1166
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:18,782
Consider it a gift.

1167
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:23,704
- That thing belongs in a museum.
- (CHUCKLING)

1168
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,372
- We all do.
- (CHUCKLES)

1169
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,126
- Hey, fun, right?
- Yeah, fun.

1170
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,004
Take care.

1171
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,895
(ALL CHANTING) Beware, beware,
walk with care.

1172
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,939
Careful what you do.

1173
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,858
Or Mumbo-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

1174
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,569
Mumbo-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

1175
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,323
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom!

1176
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,574
To Billy!

1177
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,494
- To Billy.
- ALL: To Billy.

1178
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:47,037
GUNNER: Rest in peace.

1179
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,957
- Man, I need a massage.
- Don't look at me.

1180
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,255
- Hey.
- What?

1181
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,925
- From one friend to another?
- What?

1182
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,678
You really should learn how to fight.

1183
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:05,097
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1184
