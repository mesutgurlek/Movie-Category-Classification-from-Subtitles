Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:22,925
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,728
I took a detour...

6
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,865
Through your defense lab.

00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,267
Tell me that isn't
what I think it is.

8

That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10

You were
instructed to go to Russia.

11

May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12

I'm a scientist.

revolutionary science ever developed.

into your errand boy,

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,890

steal my research?

18

with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

and I'll show you ferocity.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,308
Don't look at me. You said it.

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,978
I formally
tender my resignation.

25

We don't accept it. Formally.

Yes.

your ass, full-size.

the whistle and he gets fired.

165

He hacks into

and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

After you.

207

Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

208
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,962
This company's
founder and my mentor,

209
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,664
Dr. Hank Pym.

210
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,515
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

211
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,784
I immediately started
researching a particle

212
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,653
that could change
the distance between atoms,

213
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,990
while increasing
density and strength.

214
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,926
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

215
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,162
beneath
the dust and cobwebs of

216
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,498
Hank's research,
I couldn't tell you.

217
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,500
But just imagine,

the size of an insect.

Right, Hank?

224
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,732
Silly, I know.

225
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,667

227
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,106
Trumped-up BS to
scare the USSR.

228
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,843
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

229
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,147
every single time I asked you,

230
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:55,517
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

231
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,219
Just a tall tale.

232
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,087
Right.

233
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,457
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

234
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,737
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

235
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,640
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

236
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:21,510
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

237
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,013
Could that be done?

238
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:28,818
Well,
it's not a legend anymore.

about being a father.

343

I tell you this as a friend,

00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,936
and as the first
love of my life.

345
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,971

346
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,306
He's not an asshat.

347
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,841
Hey, watch your language.
Okay?

348

Really, Maggie? That guy?

351
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,749
Come on! You could marry
anyone you want,

352
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,950

get engaged to a cop?

353

At least he's not a crook.

354
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,289

I've changed. I'm straight.

355

356
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,995
I wanna provide.

357
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,930
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

358
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,866
So much.

359
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,401
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

362
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,541

You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

385
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:02,043
And today,
during my morning meditation,

386
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,411
an interesting
thought occurred to me,

387
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:04,880
and I think it
might apply to you, too.

my anger for Hank Pym.

I could have worked anywhere.

393
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,995

what we had to do,

but he forced us
to do it, didn't he?

But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

me about this girl,

420
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,021
Emily,
that we used to kick it with.

421

I ever touched.

do with the story.

uh, he tells me that she's

426
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,630
working as
a housekeeper now, right?

427
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,566
And she's dating
this dude, Carlos,

428
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,768
who's a shot caller
from across the bay.

429
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,170
And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.

430
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:11,639
Right? That he's

that is all retired now,
but he's loaded.

432

are on the same softball team,

433
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:19,514
and they get to talking,
right?

434
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,617

Maybe it's 248.

00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:08,022

00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,166

Yes.

Why?

Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

I did. She's great.

that we need you.

We don't.
We can do this ourselves.

I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

702
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,572
and then Hope
has you arrested.

703
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,475
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

704
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,644
She's a little bit anxious.

705
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,546
It has to do with this job,

706
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:47,748
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

707
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,317
I take it that
you're interested in.

708
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,485

709
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,518

Uh... Sure.

how you managed to get
past my security system.

713

was particularly clever.

robbed Vista Corp.

"Burgled" Vista Corp.

719
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,746
Vista's security
system was one of

720

the most advanced
in the business.

to be unbeatable.

00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:28,522
Yeah, thanks.

You know what? I'm okay.

726

How do you make them do that?

727

Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

728

They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

729
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,476
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

absolutely nothing.

You don't need to
raise your hand, Scott.

739
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:19,339
Sorry,
I just have one question.

740
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,308
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

741
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,876
and can I go back to jail now?

742
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,911
Come with me.

743
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:27,014
40 years ago,
I created a formula

744
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,283
that altered atomic
relative distance.

745
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,751
SCOTT: Huh?

746
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:32,719
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

747
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:34,488
That's what powers the suit.

748
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,990
That's why it works.

749
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,425

- But it was dangerous.

752
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,968
It was too dangerous.

753
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,572
So I hid it from the world.

754
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:55,045
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

Pym Tech.

756

Yes.

757
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:03,383
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

758
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,518
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

759
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,986
He's a big deal.

760
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,588
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

761
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:12,826
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

762
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,395
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

763
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:18,865
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

764
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:22,636
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

765
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:26,340
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

766
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,342
But I wouldn't help him.

767
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,378
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

768
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,979
How could he do that?

769
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:35,649
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

770
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:36,817
She was the deciding vote.

771
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,021
But she came back to me

772
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,857
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

773
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,594
The process is highly volatile.

it can affect
the brain's chemistry.

I don't think
Darren realizes this,

777
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:59,840
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

So, what do you want from me?

00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:06,099
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

808
00:46:08,868 --> 00:46:12,806
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

(HANK SCOFFS)

810
00:46:14,073 --> 00:46:16,076
I spent half my life

811
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,546
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

812
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:23,183
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

813
00:46:23,216 --> 00:46:26,620
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

814
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,022
This could change
the texture of reality.

815
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:32,993
Besides,
they're probably too busy

816
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:35,795
dropping cities
out of the sky.

817
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:37,564
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

818
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,800
Scott, they are ants.

819
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:44,171
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

820
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:48,108
Somebody that could
infiltrate a place

821
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,544
that's designed to
prevent infiltration.

822
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,212
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?
I mean,

823
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:54,214
I'm a good thief,
but this is insane.

824
00:46:54,247 --> 00:46:56,583
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

825
00:46:56,616 --> 00:46:59,553
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

826
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:00,987
I was against using him
when we had months,

827
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,023
and now we have days.

828

Absolutely not!

830
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,762
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

831
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:10,730
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

832
00:47:10,763 --> 00:47:13,199
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

Before Hope lost her mother,

00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:34,281
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

852
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,758
It's too late for me,

853
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:47,794
but not for you.

854
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,996
This is your chance.

855
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:53,700
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

856
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:58,304
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

857
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,407
It's not about
saving our world.

858
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,144
It's about saving theirs.

859
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,116
Damn. That was a good speech.

860
00:49:09,716 --> 00:49:10,784
Scott,

861
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:15,656
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

862
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:20,727
In the right hands,

863
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,697
the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic.

864
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,333
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

865
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:30,236
You need to be skillful,
agile, and above all,

866
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,738
you need to be fast.

867
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,740
You should be able
to shrink and grow

868
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,341
on a dime.

869
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:38,445
So your size
always suits your needs.

870
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:41,848
Now dive through the keyhole,
Scott.

871
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:45,419
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

Useless.

876
00:49:57,196 --> 00:49:58,498
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

877
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:00,900
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

878
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,070
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

879
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:07,474
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

880
00:50:07,507 --> 00:50:09,275
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

881
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:10,510
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

882
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:12,512
Show me.

883
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,305
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

884

at a difficult time.

00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:27,026
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

891
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,162
We lost her in a plane crash.

892
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,964
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

893
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:32,398
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

894
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:34,234
We're working, here.

895
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:39,123
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

896
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,109
Were you going for the hand?

897
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,817
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

898
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,386
Do not screw
with the regulator.

899
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:55,221
If that
regulator is compromised,

900
00:50:55,254 --> 00:50:57,023
you would go subatomic.

901
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:59,492
What does that mean?

902
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,561
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

903
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:03,263
What does that mean?

904
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:05,398
It means that you
would enter a reality

905
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:07,834
where all concepts
of time and space

906
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:08,968
become irrelevant

907
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,438
as you shrink
for all eternity.

gone forever.

00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:23,116
Cool.
Yeah, if it ain't broke...

912
00:51:23,149 --> 00:51:24,584
You've learned about the suit,

913
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:27,287
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

914
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,621
the ants.

915
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,591
Loyal, brave,

916
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:33,393
and your partners on this job.

917
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,602
HOPE: Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

918
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,971
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

919
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,207
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

920

Bullet ants, right?

Number 1 on

(YELLS)

938
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,290
HOPE: The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,

939
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,958
and the only
access point is a tube

940
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,527
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

941
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,463
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

942
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,932
HOPE: The tube is protected
by a laser grid,

943
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,667
and we can only
power that down for 15 seconds.

944
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,236
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

945
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:52,372
retrieve the suit,
and exit the vaults

before
the backup power comes on.

947

HOPE:
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

Alternatively known
as a carpenter ant.

Ideal for ground
and air transport.

Wait a minute,
I know this guy.

951
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,120
I'm gonna call
him "Ant-thony."

That's good. That's very good.

Because this time,
you're really gonna

have to learn
how to control him.

00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:49,662
the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.

967
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,132
They are handy to
get you in and out of difficult places.

968
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:03,443
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

969
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:08,381
(HUFFS) They're
not listening to me.

970
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:11,150
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

971
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:13,219
No shortcuts, no lies.

972

(SIGHS) Throwing
insults into the mix

973
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:17,757
will not do
anyone any good, Hope.

974
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,525
We don't have time for coddling.

975
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:21,594
Our focus should
be on helping Scott!

976
00:54:21,627 --> 00:54:22,996
Really?

977
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:25,683
Is that where our
focus should be?

978
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:43,216
(METAL TINKLING)

979
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:51,224
Hope!

980
00:55:00,232 --> 00:55:02,569
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

981
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:11,544
(DOOR CLOSES)

982
00:55:11,577 --> 00:55:13,680
We can't do this without her.

983
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,385
Oh, God.

984
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:21,421
You gotta lock your doors.

985
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:24,390
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

986
00:55:24,423 --> 00:55:27,093
Do you think this is a joke?

987
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:29,495
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

988
00:55:29,528 --> 00:55:30,797
You have a daughter.

989
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,765
I'm doing this for her.

990
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,238
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

991
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,303
He was in grief.

992
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:38,838
Yeah,
so was I, and I was seven.

993
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:42,175
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

994
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,728
He just sent me off
to boarding school.

995
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:46,377
You know, I thought,

996
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:48,681
with all that's at stake,

997
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:51,684
just maybe we might have
a chance of making peace.

998
00:55:51,717 --> 00:55:53,686
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

999
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:56,622
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

1000
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,291
Then why are you here?

1001
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,126
It proves that he loves you.

1002
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,596
Hope. Look at me.

1003
00:56:05,297 --> 00:56:06,733
I'm expendable.

1004
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,601
That's why I'm here.

1005
00:56:10,169 --> 00:56:12,839
You must have
realized that by now.

1006
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,752
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

1007
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,112
He would rather
lose this fight than lose you.

1008
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,213
Anyway...

1009
00:56:23,616 --> 00:56:26,619
You know, I didn't know
you had a daughter

1010
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:28,655
when I called the cops on you.

1011
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:33,892
What's her name?

1012
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:36,429
Cassie.

1013
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:38,731
It's a pretty name.

1014
00:56:42,535 --> 00:56:43,803
You have to clear
your mind, Scott.

1015
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,404
You have to make
your thoughts precise.

1016
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:47,207
That's how it works.

1017
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,209
Think about Cassie.

1018
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:53,746
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

1019
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:04,524
Open your eyes

1020
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:06,726
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

1021
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:30,783
That's good!

1022
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,637
Your mother convinced me

1023
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:55,408
to let her join
me on my missions.

1024
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,476
They called her the Wasp.

1025
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:59,712
She was born to it.

1026
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,316
And there's not
a day that goes by

1027
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,220
that I don't
regret having said yes.

1028
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:14,327
It was 1987.

1029
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,631
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

1030
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:22,936
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

1031
00:58:30,776 --> 00:58:33,779
The only way to
the internal mechanics

1032
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:35,748
was through solid titanium.

1033
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:49,996
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

1034
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:52,899
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

1035
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,469
Your mother,

1036
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:57,670
she didn't hesitate.

1037
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:01,441
Janet! No!

1038
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,683
She turned off her regulator

1039
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,952
and went subatomic

1040
00:59:14,653 --> 00:59:16,723
to deactivate the bomb.

1041
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,360
And she was gone.

1042
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,899
Your mom died a hero.

1043
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,004
And I spent the next 10 years

1044
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:36,342
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

1045
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:41,848
You were trying
to bring her back.

1046
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:47,287
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

1047
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,893
It's not your fault.

1048
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:57,930
She made her choice.

1049
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:07,373
(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

1050
01:00:07,406 --> 01:00:09,976
I was trying to protect you.

1051
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,613
I lost your mother.

1052
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:18,518
I didn't mean
to lose you, too.

1053
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:20,720
I'm sorry.

1054
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:25,358
This is awesome.

1055
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,561
It's awesome, you know?

1056
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:30,514
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

1057
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:32,799
It's important.

1058
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:37,436
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1059
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:38,971
Yes, you did. Yes.

1060
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:41,874
I'm going to make some tea.

1061
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:48,781
Nailed it!

1062
01:00:58,056 --> 01:00:59,892
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1063
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,892
HANK: The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

1064
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,460
SCOTT: It's freezing!

1065
01:01:34,493 --> 01:01:37,496
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

1066
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,533
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

1067
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,135
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1068
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:44,904
HOPE: We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

1069
01:01:44,937 --> 01:01:46,606
that Cross installed
in the Futures vault.

1070
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:50,142
It's currently collecting dust

1071
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:52,878
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

1072
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,914
Should be a piece of cake.

1073
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:56,882
You're over the target area.

1074
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:59,452
Disengage now, Scott!

1075
01:01:59,485 --> 01:02:00,486
Squadron A, go!

1076
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:01,821
B, go!

1077
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:06,459
C, go!

1078
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:09,829
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

1079
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:13,065
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

1080
01:02:13,098 --> 01:02:14,098
Stay calm.

1081
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:18,103
SCOTT: Guys?
We might have a problem.

1082
01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:21,607
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

1083
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,640
It's not!

1084
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,778
You son of a bitch!

1085
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:30,015
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

1086
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:31,750
Abort now!

1087
01:02:31,783 --> 01:02:33,986
No, it's okay. It doesn't look
like anyone's home.

1088
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:36,055
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1089
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:38,090
He's gonna lose the suit.

1090
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,625
He's gonna lose his life.

1091
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:45,664
(GRUNTS)

1092
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:47,657
All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.

1093
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,102
Somebody's home, Scott.

1094
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,807
MAN: What's going on
down there, Sam?

1095
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,809
SCOTT: It's the Falcon!

1096
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:58,744
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

1097
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:00,579
Wait a second.

1098
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,648
HANK: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1099
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:04,049
It's okay. He can't see me.

1100
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:05,184
I can see you.

1101
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:06,217
He can see me.

1102
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,890
Hi. I'm Scott.

1103
01:03:10,923 --> 01:03:12,591
Did he just say,
"Hi, I'm Scott"?

1104
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:14,126
What are you doing here?

1105
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,995
First off, I'm a big fan.

1106
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:17,588
Appreciate it.
So, who the hell are you?

1107
01:03:18,263 --> 01:03:19,298
I'm Ant-Man.

1108
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:20,833
"Ant-Man"?

1109
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,002
What? You haven't heard of me?

1110
01:03:23,035 --> 01:03:25,170
No, you wouldn't
have heard of me.

1111
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:26,906
You wanna tell
me what you want?

1112
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:29,208
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1113
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:31,210
Just for a few days.
I'm gonna return it.

1114
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:33,913
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1115
01:03:33,946 --> 01:03:35,181
I know exactly how that is.

1116
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:37,249
Located the breach.

1117
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:38,762
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

1118
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,690
What the hell are you doing?

1119
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:49,161
FALCON:
Breach is an adult male,

1120
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:50,594
who has some sort
of shrinking tech.

1121
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:04,977
SCOTT: Sorry!

1122
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,330
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Sorry.

1123
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,080
That's enough!

(GROANING)

1125
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:32,805
Ant-thony! A little help!

1126
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:46,651
I've lost visual.

1127
01:04:52,424 --> 01:04:53,759
(GRUNTING)

1128
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:57,129
He's inside my pack!

1129
01:04:57,162 --> 01:04:58,197
Sorry!

1130
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:01,278
You seem like
a really great guy.

1131
01:05:10,442 --> 01:05:12,178
(GRUNTING)

1132
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:29,962
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

1133
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:36,736
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1134
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,672
You jeopardized everything!

1135
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:57,223
You got it.

1136
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:01,260
Well done.

1137
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:02,327
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

1138
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,829
Did you just compliment me?

1139
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:05,097
He did, didn't he?

1140
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,965
Kind of sounded like he did.

1141
01:06:06,998 --> 01:06:08,333
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

1142
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:09,768
I was good, wasn't I?

01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,770
(SCOFFS)

1144
01:06:11,803 --> 01:06:15,074
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1145
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:17,443
Let us not dwell on the past.

1146
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,378
We gotta finish our planning.

1147
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,416
HOPE: Don't mind him.

1148
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,184
You did good.

1149
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,292
Darren.

1150
01:06:36,294 --> 01:06:37,963
How the hell did
you get in here?

1151
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:41,800
You left
the front door open, Hank.

1152
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,868
It's official.

1153
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,003
You're old.

1154
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:45,803
The plans.

1155
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:48,774
He will kill him.

1156
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,480
Well, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

1157
01:06:55,914 --> 01:06:57,249
I have good news.

1158
01:06:57,282 --> 01:06:58,350
Really?

1159
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,120
What's that?

1160
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:05,824
Pym Tech,
the company you created,

1161
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:07,826
is about to
become one of the most

1162
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:09,928
profitable
operations in the world.

1163
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:13,299
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1164
01:07:19,938 --> 01:07:21,073
You're welcome.

1165
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:28,547
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1166
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,349
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1167
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:33,418
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1168
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,754
I'll be there.

1169
01:07:52,003 --> 01:07:53,239
What did you see in me?

1170
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:56,942
I don't know what you mean.

1171
01:07:56,975 --> 01:07:59,378
All those years ago,
you picked me.

1172
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,946
What did you see?

1173
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:05,450
I saw myself.

1174
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:07,887
Then why did you push me away?

1175
01:08:09,421 --> 01:08:12,792
Because I saw
too much of myself.

1176
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:25,103
HOPE: He knows.
He's baiting you.

1177
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:27,072
We have to call it off.

1178
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:28,140
We're all taking risks.

1179
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,508
What if he saw me here?

1180
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,143
He didn't. There's no way.

1181
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:32,177
How do you know that?

1182
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,345
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1183
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:42,154
Darren, hi.

1184
01:08:42,187 --> 01:08:45,024
Hope, where are you right now?

1185
01:08:45,657 --> 01:08:46,892
I'm at home. Why?

1186
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,927
I just saw Hank.

1187
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,029
I still get nothing
but contempt from him.

1188
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:54,433
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1189
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:57,002
We need to start
everyone working around the clock.

1190
01:08:57,035 --> 01:08:58,904
Get the assembly
line up and running.

1191
01:08:58,937 --> 01:09:00,239
And I'm tripling security.

1192
01:09:00,272 --> 01:09:02,341
Full sensors at all entrances

1193
01:09:02,374 --> 01:09:05,644
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1194
01:09:05,677 --> 01:09:08,280
Great. Good idea.

1195
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:11,483
Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1196
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,657
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1197
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,893
But he is not onto you.

1198
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:23,128
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1199
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:25,163
and closing exterior vents.

1200
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:26,932
How are we gonna
get Scott inside?

1201
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:29,969
The water main.

1202
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:33,238
You can't add
security to a water main.

1203
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:35,440
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1204
01:09:35,473 --> 01:09:37,242
that's how I get in.

1205
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:39,211
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1206
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:40,445
to change the water pressure.

1207
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:42,080
Hank and I will
be beside Cross.

1208
01:09:42,113 --> 01:09:43,248
How are we
supposed to do that?

1209
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:44,583
So we expand our team.

1210
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:46,652
What do we need?

1211
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:48,420
A fake security
guard on the inside

1212
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:50,122
to de-pressurize
the water system,

1213
01:09:50,155 --> 01:09:52,024
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1214
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,358
and kill the laser grid,

1215
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,128
and a getaway guy.

1216
01:09:56,161 --> 01:10:00,499
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats.
No way.

1217
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:02,534
LUIS: Thank you for
the coffee, ma'am.

1218
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:05,537
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1219
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:07,439
(CHUCKLES)
Because we just robbed you.

1220
01:10:09,507 --> 01:10:12,611
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1221
01:10:12,644 --> 01:10:14,179
Two smoothie machines.

1222
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:15,647
Are you sure they
can handle this?

1223
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,449
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1224
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:21,219
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1225
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:23,588
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1226
01:10:23,621 --> 01:10:25,290
We know our business.

1227
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:27,426
We broke into this
spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1228
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:29,127
I let you.

1229
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,497
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

1230
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,232
Look, it's okay.
They can handle this.

1231
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:36,068
Yeah, we can handle it.

1232

- SCOTT: You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1233
01:10:37,535 --> 01:10:39,037
I'm in the system?

1234
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,105
You're in the system.

1235
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:41,340
The system?

1236
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:43,742
Yeah, we're doomed.

1237
01:10:43,775 --> 01:10:45,210
SCOTT: All right.

1238
01:10:45,243 --> 01:10:46,611
There's something
you guys need to see.

When you get to this corner,

1240

there's gonna be three offices

01:10:54,386 --> 01:10:57,356
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1243
01:10:57,389 --> 01:11:00,125
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1244
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:01,626
It's pretty freaky,
but it's safe.

1245
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:03,462
There's no
reason to be scared.

1246
01:11:03,495 --> 01:11:04,663
Oh, no, no.
Daddy don't get scared.

1247
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:06,598
- Really?
- Yeah.

1248
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:07,631
Good.

This is the work of gypsies.

DAVE: (STAMMERING)
That's witchcraft.

1252
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:20,078
Wow, that's amazing.

1253
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:21,613
That's like some
David Copperfield shit.

1254
01:11:21,646 --> 01:11:22,581
DAVE:
That's some kind of wizardry.

1255
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:23,782
KURT: This is sorcery!

1256
01:11:23,815 --> 01:11:25,350
How'd you do that, bro?

1257
01:11:25,383 --> 01:11:27,183
SCOTT: Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1258
01:11:27,485 --> 01:11:29,021
Ahhh!

1259
01:11:29,054 --> 01:11:30,522
Get off! Get off!

1260
01:11:30,555 --> 01:11:33,158
SCOTT: Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

(SNORING)

1262
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,029
I gave them each half a Xanax

1263
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:39,297
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1264
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:42,300
They fell right asleep.

1265

Hey, look,
I wanna thank you for...

1266
01:11:44,836 --> 01:11:46,805
No, please don't.

1267
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:48,306
We're all doing
this for reasons

much bigger
than any one of us.

I'm just glad
that you might have

1270
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:53,445
a slight chance of
maybe pulling this off.

1271

Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1272
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:59,184
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1273
01:11:59,217 --> 01:12:01,053
to almost liking you.

1274

should write poetry.

01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:01,246
everyone here knows
their role, right?

1280

- Wheels on the ground.

"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1761
01:46:40,796 --> 01:46:42,198
"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,

1762
01:46:42,231 --> 01:46:43,433
"you know what I'm saying?"

1763
01:46:43,466 --> 01:46:45,335
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1764
01:46:45,368 --> 01:46:47,170
And she's like,
"Yeah, you know what,

1765
01:46:47,203 --> 01:46:48,872
I can't tell you
who my contact is,

1766
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:49,539
"because he works
with the Avengers."

1767
01:46:49,572 --> 01:46:51,141
Oh, no.

1768
01:46:51,174 --> 01:46:52,375
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1769
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:54,344
Like,
he comes up to her and says,

1770
01:46:54,377 --> 01:46:55,745
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1771
01:46:55,778 --> 01:46:57,847
"who's flashing
his fresh tack,

1772
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,582
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1773
01:46:59,615 --> 01:47:01,217
And she's like,
"Well, we got everything

1774
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,820
nowadays.
We got a guy who jumps.

1775
01:47:03,853 --> 01:47:05,288
"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1776
01:47:05,321 --> 01:47:07,690
"You gotta be more specific."

1777
01:47:07,723 --> 01:47:09,192
And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1778
01:47:09,225 --> 01:47:10,493
And I'm, like, "Damn!"
I got all nervous

1779
01:47:10,526 --> 01:47:12,162
'cause I'd keep mad
secrets for you, bro.

1780
01:47:12,195 --> 01:47:14,230
So I asked Ignacio,

1781
01:47:14,263 --> 01:47:15,832
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1782
01:47:15,865 --> 01:47:17,534
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1783
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:18,768
"that he's looking for him?"

1784
01:47:19,435 --> 01:47:21,805
And? What'd he say?

1785
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,710
He said, "Yes."

1786
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,893
There's something
I want to show you.

1787
01:49:26,495 --> 01:49:29,532
I realized you
can't destroy power.

1788
01:49:31,467 --> 01:49:34,971
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1789
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:44,080
This is an advanced prototype

1790
01:49:44,113 --> 01:49:46,783
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1791
01:49:48,551 --> 01:49:51,888
She never got to use it.

1792
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:55,892
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1793
01:50:02,932 --> 01:50:05,068
Maybe it's time
we finished it.

1794
01:50:11,907 --> 01:50:14,344
It's about damn time.

1795
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:16,039
FALCON: Hey, Cap!

1796
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:33,022
This would have
been a lot easier a week ago.

1797
01:56:33,055 --> 01:56:34,824
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1798
01:56:34,857 --> 01:56:36,192
Even if he did...

1799
01:56:36,225 --> 01:56:37,905
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1800
01:56:39,161 --> 01:56:40,730
We're on our own.

1801
01:56:42,097 --> 01:56:43,232
Maybe not.

1802
01:56:45,934 --> 01:56:47,070
I know a guy.
